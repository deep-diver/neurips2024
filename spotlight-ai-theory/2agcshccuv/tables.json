It highlights the key differences in the protocols followed by each learning paradigm. Classic online learning involves the learner predicting yt, Nature selecting a consistent hypothesis ht, and Nature revealing the true label ht(xt). The goal in classic online learning is to achieve a uniform error bound. In contrast, non-uniform online learning (inductive inference) differs in that Nature selects a ground-truth hypothesis h* before the learning process starts.  Nature then presents an observation xt, the learner predicts yt, and Nature reveals the true label h*(xt). The goal here is to achieve an error bound that may depend on the chosen h*. This crucial difference underscores the distinction between the two learning frameworks and how their protocols cater to the specific goals of uniform versus non-uniform error bounds.", "section": "1.1 Our Approach"}, {"figure_path": "2aGcshccuV/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of learnabilities in the non-uniform realizable setting.

It compares the learnability of a hypothesis class H under different conditions: when the ground truth hypothesis *h* is fixed or varies across runs, whether the distribution \u03bc is known or unknown to the learner, and based on various learning criteria such as uniform, non-uniform, and consistency. The table highlights the sufficient and necessary conditions established in the paper, indicating which cases are learnable and which require specific conditions.
