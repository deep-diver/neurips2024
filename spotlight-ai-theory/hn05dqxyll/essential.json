Current techniques struggle with dimensionality, often requiring unrealistic sample sizes for accurate estimates, especially when dealing with data above tens of dimensions.  This issue is widespread across various scientific fields, hindering our ability to understand complex dependencies.\n\nThis paper introduces Latent MI (LMI) approximation. LMI cleverly leverages low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional variables to accurately estimate MI, even in scenarios with over 1000 dimensions.  The proposed method successfully tackled two biological problems: quantifying protein interaction information using protein language models and studying cell fate information from scRNA-seq data.  **LMI's superior performance over existing MI estimators demonstrates its potential to significantly impact fields like genomics, neuroscience, and ecology.**", "affiliation": "Harvard University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HN05DQxyLl/podcast.wav"}
