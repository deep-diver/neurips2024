The figure highlights the interconnect's topology using a reduced node incidence matrix. The matrix shows the connections between nodes and components, with +1 indicating a connection to the positive terminal, -1 to the negative terminal, and 0 indicating no connection.  Two of the resistors (R2 and R3) are 0-ohm resistors. The dynamic interconnect is designed to be admissible with the static interconnect shown in Figure 1, meaning it relaxes to the static interconnect's configuration in equilibrium.", "section": "2 Continuous-time optimization with circuits"}, {"figure_path": "9Jmt1eER9P/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 10: Relative error across iterations when applying the new algorithm.", "description": "This figure shows the relative error |f(xk) - f*|/f* plotted against the iteration number k, demonstrating the convergence of the new algorithm proposed in the paper.
