The methods compared are Extragradient (EG), first-order Perseus (Perseus1), second-order Perseus with Jacobian (Perseus2), VIQA with Damped Broyden approximation, and VIQA with Broyden approximation.  The left plot shows the gap (a measure of optimality) versus the iteration number, while the right plot shows the gap versus the number of Jacobian-vector product (JVP) or function evaluations. The results demonstrate that the second-order methods (Perseus2 and VIQA variants) converge significantly faster than the first-order methods (EG and Perseus1), and that VIQA with Damped Broyden approximation exhibits the fastest convergence.", "section": "8 Experiments"}]
