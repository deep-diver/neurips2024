It details how, at each time step t, an algorithm (ALG) uses the history (Ht) of past allocations to produce a fractional allocation (Xt).  An item type (kt) is sampled from a distribution (D), and then the item is allocated to a player (it) according to the probabilities in Xt. The algorithm maintains the allocation (Ai) for each player and the history (Ht). Finally, the complete allocation A is returned after all T items have been allocated.", "section": "A Algorithmic Representation of Model"}]
