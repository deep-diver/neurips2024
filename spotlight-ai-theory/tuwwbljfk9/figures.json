The causal graph (a) shows the relationships between different events in an online shopping scenario: browsing (X1), adding to cart (X2), promotion (X3), and purchasing (X4).  The branching structure (b) highlights the inherent branching nature of these events. For example, a browsing event (X1) might lead directly to a purchase or indirectly through an 'add to cart' event (X2). The figure demonstrates that a single browsing event can trigger multiple subsequent events, which are then summarized as counts. This branching nature is important to consider when modeling and analyzing count data.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "TUwWBLjFk9/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration of the graphical implication in the closed-form solution for the PGF of PB-SCM.

Each term in the closed-form solution uniquely encodes a specific local structure within the PB-SCM. The figure shows four different starting points (X1, X2, X3) in the triangular graph to illustrate how each path is encoded within each component.  For example, \u03b1\u2081,\u2082(1-\u03b1\u2081,\u2083)(1-\u03b1\u2082,\u2083)z\u2081z\u2082 represents a path from X\u2081 to X\u2082 and X\u2083, without involving X\u2083 directly.
