Regular edges show relationships among c+ candidates and among c\u2212 candidates. Thick edges indicate that c* pairwise beats all candidates, and each c+ pairwise beats each c\u2212 candidate.", "description": "This figure shows the pairwise majority relationships between 9 candidates (c*, four c+, and four c\u2212).  Solid lines show the majority preference between pairs of candidates.  In particular, c* beats all other candidates in pairwise comparisons, and each c+ candidate beats each c\u2212 candidate. The structure within the c+ and c\u2212 candidates is cyclical. This graph is used to illustrate a scenario demonstrating that even with a clear majority preference structure, it is not always possible to find a linear reward function that reflects this structure while also satisfying the Pareto Optimality criterion.", "section": "A.6 Proof of Theorem 3.7"}]
