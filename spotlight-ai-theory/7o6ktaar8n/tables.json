The sample complexity represents the number of samples needed to learn the function with a certain level of accuracy.  The table shows the complexity for both known and unknown weights, and for cardinal (actual values) and ordinal (pairwise comparisons) social welfare information. Different loss functions (l2, 0-1, and logistic) are considered to reflect different ways of measuring error.  The parameters \u03be, K, d, \u03c1, and Tmax are defined in the caption and are used to express the complexity bounds. The table helps to understand the trade-offs between different learning settings in terms of data requirements.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "7O6KtaAr8n/tables/tables_28_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: A summary of our results regarding the sample complexity of various tasks.
