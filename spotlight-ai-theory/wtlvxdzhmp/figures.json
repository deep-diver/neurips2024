The figure shows that the information-theoretic threshold is constant with n; the classical computational threshold is \u0398(n(q-2)/4); the multi-step tensor power iteration and multi-step QAOA thresholds are \u0398(n(q-2)/2); and the 1-step tensor power iteration and 1-step QAOA thresholds are \u0398(n(q-1)/2).", "section": "2 Background and related work"}, {"figure_path": "WTLvXdzhmP/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) Example overlap distribution from 1-step QAOA for the spiked matrix model (q = 2), where simulation data is collected from 40 random generated instances with n = 26 bits.
