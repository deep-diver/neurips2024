Label-Specific Representation Learning (LSRL) tackles this by creating individual representations for each label, improving performance. However, understanding how well LSRL generalizes to unseen data has been a significant challenge; existing theoretical bounds don't adequately explain LSRL's success. \nThis paper addresses this by developing a novel theoretical framework and proving novel generalization bounds for LSRL. The bounds show a substantially weaker dependency on the number of labels. The paper also analyzes typical LSRL methods to uncover the effect of different label representation strategies on generalization, paving the way for more effective and efficient LSRL algorithm design.  **The findings are not only important for LSRL but also contribute more broadly to the theory of multi-label learning and vector-valued functions.**", "affiliation": "School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dtPIUXdJHY/podcast.wav"}
