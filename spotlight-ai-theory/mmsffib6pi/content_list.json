To assess the plausibility of climate models, climate scientists compare output from model simulations against observational data [Rood, 2019].

Overall, both maps seem smooth or continuous in space, with little variation between neighboring locations in most cases.

This trend is much more pronounced for BCC-ESM1 than for NorESM2-MM. Additionally, BCC-ESM1 has a region of particularly high WD values around eastern Indonesia, where wind-terrain interaction plays an important role in the regional distribution of precipitation.

The improvement of CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5 in precipitation representation has been reported in previous studies using different evaluation methods (e.g., Chen et al. [2021]).

For most baseline methods (RMSE, MAE, WD, and Sliced WD), their rankings are moderately similar to those of SCWD, indicating general agreements, though each metric still shows unique perspectives. However, there is a large discrepancy between the rankings of GMWD and all other rankings. For surface temperature, SCWD, RMSE, and WD all show that the distance from NCEP to ERA5 is lower than that of all CMIP6 models, and MAE and Sliced WD also rank NCEP favorably among the models. However, GMWD ranks NCEP only among the median CMIP6 models.

In particular, we show that the RMSE and MAE criteria are unable to detect isolated changes in the variance of the anomalies. The data example focuses on the SAM0-UNICON surface temperature model. Despite the overall similarity in rankings for CMIP6 surface temperature, this model ranks significantly higher by RMSE/MAE than by SCWD. Further investigation shows that SAM0-UNICON exhibits significant differences in both the climatological mean and the variance of the anomalies. Because RMSE/MAE are unable to detect shifts in the variance of the anomalies they artificially inflate the ranking of this model compared to SCWD.

To this end, we developed a new similarity measure, called spherical convolutional Wasserstein distance (SCWD), which quantifies model performance in a way that properly accounts for spatial variability. SCWD builds on previous sliced WD methods to compare distributions of infinitedimensional functional data, specifically surfaces on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$ . Overall, our results indicate that incorporating local perspectives, rather than just the global mean, is essential when evaluating the similarities between climate models and observational data. In both theory and practice, a model that represents the global mean well may have large compensating errors at the regional scale. SCWD better represents the regional performance of climate models than the previously proposed WD-based evaluation criteria in [Vissio et al., 2020]. Furthermore, SCWD is not limited to only comparing the long-term mean climate state as with RMSE and MAE, and our convolution slicing provides better spatial insights (in the form of maps) than WD and Sliced WD. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "For surface temperature, we found evidence to suggest that SCWD is more accurate than the previous WD-based approach for evaluating climate models, such as the two reanalysis datasets being more similar compared to climate models and reanalysis. However, for precipitation, similar findings were made for only one of the reanalysis datasets. Given the limitations with reanalysis for precipitation discussed in Section 4.1, additional experiments from different perspectives may be needed to fully assess the accuracy of our method. Because we have only shown that SCWD is a pseudometric, rather than a metric, SCWD may not be able to fully distinguish between climate fields which have differences only in the joint spatial distribution, rather than at the local level. We acknowledge that determining the sample complexity of SCWD is an area that requires further investigation. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "We hope our method will be tested under many different scenarios and variables in climate science. For example, calculating SCWD on monthly mean or even annual data could help to detect biases in terms of longer range temporal variability. Another idea is to remove long-term climatological means from the data before computing SCWD. This would provide additional insight into which features are being captured beyond the mean climate state. SCWD can also be applied to machine-assisted climate model tuning [Hourdin et al., 2017], a growing area of research that relies on quality model evaluation metrics. Some ideas for future work to further improve SCWD include learning an optimal range value for the Wendland kernel function or using a neural network to estimate the kernel function, similar to Kolouri et al. [2019]. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Outside of climate science, SCWD can be used as a loss function for training generative models for $360^{o}$ images. This only requires a straightforward extension of SCWD to allow for multiple convolution layers, similar to the rectangular case in Nguyen and Ho [2022]. Likewise, the more general functional sliced WD can be used as a loss function for generative models on any functional manifold. For example, we can apply the functional sliced WD to texture mapping or color transfer on the surface of 3D models, which are typically considered as non-euclidean manifolds. SCWD can be also adapted to compare distributions of spatiotemporal fields, rather than spatial fields as in this article, by including both time and space in the functional data domain. This would require specifying a space-time kernel function [Porcu et al., 2016]. The more functional sliced WD framework has a variety of potential use cases for comparing distributions of functions on a broad class of manifolds. Potential application areas where the data lie on non-trivial manifolds include facial recognition [Li et al., 2014], astronomy [Szapudi, 2008], and ecology [Sutherland et al., 2015].

For these methods to work, we first have to regrid each model to a common set of grid points.

So, we again regrid the climate models and reference datasets to a common resolution but now using an Icosahedral grid of 642 locations, which provides near-uniform spacing on the sphere to alleviate concerns about area weighting. The reduced dimensionality is not ideal for evaluating climate models, but serves to make the computation of the multivariate WD and sliced WD more feasible given the costs already incurred from regridding.
