Multiple distance metrics are used for comparison, including the novel SCWD (Spherical Convolutional Wasserstein Distance) and several established methods like RMSE, MAE, WD, and sliced WD.  The SCWD results are shown for three different kernel range parameters (500km, 1000km, 2500km) to assess sensitivity.
