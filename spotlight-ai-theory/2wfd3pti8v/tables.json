Using MC-EIF, Algorithm 1 achieves lower relative expected volatility (REV) and RMSE compared to the oracle estimator.", "description": "This table presents the empirical results of applying the Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Function (MC-EIF) method to the Markowitz optimal portfolio optimization problem.  It compares the performance of the MC-EIF one-step estimator (Algorithm 1 from the paper) against a plug-in estimator and an oracle estimator (which uses the true, analytically derived efficient influence function). The results are presented in terms of Relative Expected Volatility (REV) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  Lower REV and RMSE values indicate better performance, suggesting MC-EIF achieves comparable or even better results than the oracle, especially in terms of reducing volatility.", "section": "4 MC-EIF for Automated Efficient Inference"}, {"figure_path": "2wfd3pti8v/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: We taxonomize the workflow of robust estimation into three stages: the derivation of an (approximate and/or efficient) influence function, the numerical derivation and analysis required for its computation, and the code required to compute it. For the analytic workflow, the derivation of the IF results in Equation 24. This largely involves terms already required by the original plug-in (Equation 23), but still must be implemented on a case-by-case basis in code. For the \u201cEmpirical Gateaux\u201d workflow, the first stage requires only the general purpose Equation 25, but demands case-specific numerical considerations and derivations like the one shown in Equation 26. In stark contrast, given a differentiable approximation to the functional of interest, MC-EIF \u201cautomates\u201d each stage through use of an end-to-end, general purpose solution.", "description": "This table summarizes three different approaches to influence function estimation. The first, analytic approach, involves manual derivation of the influence function and then implementation in code which requires significant expertise.  The second, empirical Gateaux approach uses a general-purpose finite-difference approximation to the influence function which simplifies derivation, but it requires careful numerical analysis and implementation which may be challenging in high dimensions.  The third approach, proposed by the authors, uses the Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Function (MC-EIF) which automates all three stages of the process, resulting in a more efficient and easier-to-use method.", "section": "C So, What's Automatic?"}]
