Current defenses often rely on generating adversarial examples using various attack methods but struggle to comprehensively address diverse attack styles.  This leads to limited robustness. \n\nTo overcome these limitations, this paper introduces MoE-BiEntIRL, a novel method that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach within maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning. **MoE-BiEntIRL reconstructs the attack policies from collected adversarial samples, enabling the generation of new adversarial examples that better reflect the diverse real-world attacks.**  The method also introduces precise sample guidance and a bidirectional update mechanism to address challenges in large action spaces, significantly improving policy learning and reducing deviation. Finally, this approach provides feature-level explanations, enhancing the interpretability of the model and leading to more effective defense strategies. **The method shows significant improvement in GNN robustness through adversarial training and data augmentation on real-world rumor detection tasks.**", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "ziehA15y8k/podcast.wav"}
