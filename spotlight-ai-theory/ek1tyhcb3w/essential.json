{"importance": "This paper is crucial because **it bridges the gap in understanding sample complexity for posted pricing**, a widely used mechanism in online markets.  Its findings directly impact the design of efficient pricing strategies, particularly in the context of online auctions and dynamic pricing. The **tight bounds derived** provide practical guidelines for businesses and researchers, while the **exploration of correlated distributions** expands the theoretical understanding beyond traditional assumptions.", "summary": "This paper reveals how many buyer samples are needed to set near-optimal posted prices for a single item, resolving a fundamental problem in online markets and offering both theoretical and practical implications.", "takeaways": ["The sample complexity for welfare maximization in posted pricing with independent buyer valuations is surprisingly independent of the number of buyers.", "Revenue maximization requires significantly more samples than welfare maximization, highlighting a crucial difference in sample complexity for different objectives in posted pricing.", "For correlated buyer valuations, the sample complexity of both welfare and revenue maximization depends on the number of price changes allowed in the pricing mechanism."], "tldr": "Selling a single item to multiple buyers with unknown private valuations is a common economic problem.  Posted pricing, where the seller sets a fixed price for each buyer, is a simple and practical approach, but finding optimal prices requires knowledge of buyer valuations.  Previous work primarily focused on independent buyer valuations; this paper tackles the more realistic but complex scenario where buyer valuations can be correlated. It also examines both welfare maximization (best overall outcome) and revenue maximization (highest revenue for the seller). \nThis paper addresses the sample complexity problem, essentially answering the question of \"how many buyer valuations do we need to sample to get near optimal prices?\" It provides matching upper and lower bounds on the number of samples needed for various settings (independent/correlated distributions, welfare/revenue maximization). The results show a significant difference between welfare and revenue maximization, and that correlation among buyer valuations changes the relationship between sample size and optimal pricing.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "EK1tyHcb3W/podcast.wav"}
