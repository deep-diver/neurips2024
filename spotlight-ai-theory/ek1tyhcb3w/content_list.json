Since the optimal mechanisms are often impractical and do not work for sequential buyers, posted pricing mechanisms, where fixed prices are set for the item for different buyers, have emerged as a practical and effective alternative. This paper investigates how many samples are needed from buyers' value distributions to find near-optimal posted prices, considering both independent and correlated buyer distributions, and welfare versus revenue maximization.

This problem is challenging because the value associated to the item is private knowledge of each buyer and thus can be strategically misreported. The mechanism designer usually has one of two objectives: (a) welfare maximization where we want to maximize the value of the winning buyer, and (b) revenue maximization where we want to maximize the price paid by the winning buyer. The welfare maximization problem was resolved by Vickrey in 1961 [Vic61] and the revenue maximization problem was resolved (for independent distributions) by Myerson in 1981 [Mye81], both of whom were awarded the Nobel prize in Economics for their contributions. In either case the optimal mechanism is a truthful auction, in which buyers report their values and have no incentive to misreport. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Although we know optimal mechanisms for selling a single item, these auctions are often difficult/impossible to implement in practice. For instance, the buyer does not know exactly how much they will pay if they win the item and these auctions do not work for online settings where the buyers arrive one-by-one $[\\mathrm{AM}^{+}06\\$ , HR09]. Thus, the last two decades has seen a lot of progress on understanding the power of simple but near-optimal mechanisms. In this regard, posted pricing mechanisms have been identified to be very successful (see books and surveys [Rou16, Har13, $\\mathrm{CFH^{+}19}$ ,Luc17]). Here, the mechanism designer puts a (carefully chosen) price $\\pi_{i}$ On the item and then the $i$ -th buyer takes the item if the item is not already sold and if they value it above $\\pi_{i}$ . Posted pricing mechanisms have several advantages: they are truthful since $\\pi_{i}$ does not depend on the $i$ -th buyer's value; the buyer knows exactly how much they pay on winning an item; and they work even for online settings so the buyers do not have to be simultaneously present. Additionally, in the setting of Myerson's 1981 paper of independent buyer valuations, they are known to give a 2-approximation to both the optimal welfare (which is usually called Prophet Inequality) and the optimal revenue [KS77, KS78, CHK07, CFPV19], as long as the posted prices are set correctly.

This is because the difference between successive thresholds is bounded by 1, so naively the total variance of $n$ thresholds could be $\\Omega(n)$ . Our main idea is to instead study a martingale that adds up the errors made in the dynamic programming solution. This way, too high values for one buyer and too low values for another buyer balance each other. On this martingale, we use Freedman's inequality (which is a martingale variant of Bernstein's inequality), which allows us to bound the total variance in terms of conditional variances. A careful application of another concentration bound allows us to bound these conditional variances in terms of the change in the optimal value, whose sum is always at most 1.
