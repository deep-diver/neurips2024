It begins with a read dataset (i), showing multiple DNA sequences.  These reads are then split into positive and negative pairs (ii).  Positive pairs consist of two segments from the same read, while negative pairs combine segments from different reads. The k-mer profiles (iii) are calculated for each segment, which are then used as input for a neural network (iv). The neural network learns representations for the k-mer profiles. Finally, the learned representations are used for metagenomic binning (v), clustering the reads based on their genomic origins.", "section": "3.3 Non-linear read embeddings"}, {"figure_path": "Ehsd856Ltb/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Evaluation of the models on multiple datasets for the metagenomic binning task.
