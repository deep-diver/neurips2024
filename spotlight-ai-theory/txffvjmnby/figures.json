The area under the curve (AUC) is approximately 0.92, indicating good performance in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  The x-axis represents the false positive rate (FPR), the proportion of legitimate transactions incorrectly classified as fraudulent. The y-axis represents the true positive rate (TPR), the proportion of fraudulent transactions correctly identified. A higher AUC indicates better performance.", "section": "4 Experiments: Credit Card Fraud Detection"}, {"figure_path": "TxffvJMnBy/figures/figures_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Typical variation of the CCV with time", "description": "This figure shows how the cumulative constraint violation (CCV) changes over time (number of rounds).

An online policy selects an action (shared weights, xt) that is used to perform multiple related tasks. After the action is chosen, the adversary reveals constraint functions (gt,i(xt)) for each task, representing the loss or error associated with that task. The goal is to minimize the cumulative constraint violation, where a task is considered successful if the corresponding constraint is satisfied (i.e., loss is non-positive).", "section": "A.3 Online Multi-task Learning as an Instance of the OCS Problem"}]
