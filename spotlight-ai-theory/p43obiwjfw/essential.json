Many existing learning-based approaches use deep reinforcement learning and model the solution as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), leading to high computational costs from repeated objective function evaluations.\nThis paper introduces the Value Classification Model (VCM), a novel neural solver that addresses these limitations. VCM uses a classification perspective, directly generating solutions instead of sequential decisions.  It incorporates a Depth Value Network (DVN) to extract features and a Value Classification Network (VCN) to generate solutions.  Training is done using a highly efficient Greedy-guided Self Trainer (GST) that doesn't need optimal labels.  Experimental results demonstrate VCM's superior performance, achieving near-optimal solutions in milliseconds with remarkable generalization ability.", "affiliation": "National University of Defence Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "p43ObIwJFW/podcast.wav"}
