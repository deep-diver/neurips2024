The left panel shows the trajectories of the standard FTRL, the extrapolated FTRL (FTRL+), and the continuous-time version of FTRL in the Matching Pennies game. The center and right panels illustrate the trajectories for a 2x2x2 harmonic game from different perspectives.  The figure demonstrates that the standard FTRL algorithm diverges, while FTRL+ converges to the Nash equilibrium. The continuous-time FTRL is shown to be recurrent (periodic).", "section": "4 Discrete-time analysis: Convergence and constant regret via extrapolation"}, {"figure_path": "HW9S9vY5gZ/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The evolution of vanilla vs. extrapolated FTRL schemes in harmonic games.
