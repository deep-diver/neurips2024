Diffusion models currently outperform these raster-scan AR approaches. This paper tackles these issues. \nThe proposed Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) redefines autoregressive learning as a coarse-to-fine process, predicting 'next-scale' token maps rather than individual tokens. This simple shift allows VAR to learn visual distributions faster and generalize better.  On ImageNet 256x256, VAR significantly improves upon the AR baseline and surpasses Diffusion Transformers, demonstrating remarkable performance gains. Importantly, it exhibits scaling laws similar to LLMs, making it a promising direction for scalable and generalizable image generation.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "gojL67CfS8/podcast.wav"}
