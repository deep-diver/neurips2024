This limits our understanding and hinders progress in improving LLM reasoning capabilities.  Existing studies offer qualitative assessments, but lack the quantitative tools needed for objective comparison and optimization.\nThis paper introduces a Reasoning Boundary Framework (RBF) to address these limitations. RBF defines a reasoning boundary (RB) to quantify CoT's upper bound and establishes a combination law for multiple RBs.  It also proposes three categories of RBs for optimization, guiding improvements through RB promotion and reasoning path optimization. The framework's effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments, providing insights into CoT strategies and offering valuable guidance for future optimization efforts.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "pC44UMwy2v/podcast.wav"}
