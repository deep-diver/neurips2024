Existing distillation methods aim to create efficient one-step generators but often compromise on quality or require expensive data preprocessing. This paper introduces DMD2, a new method that tackles these challenges. \n\nDMD2 improves upon existing approaches by removing the computationally intensive regression loss and incorporates a GAN loss to improve image quality. It also introduces a novel training technique to effectively address the input mismatch issue that exists in multi-step generative models.  **Through these improvements, DMD2 surpasses its teacher model in performance**, establishing new benchmarks in both one-step and multi-step image generation, making it a significant advance in the field.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "tQukGCDaNT/podcast.wav"}
