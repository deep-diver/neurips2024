Learning these components from observational data is challenging, with existing methods often employing complex bilevel optimization and focusing solely on drift estimation. This leads to limitations in representational power, scalability, and accuracy. \n\nThis research introduces JKOnet*, a novel approach leveraging first-order optimality conditions of the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme.  JKOnet* directly minimizes a quadratic loss, enabling efficient and accurate recovery of all three components (potential, interaction, and internal energy). Its closed-form solution for linearly parametrized functionals and superior performance in real-world cellular process predictions showcase its enhanced efficiency and versatility.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "y10avdRFNK/podcast.wav"}
