As such, in this paper, we first theoretically investigate the identification of the bi-directional MR from observational data. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which valid IV sets are correctly identified such that the bi-directional MR model is identifiable, including the causal directions of a pair of phenotypes (i.e., the treatment and outcome). Moreover, based on the identification theory, we develop a cluster fusion-like method to discover valid IV sets and estimate the causal effects of interest.

Most existing MR methods assume a one-directional causal relationship. However, bi-directional relationships are ubiquitous in real-life scenarios, for example, obesity and vitamin D status [Vimaleswaran et al., 2013], body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), etc. Understanding and analyzing bi-directional relationships can provide deeper insights into complex systems, leading to more effective interventions and solutions.

Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, suppose obesity $(X)$ and Vitamin D status $(Y)$ are the treatment and outcome of interest, respectively, and lifestyle factors (U) are the unmeasured confounders between them. One can use genetic variants $\\mathbf{G}$ as IVs to explore the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ in observational data [Vimaleswaran et al., 2013] if $\\mathbf{G}$ are valid IVs, i.e., $\\mathbf{G}$ satisfy the following three assumptions [Wright, 1928, Goldberger, 1972, Bowden and Turkington, 1990, Hern\u00e1n and Robins, 2006]: ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "A1.

However, in most MR studies, the genetic variants may include some invalid IVs due to horizontal pleiotropy\u2212where some genetic variants may have pleiotropic effects on both the treatment $X$ and the outcome $Y$ via different biological pathways [Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003, Lawlor et al., 2008]. How to select valid IVs from such genetic variants becomes the major issue in the MR study. In general, valid IVs need to be chosen based on domain knowledge or expert experience [Richmond et al., 2017, Martens et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2023]. However, it is usually difficult to select appropriate valid IVs without precise prior knowledge of genetic variants, and an invalid IV may cause biased estimation of the effect of $X$ on $Y$ [Sanderson et al., 2022, Richmond and Smith, 2022].

[2013]. Note that the original data only consists of summary data, and thus we generate individual-level data based on the data generation mechanism described in Eq.(1). The data we used comprises 16 related SNPs as candidate IVs, including seven SNPs associated with obesity (BMI): rs9939609 (FTO), rs2867125 (TMEM18), rs4074134 (BDNF), rs7647305 (ETV5), rs7138803 (FAIM2), rs3101336 (NEGR1), and rs10938397 (GNPDA2); four SNPs related to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D): rs12785878 (DHCR7), rs10741657 (CYP2R1), rs2282679 (GC), and rs6013897 (CYP24A1); and five SNPs associated with BMI and 25(OH)D: rs4498364, rs1381660, rs4549702, rs12760109, and rs77913838. We observed that FTO and FAIM2 serve as valid IVs for the $X\\rightarrow Y$ , while DHCR7 and CYP24A1 are valid IVs for the $Y\\rightarrow X$ , with estimated causal effects of -1.15 and -0.05, respectively.

The causal effect of exposure on outcome is often different from the observed correlation due to confounding factors. Correlations between exposure and outcome cannot be used as reliable evidence for inferring causality. In contrast, Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies use genetic variants to infer the causal effect of exposure on outcome. The idea behind MR studies is to find a genetic variant (or multiple genetic variants) that is associated with exposure but not with other confounders and that does not directly affect the outcome. Such a genetic variant in principle fulfills the basic assumptions of instrumental variables (IVs). It is then used to assess the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome [Thomas and Conti, 2004]. Since the assumptions of IVs cannot be fully tested and may be violated during IVs\u2019 selection, a number of methods have emerged to identify valid IVs. ", "page_idx": 13}, {"type": "text", "text": "MR studies can be conducted using a single sample, i.e., one-sample Mendelian Randomization, in which individuals are tested for genetic variation, exposure, and outcome in the same population. On the contrary, in two-sample Mendelian Randomization, the association between genetic variation and exposure is estimated in one dataset while that between genetic variation and outcome is estimated in another dataset. Compared with the Two-sample MR, one-sample MR provides more direct evidence by eliminating potential biases that can arise from individual-level data, which turns out to be more meaningful yet challenging. ", "page_idx": 13}, {"type": "text", "text": "Additionally, most existing MR methods assume a one-directional causal relationship between exposure and outcome, whereas bi-directional relationships are ubiquitous in real-life scenarios. For instance, there exist bi-directional relationships between obesity and vitamin D status [Vimaleswaran et al., 2013], body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), diastolic blood pressure and stroke [Xue and Pan, 2022], insomnia and five major psychiatric disorders [Gao et al., 2019], smoking and BMI [Carreras-Torres et al., 2018], etc. It is thus desirable to take further research on bi-directional MR. Bi-directional Mendelian Randomization assesses not only the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome but also the effect of the outcome on the exposure. To achieve this, valid IVs for both the exposure and the outcome are needed. However, this is tough because genetic variants associated with the exposure are often also associated with the outcome, and vice versa. Our goal here is to identify and differentiate valid IVs for each direction within a one-sample MR framework and infer bi-directional causal effects.

(i) Similar to Li and Ye [2022], our model in Eq.(1) describes bi-directional causality in equilibrium, and in econometrics, it is known as the simultaneous equation model. According to Hausman [1983], to avoid the recursive formalization, Eq.(1) equivalently is transformed into Eq.(2) with $\\beta_{X\\to Y}\\beta_{Y\\to X}\\neq1$ . (ii) For such a bi-directional (cyclic) structure, Mooij et al. [2013] take an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODEs) perspective and show under which conditions the equilibrium state of a system of the first-order ODEs can be described by a deterministic structural causal model (SCM). This is a very interesting work. Please note that our setting is different from those in Mooij et al. [2013]: our model is motivated by bi-directional MR studies, other than a dynamical system from the control field. Further, due to the specificity of MR studies, we can only obtain the snapshot data or equilibrium data, other than dynamical ones for the treatment, the outcome as well as genetic variants.
