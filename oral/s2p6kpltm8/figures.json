G is a valid IV relative to the causal relationship X \u2192 Y.", "description": "This figure is a graphical illustration of a valid instrumental variable (IV) model in Mendelian Randomization (MR).  It shows the relationship between SNPs (G), a risk factor (X, e.g., obesity), an outcome (Y, e.g., Vitamin D status), and unmeasured confounders (U, e.g., lifestyle factors). The solid arrows represent direct causal relationships.  The dashed lines indicate the absence of a direct causal relationship. The three assumptions for a valid IV (Relevance, Exclusion Restriction, and Randomness) are represented by A1, A2, and A3, respectively, and the violations of A1, A2, and A3 are marked with a red 'x'. The assumption A1 is that the genetic variants (G) are associated with the exposure (X). The assumption A2 is that the genetic variants (G) do not have a direct pathway to the outcome (Y). The assumption A3 is that the genetic variants (G) are uncorrelated with unmeasured confounders (U). The figure demonstrates how a valid instrument (G) is used to reliably estimate the causal effect of X on Y, while accounting for unmeasured confounding.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "S2P6KPLtm8/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An illustrative example where valid and invalid IV sets induce distinct constraints, where G\u2192Y = (G1,G3)T is a valid IV set, while G\u00a5\u2192Y = (G2, G4, G5)T is invalid due to pathways G2 \u2192 Y, G4 \u2192 Y and G5 \u2192 Y.", "description": "This figure illustrates how valid and invalid instrumental variables (IVs) create different constraints in a bi-directional Mendelian Randomization (MR) model.
