It **introduces a novel framework for causal effect estimation in exchangeable data**, addressing a significant gap in current causal inference methods.

However, many real-world datasets exhibit dependence, such as multi-environment data, violating this assumption. This limitation restricts the applicability of standard causal inference techniques to a narrow range of scenarios.  This paper tackles the challenge of causal inference in scenarios that violate the i.i.d. assumption.  It focuses on exchangeable data, which exhibit dependence but possess a specific type of symmetry, and introduces the concept of independent causal mechanisms (ICM). \nThe paper proposes a novel framework for causal inference under the ICM assumption in exchangeable data.  This involves developing a new operational definition for interventions in exchangeable data and deriving a \n'truncated factorization formula'. This formula helps identify and estimate causal effects from exchangeable data.  The authors introduce a 'Do-Finetti' algorithm that combines the ICM framework with multi-environment data to perform simultaneous causal discovery and effect estimation. The algorithm is validated empirically through experiments using a causal P\u00f3lya urn model and synthetic datasets.", "affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "4rCZeCZAON/podcast.wav"}
