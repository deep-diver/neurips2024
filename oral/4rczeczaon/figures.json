Suppose G = X \u2192 Y. The hammer represents an intervention on the closest node. (a): Data generated according to G under an i.i.d. process; (b): Data generated under an ICM-generative process (using plate notation). Block A shows how P(Y|do(X)) differs between the i.i.d. (a) and the exchangeable (b) case. Note that the causal effect under i.i.d. is a special case of that under exchangeable processes with p(\u03c8) = \u03b4(\u03c8 = \u03c80), for some value \u03c80. Corollary 1 below justifies that we omit position indices from Block A in ICM-generative processes. Block B shows the difference in intervention effect when conditioned on other observations, for i.i.d. (a) and ICM-generative (b) processes. In the i.i.d. case (a), due to (Y1, X1) \u22a5 (Y2, X2), conditioning on (X2,Y2) conveys no information on the prediction of the interventional effect on Y1. In contrast, for an ICM-generative process (b), observing (X2,Y2) does provide additional information about the effect on Y1 when intervening on X1. Graph (c) illustrates the graph surgery performed on ICM(G) (cf. Def. 7 in Appendix A). We observe that conditioning on a collider Y2 provides additional information about the effect on Y1 when intervening on X1.", "description": "This figure illustrates the differences in causal effects between independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) processes and independent causal mechanism (ICM) generative processes. It highlights how conditioning on other observations impacts the interventional effect differently in these two scenarios.  The i.i.d. case shows independence between observations, while the ICM generative process demonstrates dependence due to shared latent variables.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "4rCZeCZAON/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: An illustration of differences in what the do-operator does between a structural causal model (a) and an ICM generative process (b). In the observational phase, SCMs (a), where the dotted plate indicates i.i.d. sampled, illustrates that fixed assignment of Ux and Uy leads to fixed observable values X and Y; on the other hand, for ICM-generative processes where exch. is an abbreviation for an exchangeable process, fixing \u03b8, \u03c8 does not fix X and Y, instead, it means sampling from a fixed distribution. Because SCM fails to characterize ICM-generative processes, we define the operational meaning of do-interventions on ICM-generative processes as assigning \u03b4-distribution to the intervened variables and substituting the corresponding values in the remaining distributions.", "description": "This figure compares how the *do* operator affects causal inference in two different data generation processes: i.i.d. and ICM generative processes. In the i.i.d. case, fixing the exogenous variables (Ux and Uy) uniquely determines the observed variables (X and Y).  However, in the ICM generative process, fixing the causal de Finetti parameters (\u03b8 and \u03c8) only determines the distributions of X and Y, not their specific values. The figure illustrates how the *do* operator is redefined for ICM generative processes: by setting the intervened variable to a delta distribution and substituting the corresponding value in the other distributions.", "section": "3 Causal Effect in Exchangeable Data"}, {"figure_path": "4rCZeCZAON/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Our method's (do-Finetti) performance in simultaneously identifying DAG (right) and causal effect estimation (left), compared to the i.i.d. algorithm (i.i.d.) and corresponding methods with known true DAG (do Finetti with true DAG and i.i.d. with true DAG) in bivariate setting.
