It compares CAT3D's performance against several baseline methods across various metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and different numbers of input views (3, 6, and 9).  The results show that CAT3D consistently outperforms the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in reconstructing 3D scenes from limited observations.", "section": "4.1 Few-View 3D Reconstruction"}]
