The left side displays 256x256 images sampled from a 128x128 diffusion model, highlighting the local nature of the generated textures. The right side shows 512x512 images sampled from a 256x256 diffusion model, further emphasizing this locality. This demonstrates that the pre-trained LR diffusion model can be used to directly handle high-resolution noisy images by leveraging the inherent local diffusion prior.", "section": "3.4 Local Diffusion Priors"}, {"figure_path": "OuKW8cUiuY/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visual comparison of different denoising methods in SIDD validation dataset.", "description": "This figure shows a visual comparison of different denoising methods applied to images from the SIDD validation dataset.
