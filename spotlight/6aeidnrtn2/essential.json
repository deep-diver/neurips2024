However, these methods often suffer from high storage overheads, hindering scalability and efficiency, especially for unbounded scenes with millions of points.  This paper addresses these scalability challenges by focusing on compressing 3D Gaussian representations.\nLightGaussian tackles this problem by implementing a three-step pipeline: Gaussian Pruning and Recovery to reduce redundancy, SH Distillation to compact spherical harmonic coefficients, and Vector Quantization to further reduce bitwidth.  Through these methods, LightGaussian achieves an average 15x compression rate, while significantly boosting FPS (from 144 to 237) and maintaining high visual quality.  The method also demonstrates adaptability to other 3D representations, suggesting broad applicability and potential for future improvements in real-time neural rendering.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "6AeIDnrTN2/podcast.wav"}
