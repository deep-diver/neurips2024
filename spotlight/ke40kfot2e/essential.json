Probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) offer a solution by representing models symbolically, but existing methods were limited to tree-structures, hindering scalability and expressiveness. This limitation made it challenging to learn complex distributions from data and limited the application of PICs to larger datasets.  This paper introduces several key advancements to address these limitations. \nThe authors present a pipeline for constructing PICs with more flexible Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures beyond the previous tree-like constraints.  They introduce a technique for approximating intractable PICs using tensorized probabilistic circuits (QPCs), which efficiently encode a hierarchical numerical quadrature process.  Furthermore, neural functional sharing significantly enhances the training scalability of PICs by parameterizing them with multi-headed multi-layer perceptrons, thereby reducing computational costs and memory requirements.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques, showcasing improved performance and scalability compared to traditional approaches.", "affiliation": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Ke40kfOT2E/podcast.wav"}
