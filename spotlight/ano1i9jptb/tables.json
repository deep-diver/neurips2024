The tasks cover areas such as arithmetic, geometric reasoning, code generation, and more. For each task, the table shows the accuracy or success rate achieved by various single-query, multi-query, and prompting methods, as well as the BoT method.  The best and second-best performing methods for each task are highlighted in blue and green, respectively. The results demonstrate that BoT achieves significantly higher performance than other methods on most tasks, particularly for complex reasoning problems.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "ANO1i9JPtb/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparing BoT with previous methods across various tasks.
