The left part shows the t-SNE visualization of the logit embeddings on the CIFAR-100 dataset. It compares the distribution of synthetic data instances generated by SRe2L and the proposed DWA method.  The DWA method shows a more diverse and widespread distribution, suggesting better generalization. The right part presents a bar chart comparing the performance improvement achieved by the DWA method across three different datasets (Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and CIFAR-100), demonstrating its superior performance.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "uwSaDHLlYc/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Analysis of decoupled Lvar coefficient. We vary Avar across a wide range of (0.01 ~ 0.23). 'decoupled var' indicates Avar is changing individually with a fixed mean component whose weight defaults to 0.01. 'coupled var' represents the weight of the mean and Avar change in tandem. (a) and (b) illustrate the performance of the original SRe2L [46] and our DWA in these two scenarios, respectively. This analysis is conducted on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-18. Each Avar undergoes five independent experiments, with variance indicated by lighter color shades.", "description": "This figure analyzes the impact of the decoupled variance regularizer (Lvar) in the batch normalization (BN) loss on the diversity of synthesized datasets. It compares two approaches: (a) decoupled variance, where the variance regularizer is adjusted independently, and (b) coupled variance, where both mean and variance regularizers are adjusted simultaneously. The x-axis represents different values of the decoupled Lvar coefficient (Avar), while the y-axis shows the test accuracy achieved on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-18. The results demonstrate that adjusting the variance regularizer independently leads to better performance compared to adjusting it along with the mean regularizer, highlighting the importance of decoupling the two terms in enhancing diversity.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "uwSaDHLlYc/figures/figures_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Normalized feature distance of decoupled variance component with \u03bbvar = 0.11 (the weight of mean component defaults to 0.01) and coupled variance component with \u03bbBN = 0.11.
