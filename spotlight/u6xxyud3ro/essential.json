Existing methods for handling this, using switching regret as a measure, either had suboptimal regret bounds or were computationally expensive.  The challenge is to find an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss, accounting for changes in the optimal action over time. \n\nThe paper introduces the RESET algorithm.  RESET cleverly uses a recursive tree structure and an adaptive base algorithm to achieve the asymptotically optimal switching regret simultaneously for every possible segmentation. Its efficiency is another highlight, with logarithmic space and per-trial time complexity.  Furthermore, it provides novel bounds on dynamic regret, showing its adaptability to changing conditions.  These results represent a significant advancement in online convex optimization, addressing existing limitations and proposing a novel, parameter-free and efficient solution.", "affiliation": "Alan Turing Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "u6XxyuD3Ro/podcast.wav"}
