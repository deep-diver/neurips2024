To derive these bounds, we view SSL as a data fusion problem involving the merging of samples that come from two measurement modalities: the labeled set and the unlabeled set.

As in prior works we consider a fixed separation $\\lambda=\\|\\Delta\\pmb{\\mu}\\|_{2}^{2}/4=O(1)$ , where $\\Delta\\pmb{\\mu}$ is $k$ -sparse. The asymptotic setting is that $(k,L,n,p)$ all tend to infinity with the following scaling, which arises naturally for this problem (see Section 2): the number of labeled samples is $\\mathbf{\\bar{\\boldsymbol{L}}}=\\lfloor2\\bar{k}\\beta\\log(p)/\\lambda\\rfloor$ , the number of unlabeled samples scales as $n\\propto k^{\\gamma}/\\lambda^{2}$ , and the sparsity scales as $k\\propto p^{\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha\\in(0,1/2)$ . The figure shows different regions in the $(\\gamma,\\beta)$ plane, namely as a function of the number of unlabeled and labeled samples, where classification and feature selection are either impossible, hard or computationally easy. We say that classification is impossible if for any classifier there is a $k$ -sparse vector $\\Delta\\pmb{\\mu}$ whose corresponding accuracy is no better than random. Similarly, we say that feature selection is impossible if for any estimator $\\hat{S}$ of size $k$ there is a $k$ -sparse $\\Delta\\pmb{\\mu}$ with support $S$ such that $|\\hat{S}\\cap S|/k\\to0$ as $p\\rightarrow\\infty$ . Feature selection is easy if it is possible to construct in polynomial time a set $\\hat{S}$ of size $k$ such that $|\\hat{S}\\cap S|/k\\to1$ . This implies that the corresponding classifier has an excess risk that asymptotically tends to zero. The green region $\\gamma\\geq2$ follows from Deshpande & Montanari (2014), since in this case support estimation is computationally feasible using only the unlabeled data. The region depicted in red is where classification and support recovery are impossible. The impossibility of support recovery follows from Ingster (1997); Donoho $\\&$ Jin (2004), who proved that support recovery is feasible if and only if $\\beta>1-\\alpha$ . The same condition holds for classification as well, as described in the supplement. The orange and blue regions in Figure 1 follow from novel results of this paper. In the orange region, defined as $\\beta<1-\\alpha$ and $1<\\gamma<2$ , our computational lower bound in Theorem 2.6 suggests that any polynomial-time scheme will not succeed in accurate classification. In the blue region, characterized by $\\beta\\in(1-\\gamma\\alpha,1-\\alpha)$ and $1<\\gamma<2$ , our proposed polynomial time SSL method is guaranteed to construct an accurate classifier. This is proven in Theorem 3.2.

Under the low degree hardness conjecture, in this blue region no computationally efficient SL or UL method that separately analyze the labeled or unlabeled samples, respectively, would succeed. We conjecture that in the remaining white region, no polynomial-time algorithm exists that is able to recover the support or able to construct an accurate classifier.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
