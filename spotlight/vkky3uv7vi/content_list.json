However, real-world scenarios often involve large-scale datasets and numerous constraints, presenting significant challenges. Current methods for differentiating optimization problems typically rely on implicit differentiation, which necessitates costly computations on the Jacobian matrices, resulting in low efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BPQP, a differentiable convex optimization framework designed for efficient end-to-end learning.

This reformulation enables the use of first-order optimization algorithms in calculating the backward pass gradients, allowing our framework to potentially utilize any state-of-the-art solver.

Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that BPQP achieves a significant improvement in efficiency\u2014typically an order of magnitude faster in overall execution time compared to other differentiable optimization layers.

Beyond explicit forward functions, some layers of the network may be characterized by behaviors of implicit outputs, such as the solutions to mathematical optimization problems, which can be described as differentiable optimization layers [1]. These can be treated as implicit functions where inputs are mapped to optimal solutions. In this manner, the network can incorporate useful inductive biases, including domain-specific knowledge, physical structures, and priors, thereby enabling more accurate and reliable decision-making. This approach has been integrated into deep declarative networks [2] for end-to-end learning and has proven effective in various applications, such as energy minimization [3, 4] and predict-then-optimize [5, 6] problems.

To address this challenge, explicit methods [4, 10, 11] unroll the iterations of the optimization process and use the decision variable from the final iteration as a proxy solution for the optimization problem. This constructs an explicit computational graph from the parameters to the proxy parameters, then calculate relevant gradients. Typically, these methods are designed for unconstrained optimizations. Applying them directly to constrained optimizations is computationally expensive because it requires projecting decision variables into a feasible region. Alt-Diff [12] is a novel unrolling solution that decouples constraints from the optimization and significantly reduces the computational cost. While advanced unrolling methods continue to improve their efficiency, they require an additional cost in the unrolled computational graph that increases with the number of optimization iterations.

These methods specifically apply the theorem to KKT conditions in convex optimization. Specificity-driven approaches are often tailored for particular problems in convex optimization such as QP, offering good efficiency but sacrificing generality. OptNet [14] presented a differentiable batched-GPU QP solver. An ADMM layer is also developed for QP [18]. It facilitates implicit differentiation through a custom fixed-point mapping, reducing the cost by reducing the dimensions of the linear system to be resolved. Generality-focused approaches pursued more generalized solutions but faced limitations in efficiency, performing poorly on largescale optimization problems. Their solution processes often rely on specific methods (such as coupled forward and backward passes), which prevent the application of various optimizers, thus leading to the aforementioned efficiency issues. Diffcp [1, 15] considers computing the derivative of a convex cone program by implicitly differentiating the residual map for its homogeneous self-dual embedding. Open-source convex solver CVXPY [19] adopts a similar method and computes gradients by SCS [20]. JaxOpt [10] proposes a simple approach to adding implicit differentiation on top of any existing solver, which significantly lowers the barrier to using implicit differentiation. Our work, BPQP, based on implicit methods, can be efficiently and broadly applied to convex optimization problems. We simplify the backward pass by reformulating it into a simpler, decoupled QP problem. This decoupling grants BPQP the freedom to choose an optimizer and, in conjunction with problem simplification, greatly reduces the computational cost in both the forward and backward passes.

Sharing this information will limit the available forward solvers and result in a coupled design. Exact falls back to a simpler implementation that does not involve sharing information between designs. It solves the KKT matrix (i.e., Eq. (3)) in the backward pass via a matrix inverse method without relying on information from the forward pass. Although Exact uses a relatively efficient implementation in the forward pass (i.e., a first-order method, same as BPQP), the fallback backward implementation becomes a bottleneck for efficiency.

Our approach, BPQP, is grounded in implicit methods and simplify the backward pass by reformulating it into a simpler decoupled QP problem, which greatly reduces the computational cost in both the forward and backward passes.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
