This paper addresses this limitation by proposing Vision-Augmented Prompting (VAP), a novel dual-modality reasoning approach.  VAP leverages external drawing tools to synthesize images from textual problem descriptions, enabling LLMs to reason using both verbal and visual-spatial cues.  The approach iteratively refines both the image and the reasoning chain, ultimately improving accuracy and robustness.\nVAP's effectiveness is demonstrated across four diverse tasks: solving geometry problems, Sudoku puzzles, time series prediction, and the travelling salesman problem.  **Extensive experiments show VAP's superiority over existing LLM-based reasoning frameworks, highlighting the importance of multimodal reasoning in enhancing AI problem-solving.** The self-alignment technique ensures the accuracy of the synthesized images and the alignment with the textual reasoning process, thereby improving robustness.  Results indicate significant performance gains across all four tasks, showcasing VAP's potential to advance the field of AI reasoning.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "NGuGVT7ar2/podcast.wav"}
