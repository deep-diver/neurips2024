Using the conditional flow matching framework, these can be used to predict the instantaneous velocity vo(t,xt) and future observations. Both flows are conditioned on past data x[t-h,t-1] and conditional variables c.", "description": "This figure illustrates the Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM) method.  TFM simultaneously learns two neural networks: one that estimates the next time point in a time series (x1), given the previous points and covariates (xto, xt-1, xt-2, c); and another that estimates the uncertainty associated with this prediction (\u03c3o(t,xt)). The prediction of the next time point is conditioned on previous observations and contextual variables. The figure highlights how these estimations are combined to provide both a point prediction and an uncertainty range, which is crucial for applications involving noisy and irregularly sampled data.", "section": "Trajectory Flow Matching"}, {"figure_path": "fNakQltI1N/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: 1D harmonic oscillator overfitting experiment results.
