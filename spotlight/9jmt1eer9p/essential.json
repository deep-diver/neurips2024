Modern machine learning optimizers focus on empirical performance but often lack theoretical guarantees. This creates a significant challenge: balancing theoretical rigor with practical efficiency.  The existing methods of designing optimization algorithms either prioritize speed, ignoring theoretical guarantees, or focus on theoretical guarantees, compromising on speed.\nThis paper presents a novel methodology using electric circuits to address this issue.  It proposes to design an electric circuit whose dynamics converge to the optimization problem's solution.  Then, it leverages computer-assisted techniques to discretize the circuit's continuous-time dynamics into a provably convergent discrete-time algorithm. This approach is shown to recover several classical algorithms and enables users to readily explore new ones with convergence guarantees.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "9Jmt1eER9P/podcast.wav"}
