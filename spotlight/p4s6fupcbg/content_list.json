By combining image and pixel-level confidence with 3DGS fine-tuning, we have achieved state-of-the-art performance in NVS enhancement. However, our approach relies on adjacent views for continuous interpolation, it cannot be easily adapted to single-view 3D model generation. Moreover, the confidence-aware 3DGS fine-tuning strategies are relatively simple and straightforward. In the future, it is interesting to integrate confidence maps directly with the video generation model, enabling the generation of images that are more in line with the real 3D world without the need for post-processing. Meanwhile, utilizing the efficient data generation capability of 3DGS to construct a massively scaled dataset for our video generation model presents a prime opportunity to enhance the model\u2019s 3D consistency. This approach also facilitates the 2D models to understand the 3D world directly from 2D images without additional geometric constraints. Regarding the social impact, the goal of this work is to advance the fields of 3D reconstruction and NVS. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
