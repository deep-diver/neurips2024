Existing adversarial training methods for LLMs are computationally expensive due to the need for discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. This hinders the widespread adoption of adversarial training in LLMs for improving robustness.\nThis paper proposes a new adversarial training algorithm (CAT) that utilizes continuous attacks in the embedding space of LLMs, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing discrete methods. It also introduces CAPO, a continuous variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment.  Experiments show that these methods significantly enhance LLM robustness against various attacks while maintaining utility, offering a pathway towards scalable adversarial training for robustly aligning LLMs.", "affiliation": "Mila, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "8jB6sGqvgQ/podcast.wav"}
