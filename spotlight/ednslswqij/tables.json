The experiments involve three tasks: translation, rotation, and removal of objects.  The results are broken down for both 'seen' (objects present in the training data) and 'unseen' objects (objects not seen during training), showing performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID) within the bounding box of the edited object.

It compares the performance of the proposed Neural Assets model against two baselines, Chained and 3DIT, across various metrics: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and DINO. The metrics are evaluated both at the image level (considering the entire image) and at the object level (focusing solely on the edited objects).

It compares the performance using CLIP, MAE, DINO, and a fine-tuned DINO (FT-DINO) as visual encoders. The metrics used to evaluate the model include PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID (image-level), and PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and DINO (object-level).

It compares the performance of training with single frames versus paired frames (source and target frames from videos) for learning Neural Assets.  It also includes a variant where positional encoding is removed from the ViT image encoder. The metrics used are PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID (image-level), and PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and DINO (object-level). The results show that paired frame training significantly improves performance compared to single frame training, demonstrating the importance of learning disentangled appearance and pose features.", "section": "4.4 Ablation Study"}]
