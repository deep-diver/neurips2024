Existing latent-space control methods often lack mathematical structure, stability guarantees, and invertible input-output mappings.  This hinders combining them with powerful model-based control strategies. \nThe paper introduces a novel method that uses a Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) to learn latent dynamics and implement model-based control.  CON boasts inherent Input-to-State stability, efficient dynamics integration (using an approximate closed-form solution), and an invertible input-output mapping.  This combination allows for effective and precise latent-space control, as demonstrated by high-quality performance on a soft robot using only raw image feedback.
