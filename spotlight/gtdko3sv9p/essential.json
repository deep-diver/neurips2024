Existing methods struggle with high-dimensional discrete data, often relying on embedding techniques that compromise performance or are computationally expensive.  This limitation hinders progress in various applications like code generation and language modeling. \n\nThis paper introduces Discrete Flow Matching (DFM), a novel framework addressing these challenges. **DFM uses flexible probability paths and a generic sampling formula based on learned posteriors**, achieving state-of-the-art performance on HumanEval and MBPP coding benchmarks as well as outperforming other models in text generation tasks.  DFM also shows significant improvements by scaling up the model size, **highlighting the scalability and potential for future enhancement** of the approach.", "affiliation": "Meta FAIR", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "GTDKo3Sv9p/podcast.wav"}
