Existing model fusion methods, like averaging model weights, often underperform, especially in NLP due to a large discrepancy between the loss and metric landscapes during fine-tuning. This makes finding models with good generalization difficult.\nThe paper introduces BOMF, a novel model fusion technique leveraging multi-objective Bayesian optimization. BOMF optimizes both the desired metric and loss, using a two-stage approach (hyperparameter optimization and model fusion optimization).  Experiments demonstrate that BOMF significantly improves performance on various downstream tasks compared to existing methods. This makes it an efficient and effective tool for improving the fine-tuning process of language models.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "lV4kTHTgpJ/podcast.wav"}
