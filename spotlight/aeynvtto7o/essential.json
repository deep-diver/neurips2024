This limitation hinders the models' ability to capture biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns and generalize across diverse datasets.  Effectively leveraging cell ontology information during TFM pre-training is crucial for overcoming this limitation. \n\nTo address this, the researchers developed scCello, a novel cell ontology-guided TFM. scCello incorporates cell-type coherence and ontology alignment losses into the pre-training process.  This innovative approach enables scCello to learn biologically meaningful patterns while maintaining its general-purpose nature.  **The model demonstrated superior performance in various downstream tasks, including novel cell type classification, marker gene prediction, and cancer drug response prediction**, surpassing existing TFMs in accuracy and generalizability.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aeYNVtTo7o/podcast.wav"}
