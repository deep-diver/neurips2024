However, their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).  Spiking Transformers aim to bridge this gap, but their quadratic complexity hinders scalability.  Existing spiking transformers have limited success on benchmark datasets like ImageNet. \nThis research introduces QKFormer, a novel spiking transformer that addresses the limitations of its predecessors. QKFormer utilizes a novel Q-K attention mechanism with linear complexity and high energy efficiency, improving training speed and allowing larger model development.  The authors also employ a hierarchical architecture with multi-scale spiking representation.
