It shows the learned density (q\u03b8,r) produced by each method and the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the mixing distribution (r) learned by PVI using 100 particles.  The comparison is performed across different kernel choices (Constant, Push, Skip, LSkip), demonstrating how the expressiveness of the mixing distribution affects the final density estimation under different kernel types.", "section": "5.1 Impact of the mixing distribution"}, {"figure_path": "p3gMGkHMkM/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of PVI and PVIZero on a bimodal mixture of Gaussians for various kernels.
