Existing algorithms for Massart noise, a more realistic noise model, had suboptimal sample complexities compared to those under the simpler random classification noise. This was believed to reflect the inherent difficulty in managing the non-uniformity of Massart noise.\nThis paper introduces Perspectron, a novel algorithm that addresses this issue.  By cleverly re-weighting samples and using a perceptron-like update, it achieves the optimal sample complexity, matching the best results for random classification noise.  This improvement extends to generalized linear models, offering a significant advancement in the field.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ENlubvb262/podcast.wav"}
