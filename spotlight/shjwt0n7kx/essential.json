Existing methods often rely on computationally expensive techniques like Monte Carlo simulations or importance sampling, making them inefficient for complex systems.  Many existing methods either focus on finding the 'most probable path' or only consider Brownian motions, and are not computationally feasible to tackle high dimensional problems like protein folding.\nThis paper introduces a novel variational approach to TPS, utilizing a simulation-free training objective based on Doob's h-transform. This significantly reduces the search space by directly imposing boundary conditions and avoiding trajectory simulations. The method uses a neural network to parameterize the conditioned stochastic process, enabling efficient optimization. Results on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks demonstrate the method's superior sample-efficiency and feasibility compared to existing techniques. The new method is shown to be capable of generating high-quality samples of transition paths effectively and with significant computational savings.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ShJWT0n7kX/podcast.wav"}
