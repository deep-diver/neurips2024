Existing PE methods are either not compatible with SNNs' spike-based communication or lack hardware-friendliness.  This paper tackles this challenge.\nThe authors propose a novel PE technique, CPG-PE, drawing inspiration from the Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) in the human brain.  They demonstrate that CPG-PE outperforms existing methods across various sequential tasks, such as time-series forecasting and natural language processing.  Furthermore, the analysis of CPG-PE elucidates the underlying mechanisms of neural computation and suggests a new direction for designing more effective and biologically realistic SNNs. **CPG-PE is shown to be highly effective and addresses a critical limitation in SNN research.**", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "kQMyiDWbOG/podcast.wav"}
