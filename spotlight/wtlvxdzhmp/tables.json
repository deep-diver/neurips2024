Note in the first row, which corresponds to p = 1 with \u025b\u2081 = 1, we know the optimal value |a1b1| = \u221aq/e from Eq. (3.7). The remaining values are optimized via a quasi-Newton method starting with 1000 heuristic initial guesses of (\u03b3, \u03b2) and keeping the best value; hence, they currently should be considered as lower bounds on the best possible enhancement factors.", "description": "This table presents the quantum enhancement factor achieved by the p-step QAOA over the p-step tensor power iteration for spiked q-tensors in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime. The enhancement factor represents how much the signal-to-noise ratio can be reduced while maintaining the same overlap as classical power iteration. For p=1, the optimal enhancement factor is known and presented in the first row.  For p>1, the values shown are numerically optimized and should be considered lower bounds on the true optimal enhancement factors.", "section": "Main results"}]
