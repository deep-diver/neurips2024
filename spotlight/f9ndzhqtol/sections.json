By cleverly decomposing the sampling process into independent, parallelizable blocks, these methods significantly reduce the overall computational cost. This is particularly crucial for high-dimensional data, where traditional sequential sampling becomes prohibitively expensive.  The core idea revolves around exploiting the inherent structure of diffusion models to enable parallel processing of intermediate steps without compromising the quality of the final samples.  **Theoretical analysis often demonstrates sub-linear time complexity**, indicating a substantial improvement over standard methods.  **The effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific implementation and the underlying model architecture**, as well as the availability of sufficient computational resources.

Instead, the growth rate is considerably slower, potentially logarithmic or even polylogarithmic. This is particularly valuable when dealing with high-dimensional data, where linear-time approaches become computationally intractable.  **The paper likely presents a novel approach that leverages parallelization techniques, such as parallel sampling**, to drastically reduce the computational cost of inference.  The key is likely the breakdown of computations into independent subtasks, enabling concurrent processing across multiple cores or processors, achieving sublinear scaling.  **Proving sublinear time complexity is a major theoretical contribution**, demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and scalability for large datasets.
