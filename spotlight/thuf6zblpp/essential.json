Gaussian BBVI methods, while efficient, lack flexibility in representing complex, non-Gaussian distributions.  This limitation hinders accurate approximation of intricate posterior distributions in Bayesian modeling.\nEigenVI addresses these challenges by employing orthogonal function expansions to create flexible variational families.  Instead of iterative optimization, EigenVI uses score-matching and minimizes the Fisher divergence, which reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem. This efficient approach allows EigenVI to accurately model diverse distributions, including those that are multimodal, asymmetric, or heavy-tailed.  Empirical evaluations demonstrate EigenVI's superior accuracy over existing Gaussian BBVI methods on several benchmark models, highlighting its efficacy and potential for broader applications in probabilistic inference.", "affiliation": "Flatiron Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Variational Inference"}, "podcast_path": "thUf6ZBlPp/podcast.wav"}
