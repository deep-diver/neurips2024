Traditional methods based on influence functions demand complex manual derivations, hindering widespread adoption.  This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional settings where computational cost and analytical complexity dramatically increase. \nThis paper introduces Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions (MC-EIF), a fully automated method for approximating efficient influence functions. MC-EIF leverages automatic differentiation and probabilistic programming to efficiently compute EIFs, making complex calculations significantly easier.  **The method is shown to be consistent and achieves optimal convergence rates,** outperforming existing automated approaches in empirical evaluations. **MC-EIF offers a general and scalable solution**, extending the reach of efficient statistical estimation to a far broader class of models and functionals than previously possible.", "affiliation": "Basis Research Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "2wfd3pti8v/podcast.wav"}
