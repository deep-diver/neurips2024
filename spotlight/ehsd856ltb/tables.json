The comparison is based on the number of clusters achieving an F1 score greater than 0.9 across six different datasets: Synthetic 5, Synthetic 6, Plant 5, Plant 6, Marine 5, and Marine 6.  Each dataset represents a different metagenomic community.", "section": "4.2 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "Ehsd856Ltb/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Statistics of the datasets used in the experimental evaluations.", "description": "This table presents a statistical overview of the datasets employed in the paper's experiments.  It details the number of species, sequences, minimum sequence length, maximum sequence length, and average sequence length for various datasets categorized as Synthetic, Plant, and Marine, each with variants 0, 5, and 6.  Dataset 0 is used for threshold determination in the K-medoid algorithm, while datasets 5 and 6 are used for model evaluation.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Ehsd856Ltb/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Symbols and their descriptions used throughout the paper.", "description": "This table lists the symbols used in the paper and their corresponding descriptions.
