For each dataset, it shows the number of variables and the number of nodes in the corresponding PC.  The datasets range in size from relatively small (e.g., NLTCS with 16 variables) to very large (e.g., Ad with 1556 variables), reflecting a broad spectrum of complexity levels.", "section": "5.1 Datasets and Graphical Models"}, {"figure_path": "ufPPf9ghzP/tables/tables_44_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Gap Between AOBB And Other Methods.", "description": "This table presents the log-likelihood score gap between the neural network methods (SSMP, GUIDE, SSMP + ITSELF, GUIDE + ITSELF) and exact solutions. These exact solutions are obtained using AOBB, which provides near-optimal results for smaller datasets. For each approach M, the gap is calculated as the relative difference between the score of the near-optimal solution (determined by AOBB) and the score achieved by M. This approach is feasible due to the use of small datasets, allowing identification of exact solutions. The final column highlights the neural-based approach achieving the best performance for each dataset and query ratio combination.", "section": "E Gap Analysis For PGM"}]
