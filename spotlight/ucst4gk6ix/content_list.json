Unsurprisingly, various extensions to 3D Gaussian Splatting have been proposed, such as extending 3D Gaussians to dynamic scenes [43, 41], making them robust to aliasing effects [48, 42], and generative 3D content creation [52, 49, 36].

Specifically, they rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting heuristics for placing Gaussians [19, see \u201cadaptive density control\u201d]. Depending on the state of each Gaussian, they are cloned, split, or pruned, which is the primary way to control the number of Gaussians within the 3DGS representation. Moreover, Gaussians are regularly \u2018reset\u2019 by setting their opacities to small values to remove floaters in the representations. This heuristic-based approach requires multiple hyperparameters to be carefully tuned and, as we will show later on in the paper, can fail in some scenes.

It causes the method to heavily rely on good initial point clouds for it to work well, especially when applied to real-world scenes. It is also nontrivial to estimate how many 3D Gaussians will be used for a given scene from just the hyperparameters, making it difficult to control the computation and memory budget in advance without affecting reconstruction quality during inference time. Concurrent works [10, 9] thus focus on having better initialization to solve the former, or study the latter problem [4]. However, even these recent concurrent solutions still rely on heuristics, and they do not always generalize well. In some cases, this leads to sub-optimal placement of Gaussians resulting in poor quality renderings and wasted compute.

With this considered, we show in Section 3.2 that the conventional 3D Gaussian Splatting update rule is very similar to a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics update [3, 20], where the only term missing is a noise term that promotes the exploration of samples. We thus reformulate 3D Gaussian Splatting into an SGLD framework, an MCMC algorithm, which naturally explores the scene landscape, and samples Gaussians that are effective in reproducing the scene faithfully. It is important to note that while we assume an underlying distribution, this distribution does not need to be explicitly modelled, as the Gaussians themselves are already representing it.

Importantly, to minimally disturb the MCMC sampling chain, we make sure that the two states, before and after the move, are of similar probability. This implies that the training loss value does not change as we alter combinatorial properties, such as the number of Gaussians within the representation, preventing the training process from becoming unstable.

This rasterization operation is highly efficient, as instead of querying hundreds of points along a light ray to render a pixel, one can simply rasterize the (few) Gaussians associated with a given pixel.
