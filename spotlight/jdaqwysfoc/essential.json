These issues stem from their reliance on convolutional operations that restrict their ability to capture complex graph structures and long-range dependencies.  Addressing these limitations is crucial for advancing GNN research and expanding their applicability to real-world problems.\nThis paper introduces RUM (Random Walk with Unifying Memory), a novel GNN architecture that eliminates convolutional operations. RUM leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process topological and semantic features extracted from random walks on the graph.  The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that RUM surpasses the expressiveness of the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test, alleviates over-smoothing and over-squashing, and achieves competitive performance on various graph learning tasks, showing potential for more powerful and efficient graph analysis.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Graph Neural Networks"}, "podcast_path": "JDAQwysFOc/podcast.wav"}
