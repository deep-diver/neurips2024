A lower MAE difference (y-axis) indicates more susceptible timestamps to attack.", "description": "This figure shows the results of an experiment designed to determine which timestamps are most vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The experiment involved training a clean forecasting model and measuring its mean absolute error (MAE) for each timestamp.  Timestamps with higher MAE values indicate poorer prediction performance and are considered more susceptible to attack. The experiment then implemented a simple backdoor attack on different groups of timestamps, sorted by their MAE percentile, and compared the MAE of the attacked model to that of the clean model. The y-axis represents the difference in MAE between the clean and attacked models for each group of timestamps. The results demonstrate that timestamps with higher MAE percentiles (i.e., timestamps where the clean model performs poorly) tend to have a smaller MAE difference after the attack, indicating greater vulnerability.", "section": "3.2.1 Selecting Timestamps for Poisoning"}, {"figure_path": "Kl13lipxTW/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The impact of the temporal injection rate \u03b1\u03c4 and the spatial injection rate \u03b1s on clean metrics, MAEC and RMSEc, and attack metrics, MAEA and RMSEA.", "description": "This figure shows the impact of the temporal injection rate (\u03b1\u03c4) and spatial injection rate (\u03b1s) on the performance of the BACKTIME attack.  It presents four subplots: two illustrating the impact of \u03b1\u03c4 on MAE and RMSE for both clean and poisoned data, and two illustrating the impact of \u03b1s on MAE and RMSE for both clean and poisoned data. The x-axis of each subplot shows the injection rate (\u03b1\u03c4 or \u03b1s), while the y-axis represents the MAE or RMSE.  The shaded areas in the plots represent the standard deviation of the results.  The goal of BACKTIME is to minimize the attack metrics (MAEA and RMSEA) while keeping the clean metrics (MAEC and RMSEc) low, showing how the balance between attack effectiveness and stealthiness changes with varying injection rates.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Kl13lipxTW/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: The shapes of all the target patterns we evaluated in this paper.", "description": "This figure shows three different shapes of target patterns used in the BACKTIME experiments.

The third pattern resembles an upward and downward trend that has a peak and then decreases.", "section": "3.2.1 Selecting Timestamps for Poisoning"}]
