It presents the evaluation results across five different BBOB functions (GriewankRosenbrock, Lunacek, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, and SharpRidge), showcasing both 'similar' and 'mixed' transfer learning settings.  The graphs illustrate the objective function values over the number of evaluations, providing insights into the convergence speed and performance of each method under varying conditions.", "section": "4.2 Synthetic Functions"}]
