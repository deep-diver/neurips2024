Recent research explores transfer learning to speed up the optimization process, focusing on transferring search spaces, but existing methods are not adaptive or flexible enough to identify promising subspaces efficiently. This paper introduces MCTS-transfer, a novel search space transfer method that iteratively divides, selects, and optimizes a learned subspace using Monte Carlo tree search. \n\nMCTS-transfer offers several advantages. First, it provides a well-performing search space for warm-start optimization. Second, it adaptively identifies and leverages information from similar source tasks to improve the subspace search. This adaptive approach is crucial because it allows for the efficient identification of promising areas within the search space during the optimization process.  Third, it demonstrates superior performance compared to other search space transfer methods on different optimization tasks.  The results highlight its potential to significantly advance black-box optimization in various real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "T5UfIfmDbq/podcast.wav"}
