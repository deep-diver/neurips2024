This paper highlights a key observation: the decoder can reconstruct point clouds well even without encoder information if it has the masked patch centers. This raises concerns about the encoder's role in learning semantic features. \n\nTo address this, PCP-MAE is proposed.  This method uses a 'Predicting Center Module' (PCM) which shares parameters with the original encoder, and it learns to predict the significant centers. These predicted centers then replace the directly provided ones for masked patches in the decoder, enhancing reconstruction accuracy.  Importantly, the PCM uses cross-attention, allowing it to leverage both visible and masked patch information for center prediction. Experimental results show that PCP-MAE significantly surpasses existing methods, achieving significant performance improvements on benchmark datasets. This indicates that the proposed method effectively guides the model to learn more meaningful representations, ultimately improving downstream task accuracy.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "i1xjK5a0X8/podcast.wav"}
