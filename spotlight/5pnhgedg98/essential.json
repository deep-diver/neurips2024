Existing methods for designing adders and multipliers often fail to sufficiently optimize both speed and size. This leads to increased latency and larger modules, hindering overall system performance. This research addresses this limitation by casting the design task as a tree generation game, leveraging reinforcement learning to find superior designs. \nThis paper introduces ArithTreeRL, a novel method for designing adders and multipliers using reinforcement learning. The key innovation is representing the design problem as a game, which allows the system to efficiently explore the vast design space. ArithTreeRL demonstrates significant improvements over existing techniques in both speed and size for both adders and multipliers.  **The results indicate that the approach is not only effective but also scalable, applicable to state-of-the-art 7nm technology.**", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "5pnhGedG98/podcast.wav"}
