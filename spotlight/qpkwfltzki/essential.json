Current methods for quantifying state novelty using L p norms or bisimulation metrics have limitations in scalability and accuracy.  These methods often rely on count-based episodic terms or suffer from approximation inaccuracies in metric learning, hindering performance in challenging scenarios.\n\nThe proposed Effective Metric-based Exploration-bonus (EME) solves these issues. **EME employs a new metric for evaluating state discrepancy with theoretical guarantees, and a diversity-enhanced scaling factor dynamically adjusts exploration bonuses based on reward model variance.**  Experiments across diverse environments demonstrate EME's superior performance and scalability compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential to significantly advance RL exploration.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QpKWFLtZKi/podcast.wav"}
