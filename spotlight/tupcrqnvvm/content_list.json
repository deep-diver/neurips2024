We introduce newly devised GPC-style \u201cperipteral\u201d loss which leverages numerically graded relationships between pairs of objects (sets in our case). Unlike traditional contrastive learning, or RHLF preference ranking, our method utilizes graded comparisons, extracting more nuanced information than just binary-outcome comparisons, and contrasts sets of any size (not just two). We also define a novel suite of automatic sampling strategies for training, including active-learning inspired submodular feedback.

", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The first is that of identifying a useful practical scalable submodular function that can be used for real-world data science tasks. Submodular functions, set functions that exhibit a diminishing returns property (see Appendix B), have received considerable attention in the field of machine learning. This has fostered new algorithms that offer near-optimal solutions for various applications. These applications include detecting disease outbreaks [56], modeling fine structure in computer vision [41], summarizing images [102, 72, 26, 37], active learning [34, 32, 25], compressed sensing, structured convex norms, and sparsity [4, 24], fairness [17, 43], efficient model training [57, 58, 70, 69] recommendation systems [71], causal structure [114, 97], and brain parcellating [85] (see also the reviews [101, 12]). Despite these myriad applications, most research on submodularity has been on the algorithmic and theoretical side which assumes the submodular function needing to be optimized is already at hand. While there has been work showing the theoretical challenges associated with learning submodularity [5, 7, 6], there is relatively little work on practical methods to produce a useful submodular function in the first place (a few exceptions include [60, 92, 103]). Often, because it works well, one uses the non-parametric submodular facility location (FL) function, i.e., for $A\\subseteq V$ with $|V|=n$ , $\\begin{array}{r}{f(A)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\operatorname*{max}_{a\\in A}s_{a,i}}\\end{array}$ where $s_{a,i}\\geq0$ is a similarity between items $a$ and $i$ . On the other hand, the FL f unction\u2019s computational and memory costs grow quadratically with dataset size $n$ and so FL can become infeasible for large data or online streaming applications. There is a need for practical strategies to obtain useful, scalable, general-purpose, and widely applicable submodular functions. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second problem we address in this paper is the following: how best, in a modern machine-learning context, can one learn a scaling from oracles that, for a given query, each provide numerically graded pairwise comparisons between two choices?

The oracle could be an individual human annotator, or could be a combinatorially expensive desired target function \u2014 in either case we assume that it is infeasible to optimize over the oracle but it is feasible to query. Learning a \u201cscaling\u201d means learning a scalar-valued function $f$ that respects these graded pairwise scores in that $f(A)-f(B)\\approx S c o r{\\bar{e}}(A,B)$ . ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "A special case of such preference elicitation from human oracles have been studied going back many decades. For example, the psychometric \u201cLaw of comparative judgment\" [99] focuses on establishing numeric interval scales based on knowing preferences between pairs of choices (e.g., $A$ vs $B$ ). The Bradley-Terry [14] model (generalized to ranking elicitations in the Luce-Shephard model [65, 90]) also involves preferences among elements of pairs. These preferences, however, are not graded and rather are either only binary $\\mathit{\\omega}\\times\\mathit{B}$ or $B\\prec A$ ), ternary (allowing also for indifference), or quaternary (allowing also for incomparability). Thus, each oracle query provides minimal information about a pair. Therefore, multiple preference ratings are often aggregated where a collection of (presumed random i.i.d.) oracles vote on the preference between items of the same pair. This produces a histogram of preference ratings $C_{i j}$ (a count of how many times $i$ is preferred to $j$ [91]) and this can be used in modern reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) systems [109, 19, 76, 111, 105] for reward learning (i.e., inverse reinforcement learning [3, 1]). Overall, the above modeling strategies are known in the field of psychometric theory [33] as \u201cpaired comparisons\u201d where it is said that \u201cpaired comparison methods generally give much more reliable results\u201d [74] for models of human preference expression and elicitation.

We explore \u201cgraded pairwise comparisons\u201d (GPC) which also have been studied for quite some time [87, 9, 10]. Quite recently, it was found that \u201cGPCs are expected to reduce faking compared with Likert-type scales and to produce more reliable, less ipsative trait scores than traditional-binary forced-choice formats\u201d [61] such as paired comparisons. An intuitive reason for this is that, once we get to the point that an oracle is asked only if $A\\prec B$ or $B\\prec A$ , this does not elicit as much information out of the oracle as would asking for $S c o r e(A,B)$ even though the incremental oracle effort for the latter is often negligible. As far as we know, despite GPC\u2019s potential information extraction efficiency advantages, GPC has not been addressed in the modern machine learning community. Also, while histograms $C_{i,j}$ are appropriate for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of non-linear logistic and softmax style regression [19, 76, 115, 111], MLE with a Bradley-Terry style model is suboptimal to learn scoring from graded preferences $S c o r e(A,B)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ which can be an arbitrary signed real number.

In a nutshell, DSPNs are an expressive theoretically interesting parametric family of submodular functions that can be successfully learnt using a new GPC-style loss that we introduce below. In our work, since the teacher will be an expensive FL function and the learner is a DSPN set function, we can view this as a form of knowledge distillation.

Unlike standard supervised learning which teaches models to associate samples to human-supplied labels, contrastive learning encourages models to capture relationships between pairs, groups, or sections of unlabeled samples. It does this by \u201ccontrasting\u201d positive pairs (i.e., similar data points) against negative pairs (dissimilar data points). Mathematically, this approach uses loss functions that encourage the model to learn embeddings where positive pairs become \u201cclose\u201d (according to some distance measure), while negative pairs become \u201cfar.\u201d A common setting is the contrastive loss, such as the triplet loss or the Siamese network loss. For instance, in the triplet loss framework, the model is trained on triplets of data points consisting of an anchor $x$ , a positive example $x^{+}$ (similar to the anchor), and a negative example $x^{-}$ (dissimilar from the anchor). Optimizing a model with such a loss function encourages a representation that respects these positive/negative pairwise preferences. ", "page_idx": 17}, {"type": "text", "text": "On the other hand, such contrastive approaches are analogous to binary-only pairwise comparison elicitations. That is, existing contrastive losses neither utilize information regarding how positive the pair $x,x^{+}$ is nor how negative the pair $x,x^{-}$ is. A more nuanced graded comparison, if available, would be an improvement. In fact, the benefit of graded comparisons is analogous to the benefits of using soft over hard labels in supervised training (say from model distillation) which has benefits in uncertainty representation, regularization, noise mitigation, adjustable smoothness via softmax temperature, and more efficient knowledge transfer. Another limitation of previous contrastive learning is that it operates only with positive or negative groups of size two (pairs) rather than larger groups. While it is often the case that the anchor $x$ is contrasted with many negative examples, it is always done so pairwise, considering each $x^{-}$ with $x$ together in a sum of pairwise terms. Also, while [100, 42] is the only work we are aware of that considers more than two positive examples at a time, each of these positive samples is again considered only paired up with a negative sample, leading to ${\\binom{k}{2}}$ pairings with $k$ positive examples. Sums of pairwise terms do not allow for the consideration of higher order relationships, e.g., a given pair might be measured differently in the context of a third sample. In addition to addressing the two aforementioned problems, DSPNs and our GPC-style loss addresses this issue as well, although our learning goal in this paper is learning submodularity not in representation learning (the latter of which we leave to future work).

Common to these applications is the fundamental approach of embedding each element within a set into dense embeddings, followed by permutationinvariant aggregation (set-to-vector transformation), and subsequent integration into a deep neural network [110, 38, 83]. The significance of incorporating interaction among set elements has been emphasized by [55], who argue that conventional aggregations, such as average-pooling, can be interpreted as a specialized form of attention. Consequently, they propose an attention-based architecture known as the set-transformer. Building upon this, [67] have made computational enhancements to the attention-based architecture. Lastly, there has been a recent exploration into a probabilistic interpretation of set-to-vector transformations [113, 46], further refining the methodology. ", "page_idx": 17}, {"type": "text", "text": "The works mentioned above diverge from our approach for several reasons. Firstly, they primarily focus on supervised learning oracles utilizing static datasets to learn neural parameters, whereas our method draws inspiration from max-margin contrastive learning and employs a dynamically updated dataset. Secondly, these existing works lack architectural and/or optimization constraints ensuring the submodularity of the learned set function, in contrast to our work on learning deep submodular functions, where submodularity is explicitly guaranteed. However, for a comprehensive evaluation against existing literature, we include Deep Sets and Set-Transformer as a baseline for comparison. Thirdly, the set sizes used in these works are much smaller (30 in many experiments) ", "page_idx": 17}, {"type": "text", "text": "compared to ours which go up to 500. Lastly, the learned set function in these works lacks a clear interpretation associated with extremal\u2014sets that (locally) maximize or minimize the set function. In contrast, our Deep Submodular Function (DSF) yields heterogeneous/homogeneous sets upon maximization/minimization. It is noteworthy that the choice of a submodular function as the inductive bias may not be essential for certain tasks, such as point-cloud classification and amortized clustering of mixture models. However, it proves to be a plausible inductive bias in scenarios where the objective is to count unique characters [110, 113, 46, 55], since it can be exactly be expressed as a partition matroid rank function, which lies in the family of deep submodular function. ", "page_idx": 18}, {"type": "text", "text": "Beyond neural approaches, one of the previous works [66] has also considered learning Determinantal Point Process, or DPPs [50], by learning the $O(n^{2})$ similarity matrix by noise contrastive estimation [35].

[31] examined the approximation of an oracle for every subset, utilizing a multiplicative approximation approach to approximate the submodular polyhedron of the oracle using L\u00f6wner ellipsoids. In contrast, [5, 6] focused on approximating the oracle with high probability on sets sampled from specific distributions (often referred to as Probably Mostly Approximately Correct (PMAC) learning) by transforming the problem into the identification of linear separators. Notably, [6] demonstrated the impracticality of approximating any arbitrary monotone non-decreasing submodular function to arbitrary closeness under PMAC learning in polynomial queries.

The expressivity improvement of DSPNs over DSFs means that it is now an open theoretical problem if DSPNs can represent all polymatroid functions or not.

More recently, [51] learns \u201cadditively contributive\" (AC) features with an autoencoder by restricting all weights in the initial layer of the decoder to the positive orthant.

The top 10 images selected by any of the DSPN features appear very homogeneous and are strongly correlated to class, while images with the lowest feature values (typically with feature value 0) are practically indistinguishable from a random subset of images. In other words, a high value indicates the presence of some attribute while a low value indicates its absence. When we perform a similar qualitative analysis upon CLIP features, we find that both the high valued sets and low valued sets have some weak correlation to class. CLIP features cannot be interpreted in the same way as DSPN because each feature corresponds to a coordinate in some higher dimensional space.
