Each robot and task necessitates its own data collection and training, making the process expensive and prone to overfitting. This paper tackles this challenge by proposing a new approach that leverages the power of pre-training on a vast and diverse set of robotic data. \nThe proposed solution, Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers (HPT), employs a modular architecture. It consists of embodiment-specific \"stems\" which process sensor inputs from different robots, a shared \"trunk\" to learn a task-agnostic representation, and task-specific \"heads\" to map into control actions.  HPT leverages both simulated and real-world data, showcasing excellent results on multiple benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate the improved performance and generalization capabilities of HPT, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable robotic systems.
