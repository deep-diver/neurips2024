Given a barely fractional strategy $x(\\cdot)$ , we define a $k$ - collective algorithm for which the population distribution will always match $\\pmb{x}(t)\\in\\mathcal{P}_{k}(\\mathcal{X})$ . The result then follows from the equivalence between collective and barely random algorithms discussed in the introduction. We initially distribute the $k$ agents following ${\\pmb x}(0)$ . Now, we assume as our induction hypothesis that the team at time $t-1$ is distributed exactly following ${\\pmb x}(t-1)$ and we show that we can deterministically redistribute the members of the team to follow ${\\mathbf{}}x(t)$ , while paying a moment cost of $\\operatorname{OT}(\\mathbf{x}(t-1),\\mathbf{x}(t))$ .

We use this coupling to reassign the agents deterministically to their new destination (we assume that agents have arbitrary identifiers and the ability to communicate, in order to break the possible ties). Clearly, since the coupling is optimal, the average movement cost in the collective strategy will equal the transport cost of the fractional strategy, and since the population distribution of the agents is consistent with the barely fractional configuration, the service costs are equal.

A straightforward illustration of the fractional variant of metrical task systems is in asset management. Consider an investor distributing its stakes on several assets via $\\pmb{x}(\\dot{t})\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{X})$ where $\\mathcal{X}$ is a set of financial products such as stocks.The distance between two products is defined by the transaction cost associated to exchanging a unit value between two product (i.e. the liquidity of the products varies). The service cost corresponds to the cost of holding a poorly performing asset. The movement cost is a variable cost which is proportional to the mass that is exchanged at any round. Another type of cost that could naturally arise is a fixed transaction cost that the player should pay for converting any amount of stock $\\rho$ into stock $\\rho^{\\prime}$ . We propose to set this cost equal to $\\tau d(\\rho,\\rho^{\\prime})$ for some real constant $\\tau>0$ . In this setting, it becomes relevant for the player to perform transactions only if they involve a fractional mass greater than $\\tau$ . A direct consequence of our results (Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 2.2) is that adding fixed transaction cost $\\tau$ to the fractional variant of metrical task systems has little effect on its competitive ratio, provided that $\\tau\\leq1/n^{2}$ .

We recall the definition of the game. The game starts with $n$ balls each located in one of $n$ urns. In discrete rounds, an adversary picks an urn which contains a ball and the player has to move one ball in that urn to any other urn. The game ends when all urns have been chosen at least once by the adversary, and the cost of the player is the number of rounds before the end of the game, re-normalized by $1/n$ . The simple strategy for the player that consists in relocating selected balls to the least loaded urn is known to induce a cost of at most $\\ln(n)+3\\leq H_{n}+3$ . Observe that this game models exactly the movement cost a corresponding $n$ -barely fractional strategy in a given phase (where each ball represents a probability mass of $1/n$ and each urn represents a point of the uniform metric space).

For instance, one can study the competitiveness of collective algorithms under: restricted communications (such as the write-read model of [34] or the local model of [27]), synchronous movements (as discussed in [23]), capacity constraints (where the amount of agents at a position is limited [6, 25]) or even with agents having some degree of selfishness or maliciousness (then involving a price of anarchy [39] for selfish agents, or some degree of robustness to byzantine faults [40] for malicious agents).
