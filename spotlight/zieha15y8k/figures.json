Three instances of the rumor's propagation on X are listed, which imply different attack styles and sequences: (1) User A, who has a notable number of followers, posted the rumor and gained considerable attention. The attack sequence involved purchasing followers and posting the rumor. (2) User B, with a large number of followers, retweeted the rumor originally posted by User A. This extends the last sequence to constitute a sequence of purchasing followers, posting, and retweeting. (3) User C, with almost no followers, copied the content posted by User A and published it again, forming a one-step attack sequence. Repeated similar attacks can be seen as a sequence.", "description": "This figure showcases three different attack scenarios on a social media platform (X, formerly Twitter). Each scenario shows how a rumor spreads through different methods and with varying degrees of success, highlighting the diverse attack styles and sequences used by malicious actors to manipulate information spread.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ziehA15y8k/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The framework of our proposal.

The attack stage shows multiple attackers generating various attack trajectories on a social network graph. The reconstruction stage uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model and maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (EntIRL) to learn the attack policy from the observed trajectories, leveraging precise sample guidance and a bidirectional update mechanism to improve accuracy.  The defense stage utilizes the reconstructed attack policy to generate additional adversarial samples, which are then used for data augmentation and adversarial training of a targeted model, enhancing its robustness against attacks. The top-right corner shows an example of an attack trajectory involving subgraph selection and node manipulation.  The figure provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed methodology for improving the robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs) in social media analysis.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "ziehA15y8k/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The framework of our proposal.

This stage incorporates precise sample guidance and a bidirectional update mechanism to improve the accuracy and efficiency of policy reconstruction.
