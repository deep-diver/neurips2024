In the first example, as the text prompts contain multiple objects, the agent chooses the LMD tool for generation. However, there are still some errors in the image. The agent first attempts to use the attribute editing tool to change the leftmost sheep to white, but it fails. The agent further attempts to modify the color using the replace tool, but after replacement, the size of the sheep becomes too small and not very noticeable. The agent then chooses to remove the black sheep and then adds a white sheep, successfully achieving the same effect as editing color. Finally, the agent uses the object addition tool to add a goat on the right side, ensuring that the image accurately matches the text prompt in the end. In the second example, due to the lack of clarity of the hair in the BoxDiff generated image, the editing tools cannot edit so that the hair correctly matches the description of \"long black hair\". Therefore, the agent invokes another generation tool to guarantee the final image is correct. Some image editing examples are also provided in Fig. 5.

However, due to the lack of fine resolution ability in existing editing tools, the generated blue cup\u2019s size is inaccurate. In addition, as shown in the second case, errors in the output of localization tools can also affect the final result.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenArtist well addresses complex problems in image generation and editing, and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Its ability in a wide range of generation tasks also validates its unified capacity.

Through the use of multiple generation and editing tools, our method also achieves greater control, such as representing more objects and more complex relationships between objects in customization generation. These visualization examples strongly illustrate the necessity of employing an agent for image generation and demonstrate that our approach effectively accomplishes the goal of unified image generation and editing.

Finally, we present our step-by-step visualized results in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. For image generation, our method initially utilizes the most suitable tool to generate the initial image. If the image quality is too low or cannot be corrected after some modification operations, additional tools are invoked to continue generation. Further, for parts of the image that do not meet the text requirements, editing tools are continuously called to make modifications until the image correctly matches the text. For image editing, our method effectively decomposes the input problem and iteratively utilizes different tools to make step-by-step modifications until the image is correctly edited. This visualization clearly demonstrates the process, from decomposition and planning tree with step-by-step verification, to the final tool execution.
