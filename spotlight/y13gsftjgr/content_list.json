This reduces scaling law experiments to only the model scaling axis, effectively dividing the number of necessary training runs by one order of magnitude.

The cosine decay was originally introduced by Loshchilov & Hutter (2016) for cyclic schedules in vision tasks, where it is common practice to have stepwise or cyclic LRs to escape bad minima when training multiple epochs (Smith et al., 2017). For language models where data is more vast, the cosine schedule with a single cycle is currently the de-facto standard for training, with few exceptions of T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and PaLM1 (Chowdhery et al., 2023) that used a form of inverse square root. In line with our work, recently released models opt for alternatives such as stepwise schedules (Bi et al., 2024) or the presented constant $^+$ cooldown (Shen et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024). These alternatives were previously also explored for vision transformers by Zhai et al. (2022), who find reciprocal square-root with cooldown to perform best, and in the context of continual learning (Ibrahim et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2023). Defazio et al.

Importantly, Sandler et al. (2023) show the equivalence of WA with decaying learning rate schedules. In the context of LLM training, close to our work is Sanyal et al.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
