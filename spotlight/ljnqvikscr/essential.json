Existing methods assume the availability of arbitrary building blocks, limiting their practicality. This necessitates more sophisticated algorithms that can effectively navigate the search space while adhering to these constraints.  This research addresses these limitations.\n\nThe proposed solution, Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP), leverages a bidirectional graph search that interleaves expansions from both the target molecule and the goal starting materials.  This ensures constraint satisfaction and improved efficiency. DESP incorporates a goal-conditioned cost network to guide the search, further enhancing its performance.  Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate DESP's superiority over existing approaches, especially in constrained scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field of CASP.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "LJNqVIKSCr/podcast.wav"}
