The training phase involves multiple input-output function pairs ((u\u1d62, f\u1d62)).  These pairs are processed through a kernel map (the attention mechanism) to extract a global understanding of the underlying physical laws, creating a 'kernel space of identifiability'.  This knowledge is then used to construct a kernel (mechanism) K which acts as a nonlocal interaction operator that maps input function 'utest' to output function 'ftest'. The downstream application utilizes this learned kernel for prediction on new, unseen data.", "section": "3 Nonlocal Attention Operator"}, {"figure_path": "uSKzEaj9zJ/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Results on radial kernel learning, when learning the test kernel from a small (d = 30) number of data pairs: test on an ID task (left), and test on an OOD task (right).", "description": "This figure displays the results of learning radial kernels with a small number of data pairs (d=30).
