A vast number of MARL algorithms have been proposed for iterative strategy adjustment while playing a game. The most widely studied class of algorithms of this type involve each player running a no-regret algorithm on its own stream of rewards. The celebrated fictitious play algorithm [9] and its descendants are special cases of this class. Although the convergence behavior of fictitious play and its variants has been studied extensively, convergence results are typically available only for games exhibiting special structural properties amenable to analysis [25, 29, 4, 45, 46]. Indeed, the convergence properties of fictitious play are intimately connected to those of best response dynamics, a full information dynamical system evolving in continuous time where the evolution rule for player $i$ \u2019s strategy is governed by its best response multi-function. By harnessing such connections, convergence results for fictitious play and a number of other MARL algorithms have been obtained by analyzing the dynamical systems induced by specific update rules [5, 28, 49].

In the case of deterministic strategy updates, [22] studied strategic dynamics in continuous time and showed that if the strategy update functions, analogous to $f^{i}$ above, satisfy regularity conditions as well as a desirable property called uncoupledness, by which $f^{i}$ cannot depend on the reward functions of $i$ \u2019s counterplayers, then the resulting dynamics are not Nash convergent in general. These results were recently generalized by [38]. Additional possibility and impossibility results were presented by [2], who studied strategic dynamics in a different setting, where players do not observe counterplayer strategies. Under stochastic strategic dynamics, a number of positive results were obtained by incorporating exogenous randomness into one\u2019s strategy update, along with finite recall of recent play [23, 19, 20]. In the regret testing algorithm of [19], players revise their strategies according to whether or not their most recent strategy met a satisfaction criterion: if $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}^{i}$ performed within $\\epsilon$ of the optimal performance against $\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{-i}$ , player $i$ continues using it and picks $x_{t+1}^{i}=x_{t}^{i}$ .

Theorem 1 shows that for any starting strategy profile, some such path connects the strategy proflie to an equilibrium, and so a sufficiently exploratory strategy update may drive play to equilibrium along a satisficing path. This offers important insights for the design of MARL algorithms. The first takeaway from Theorem 1 is that play can be driven to equilibrium by changing only the strategies of those players who are not best responding. In particular, this means that a satisfied agent does not need to continue updating its strategy after it becomes satisfied. As we will discuss in the next section, this property is helpful in distributed and decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents are able to assess whether they are satisfied but may not be able to assess whether the overall system is at equilibrium.

As we outline below, this construction runs against the conventional approaches to designing MARL algorithms, and it can be used to avoid common pitfalls of MARL algorithms such as cyclical behavior.

While such algorithms are sensible from the point of view of a single self-interested individual, they may fail to drive play to a Nash equilibrium when all players adopt similar algorithms [36, 18, 37]. To address this non-convergence issue, one recurring algorithmic modification involves manipulating step sizes, either with a mixture of fast agents and slow agents [13] or with each individual varying its step sizes according to its performance [8]. However, such approaches only come with provable convergence guarantees in select subclasses of games with exploitable structure. In instances where step size manipulation does not (or cannot) yield convergence, the analysis of Theorem 1 may offer an alternative route to algorithm modification.

A second principle, which we believe to be new, leverages the second takeaway above, involving counterintuitive path construction: players may alternate between reward-improving periods (during which strategy updates are done in a conventional way that improves the agent\u2019s reward) and suboptimal periods (during which reward-deteriorating and/or random strategy updates may be used). The timing of such periods or the extent of the randomness in strategic updates may be made to depend on whether cycles in the strategy iterates were detected. By incorporating suboptimal exploration in an adaptive manner, a MARL algorithm can break cycles as needed but rely on conventional algorithms the remainder of the time.
