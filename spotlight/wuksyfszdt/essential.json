Existing algorithms like DANE, while communication-efficient, suffer from suboptimal local computation. Accelerated methods, while achieving better local computation,  often come with communication complexity dependencies on the number of clients, making them unsuitable for large-scale settings.\nThis paper addresses these issues by proposing S-DANE and ACC-S-DANE, novel algorithms based on stabilized proximal-point methods.  These algorithms achieve the best-known communication complexity among non-accelerated methods while maintaining efficient local computation.  Furthermore, they support partial client participation and arbitrary local solvers, enhancing their practical applicability.  Adaptive versions are also developed, removing the need to know any system parameters beforehand.", "affiliation": "Saarland University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "WukSyFSzDt/podcast.wav"}
