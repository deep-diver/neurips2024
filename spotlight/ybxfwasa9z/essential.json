These issues limit RL's performance and application.  Existing solutions often rely on manual adjustments, limiting adaptability and scalability.\nThis paper introduces OPEN, an algorithm that meta-learns an update rule that addresses these three challenges.  OPEN uses a flexible parameterization informed by existing techniques to boost exploration and handle non-stationarity and plasticity loss. Experiments show that OPEN matches or surpasses the performance of standard optimizers, particularly demonstrating strong generalization across various environments and agent structures.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "YbxFwaSA9Z/podcast.wav"}
