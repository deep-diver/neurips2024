The algorithm of [DGT19] adaptively partitions the space into polyhedral regions and uses a different linear classifier in each region, each achieving error $\\eta+\\epsilon$ within the corresponding region. Their approach leverages the LeakyReLU loss (see (1)) as a convex proxy to the 0-1 loss. At a high-level, their approach reweights the samples in order to accurately classify a non-trivial fraction of points. [CKMY20] uses the LeakyReLU loss to efficiently identify a region where the value of the loss conditioned on this region is sub-optimal; they then use this procedure as a separation oracle along with online convex optimization (see also [DKTZ20b, $\\mathrm{DKK}^{+}\\bar{21}]$ ) to output a linear classifier with 0-1 error at most $\\eta+\\epsilon$ . Both of these approaches inherently require $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^{3})$ samples for the following reason: they both need to condition on a region where the probability mass of the distribution can be as small as $\\Theta(\\epsilon)$ . Thus, even estimating the error of the loss would require at least $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^{2})$ conditional samples. Beyond the dependence on $1/\\epsilon$ , the sample complexity achieved in these prior works is also suboptimal in the margin parameter $\\gamma$ ; namely, $\\Omega(1/\\gamma^{4})$ . This dependence follows from the facts that both of these works require estimating the loss in each iteration within error of at most $\\gamma\\epsilon$ , and that their algorithmic approaches require $\\bar{\\Omega}(1/\\gamma^{2})$ iterations.

At a high-level, we design a uniform approach to decrease the \u201cglobal\u201d error, as opposed to the local error (as was done in prior work). Specifically, we construct a different sequence of convex loss functions, each of which attempts to accurately simulate the 0-1 objective. We note that a similar sequence of loss functions was used in the recent work [DKTZ24] in a related, but significantly different, adversarial online setting. Interestingly, a similar reweighting scheme was used in [CKMY20] for learning general Massart halfspaces. Beyond this similarity, these works have no implications for the sample complexity of our problem. (See Appendix A.2 for a detailed comparison.) Via this approach, we obtain an iterative algorithm which uses only ${\\cal O}_{\\gamma}(1/\\epsilon^{2})$ samples in order to estimate the loss in each iterative step.

Unfortunately, it is possible that no optimal vector $\\mathbf{w}^{*}$ (under 0-1 loss) minimizes $\\ell(\\mathbf{w}^{*},\\mathbf{w})$ . For this reason, we consider the objective $\\ell_{\\eta}(\\mathbf{w},\\mathbf{u})=\\mathbf{E}[(\\mathbb{1}\\{y\\neq\\mathrm{sign}(\\mathbf{w}\\cdot\\mathbf{x})\\}-\\eta-\\epsilon)|\\mathbf{w}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}|/|\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}|]$ .

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
