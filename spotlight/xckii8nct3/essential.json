Previous research lacked explicit constructions of PQCs and non-asymptotic error bounds, particularly for multivariate functions, hindering practical applications. Many existing universal approximation theorems rely on classical data processing, obscuring the quantum advantage.\nThis paper addresses these limitations by explicitly constructing data re-uploading PQCs for approximating multivariate polynomials and smooth functions.  The researchers establish the first non-asymptotic approximation error bounds, demonstrating that for smooth functions, PQCs can be more efficient than classical deep neural networks.  Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, providing a much-needed theoretical foundation for designing practical PQCs for near-term quantum devices and advancing quantum machine learning.", "affiliation": "Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XCkII8nCt3/podcast.wav"}
