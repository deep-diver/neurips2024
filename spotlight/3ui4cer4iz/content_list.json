This indicates that our proposed ScanNetV2-INS poses more challenges in identifying fine-grained objects and yields fairer metrics.

Moreover, for high-resolution point clouds with vivid light and shade effects, the superpoints generated based on geometric and texture is not enough yet. One approach is to design a more sophisticated pre-segmentation model with semantic awareness. Besides, though constraints provided by 3D prior are introduced, the affinity matrix based on 2D masking still relies heavily on the accuracy of 2D foundation segmentators.

The key idea is to incorporate more 3D priors into the 2D foundation model guided pipeline and leverage not only knowledge transferred from 2D space but also features in 3D space. We first generate complementary 3D superpoint primitives based on both geometric and textural priors to reduce the initial errors that accumulate in subsequent procedures. Then we introduce supplemental constraints from the 3D space by using a 3D detector. Along with the constructed affinity matrix by using 2D masks, the region growing and refinement process is performed on the 3D primitives. Furthermore, we propose ScanNetV2-INS with complete ground truth labels and supplement additional instances for 3D class-agnostic instance segmentation, which produces unbiased metrics on comparing different methods. Experimental evaluations on ScanNetV2, ScanNetV2-INS, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We believe that we pioneer at exploiting the importance of 3D priors in the 2D foundation model guided pipeline, and it should draw attention toward future research that methods trying to extend 2D foundation models into 3D space should not overlook the role of inherent 3D priors.
