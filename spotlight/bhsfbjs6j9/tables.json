The Wasserstein distance is a measure of the dissimilarity between probability distributions, reflecting how well each model captures the multimodality inherent in human perception of ambiguous shapes. Lower values indicate better performance in capturing the multiple possible interpretations.", "section": "4 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "bhSfbjS6j9/tables/tables_17_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Shape from shading benchmark quantitative results. Errors are measured by median angular error of normals maps.

The models are evaluated based on the median angular error of their normal field predictions.  The error is calculated as the angle between the predicted normal and the ground truth normal at each pixel. The results are averaged across the top 5 predictions from 50 independent model runs for the diffusion-based models, reflecting the inherent stochasticity of these approaches.", "section": "4.3 Real Images"}, {"figure_path": "bhSfbjS6j9/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Multiscale optimization schedule", "description": "This table presents the multiscale optimization schedule used in the paper's experiments. It details the resolution, guidance rate, lighting guidance application, noise injection and resume sampling (N&R) starting timestep, and runtime for both perception stimuli and captured photo experiments.  The schedule involves a sequence of resolutions, with parameters adjusted for each resolution to improve the optimization process and balance speed and quality. The use of V-cycle, noise injection, and guidance are explained in the paper.", "section": "A.10 Multiscale schedule specification"}]
