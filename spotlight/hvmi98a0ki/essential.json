This paper tackles the challenge of optimizing Jacobian computation for exact results while minimizing computational cost, a known NP-hard problem. Current methods such as forward and reverse-mode AD, or minimal Markowitz degree, offer only limited efficiency gains. \nThe proposed AlphaGrad approach addresses this by framing Jacobian computation as a game played by a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent, called VertexGame.  This agent learns to find the optimal vertex elimination order in a computational graph, reducing the number of necessary multiplications.  The approach is validated on diverse tasks, demonstrating significant improvements (up to 33%) over existing methods.  Furthermore, a new AD interpreter in JAX, called Graphax, is developed to execute the obtained optimal orders, translating theoretical gains into actual runtime improvements.", "affiliation": "Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich & RWTH Aachen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hVmi98a0ki/podcast.wav"}
