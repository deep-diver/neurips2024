{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers studying economics, game theory, and online learning.  It **bridges the gap between theoretical economic models and practical online settings**, offering a novel approach to address externalities under uncertainty. This work **opens new avenues** for developing efficient mechanisms in various applications involving strategic interactions and incomplete information.", "summary": "Economists learn to resolve externalities efficiently even when players lack perfect information, maximizing social welfare by leveraging bargaining and online learning.", "takeaways": ["The classical Coase theorem holds under uncertainty, provided players can negotiate and compensate for externalities.", "A novel policy enables efficient bargaining in online settings by allowing players to learn their preferences and make strategic transfers.", "The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional economic models by accounting for uncertainty and incomplete information."], "tldr": "Externalities, indirect effects impacting global welfare from economic interactions, pose a significant challenge in economics.  Most models assume perfect knowledge among players, hindering practical implementation. This paper tackles this by extending the Coase Theorem, which suggests property rights and bargaining can optimize social welfare in the presence of externalities, to online settings where players lack complete information.\nThe researchers employ a two-player multi-armed bandit framework to model economic interactions, where player actions influence others' rewards. They demonstrate that without property rights, social welfare suffers.  To address this, they devise a policy for players to learn bargaining strategies and maximize total welfare. This strategy involves transfers that incentivize actions that benefit overall social welfare, thus extending Coase's Theorem under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. The solution demonstrates a sub-linear social welfare regret, indicating efficiency.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "omyzrkacme/podcast.wav"}
