Optimal Transport (OT) barycenters offer a mathematically grounded solution, but computing them, especially in the continuous setting, remains challenging.  Existing continuous OT barycenter solvers often suffer from limitations such as restricting to specific cost functions or requiring non-trivial a priori selections, hindering their applicability to real-world scenarios.  This paper addresses these challenges. \nThis work introduces a novel algorithm to approximate continuous EOT barycenters for arbitrary OT cost functions.  It leverages the dual reformulation of the EOT problem and connects seamlessly with Energy-Based Models (EBMs).  The method provides quality bounds, avoids complex optimization tricks, and is validated on low-dimensional and image-space setups, including non-Euclidean costs.  The authors also demonstrate learning the barycenter on an image manifold generated by a pretrained GAN, showcasing its practical use and suggesting new directions for real-world applications.  **The method's versatility and strong theoretical foundation make it a significant contribution to the field.**", "affiliation": "Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "JZHFRLoqDq/podcast.wav"}
