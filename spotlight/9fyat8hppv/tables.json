It shows the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for various methods under different spike thresholds (Vth = 1, 2, 4). The \"Spike\" column indicates whether the method uses spike information. The \"Params\" column shows the number of parameters for each method.  The results highlight the performance of different deblurring approaches using both conventional and spike-based methods, showing the impact of spike data availability on reconstruction quality.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "9FYat8HPpv/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performance comparison between the SAN in GEM [39] and our designed LDN.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the performance of the Scale-aware Network (SAN) used in the GEM model [39] and the Lightweight Deblurring Network (LDN) proposed by the authors.  The comparison focuses on the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), the number of parameters (Params), and the number of floating-point operations (Flops) for both networks.  The results show that the authors' LDN achieves higher PSNR and SSIM scores with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs, demonstrating its superior efficiency.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "9FYat8HPpv/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison of the sequence reconstruction task on the GOPRO dataset.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for sequence reconstruction on the GOPRO dataset.  It compares various methods (LEVS, Motion-ETR, BiT, TRMD+DASR, RED+DASR, REFID+DASR, SpkDeblurNet, and the proposed S-SDM) across three different spike thresholds (Vth=1, Vth=2, Vth=4).  For each method and threshold, the table provides the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and the number of parameters (Params) used.
