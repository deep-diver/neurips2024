Early attempts failed to produce high-fidelity videos due to imprecise semantic reconstruction and insufficient low-level visual detailing.  The existing state-of-the-art model, MinD-Video, although showing promise, still lacks the ability to capture low-level details. \nNeuroClips addresses these challenges by employing a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity videos by integrating a semantics reconstructor (for keyframes) and a perception reconstructor (for low-level details). The keyframes provide semantic accuracy, while the perception flows ensure smoothness.  NeuroClips significantly improves video reconstruction quality in various metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing both high-level semantics and low-level visual details, achieving smoother and more consistent video reconstruction.  Furthermore, it pioneers the use of multi-fMRI fusion to reconstruct longer video sequences.", "affiliation": "Tongji University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "8qu52Fl1Dt/podcast.wav"}
