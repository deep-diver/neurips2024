However, existing methods often struggle with inaccurate geometry and appearance distortions during deformation.  Many methods also assume elastic materials which limits their generalizability. \n\nThe GIC framework overcomes these challenges by combining the strengths of 3D Gaussian representation for accurate geometry and a continuum simulation for capturing dynamic behavior. By incorporating 2D shape guidance from rendered object masks, GIC improves estimation accuracy and robustness, outperforming previous approaches across several benchmarks. This work significantly advances research into visual system identification with its practical and accurate approach.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "SSCtCq2MH2/podcast.wav"}
