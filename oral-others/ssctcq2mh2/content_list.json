Another problem of previous methods lies in that many methods [8\u201310] require the ground-truth full knowledge of object geometry for the identification, which limits their practicality. Some subsequent methods [5, 4] turn to recover the geometries and physical properties from observations in a decoupled manner. Specifically, these methods first extract object geometries by making use of stereo observations or dynamic neural reconstruction [11] from RGB video sequences, and then perform simulation directly on the point clouds or after the tetrahedral mesh conversion.

Reconstructing dynamic scenes from monocular or multi-view video(s) is a long-standing problem in the computer vision community [19, 20]. Previous works exploit neural implicit representation [21, 22] for non-rigid reconstruction. These methods either reconstruct the scene in a frame-wise manner [23, 24] or maintain a canonical shape and model the deformation with a neural network [25, 26, 11, 27]. While effective for novel view synthesis, these methods often require extensive training time and can result in noisy deformations owing to the implicit representation, which may compromise the utility of the recovered geometries for physical property estimation [12]. Recent progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique [15] stands out to be a prevalent method for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis because of the abilities of explicit shape modeling and extremely fast view rendering. Similar to non-rigid NeRF, many follow-up works extend the 3DGS into 4D by treating each frame separately [28] or decomposing a scene into a canonical 3D Gaussian point cloud and a deformation model that warps the canonical shape into a specific scene [16, 29, 30]. In this paper, we draw upon these prior studies [16, 29] and propose a novel motion-factorized dynamic 3D Gaussian network to achieve better performance on reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

However, unveiling these properties from visual information is an extremely difficult task due to the ambiguity introduced by incomplete observation and the high degrees of freedom of the scene. Early works [39, 40] study the problem by learning physical properties via interactions. With recent improvements in differentiable physics simulation [17, 18, 41\u201345], many methods turn to evaluate the physical properties by comparing the rendering results with 2D ground truth given the prior knowledge about the object geometry. VEO [5] presents a differentiable simulator to learn patterns from 4D reconstruction and force-displacement measurements. Another approach [4] eliminates the dependence of captured forces by proposing an iteration framework between deformation tracking and parameter optimization. While these methods demonstrate promising results, the inferior reconstruction might lead to degraded performance, and the assumption of elastic material restricts the applicability. PAC-NeRF [12] instead proposes a single framework to recover both the unknown geometry and physical properties of deformable objects from multi-view video sequences. However, the inferior geometries and blurry rendered images might have detrimental effects on physical property reasoning. In this work, we adopt MPM as our simulation framework following the approach used in PAC-NeRF due to its ability to simulate a variety of materials [6, 46\u201348].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
