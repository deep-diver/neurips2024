Existing policy representations like feedforward networks, energy-based models, and diffusion models also have limitations in high-dimensional settings.  This paper addresses these shortcomings.\n\nThe researchers introduce DiffTORI, which uses differentiable trajectory optimization to generate actions. This allows for direct optimization of the task performance through the trajectory optimization process, eliminating objective mismatch.
