Unsupervised environment design (UED) aims to address this by automatically generating diverse training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities. However, existing UED methods suffer from limitations in environment generation diversity and sample efficiency. \nThis paper introduces ADD (Adversarial Environment Design via Regret-Guided Diffusion Models), a novel UED algorithm that uses diffusion models to directly generate environments. **ADD guides the environment generation process using the agent's regret**, enabling it to produce challenging but effective environments.  **ADD combines strengths of prior learning-based and replay-based methods, improving the training and generalization ability of agents.** Experimental results demonstrate that ADD significantly outperforms existing UED baselines in several challenging tasks, producing more effective and diverse training environments.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "eezCLKwx6T/podcast.wav"}
