Context-based OMRL (COMRL) focuses on learning a universal policy conditioned on task representations, but existing methods struggle with generalization when the testing environment differs from the training data (context shift). Several methods have tried to improve generalization, but their approaches seemed disconnected.\nThis work proposes a unified information-theoretic framework called UNICORN, showing that existing COMRL algorithms essentially optimize the mutual information between task representations and their latent representations.  This insight provides design flexibility for developing novel algorithms.  UNICORN introduces a supervised and self-supervised implementation, demonstrating superior generalization across multiple RL benchmarks and context shift scenarios, offering a new perspective for understanding task representation learning in reinforcement learning.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QFUsZvw9mx/podcast.wav"}
