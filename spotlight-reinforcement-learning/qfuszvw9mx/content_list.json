In this work, by examining several key milestones in the field of COMRL, we propose to integrate these seemingly independent methodologies into a unified framework. Most importantly, we show that the pre-existing COMRL algorithms are essentially optimizing the same mutual information objective between the task variable $_M$ and its latent representation $Z$ by implementing various approximate bounds. Such theoretical insight offers ample design freedom for novel algorithms. As demonstrations, we propose a supervised and a self-supervised implementation of $I(Z;M)$ , and empirically show that the corresponding optimization algorithms exhibit remarkable generalization across a broad spectrum of RL benchmarks, context shift scenarios, data qualities and deep learning architectures.

In pursuit of this high level of artificial intelligence (AI), the paradigm of meta-reinforcement learning (RL) proposes to train AI agents in a trial-and-error manner by interacting with multiple external environments. In order to quickly adapt to the unknown, the agents need to integrate prior knowledge with minimal experience (namely the context) collected from the new tasks or environments, without over-ftiting to the new data. This meta-RL mechanism has been adopted in many applications such as games [1, 2], robotics [3, 4] and drug discovery [5].

As a remedy, offline RL [10] enables agents to learn from logged experience only, therefore circumventing risky or costly online interactions. Recently, offilne meta-RL (OMRL) [11\u201313] has emerged as a novel paradigm to significantly extend the applicable range of RL by \"killing two birds in one stone\": it builds powerful agents that can quickly learn and adapt by meta-learning, while leveraging offline RL mechanism to ensure a safe and efficient optimization procedure. In the context of classical supervised or self-supervised learning, which is de facto offilne, OMRL is reminiscent of the multi-task learning [14], meta-training [6] and fine-tuning [15\u201317] of pre-trained large models.

To this end, one of the earliest COMRL algorithms FOCAL [11] proposes to capture the structure of task representations by distance metric learning.

To alleviate the problem, follow-up works such as CORRO [23] reformulates the task representation learning of COMRL as maximizing the mutual information $I(Z;M)$ between the task variable $_M$ and its latent $Z$ . It then approximates $I(Z;M)$ by an InfoNCE [24] contrastive loss, where the positive and negative pairs are conditioned on the state-action tuples $(s,a)$ .

Our theory offers valuable insight on how these methods are inherently connected and incrementally evolved in pursuit of better generalization against context shift. Based on the proposed framework, we instantiate two novel algorithms called UNICORN-SUP and UNICORNSS which are demonstrated to be remarkably robust and broadly applicable through extensive experiments. We believe our study offers potential for new implementations, optimality bounds and algorithms for both fully-offline and offline-to-online COMRL paradigms. Mathematically, we expect our framework to be able to incorporate almost all existing COMRL methods that focus on task representation learning. Since according to Definition 2.1, as long as the method tries to solve COMRL by learning a sufficient statistic of w.r.t , it will eventually come down to optimizing an information-theoretic objective equivalent to $I(\\boldsymbol{Z},M)$ , or a lower/upper bound like the ones introduced by Theorem 2.3, up to some regularizations or constraints.

Our offilne datasets cover at most 40 tasks and $\\sim450k$ transitions, which might be the reason why UNICORN-SUP is inferior to UNICORN-SS $\\ n_{M}$ too small in Theorem 2.4). However, we expect our conclusion to extrapolate to larger task sets, dataset sizes and model parameters, for which the DT variants may demonstrate better scaling. Lastly, in principle, the information theoretic formalization in this work should be directly applicable to online RL. However, many of our key derivations rely on the static assumption of $_M$ and $\\mathbf{\\deltaX}$ (see Appendix B), which are apparently violated in the online scenario.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
