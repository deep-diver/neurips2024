{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with delayed observations.  **It introduces a novel framework, VDPO, that significantly improves sample efficiency without sacrificing performance**, a critical challenge in this domain. This work **opens new avenues for applying RL to real-world scenarios** where delays are prevalent, such as robotics and control systems.", "summary": "VDPO: A novel framework for delayed reinforcement learning achieving 50% sample efficiency improvement without compromising performance.", "takeaways": ["VDPO reformulates delayed RL as a variational inference problem, improving sample efficiency.", "VDPO uses a two-step iterative optimization: TD learning in a delay-free environment followed by behaviour cloning.", "Empirical results show VDPO achieves comparable performance to SOTA methods with significantly reduced sample complexity."], "tldr": "Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with delayed observations, commonly addressed by state augmentation. However, this leads to increased state space dimensionality, hindering learning efficiency. Existing solutions using Temporal Difference (TD) learning still face this challenge. \n\nVariational Delayed Policy Optimization (VDPO) offers a novel approach by framing delayed RL as a variational inference problem.  It tackles the issue through a two-step iterative process: first, TD learning on a delay-free smaller state space environment to create a reference policy.  Second, behaviour cloning efficiently imitates this policy in the delayed environment.  **VDPO demonstrates superior sample efficiency (approximately 50% less samples) compared to state-of-the-art methods in MuJoCo benchmark tasks without compromising performance.**", "affiliation": "University of Southampton", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "DAtNDZHbqj/podcast.wav"}
