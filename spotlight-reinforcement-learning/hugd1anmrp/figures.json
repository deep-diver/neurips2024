Interactive Fano method lower bounds for the regret of any algorithm ALG.", "description": "This figure presents the interactive Fano method which extends Fano's inequality to interactive decision-making problems. It recovers classical lower bounds (Assouad, Fano, Le Cam) as special cases and integrates them with DEC-based lower bounds for interactive decision-making.  The core idea is to generalize the separation condition in Fano's inequality to an algorithm-dependent condition, leveraging a 'ghost' data generation from a reference distribution to quantify the separation between model distributions. The key result is a unified framework for characterizing learnability for any structured bandit problem using a new complexity measure: the decision dimension.", "section": "3 A General Lower Bound"}]
