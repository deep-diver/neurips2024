Subfigure (a) shows the errors of PR-averaged iterates and RR-extrapolated iterates, all generated using Markovian data. Different stepsizes (\u03b1 = 0.8, 0.4, 0.2) are used for both PR and RR methods. The plot shows that RR extrapolation significantly reduces the bias compared to PR averaging. Subfigure (b) compares the errors under Markovian data (xt+1 ~ P(\u00b7|xt)) and i.i.d. data (xt ~ \u03c0) with the same stepsizes. The plot indicates that Markovian data does not necessarily result in a larger bias than i.i.d. data, highlighting the complex interplay between nonlinearity and Markovian structures.", "section": "5 Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "XUL75cvHL5/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Experiment results to verify the Central Limit Theorem.", "description": "This figure contains two subfigures, (a) and (b). Subfigure (a) is a histogram of the centered and scaled PR-averaged iterates from the experiment, overlaid with a fitted normal density curve. The close alignment indicates that the empirical distribution closely follows the normal distribution. Subfigure (b) is a QQ plot that compares the empirical distribution of the PR-averaged iterates from the L2-regularized logistic regression experiment with the theoretical normal distribution. The linearity of the points along the 45-degree reference line indicates that the empirical distribution closely follows the normal distribution.  These plots verify the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the averaged iterates from the experiment.", "section": "4 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "XUL75cvHL5/figures/figures_16_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experiment results to illustrate the properties of asymptotic bias.", "description": "This figure contains two subfigures.
