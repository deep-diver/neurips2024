This is unrealistic for real-world scenarios like robotics, where resetting is difficult or impossible.  This necessitates nonepisodic RL algorithms that learn from a single, continuous interaction. However, existing methods often lack theoretical guarantees, especially for nonlinear systems, making it hard to analyze their performance and improve them.\n\nThis paper addresses this issue by introducing NEORL, a novel nonepisodic RL algorithm.  **NEORL uses a principle called \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\"**, making it capable of efficient exploration in unknown environments.  Importantly, the paper **provides a theoretical guarantee (regret bound) for NEORL's performance in general nonlinear systems**.  Extensive experiments show that NEORL significantly outperforms other methods, achieving optimal average cost while exhibiting sublinear regret, proving its effectiveness in deep RL benchmarks.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZWNdgc13aw/podcast.wav"}
