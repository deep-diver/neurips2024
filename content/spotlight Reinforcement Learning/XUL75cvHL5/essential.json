Existing analyses of SA often simplify by assuming either independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data or linear update rules. However, real-world data often exhibits dependencies (Markovian data) and algorithms frequently employ nonlinear update rules, making these assumptions unrealistic.  The interaction between Markovian dependence and nonlinearity presents significant analytical challenges not captured by prior techniques, leading to obstacles in establishing weak convergence and characterizing the asymptotic bias of SA algorithms. \nThis paper tackles these challenges head-on. By carefully examining the simultaneous presence of Markovian data and nonlinear update rules, the authors develop a fine-grained analysis leveraging smoothness and recurrence properties of SA updates. This allows them to derive, for the first time, the weak convergence of the joint process of Markovian data and SA iterates. The asymptotic bias is precisely characterized, revealing a previously unknown multiplicative interaction between the Markovian noise and nonlinearity.  Moreover, the paper provides finite-time bounds on higher moments and establishes a central limit theorem, offering valuable tools for both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XUL75cvHL5/podcast.wav"}
