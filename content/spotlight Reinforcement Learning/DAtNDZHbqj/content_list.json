However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL techniques with Temporal-Difference (TD) learning frameworks often suffer from learning inefficiency, due to the significant expansion of the augmented state space with the delay. To improve learning efficiency without sacrificing performance, this work introduces a novel framework called Variational Delayed Policy Optimization (VDPO), which reformulates delayed RL as a variational inference problem. This problem is further modelled as a two-step iterative optimization problem, where the first step is TD learning in the delay-free environment with a small state space, and the second step is behaviour cloning which can be addressed much more efficiently than TD learning. We not only provide a theoretical analysis of VDPO in terms of sample complexity and performance, but also empirically demonstrate that VDPO can achieve consistent performance with SOTA methods, with a significant enhancement of sample efficiency (approximately $50\\%$ less amount of samples) in the MuJoCo benchmark.

Most of these achievements lack stringent timing constraints, and, therefore, overlook delays in agent-environment interaction. However, delays are prevalent in many real-world applications stemming from various sensors, computation, etc, and significantly affect learning efficiency [17], performance [6], and safety [26]. While observation-delay, action-delay, and reward-delay [10] are all crucial, observation-delay receives the most attention [7, 33, 42]. Unlike reward-delay, observation-delay, which is proved to be a superset of action-delay [19, 29], disrupts the Markovian property inherent to the environments. In this work, we focus on the reinforcement learning with a constant observation-delay $\\Delta$ : at any time step $t$ , the agent can only observe the state $s_{t-\\Delta}$ , without access to states from $t-\\Delta+1$ to $t$ . ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Augmentation-based approach is one of the promising methodologies [4, 19].

However, the underlying sample complexity issue remains a central challenge. Pioneering works [5, 29] directly conduct classical temporal-difference (TD) learning methods, e.g., Deep Q Network [28] and Soft ActorCritic [13], over the delayed MDP. However, due to the significant growth of the dimensionality, the sample complexity of these techniques increases tremendously. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods [20, 39, 42] mitigate this issue by introducing an auxiliary delayed task with shorter delays to help learning the original longer delayed task (e.g., improving the long-delayed policy based on the short-delayed value function). However, sample inefficiency is not addressed sufficiently due to the TD learning paradigm still being affected significantly by the increased delays. The memory-less approach [33] improves the learning efficiency by ignoring the absence of the Markovian property of observation-delay RL and learning over the original state space with a cost of serious performance drop. Therefore, the critical challenge still remains: how to improve learning efficiency without compromising performance in the delayed setting.

Specifically, VDPO operates alternatively: (1) learning a reference policy over the delay-free MDP via TD learning and (2) imitating the behaviour of the learned reference policy over the delayed MDP via behaviour cloning. In the high dimensional delayed MDP, VDPO replaces the TD learning paradigm with the behaviour cloning paradigm, which considerably reduces the sample complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VDPO not only effectively improves the sample complexity, but also achieves consistent theoretical performance with SOTAs.

Existing delayed RL techniques conduct learning over either original state space (referred to as direct approach) or augmented state space (referred to as augmentationbased approach). Direct approaches enjoy high learning efficiency by learning in the original small state space. However, early approaches simply ignore the absence of Markovian property caused by delay and directly conduct classical RL techniques based on delayed observations, which distinctly suffer from serious performance drops. The subsequential improvement is to train based on unobserved instant observations, which are predicted by various generative models, e.g., deterministic generative models [38], Gaussian distributions [7], and transformers [24]. However, the inherent approximation errors in these learned models introduce prediction inaccuracy and result in suboptimal performance issues [24]. To summarize, direct approaches achieve high learning efficiency, but commonly with a cost of performance degeneration. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "The augmentation-based approach is notably more promising as it retrieves Markovian property via augmenting the state with the actions related to delays and thus legitimately enables RL techniques over the yielded delayed MDP [4, 19]. However, the augmentation-based approach works in a significantly larger state space, which is thus plagued by the curse of dimensionality, resulting in learning inefficiency. To mitigate this issue, DC/AC [5] leverages the multi-step off-policy technique to develop a partial trajectory resampling operator to accelerate the learning process. Based on the dataset aggregation technique, DIDA [23] generalizes the pre-trained delay-free policy into an augmented policy. Recent attempts [20, 39] evaluate the augmented policy by a non-augmented Qfunction for improving learning efficiency. ADRL [42] suggests introducing an auxiliary delayed task with changeable auxiliary delays for the trade-off between the learning efficiency and performance degeneration in the stochastic MDP.

VDPO redefines the delayed RL problem into a two-step iterative optimization problem. It alternates between (1) maximizing the performance of the reference policy by temporal-difference learning in the delay-free setting and (2) minimizing the KL divergence between the reference and delayed policies by behaviour cloning.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
