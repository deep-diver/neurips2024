Bottom: (left) Execution times of ECOLog and RS-GLinCB for different values of \u03ba (low \u03ba = 9.3 and high \u03ba = 141.6) for Logistic rewards. (right) Execution times of GLOC and RS-GLinCB for different values of \u03ba (low \u03ba = 17.6 and high \u03ba = 202.3) Probit rewards.", "description": "The figure compares the performance of RS-GLinUCB with other algorithms (ECOLog, GLOC, GLM-UCB) in terms of cumulative regret and execution time. The top panels show the cumulative regret for Logistic and Probit reward models, while the bottom panels show the execution time for different values of kappa (a measure of non-linearity).  RS-GLinUCB demonstrates lower regret and comparable or better execution times.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
