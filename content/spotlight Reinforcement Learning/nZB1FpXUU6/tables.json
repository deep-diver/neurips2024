The values were largely based on previous work (Cobbe et al., 2020) for the easy mode of Procgen, with some minor adjustments.  The hyperparameters control various aspects of the training process, such as the number of timesteps per rollout, the number of epochs, the learning rate, the use of an LSTM, and reward normalization.", "section": "A Experiment Details"}, {"figure_path": "nZB1FpXUU6/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Descriptions of the contexts used in our experiments.", "description": "This table details the various environment parameters used in the Procgen games and their corresponding values.  It provides context for understanding how different parameters impact game difficulty and the learning process. For each game, the table lists the parameter, its description, and the range of values used. The games include bossfight, climber, coinrun, dodgeball, fruitbot, heist, leaper, maze, and ninja.  Each game has multiple parameters that jointly define a context, and the various values of these parameters were used in the experiments described in the paper.", "section": "A Experiment Details"}]
