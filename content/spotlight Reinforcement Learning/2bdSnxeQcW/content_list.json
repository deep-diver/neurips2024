Traditionally, online RL develops advanced decision-making strategies through continuous interaction with environments [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. However, in real-world scenarios, interacting with the environment can be costly, particularly in high-risk environments like disaster situations, where obtaining sufficient data for learning is challenging [7, 8]. In such setups, the need for exploration [9, 10, 11, 12] to discover optimal strategies often incurs additional costs, as agents must try various actions, some of which may be inefficient or risky [13, 14]. This highlights the significance of research on offilne setups, where policies are learned using pre-collected data without any direct interaction with the environment [15, 16]. In offline setups, policy actions not present in the data may introduce extrapolation errors, disrupting accurate value estimation by causing a large overestimation error in the value function, known as the distributional shift problem [17]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address the distributional shift problem, Fujimoto et al. [17] proposes batch-constrained $Q$ -learning (BCQ), assuming that policy actions are selected from the dataset only. Ensuring optimal convergence of both the policy and value function under batch-constrained RL setups [17], BCQ demonstrates stable learning in offilne setups and outperforms behavior cloning (BC) techniques [18], which simply mimic actions from the dataset. However, the policy constraint of BCQ strongly limits the policy space, prompting further research to find improved policies by relaxing constraints based on the support of the policy using metrics like maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [19] or Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence [20]. While these methods moderately relax policy restrictions, the issue of limited policies persists. Thus, instead of constraining the policy space directly, alternative offline RL methods have been proposed to reduce overestimation bias based on penalized $Q$ -functions [21, 22]. Conservative $Q$ -learning (CQL) [21], a representative offilne RL algorithm using $Q$ -penalty, penalizes the $Q$ -function for policy actions and provides a bonus to the $Q$ -function for actions in the dataset. Consequently, CQL selects more actions from the dataset, effectively reducing overestimation errors without policy constraints.

EPQ imposes a threshold-based penalty on the value function exclusively for states causing estimation errors to mitigate overestimation bias without introducing unnecessary bias in offline learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively reduces both overestimation bias due to distributional shift and underestimation bias due to the penalty, allowing a more accurate evaluation of the current policy compared to the existing methods.
