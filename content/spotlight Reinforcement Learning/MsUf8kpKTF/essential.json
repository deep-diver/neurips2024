This is especially challenging in on-policy RL, where the model learns directly from its own interactions, limiting the flexibility to adapt to changing environments.  The existing approaches developed for other RL settings (supervised learning, off-policy RL) fail to address this problem effectively in on-policy deep RL.\nThis research systematically investigates plasticity loss in the on-policy deep RL setting using various methods. They show that plasticity loss is significant in this setting, even with carefully designed distribution shifts in training data. Most of the existing interventions are not effective, highlighting the need for specific on-policy solutions. This study provides several criteria for mitigating plasticity loss.   They introduce \"regenerative\" methods that address plasticity loss consistently across several different environments and types of distribution shifts in the training data. These methods prove more effective than existing approaches, showcasing their potential for building more robust and adaptable AI agents.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MsUf8kpKTF/podcast.wav"}
