### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Decision Transformers (DTs) are a promising paradigm in offline reinforcement learning, but their online finetuning remains under-explored. Existing methods like Online Decision Transformer (ODT) struggle with low-reward offline data. This paper theoretically analyzes the limitations of ODT's online finetuning process, attributing the issues to the use of Return-To-Go (RTG) far from the expected return.

The paper proposes a novel method that integrates TD3 gradients into the ODT's online finetuning process. This simple yet effective approach significantly enhances ODT's performance, particularly when pretrained on low-reward data. Experiments across multiple environments confirm the effectiveness of adding TD3 gradients, demonstrating improvements in online performance compared to the baseline ODT and other offline RL algorithms.

> This figure illustrates the core idea of the paper.  On the left, it shows how the Online Decision Transformer (ODT) struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. The ODT's policy gradient (∂RTG/∂a) is in the opposite direction needed for improvement in this scenario. The unreachable target RTG makes it difficult to recover.  The right side of the figure demonstrates the proposed solution which adds reinforcement learning (RL) gradients (TD3). This allows for local policy improvements by providing the needed ∂RTG/∂a for improvement, leading to better overall performance.

### In-depth insights


#### ODT's Online Tuning
ODT's online tuning, a crucial aspect of its performance, focuses on adapting the pre-trained model to new, online data.  The core idea is to continue the supervised learning paradigm used in offline training, iteratively updating the model with newly collected trajectories. However, **a critical limitation emerges when the offline data used for pre-training is of low reward quality**. This leads to difficulties in effective online finetuning since the initial policy struggles to improve upon suboptimal trajectories.  **A proposed solution involves adding reinforcement learning gradients** from algorithms like TD3 to the online fine-tuning process. This addition helps steer the policy towards local improvements that are otherwise missed by solely relying on the supervised learning signal. This approach is particularly effective when overcoming the limitations associated with low-reward offline data pre-training, **demonstrating an improvement in online performance**.  Further investigation is needed to explore the reasons behind these observed improvements and analyze the overall efficacy of the combined approach.  Future research could focus on resolving the limitations of the theoretical analysis presented in this method, potentially via relaxation of assumptions for a wider applicability and robust generalization.

#### RL Gradient Boost
The concept of "RL Gradient Boost" in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) suggests enhancing the training process by incorporating gradients derived from standard RL algorithms.  This approach directly addresses the limitations of solely relying on supervised learning methods for fine-tuning decision transformers, particularly when dealing with low-reward offline datasets. **By integrating RL gradients, the method aims to refine the policy by leveraging both supervised and reinforcement learning signals.** This combined approach likely leads to more robust and efficient online fine-tuning, overcoming the challenge of suboptimal trajectories often encountered in traditional offline-to-online RL paradigms. The boost is particularly significant when the model is pretrained on low-reward data, indicating that **the RL gradients serve as a corrective mechanism**, steering the policy towards better performance in online scenarios.  This approach represents a **novel integration of supervised and RL methods**, potentially offering a substantial improvement over purely supervised techniques in online RL tasks with decision transformers.

#### Theoretical Analysis
A theoretical analysis section in a reinforcement learning research paper would ideally delve into the mathematical underpinnings of the proposed methods.  It might start by formally defining the problem within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework.  **Key aspects** like the state and action spaces, reward functions, and transition probabilities would be explicitly stated, along with assumptions made for tractability. The core of the analysis would then focus on deriving key properties of the proposed algorithm, potentially proving its convergence, optimality, or sample complexity under certain conditions. For instance, a proof of convergence might demonstrate that the algorithm's parameters converge to an optimal policy over time. Another key aspect may be to mathematically characterize the relationship between the model's performance and the characteristics of the training data, such as the quality or quantity of data available.  **A particularly insightful theoretical analysis** might identify potential limitations of the proposed algorithm. This could involve proving bounds on its performance, highlighting scenarios where it might fail to achieve optimal solutions, or demonstrating its sensitivity to specific hyperparameters or data distributions.  The analysis may use tools from probability theory, statistics, optimization, and information theory to prove the claims made. Finally, the analysis may offer novel insights or theoretical connections to existing work in reinforcement learning, placing the presented methods within a broader context and demonstrating their novelty and significance.

#### Empirical Findings
An Empirical Findings section in a research paper would present results from experiments or observations designed to test the hypotheses.  It should begin with a clear and concise summary of the main findings, highlighting any statistically significant results.  **Visualizations such as graphs and tables are crucial for effectively presenting complex data**, enhancing understanding and supporting claims.  The discussion should explicitly address whether the results support or refute the initial hypotheses.  **A detailed analysis of potential confounding variables and limitations** of the methodology is necessary to ensure the reliability and validity of the conclusions.  Crucially, any unexpected or surprising results should be noted and potential explanations offered.  This section's strength lies in its clarity, depth of analysis, and **transparency regarding limitations and potential biases**.  The findings should be directly connected to the paper's broader contributions, clearly showing how they advance the field of study.

#### Future Work
The paper's "Future Work" section presents exciting avenues for expanding upon the core findings.  **Addressing the limitations** of the theoretical analysis, specifically relaxing assumptions made about reward distributions and incorporating more realistic noise models, is crucial for broader applicability.  Exploring alternative RL gradient methods beyond TD3, potentially incorporating algorithms better suited to high-dimensional action spaces, or examining hybrid approaches that combine different RL techniques, could yield significant performance improvements. **Investigating the impact of different architectural choices** for both the decision transformer and the critic network, including exploring more advanced transformer architectures or value function approximators, is also warranted.  Finally, a thorough exploration of different training paradigms beyond the supervised learning framework employed here could unlock new capabilities, especially in handling out-of-distribution data in real-world settings.

> This figure illustrates the limitations of Online Decision Transformers (ODT) when pretrained with low-reward offline data.  ODT, using a supervised learning approach, struggles to improve because the gradient it produces (∂RTG/∂a) points in the opposite direction needed for local policy improvement (∂RTG/∂a). The figure shows how the target return-to-go (RTG) is far from the actual return, leading to poor performance. The solution proposed in the paper is to add reinforcement learning (RL) gradients (like those from TD3) to provide the necessary local improvement signal and thus improve the policy.

It highlights how the Lipschitz condition, implying a bounded rate of change in the density function, constrains the cumulative probability. The shaded area represents a region of probability mass, and the figure uses this to visually illustrate how a bound on the rate of change in pβ(RTG|s) translates to a bound on the cumulative probability. The exclusion of the left-hand shaded area signifies that the probability mass in that region is not being considered because it could be truncated by Vβ(s).

> This figure illustrates the core idea of the paper.  Online Decision Transformers (ODT) struggle when pretrained with low-reward data because the gradient of the return-to-go (RTG) with respect to the action, produced by the transformer, points in the opposite direction needed for improvement.  Adding reinforcement learning (RL) gradients, such as those from TD3, provides a local improvement signal which addresses this limitation and leads to better online finetuning performance.

It shows how the Online Decision Transformer (ODT) fails to improve when pretrained with low-reward offline data, highlighting the contrast between the gradient provided by the decision transformer (∂RTG/∂a) and what is needed for local policy improvement (∂RTG/∂a). The figure suggests that by adding RL gradients, the agent can improve locally and achieve better performance. The left panel shows how ODT struggles with an unreachable target RTG (Returns-To-Go), while the right panel illustrates that incorporating TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) gradients enables local improvement by using a Q-function.

Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) struggle to improve when pretrained with low-reward data because the gradient they produce (∂RTG/∂a) works against the direction needed for local policy improvement (∂RTG/∂a).  Adding RL gradients (such as TD3) allows the agent to improve locally, even if the target RTG is far from the pretrained policy and out of distribution, leading to better overall performance.

The figure demonstrates that while increasing T_train initially improves the speed of convergence, excessively long context lengths (T_train) lead to instability and fluctuations in the learning process.

The figure also shows the learned critic function for the RL algorithms correctly approximate the reward function, while the ODT policy fails to identify a high-reward region, showcasing the benefit of incorporating RL gradients for online finetuning.

However, excessively long T_train values result in training instability and performance fluctuations. The optimal T_train value appears to be a balance between capturing sufficient context for accurate decision-making and preventing instability.

The results demonstrate that only using the proposed method's architecture with TD3+BC leads to improved performance, although still below the full method.

Four methods were compared: ODT (baseline), TD3+BC, TD3+RvS (both using the original TD3+BC architecture), and TD3+BC using the transformer architecture from the proposed method.  The results across four Adroit environments highlight that only the combination of TD3+BC with the transformer architecture shows some improvement, demonstrating the importance of the chosen architecture in achieving better performance than the baseline ODT.  However, even this modified TD3+BC architecture did not achieve the same results as the proposed method (TD3+ODT), further emphasizing the synergistic effect of combining both the RL gradient and the transformer.
