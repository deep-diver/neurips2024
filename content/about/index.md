# Welcome to AI Paper Reviewer!

AI Paper Reviewer is a unique platform dedicated to providing insightful reviews and summaries of artificial intelligence research papers. The content is entirely generated by advanced AI systems, offering a novel approach to understanding and disseminating complex scientific literature.

## Mission

The mission is to make cutting-edge AI research more accessible to a wider audience. By leveraging the power of AI, we aim to:

1. Summarize complex research papers in clear, concise language
2. Highlight key findings and their potential implications
3. Provide context and connections to related work in the field
4. Foster a deeper understanding of AI advancements among researchers, students, and enthusiasts

## How It Works

All the pipeline is implemented in [this repo](https://github.com/deep-diver/paper-reviewer), but briefly:

1. Scanning the latest AI research papers collected from [Hugging Face Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers).
2. Extracting visual information (figures, charts, tables) from the papers.
3. Generating descriptive text for the visual information.
4. Generating summaries and reviews of the papers.

This project leverages the following tech stack:
- [Upstage's Document Parse](https://www.upstage.ai/products/document-parse): Extracting visual information from the papers.
- [Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/): Extracting visual information from the papers if Document Parse is not available.
- [Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/): Generating summaries and reviews of the papers.
- [Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/): Double checking if visual information is correctly extracted.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): Static site generator.
- [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish): Theme for Hugo.

## Disclaimer

While we strive for accuracy and clarity, please note that all content on this site is AI-generated. We encourage readers to refer to the original papers for the most authoritative information.

We hope you find AI Paper Reviewer a valuable resource in your AI learning journey!
