(a) shows how traffic volume patterns evolve with urban expansion and the establishment of new POIs.  The introduction of a new commercial center changes the traffic patterns observed at two specific points, highlighting the dynamic nature of urban spatiotemporal systems. (b) shows a model cold-start issue when a new task (accident prediction) is introduced. Existing models trained on single tasks, like traffic volume and speed prediction, are not able to easily generalize to this new task, emphasizing the need for a continuous multi-task learning framework.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "tnh4LK72yj/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Framework overview of CMuST.", "description": "This figure provides a comprehensive overview of the Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST). It illustrates the data flow and processing steps involved in the framework.  The framework consists of three main components: Data Representation and Integration, Multi-dimensional Spatio-Temporal Interaction, and Rolling Adaptation. The Data Representation and Integration component takes in all samples of spatio-temporal series, performing data representation and integration to obtain a comprehensive representation H.  This is then fed into the Multi-dimensional Spatio-Temporal Interaction component, which uses a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to capture interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions and incorporates task prompts. The resulting representation is then processed by the Rolling Adaptation component, which uses a task summarization scheme, weight behavior modeling, and task-specific refinement to enable continuous multi-task learning and refine the model for each task.  The figure highlights the key steps and modules within each component, providing a visual representation of the CMuST framework's workflow.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "tnh4LK72yj/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Ablation studies of CMuST on Chicago.", "description": "This figure presents the results of ablation studies conducted on the Chicago dataset to evaluate the impact of different components within the CMuST framework.  Specifically, it compares the performance (measured by MAE and MAPE) of the full CMuST model against three variants: one without context-data interaction, one without the consistency maintainer (which helps maintain consistency in learning across tasks), and one without task-specific preservation.
