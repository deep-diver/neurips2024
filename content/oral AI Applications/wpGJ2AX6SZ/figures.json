Panel (a) shows a partition of data points into three subsets (S1, S2, S3) where a hyperplane classifier cannot effectively separate positive and negative examples within each subset. Panel (b) presents another example with a different partition, highlighting that there are multiple ways to create such partitions.  The key takeaway is that within each subset, there's not enough signal for a hyperplane classifier to distinguish between the positive and negative outcomes, which is the defining characteristic of an approximately multicalibrated partition.", "section": "3 Methodology and preliminaries"}, {"figure_path": "wpGJ2AX6SZ/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The relative performance of radiologists and predictive algorithms for detecting atelectasis.
