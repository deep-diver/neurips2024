### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional A* search algorithms can struggle in complex problems with less accurate heuristic functions. They often get trapped in local optima and fail to find the optimal solution efficiently.  This paper addresses this limitation by incorporating exploration into the A* search via selective sampling, enhancing the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and explore other promising branches. 

The paper proposes SeeA*, an algorithm that uses selective sampling to create a dynamic subset of nodes awaiting expansion, enabling exploration beyond the node with the best heuristic value. Three different sampling strategies are presented, and a theoretical analysis proves SeeA*'s superior efficiency over A* when the heuristic is less accurate. Experiments on retrosynthetic planning, logic synthesis, and Sokoban demonstrate SeeA*'s efficiency improvements and superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

> This figure illustrates how SeeA* addresses the limitations of the A* search algorithm, particularly when dealing with inaccurate heuristic estimations. Subfigure (a) shows an optimal search path using the exact cost function f*(n). Subfigure (b) shows that A* search might get trapped in a suboptimal branch due to inaccurate cost estimations provided by f(n). Subfigures (c) and (d) demonstrates that SeeA* avoids this by selectively sampling nodes and expanding the node with the best heuristic value within this sample.  SeeA* may choose a node different from the best node in the entire open set (O), which enables exploration of other promising branches.

> This table presents a comparison of different algorithms for retrosynthetic planning on the USPTO benchmark dataset.  The algorithms compared include Retro*, Retro*+, MCTS, A*, WA*, LevinTS, PHS, Œµ-Greedy, and the three variants of the SeeA* algorithm (Uniform, Cluster, UCT). For each algorithm, the table shows the success rate (percentage of molecules for which a solution was found), the average length of the solutions found, the average number of nodes expanded during the search, and the average computation time in seconds. The results demonstrate that the SeeA* algorithm, particularly the Cluster and UCT variants, outperforms the other algorithms in terms of success rate and solution length while maintaining a relatively low computation time.





### In-depth insights


#### SeeA*: Algorithm
The proposed SeeA* algorithm enhances the A* search algorithm by incorporating a selective sampling process.  Instead of expanding the node with the minimum f-value from the entire open set, SeeA* samples a subset of open nodes and expands the best node from this subset. This strategy allows SeeA* to explore more promising branches, particularly when the heuristic function is inaccurate, which is a common issue in many applications.  **Three sampling techniques (uniform, clustering, and UCT-like) are introduced to manage the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.**  The paper presents a theoretical analysis showing SeeA*'s superiority over A*, especially when heuristic accuracy is low, and experimental results on retrosynthetic planning, logic synthesis, and Sokoban demonstrate SeeA*'s efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.  The core innovation lies in its ability to dynamically adapt the search, striking a balance between focused expansion (exploitation) and broader exploration of the search space, leading to better solution quality and efficiency.

#### Sampling Strategies
The effectiveness of SeeA* hinges significantly on its sampling strategies, which determine the subset of open nodes considered for expansion.  **Three strategies are explored**: uniform sampling, which offers unbiased selection but might overlook promising branches; clustering sampling, which aims to balance exploration and exploitation by sampling from diverse node clusters; and a UCT-like strategy, inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, which incorporates both exploitation (nodes with low estimated costs) and exploration (nodes at shallower depths).  The theoretical analysis and experimental results strongly suggest that the choice of sampling strategy significantly impacts SeeA*'s performance, particularly when heuristic accuracy is limited.  **A key insight** is that, while uniform sampling provides a simple baseline, the more sophisticated approaches (clustering and UCT-like) demonstrably enhance the search efficiency and solution quality in challenging real-world problems.  This highlights the **importance of tailoring sampling strategies** to the problem domain and heuristic quality, making the choice of sampling strategy a crucial design parameter of SeeA*.

#### Theoretical Analysis
A theoretical analysis section in a research paper would ideally delve into a rigorous mathematical framework to support the claims made.  It would likely involve defining clear assumptions about the problem domain, such as the nature of the heuristic function's error distribution. **Formal proofs** would then be presented to demonstrate the algorithm's superiority, possibly by comparing its performance metrics (e.g., number of node expansions) to existing algorithms under specified conditions. For instance, it might prove that under certain assumptions about prediction errors, the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms traditional methods.  **Key theorems and corollaries** should provide intermediate steps and support the main conclusions. The analysis should not only focus on efficiency but also consider other important factors, such as optimality guarantees and the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. A comprehensive theoretical study would strengthen the paper's contribution significantly by providing a solid mathematical foundation for the empirical findings.  **Limitations of the theoretical framework** should also be clearly acknowledged, along with a discussion of their potential impact on the conclusions.

#### Experiment Results
The "Experiment Results" section of a research paper is crucial for validating the claims and demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.  A strong results section should present findings clearly and concisely, ideally using visualizations like graphs and tables to aid understanding.  **Statistical significance** should be rigorously addressed, clarifying whether observed improvements are meaningful or due to chance.  **Comparison with baselines or state-of-the-art methods** is necessary to showcase the novelty and impact of the work. A thoughtful discussion interpreting the results, acknowledging limitations, and providing potential explanations for unexpected findings adds further weight.  **Reproducibility** is paramount; sufficient details about the experimental setup, data, and methodology should be provided to allow others to replicate the experiments.  **A robust experimental design** with adequate sample size and appropriate controls further strengthens the credibility of the results.  Therefore, a well-structured and thorough "Experiment Results" section is critical for convincing readers of the paper's contributions and impact.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on SeeA* could explore **more sophisticated sampling strategies** to further enhance the balance between exploration and exploitation.  Investigating **adaptive sampling methods** that dynamically adjust the sampling rate based on the characteristics of the search space would be valuable.  Additionally, **theoretical analysis** could be extended to cover a broader range of heuristic function error distributions, moving beyond the uniform distribution used in this paper.  Exploring the application of SeeA* to other challenging problem domains, such as **large-scale planning and combinatorial optimization problems**, would provide further validation of its effectiveness.   Finally, a **comprehensive empirical comparison** with a wider array of state-of-the-art heuristic search algorithms across diverse datasets and problem instances would solidify SeeA*'s place and further reveal its advantages.

> This figure compares two different sampling strategies used in the SeeA* algorithm: uniform sampling and clustering sampling.  The uniform sampling strategy randomly selects candidate nodes from the open set, while the clustering sampling strategy first groups the open nodes into clusters and then samples nodes from each cluster. This is done to improve exploration by ensuring nodes from a wider range of potential solutions are selected for consideration in the next expansion step. The figure visually shows how the two strategies differ in selecting the next node for expansion, highlighting that the clustering method promotes more diverse exploration.

> This figure shows the success rate and average solution length for retrosynthetic planning on the USPTO benchmark dataset using the SeeA* algorithm with a uniform sampling strategy.  The x-axis represents the candidate set size (K), which is a hyperparameter controlling the exploration-exploitation balance.  The green line shows the success rate, indicating that the algorithm performs better with moderate K values, not too small and not too large. The orange line shows the average solution length, which also shows a trend of shorter lengths in the same moderate range of K values, suggesting that an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial for efficiency.

The x-axis represents the number of clusters used in the sampling process. The y-axis shows two metrics: success rate (green line) and average solution length (orange dashed line).  The results suggest that a moderate number of clusters leads to the best performance, with both high success rate and short solution lengths.  Too few clusters may not provide sufficient exploration, while too many clusters might introduce excessive noise, reducing performance.

> This figure shows the results of an experiment comparing the average solution length and the number of node expansions required by SeeA* in solving the Sokoban game. The experiment used uniform sampling to select candidate nodes, varying the size (K) of the candidate set. As the size of the candidate set increases, the average solution length decreases and the average number of node expansions increases. The figure demonstrates the trade-off between exploration (larger K) and exploitation (smaller K) in the SeeA* algorithm.

> This figure compares the node expansion probabilities of three search algorithms: A*, Œµ-Greedy, and SeeA*.  It shows how the probability of expanding a node changes based on its heuristic value and the algorithm used.  A* deterministically expands the node with the lowest heuristic value. Œµ-Greedy randomly explores other nodes with a small probability. SeeA*, using a uniform sampling strategy, creates a subset of nodes and expands the one with the lowest heuristic value in the subset. The figure illustrates how SeeA* balances exploitation (favoring the best node) and exploration (considering other nodes).

> This figure illustrates two different sampling strategies used in the SeeA* algorithm to select candidate nodes for expansion.  (a) shows the uniform sampling, where nodes are randomly selected from the open set.  This results in a relatively even distribution of selected nodes across the search space but may miss promising areas. (b) shows the clustering sampling strategy, where the open nodes are first grouped into clusters, and then nodes are sampled from each cluster. This strategy ensures that all clusters are represented in the candidate set, improving the chance of selecting promising nodes, even if they are not the top candidates in the open set overall. The clustering strategy helps to balance exploration (exploring different areas of the search space) and exploitation (focusing on nodes with the best heuristic values).
