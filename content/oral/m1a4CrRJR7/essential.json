However, understanding their generalization ability has been limited. This paper focuses on this important problem by studying systems with a tree structure, involving a fast retriever and a more accurate ranker.  A core issue is the potential for mismatches between the data distributions seen during retrieval and ranking, affecting the overall performance.\nThe researchers address this by using Rademacher complexity to derive generalization error bounds for different model types.  They show that using a tree structure retriever with many branches and harmonizing data distributions across the two stages improves generalization.  These theoretical results are supported by experiments on real-world datasets, confirming the effectiveness of their proposed approaches for improving the generalization capabilities of these widely used recommender systems.", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "m1a4CrRJR7/podcast.wav"}
