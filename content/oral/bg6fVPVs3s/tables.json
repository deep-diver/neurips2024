It compares several methods for image generation, including the baseline EDM2 models, classifier-free guidance (CFG), guidance interval, and the proposed autoguidance method.  The FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and FDDINOV2 scores are reported, which measure the quality and diversity of generated images.  The table details the hyperparameters used for each method, including the guidance weight (w), EMA (exponential moving average) lengths for the main and guiding models (EMAm and EMAg), and the capacity and training time of the guiding model for the autoguidance method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of autoguidance in improving image quality and diversity, especially compared to CFG.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "bg6fVPVs3s/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Results on ImageNet-512 and ImageNet-64.
