They fail to generalize well to new domains or conditions, hindering the development of robust and adaptable urban intelligence systems. This necessitates the need for a more comprehensive approach that can effectively model interdependencies across various dimensions of urban data and adapt continuously to new tasks and domains.\nThe proposed Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) directly addresses these issues. It leverages a novel multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to capture complex relationships within and across various data dimensions, allowing for effective cross-interactions between context and observations. To ensure continuous learning, CMuST employs a Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) that preserves task uniqueness while harnessing correlated patterns.  Extensive evaluations demonstrate CMuST's superiority over existing methods, showcasing its impressive performance in both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Smart Cities"}, "podcast_path": "tnh4LK72yj/podcast.wav"}
