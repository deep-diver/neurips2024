Place cells, which fire when an animal is in a specific location, are key to this process. However, the system's capacity to represent different environments ('contexts') remains unclear, especially considering the variability in place cell firing properties ('remapping'). This paper addresses this gap. The paper utilizes a geometric approach by representing contexts as manifolds within a high-dimensional space of neural activity. By investigating how place cell characteristics and noise affect the distances between these manifolds, it investigates how the hippocampal system's contextual capacity scales with the number of place cells and how it is impacted by factors such as place cell width and noise.  The findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between spatial resolution and contextual capacity, tuned by place cell width and boundary effects. \nThis research demonstrates that the capacity of the hippocampal place cell system for encoding contexts grows exponentially with the number of neurons involved. It also highlights a critical trade-off between the system's ability to encode spatial location with high precision and its ability to represent many different contexts.  Furthermore, it reveals that clustering place cells near the boundaries of environments can substantially increase the system's overall contextual capacity. These findings provide novel insights into the geometrical principles that govern hippocampal coding and have important implications for understanding spatial memory and navigation.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "REIK4SZMJt/podcast.wav"}
