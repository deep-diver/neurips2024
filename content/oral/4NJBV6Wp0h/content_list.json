A similar concern applies to the non-adversarial setting, where similar LLMs are use as both optimizer and reward model, as well: the strength of potential reward hacking is unbounded even if the two LLMs only communicate textually. For example, the optimizer can ignore the feedback provided by the reward model, and instead directly optimize for the shared, unaligned representation of the human-specified objectives.

This requires controlling for generation quality using ground-truth annotation when measuring self-preference.

Although we observe on the correlation of the two properties on the confidence of individual predictions, our control experiments cannot further the causal argument on the example level.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
