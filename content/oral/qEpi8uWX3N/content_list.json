A solution to this has been the development of more selective adaptation techniques, involving modifying only a portion of the parameters or integrating external modules designed for new tasks. Key methodologies in this sphere include LoRA [18], Adaptors [37, 17, 31], and many other variants [25, 24, 9, 14, 53], all part of what can be generally termed as Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT).

The following experiments were executed on a GPU infrastructure consisting of 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs and a CPU powered by an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU clocked at 2.00GHz. Power consumption measurements were recorded using CodeCarbon [34]. Figure 5 shows the results of various fine-tuning approaches for GSM-8K using the LLaMA2-7B model. we can see that HydraLoRA effectively speeds up the training process $1.96\\times$ and reduces $49.6\\%$ energy cost compared to LoRA (rank $=\\!32$ ). While the energy consumption and latency of LoRA-Split exceeds the LoRA (rank $=\\!32$ ). This is for the reason that HydraLoRA jointly considers inherent knowledge modularity and collaboration, which utilizes the \u201cHydra\u201d structure with a shared A matrix and different B matrix. In this way, it only employs rank ${\\it=}16$ training overhead but expands to a performance enhancement of more than rank $=\\!32$ . Overall, this experiment demonstrates the parameter effectiveness of HydraLoRA.

As Figure 8 shown, we conduct a comprehensive and meticulous analysis by fine-tuning the Dolly-15K model on the LLaMA2-7B dataset and subsequently evaluating its performance on the MMLU benchmark to rigorously examine the impact of variations in the intrinsic component, symbolized by the variable $N$ , on the model\u2019s overall performance. Empirically we find that the number N of clusters is not a sensitive parameter for HydraLoRA, with a wide range of reasonable number N of clusters (e.g. 2 to 4) performing decently well in all settings in our experiments. Specifically, the performance loss of $\\Nu=3$ vs. the optimal $\\Nu=4$ is only $0.42\\%$ . Meanwhile, as illustrated in Figure 7, we employ three distinct methods to generate the number of corpus clusters 15-fold, and the results demonstrate that the $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{k}}$ -means [30] yields comparable outcomes with DBSCAN [39]. Therefore, based on this observation, we choose $\\mathbf{k}$ -means because it is simple but effective, more sophisticated hyperparameter search approaches (e.g. DBSCAN, parameter sweep and Bayesian optimization) will be unnecessarily costly. It\u2019s noteworthy that HydraLoRA is adeptly designed to orchestrate its components in a way that it can automatically calibrate and navigate toward the optimal performance configuration across various parameters. This intelligent auto-tuning is achieved through the application of the $\\mathbf{k}$ -means clustering algorithm. This strategic component orchestration not only enhances performance but also ensures a more efficient and effective utilization of resources, underpinning the model\u2019s capability to adapt and perform efficiently in a dynamic computational environment.

This has spurred research on parameterefficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques that reduce memory and storage costs during adaptation. One prominent PEFT approach is adapters [17, 37]. It introduces new, trainable dense layers within the existing model, keeping the original parameters frozen. This concept has proven successful across various domains [35, 42, 43, 56]. Further improvements on adapter compactness involve constructing parameter matrices using Kronecker products of low-rank matrices [31]. Another PEFT strategy directly manipulates activations with learned vectors. This can be achieved through concatenation [29, 25, 24], multiplication $\\mathrm{{JA^{3}}}$ ; [27]), or addition (BitFit; [53]). Prefix-tuning [25] and prompt-tuning [24] are noteworthy examples that fine-tune continuous prompts instead of designing discrete ones [9]. Interestingly, a study suggests that many PEFT methods can be viewed as a form of adapter, providing a unified perspective [14]. Beyond adding new parameters or altering the computational graph, researchers also explore sparse [12, 44, 46] or low-rank updates (LoRA; [18]). ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Multi-LoRA Architecture LoRA has notably garnered increasing interest recently, becoming a standard approach for adapting LLMs such as LLaMA [47, 48] under limited computational resources. Recognizing its potential, researchers have delved deeper, exploring the benefits of employing multiple LoRAs. LoraHub [19] takes this multi-LoRA approach by training several adapters and strategically picking combinations based on the domain during inference. Meanwhile, MultiLoRA [50] focuses on horizontal scaling, aiming to reduce LoRA\u2019s parameter dependence. This involves splitting LoRA modules along the rank dimension and introducing learnable scaling factors for enhanced expressiveness. Addressing scaling challenges from a different angle, the mixture of LoRA concept is further proposed [52]. This mitigates resource consumption when scaling instruction-tuned LLMs. Recognizing the potential for conflict during instruction tuning, LoRAMoE [11] leverages the Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs; [20]) structure to safeguard the pretrained LLM\u2019s knowledge from excessive corruption by instruction data. Similarly, MOELoRA [28] incorporates a MoE framework into LLMs, thereby improving their multitasking capabilities in the medical domain. Shifting the focus to the system perspective, S-LoRA [41] provides a framework for efficiently serving multiple LoRA adapters. Unlike previous methods that relied on choosing LoRA combinations based on their training domains, HydraLoRA breaks free from the dependence on domain knowledge during inference. Additionally, HydraLoRA\u2019s asymmetric structure further enhances parameter efficiency compared to existing symmetric approaches.

In response, we introduce a novel architecture HydraLoRA that features an asymmetric structure with a shared matrix for all samples and distinct matrices for each intrinsic component. This design improves domain adaptation by selectively focusing on distinct components, enhancing both fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of balancing learning capabilities for diverse datasets against the need for a lean model, offering a viable pathway for improving LLMs with minimal parameter growth.
