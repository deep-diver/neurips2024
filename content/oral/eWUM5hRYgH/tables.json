Sample complexity of algorithms for solving policy evaluation (PE) in the l\u221e norm, and distributional policy evaluation (DPE) in the supreme 1-Wasserstein metric.", "description": "This table compares the sample complexity for solving policy evaluation and distributional policy evaluation problems using different algorithms.  The sample complexity is given in terms of the error bound (\u03b5) and the discount factor (\u03b3). Model-based methods typically have lower sample complexity compared to model-free methods. The table shows that our work achieves a near-minimax optimal sample complexity.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
