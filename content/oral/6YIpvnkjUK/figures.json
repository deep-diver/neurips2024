It shows the error rate (y-axis) achieved by each algorithm against the number of samples used (x-axis).  A second plot shows communication complexity (in bits) versus the number of samples used.

The sample complexity plots the error rate against the number of samples used, illustrating that Fed-DVR-Q achieves lower error rates for the same number of samples. The communication complexity plot shows the total bits transmitted against the number of samples, demonstrating that Fed-DVR-Q requires significantly less communication for comparable performance.", "section": "D Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "6YIpvnkjUK/figures/figures_46_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Dependence of sample and communication complexities of Fed-DVR-Q on the number of agents.", "description": "This figure shows how the sample and communication complexities of the Fed-DVR-Q algorithm change with the number of agents involved.  The left panel (a) demonstrates that the sample complexity decreases linearly with the number of agents, indicating a linear speedup. The right panel (b) shows that the communication complexity remains relatively constant regardless of the number of agents.
