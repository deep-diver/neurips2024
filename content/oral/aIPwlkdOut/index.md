### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Interactive preference learning systems traditionally rely on binary choices to infer user preferences. However, this approach has limitations as it does not capture the strength of preferences.  This paper addresses this issue by incorporating human response times as complementary information to choices, acknowledging the inverse relationship between response time and preference strength.  This means quicker responses indicate stronger preferences.

The study introduces a computationally efficient method that combines both choices and response times to estimate user preferences.  This method is theoretically and empirically compared to traditional choice-only methods, demonstrating superior performance, particularly for easy queries (those with strong preferences). This efficient method is then successfully integrated into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification, showing significant performance gains in simulations using real-world datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### Response Time's Role
Response times, often overlooked in preference learning, offer valuable insights into the **strength of user preferences**.  This paper argues that incorporating response times enhances utility estimates, especially for "easy" queries where preferences are strong. The inverse relationship between response time and preference strength (faster responses indicate stronger preferences) provides complementary information to binary choices alone. The authors propose a computationally efficient method to integrate response times with choices for improved preference estimation.  This enhancement leads to more accurate utility function estimations and, importantly, **accelerates preference learning** in interactive systems like recommender systems and assistive robotics, significantly improving efficiency and reducing error in applications requiring quick preference inference.

#### EZ Diffusion Model
The EZ Diffusion Model, a simplified version of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), offers a computationally efficient approach for modeling human decision-making by incorporating both choices and response times.  **Its key advantage lies in its closed-form solutions for choice and response time moments**, which contrasts with the computationally intensive methods often required for DDM parameter estimation.  The model assumes a deterministic drift, reflecting the utility difference between options, and a fixed starting point, facilitating parameter estimation with a linear regression method in a linear utility structure.  **This efficiency is crucial in real-time applications like interactive preference learning systems**, where the model must quickly adapt to incoming human responses.  However, the model's simplicity also introduces limitations.  **Assumptions such as deterministic drift and fixed parameters might not fully capture the variability of human decision-making**. Despite these limitations, its efficiency for transforming binary choice signals into continuous signals makes the EZ Diffusion Model a powerful tool for integrating human response time data in preference learning and bandit algorithms.

#### Bandit Algorithm
The core of this research paper revolves around preference-based bandit algorithms, a type of machine learning designed to learn user preferences through interactive queries.  The algorithm efficiently balances exploration (trying different options) and exploitation (choosing the currently best-known option), aiming to maximize cumulative reward while minimizing the number of queries.  **The key innovation lies in leveraging human response times as additional feedback, supplementing traditional binary choice data.** Response time, it is hypothesized, inversely correlates with preference strength, providing a richer signal than choices alone.  The paper introduces a novel, computationally efficient method for estimating utility functions, incorporating both choice and response time data, which is theoretically compared and empirically validated against conventional choice-only estimators.  **This enhancement drastically accelerates preference learning**, allowing the algorithm to make better arm selection with fewer interactions, especially when dealing with easy queries (strong preferences).  The integration of the proposed estimator into the Generalized Successive Elimination algorithm further streamlines the learning process, enabling faster and more accurate best-arm identification in real-world scenarios.

#### Real-World Datasets
The utilization of real-world datasets is crucial for evaluating the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method.  The paper's selection of three diverse datasets, encompassing different modalities (food choices, snack preferences), enhances the study's robustness.  **Each dataset presents unique characteristics** which allow for a thorough examination of algorithm performance across various scenarios.  **The inclusion of varied sample sizes** further strengthens the analysis, enabling the assessment of scalability and efficiency.  However, a detailed description of data preprocessing steps is essential, as this can significantly influence the results.  **Transparency in data handling is crucial**, especially for ensuring replicability. It is important to note that the paper focuses on the fixed-budget setting, potentially overlooking other crucial aspects of real-world applications. While datasets allow for practical evaluation, a wider range might further validate the findings.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on incorporating human response times in interactive preference learning systems are abundant.  **Improving the robustness of response time handling** is crucial, particularly addressing situations with inconsistent attention or noisy data.  **Developing algorithms that adaptively leverage response times** based on query difficulty would significantly enhance efficiency.  Exploring alternative models beyond the EZ-diffusion model, such as race models or attentional DDM, is necessary to broaden applicability and potentially capture more nuanced aspects of human decision-making.  **Investigating the ethical implications** of utilizing response times for preference learning, such as potential biases related to response speed and privacy concerns, must be carefully addressed.  **Developing robust methods for estimating non-decision time** directly from observed data would remove the dependency on prior assumptions. Finally, **extending this framework to more complex scenarios**, encompassing contextual bandits or reinforcement learning settings, holds significant promise for a variety of real-world applications.
