For all language models, it is possible to discriminate with very high accuracy between the ACS census data and model-generated data, (*) before adjustment and (x) after adjustment. We contrast this against the accuracy value of discriminating between the ACS data of any given U.S. state and the rest of the ACS census data (-).", "description": "This figure displays the accuracy of a discriminator model in distinguishing between human survey responses (from the ACS) and synthetic responses generated by various language models.  The results show that the models' synthetic responses are easily distinguishable from the human responses, even after adjusting for bias, demonstrating a significant difference in data distributions.  The accuracy is compared to a baseline accuracy obtained from distinguishing between the data for individual US states and the remainder of the ACS data.", "section": "F.2 The discriminator test"}]
