The diffusion process of interest often originates from three quantities: a drift term due to a potential field, the interaction with other particles, and a stochastic term. If these three components are known, predictions follow from simple forward sampling [27] or the recent work in optimization in the probability space [1, 3, 11, 25, 34, 38, 41]. In this paper, we consider the case when the diffusion process is unknown, and we seek to learn its representation from observational data. The problem has been addressed when the trajectories of the individual particles are known [5, 32], but it is often the case that we only have \u201cpopulation data\u201d. For instance, single-cell RNA sequencing techniques enabled the collection of large quantities of data on biological systems [35], but the observer cannot access the trajectories of individual cells since measurements are destructive [20, 36]. The most promising avenue to circumvent the lack of particle trajectories is the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme [24] which predicates that the particles as a whole move to decrease an aggregate energy, while not deviating too much from the current configuration. However, the JKO scheme entails an optimization problem in the probability space. Thus, the problem of finding the energy functional that minimizes a prediction error (w.r.t. observational data) takes the form of a computationallychallenging infinite-dimensional bilevel optimization problem, whereby the upper-level problem is the minimization of the prediction error and the lower-level problem is the JKO scheme. Recent work [1, 9] exploits the theory of optimal transport and in particular Brenier\u2019s theorem [7] to attack this bilevel optimization problem, a model henceforth referred to as JKOnet. Despite promising initial results in [9], this complexity undermines scalability, stability, and generality of the model.

Given $\\theta$ , the effects mismatch is the Wasserstein distance between the observed trajectory and the predicted trajectory obtained iteratively solving the JKO step with $J_{\\theta}$ .

Motivated by robustness, interpretability, and generalization, here we seek a method to learn the causes. In [23, 42], the authors try to learn a geometry that explains the observed transport maps.

Differently from [9], we do not need to track the gradients within the Sinkhorn algorithm to compute the back-propagation [13], and we do not need to solve any optimal transport problem during training. If the number of particles per snapshot is very large, one may consider splitting the single snapshot into multiple ones and computing the couplings of the sub-sampled population. For datasets larger than 1000 particles, we compute the couplings in batches of 1000. In our experiments, we solve the optimal transport problem via linear programming using the POT library [18]. In Figure 10, we compare the performances resulting from training JKOnet\u2217to recover the potentials in Appendix F when the couplings are computed with plain linear programming or with Sinkhorn-type algorithms [13] with various degrees of regularization $\\varepsilon$ . In particular, we conclude that, as long as the couplings are close to the correct one, the algorithm used to compute them does not impact the performance of JKOnet\u2217. However, small regularizers slow down the Sinkhorn algorithm and, thus, we prefer to directly solve the linear program without regularization.

Therefore, the dimensionality $d$ of the data impacts the solving time only in relation to the construction of the cost matrix $C$ (in particular, linearly). However, this cost is negligible and dwarfed by the actual solution of the linear program. In particular, the dimensionality does not affect the size of the linear program. Moreover, the optimal plans at different timesteps can be computed in parallel. As a result, only the number of particles (i.e., the size of the dataset) is a scaling bottleneck. In practice, as showcased by the real-world application in Section 4.4, this is often not an issue. For completeness, we report an ablation on the number of particles for the computation times of plain linear programming and Sinkhorn algorithm with different values of the regularizer in Figure 10, using the default configuration in the POT library [18] for linear programming and in the OTT-JAX library [6] for the Sinkhorn algorithm. This analysis suggests that, while the number of particles affects the computational time in an exponential fashion, the computation of optimal transport plans does not pose a problem for reasonably sized datasets. Also, we highlight that this operation is done only once and independently from, e.g., the network architecture. Finally, as discussed above, batching strategies can help reduce the computational cost. Specifically, rather than computing the couplings between $N$ particles, one can compute $\\lceil N/b\\rceil$ couplings between $b$ particles, sampled uniformly from the entire population at each timestep, and then aggregate them.

We further clarify the differences here. In our setting and the one used for JKOnet, we use $60\\%$ of the data at all time steps for training and $40\\%$ for testing. To evaluate performance, we compute the EMD between one-step-ahead predictions and ground truth, averaged over the testing data.

Formally, if $t$ is the time step used for testing, then $\\mu_{t}$ is used for testing and $\\mu_{k},k\\neq t$ is used for training. Note that, in all algorithms, the first and last time steps are always used for training. Since the data includes 5 time steps and one is left out, $80\\%$ of the data is used for training and $20\\%$ for testing (in practice, these numbers are only approximate since the number of particles is not constant over time). In this case, performance is evaluated by computing EMD between the prediction and the ground truth at the time step left out, averaged over the left-out time steps. The differences between the two settings demand some caution in comparing and interpreting the performance of the various algorithms.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
