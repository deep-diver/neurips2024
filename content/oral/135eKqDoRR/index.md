### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Visual reprogramming (VR) is a technique that repurposes pretrained models for new tasks by modifying their input or output interfaces.  However, current methods often rely on simple one-to-one label mappings, which may overlook complex relationships between the original and new labels and thus limit performance. This research identified this issue as a major drawback of current VR methods.



To overcome this limitation, the paper presents the Bayesian-guided Label Mapping (BLM) method.  BLM utilizes a probabilistic mapping matrix to capture the complex relationships between the original and new labels, guided by Bayesian conditional probabilities.  Experiments show that BLM significantly improves VR performance across various datasets and models, offering a more flexible and interpretable approach than existing methods. The success of BLM also offers a probabilistic view of VR, showing its promise in improving the interpretability of VR methods.

> This figure illustrates the limitations of using a one-to-one label mapping in visual reprogramming.  Panel (a) shows that individual images may have multiple strong activations in the pretrained model's output, but only one is used in the mapping. Panel (b) shows that using a greedy one-to-one mapping may lead to suboptimal assignments across the dataset, where the best possible mapping isn't always selected for each downstream label. The examples highlight that one-to-one mappings fail to capture the rich relationships between pretrained and downstream label spaces.

### In-depth insights


#### Bayesian Label Mapping
Bayesian label mapping offers a novel approach to visual reprogramming by moving beyond traditional one-to-one mappings between pretrained and downstream labels.  **It leverages Bayesian conditional probability to construct a probabilistic mapping matrix**, where each element quantifies the relationship between individual pretrained and downstream labels.  This probabilistic approach accounts for inherent uncertainties and complexities, **allowing for flexible many-to-many mappings** that outperform deterministic methods. The iterative updating of the matrix further refines the mapping during optimization, improving accuracy and offering a probabilistic lens for understanding visual reprogramming's effectiveness.  **This method's strength lies in its ability to handle complex relationships between labels** and its adaptability to various pretrained models and input reprogramming techniques, demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks and datasets.

#### Visual Reprogramming
Visual reprogramming (VR) is a powerful technique that repurposes pretrained models for new tasks **without modifying their core parameters**.  It cleverly adapts the input or output interfaces, allowing the model to perform different functionalities.  A common approach involves modifying the input with trainable noise patterns, and mapping the model's original output labels to the new task's labels. This process introduces flexibility and efficiency, **reducing the need for extensive retraining**. However, challenges exist such as finding optimal label mappings and dealing with the complex relationship between pretrained and downstream labels.  **Bayesian-guided Label Mapping (BLM)** is a novel technique that leverages probabilistic relationships and addresses these limitations, enabling more robust and accurate visual reprogramming across diverse applications.

#### Many-to-many Mapping
The concept of "many-to-many mapping" in the context of visual reprogramming (VR) offers a powerful alternative to traditional one-to-one mappings between pretrained and downstream labels.  **One-to-one mappings**, while computationally efficient, often oversimplify the complex relationships inherent in real-world data, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.  A many-to-many approach acknowledges that a single downstream label might correspond to multiple pretrained labels, and vice versa. This is especially relevant when dealing with hierarchical or semantically related labels.  **By assigning probabilistic weights to the mappings**, a many-to-many approach can effectively capture the uncertainty and nuanced relationships between the label sets, thus improving the overall accuracy and robustness of the VR system.  **Bayesian methods**, for instance, can provide a principled way to learn these probabilistic mappings, incorporating prior knowledge and updating beliefs iteratively based on data.  While computationally more intensive than one-to-one methods, the enhanced performance gains often justify the additional cost.  The improved performance, interpretability, and flexibility offered by many-to-many mappings highlight their importance for future advancements in visual reprogramming.

#### BLM Algorithm Details
The BLM (Bayesian-guided Label Mapping) algorithm is a crucial component of the visual reprogramming framework, offering a probabilistic approach to address the limitations of traditional one-to-one label mapping methods.  **Instead of a deterministic, one-to-one mapping between pretrained and downstream labels, BLM constructs a probabilistic mapping matrix.** Each element in this matrix represents the probability of a given pretrained label corresponding to a specific downstream label, reflecting the complex, often many-to-many relationships between the label spaces.  This probabilistic approach is guided by Bayesian conditional probability, leveraging the joint distribution of predicted pretrained labels and ground-truth downstream labels.  **BLM iteratively refines this probabilistic matrix during optimization**, allowing it to adapt and accurately capture the label relationships in various downstream tasks.  The use of Bayesian principles provides a statistically sound foundation for the BLM algorithm, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of visual reprogramming compared to existing methods.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this Bayesian-guided label mapping (BLM) for visual reprogramming could explore **more sophisticated probabilistic models** for the label mapping matrix, potentially incorporating hierarchical relationships between pretrained and downstream labels or leveraging techniques from graph neural networks.  Investigating the **generalizability of BLM across diverse pretrained models** and downstream tasks beyond those evaluated in the paper is crucial. Further analysis into the **theoretical connections between BLM and other transfer learning techniques**, such as domain adaptation, is warranted to better understand its strengths and limitations.  Finally, research could focus on developing **efficient algorithms to scale BLM to extremely large label spaces**, a practical limitation of the current approach.  These directions would enhance BLM's robustness, applicability, and theoretical underpinnings.

> This figure illustrates the learning process of Bayesian-guided Label Mapping (BLM) and its enhanced version BLM+. It details the four steps involved: 1) Input image with VR patterns goes into a pretrained model, generating logits and predicted pretrained labels; 2) BLM/BLM+ estimates the probabilistic label mapping matrix using ground-truth downstream labels and predicted pretrained labels; 3) BLM/BLM+ reweights the output logits of the pretrained model for the downstream labels; 4) Backpropagation updates the input visual reprogramming patterns.  This iterative process refines the label mapping and the input VR to optimize the performance on the downstream task.
