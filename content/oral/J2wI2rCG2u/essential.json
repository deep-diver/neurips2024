Existing methods like Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent (SDGD) address this through randomization, while high-order auto-differentiation (AD) handles the exponential scaling for univariate functions.  However, neither method effectively handles both high dimensionality and high-order derivatives simultaneously.\nThis paper introduces the Stochastic Taylor Derivative Estimator (STDE), which efficiently addresses these challenges. STDE leverages univariate high-order AD by intelligently constructing input tangents, allowing for efficient contraction of derivative tensors and randomization of arbitrary differential operators. The method demonstrates significant speedup and memory reduction over existing techniques when applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), solving 1-million-dimensional PDEs in just 8 minutes on a single GPU.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "J2wI2rCG2u/podcast.wav"}
