Traditional methods often assume isotropic (equal) covariance matrices for all clusters, which is rarely true in real-world data.  This simplification limits accuracy and applicability of existing algorithms.  Anisotropic GMMs, where clusters have different covariance matrices, present a more realistic and challenging clustering problem. Existing approaches often struggle with the computational complexity of handling varying covariances, and theoretical guarantees are lacking. \nThis paper addresses these challenges by introducing two novel, computationally efficient clustering algorithms specifically designed for anisotropic GMMs.  The algorithms iteratively estimate and utilize covariance information, resulting in significantly improved clustering accuracy compared to existing methods.  The authors rigorously prove that their algorithms achieve minimax optimality\u2014meaning they achieve the best possible accuracy\u2014and converge quickly.  The findings are supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrating practical effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Clustering"}, "podcast_path": "ge8GZn8Gtu/podcast.wav"}
