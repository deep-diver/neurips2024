X: SM is not possible with natural choices of comp(.). ?: open. *: SM is possible if willing to pay for (suboptimal) A complexity. See Appendix E.2 for precise descriptions of each setting and our choices for their complexities.", "description": "This table summarizes the statistical modularity results for various base MDP classes.  It shows whether each class exhibits statistical modularity (meaning its sample complexity scales polynomially with the base class complexity and decoder class size) or not, using a specific complexity measure.  It highlights that most well-studied function approximation settings lack statistical modularity when latent dynamics are introduced.  It also points out cases where statistical modularity is achievable under specific conditions or assumptions (such as pushforward coverability).  Open questions are identified for certain classes where it's unclear whether statistical modularity is attainable.", "section": "Statistical Modularity: Positive and Negative Results"}]
