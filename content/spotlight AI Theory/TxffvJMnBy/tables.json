[{"figure_path": "TxffvJMnBy/tables/tables_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of the results on COCO. Unless stated otherwise, we assume arbitrary time-varying convex constraints and convex cost functions. In the above table, 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1 is an adjustable parameter, a is the strong convexity parameter of the strongly convex cost functions. Conv-OPT refers to solving a constrained convex optimization problem on each round. Projection refers to the Euclidean projection operation on the convex set X. For typical convex sets (e.g., Euclidean box, probability simplex), projection operations are substantially more efficient than solving a constrained convex optimization problem.", "description": "This table summarizes existing work on Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO), highlighting different algorithms' regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds under various assumptions.  It compares the complexity of each algorithm per round and notes whether time-invariant constraints or strong convexity are assumed.  The table concludes by showing the improved results presented in this paper.", "section": "1.1 Related Work"}]
