[{"figure_path": "aJGKs7QOZM/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Contribution Results. Consistency, robustness and approximation results proved for the mechanism design problems augmented with output advice. In the house allocation problem, bounds are shown for unit-range valuations, while the ones in parentheses are for unit-sum valuations. In combinatorial auctions, pm is the approximation ratio guarantee of a maximal in range mechanism.", "description": "This table summarizes the main results of the paper. For each of the studied mechanism design problems (Facility Location, Scheduling, Combinatorial Auctions, and House Allocation), it shows the consistency (Cons), robustness (Rob), and approximation guarantees achieved by the proposed mechanisms.  The approximation guarantees are expressed as functions of the quality of recommendation (\u00f4), a novel metric introduced in the paper,  as well as other relevant parameters (\u03bb for Facility Location, \u03b2 for Scheduling).  The table highlights the trade-offs between consistency and robustness for each problem and the improvements obtained by using output recommendations.", "section": "1.1 Contributions"}]
