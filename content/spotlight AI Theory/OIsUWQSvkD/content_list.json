Second, certain functional variables can be excluded from being observed without affecting the identifiability of a causal effect, which may significantly reduce the number of needed variables in observational data.

However, it is well known that such interventional queries can sometimes be answered based on observational queries (first rung of the causal hierarchy) which can be estimated from observational data. This becomes very significant when experimental studies are either not available, expensive to conduct, or would entail ethical concerns. Hence, a key question in causal inference asks when and how a causal effect can be estimated from available observational data assuming a causal graph is provided [2]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "More precisely, given a set of treatment variables $\\mathbf{X}$ and a set of outcome variables $\\mathbf{Y}$ , the causal effect of $\\mathbf{x}$ on $\\mathbf{Y}$ , denoted $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathbf{Y}|d o(\\mathbf{x}))$ or $\\mathrm{Pr}_{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathbf{Y})$ , is the marginal probability on $\\mathbf{Y}$ when an intervention sets the states of variables $\\mathbf{X}$ to $\\mathbf{x}$ . The problem of identifying a causal effect studies whether $\\mathrm{Pr}_{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathbf{Y})$ can be uniquely determined from a causal graph and a distribution $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathbf{V})$ over some variables $\\mathbf{V}$ in the causal graph [2], where $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathbf{V})$ is typically estimated from observational data. The casual effect is guaranteed to be identifiable if $\\mathbf{V}$ correspond to all variables in the causal graph (with some positivity assumptions); that is, if all such variables are observed. When some variables are hidden (unobserved), it is possible that different parameterizations of the causal graph will induce the same distribution $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathbf{V})$ but different values for the causal effect $\\mathrm{Pr}_{\\mathbf{x}}(\\mathbf{Y})$ which leads to unidentifiablility. In the past few decades, a significant amount of effort has been devoted to studying the identifiability of causal effects; see, e.g., [3, 2, 4\u20137]. Some early works include the back-door criterion [8, 2] and the front-door criterion [3, 2]. These criteria are sound but incomplete as they may fail to identify certain causal effects that are indeed identifiable. Complete identification methods include the do-calculus [2], the identification algorithm in [9], and the ID algorithm proposed in [10]. These methods require some positivity assumptions (constraints) on the observational distribution $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathbf{V})$ and can derive an identifying formula that computes the causal effect based on $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathbf{V})$ when the causal effect is identifiable. Some recent works take a different approach by first estimating the parameters of a causal graph to obtain a fully-specified causal model which is then used to estimate causal effects through inference [11\u201314]. Further works focus on the efficiency of estimating causal effects from finite data [15\u201318], the general identifiability of causal effects from both observational and experimental data [19], and the causal effect identification with data collected from sub-populations [20].

For example, [21] showed that certain unidentifiable causal effects can become identifiable given information about context-specific independence. Our work in this paper follows the same direction as we consider the problem of causal effect identification in the presence of a particular type of qualitative knowledge called functional dependencies [22]. We say there is a functional dependency between a variable $X$ and its parents $\\mathbf{P}$ in the causal graph if the distribution $\\mathrm{Pr}(X|\\mathbf{P})$ is deterministic but we do not know the distribution itself (i.e., the specific values of $\\mathrm{Pr}(x|\\mathbf{p})\\rangle$ ). We also say in this case that variable $X$ is functional. Previous works have shown that functional dependencies can be exploited to improve the efficiency of Bayesian network inference [23, 13, 24\u201326]. We complement these works by showing that functional dependencies can also be exploited for identifiability. In particular, we show that some unidentifiable causal effects may become identifiable given such dependencies, propose techniques for testing identifiability in this context, and highlight other implications of such dependencies on the practice of identifiability.
