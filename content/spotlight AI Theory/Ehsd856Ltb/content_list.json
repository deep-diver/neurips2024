In order to recover the full microbial genomes, a subsequent binning/clustering step is performed, where individual DNA fragments are clustered together according to their genomic origins. This process is also referred to as metagenomic binning [19, 9]. The fragments being clustered during the binning process consist of contiguous DNA sequences (contigs) obtained from the reads through a so-called assembly process [29] (contigs are generally longer and less error-prone than the reads).

These representations have mostly been studied from an empirical perspective [6], although general theoretical analyses into their representational properties have also been considered [25]. With $k=4$ (i.e., tetra-nucleotides) a 256-dimensional vector is used to describe the genome, each entry in the vector encoding the frequency of a specific $k$ -mer (e.g., ACTG, ATTT) in the genome sequence.
