Existing high-order methods for VIs demand precise derivative computations, which can be computationally expensive.  This often limits their applicability to large-scale machine learning tasks where exact derivatives are unavailable or too costly to compute.  Furthermore, existing high-order methods typically lack theoretical guarantees of global convergence.\nThis work addresses these challenges by introducing VIJI, a novel second-order method for solving VIs with inexact Jacobian information.  The researchers establish lower bounds and demonstrate that their method attains optimal convergence rates in the smooth and monotone VI setting when derivative approximations are sufficiently accurate.  They also propose quasi-Newton updates to make VIJI more practical, achieving a global sublinear convergence rate even with inexact derivatives.  Finally, the method is generalized to handle high-order derivatives.", "affiliation": "Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "uvFDaeFR9X/podcast.wav"}
