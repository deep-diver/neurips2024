New algorithm achieves optimal mistake bounds in multiclass transductive online learning.", "takeaways": ["A new dimension, the Level-constrained Littlestone dimension, characterizes online learnability in multiclass transductive online learning with unbounded label spaces.", "The trichotomy of minimax rates (\u0398(T), \u0398(log T), \u0398(1)) for expected mistakes established in finite label spaces extends to unbounded label spaces.", "Novel algorithms handle extremely large or unbounded label spaces with improved upper bounds, removing dependence on label set size."], "tldr": "Multiclass transductive online learning faces challenges when the number of labels is large or unbounded. Previous research primarily focused on binary or finite label spaces, leaving the unbounded case as an open question. This limited understanding hinders the development of effective learning algorithms for real-world scenarios involving vast data and complex categories. This paper tackles this challenge directly.\nThis research introduces new combinatorial parameters (Level-constrained Littlestone and Branching dimensions) to characterize online learnability. Using these parameters, the study establishes a trichotomy of minimax rates for expected mistakes, extending previous results to unbounded label spaces.  Furthermore, the paper presents novel algorithms surpassing previous multiclass upper bounds by eliminating label set size dependence.  These contributions provide a refined theoretical understanding and improved algorithmic tools for multiclass transductive online learning in scenarios with a potentially unbounded number of labels.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "3EREVfwALz/podcast.wav"}
