Here the red paths denote realizable branches.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of V(i,j) nodes in an infinite tree. Each V(i,j) node represents a point in the tree, and the red paths indicate realizable branches, meaning branches for which there exists a hypothesis in the hypothesis class H that is consistent with all the labels along that branch.", "section": "5 Non-uniformity Versus Consistency in the Realizable Setting"}]
