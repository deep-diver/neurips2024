The BO algorithm proposes a candidate point. The expert then provides a binary label ('accept' or 'reject'). If the expert is 'uncertain', the algorithm performs a cross-check of the expert's reliability; if 'confident', it proceeds directly.  This process allows the BO algorithm to efficiently incorporate expert knowledge while maintaining robustness against potentially unreliable expert advice.", "section": "2 Problem Statement"}, {"figure_path": "IDn9SiKgLy/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visual explanation: While the vanilla LCB returns xu, a far point from global minimum x*, expert-augmented LCB can successfully navigate to closer point xf by mixing ft and gt with f\u2081 + Atg\u2081, where \u03bbt is the dual variable.

The vanilla LCB selects a point (xu) that is far from the global minimum (x*).  The expert-augmented LCB, however, incorporates expert feedback (Di) to guide the selection of a point (xf) closer to the global minimum by combining the surrogate objective function (ft) and the expert belief function (gt) using a primal-dual approach with a weighting factor (\u03bbt).
