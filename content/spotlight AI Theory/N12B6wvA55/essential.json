Existing methods often lack efficiency or rigorous convergence guarantees, particularly when dealing with ill-conditioned problems or alternative geometries. This necessitates a new approach that considers geometric properties for better optimization. \n\nThis research tackles this challenge by adapting mirror descent and preconditioned gradient descent to the Wasserstein space. The authors provide convergence guarantees under relative smoothness and convexity conditions, carefully selecting curves along which these properties hold.  **Experiments on various tasks, including single-cell data alignment, showcase the algorithms' superior performance over existing methods**, highlighting the benefits of adapting the geometry induced by the regularizer.", "affiliation": "CREST, ENSAE, IP Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "N12B6wvA55/podcast.wav"}
