A social welfare function aggregates the utilities into a single number, providing a measure for the evaluation of actions with respect to the entire group. Utilitarian social welfare, for example, is the sum of utilities, whereas egalitarian social welfare is the minimum utility. Given two actions that induce the utility vectors $(3,0)$ and $(1,1)$ for two individuals, the former is preferred when measured by utilitarian social welfare, whereas the latter is preferred according to egalitarian social welfare.

First, to facilitate sample-efficient learnability, we need to make some structural assumptions on the class of social welfare functions. We focus on the class of weighted power mean functions, which includes the most prominent social welfare functions: the aforementioned utilitarian and egalitarian welfare, as well as Nash welfare (the product of utilities). This class is a natural choice, as it is the only class of functions feasible under a set of reasonable social choice axioms such as monotonicity, symmetry, and scale invariance [20, 7]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Second, we need to specify the input to our learning problem. There are two natural options, and we explore both: utility vectors coupled with their values under a target social welfare function, or pairwise comparisons between utility vectors. We demonstrate sample complexity bounds for both types of inputs, where the social welfare value or comparisons can be noiseless or corrupted by noise. We note that estimating the utility vector associated with any particular decision or policy is ostensibly challenging, but in fact this has been done in prior work and we have access to relevant data, as we discuss in Section 6. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our contributions. Learning weighted power mean functions is a non-standard regression or classification problem due to the complex, highly nonlinear dependence on the power parameter $p$ , which is the parameter of interest. While one can invoke standard hyperparameter selection approaches such as cross-validation to select $p$ from a grid of values, the infinite domain of $p$ does not allow demonstration of a polynomial sample complexity without deriving an appropriate cover. We derive statistical complexity measures such as pseudo-dimension, covering number, VC dimension and Rademacher complexity for this function class, under both cardinal and ordinal observations of the social welfare function. Our sample complexity bounds are summarized in Table 1. These results may be of interest for other problems where weighted power mean functions are used, such as fairness in federated learning [12].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
