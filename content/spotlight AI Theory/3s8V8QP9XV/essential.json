While recent algorithms boast strong theoretical guarantees, a classic method called Lanczos-FA frequently outperforms them in practice.  This lack of theoretical understanding motivates the need for improved analysis. \nThis research addresses this gap by proving that Lanczos-FA achieves near-optimal performance for a natural class of rational functions.  The approximation error is shown to be comparable to that of the best possible Krylov subspace method, up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the function's properties and the matrix's condition number, but not on the number of iterations. This result provides a strong theoretical foundation for the excellent performance of Lanczos-FA, especially for functions well-approximated by rationals, like the matrix square root.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "3s8V8QP9XV/podcast.wav"}
