The figure shows how the space of possible slices (X\u25a1) of signaling schemes is partitioned into regions based on the best-response action (a) for the receiver given that slice. Each region, denoted as X\u25a1(ai), represents the set of slices for which action ai is a best response. The figure also illustrates how the normalized slices (X\u25b3) are similarly partitioned.", "section": "3 Warm-up: A single signal is all you need"}]
