From a computational perspective, the QUBO problem belongs to the NP-hard family. Typical solving methods for the QUBO include exact methods and heuristic methods.

Since the exact methods are prohibitively expensive when applied to largesize instances, various heuristic methods have extensively emerged, which are designed for highquality solution discovery within acceptable timeframes.

First, transforming QUBO into a graph typically results in a fully connected $Q$ matrix, leading to $n^{2}$ real-valued edges, with each edge $q_{i j}$ directly affecting the $O F V$ of the problem. It is essential to manage the extraction of large-scale edges and discern their distinctions. As stated in [43], the graph convolution in GCNs is a special form of Laplacian smoothing, a key factor for their effectiveness. This smoothing could diminish the influence of high-weight edges, which is not required in QUBO since their original weight differences are essential for the model to accurately identify their impact on the objective function. Also, GCN performance significantly degrades when its depth exceeds two layers [42], even when employing residual connections. This is because when a GCN contains numerous convolutional layers, the resulting output features may become excessively smoothed, making it difficult to differentiate vertices from various clusters. To address these issues and based on the principles of graph convolution, we propose a QUBO-tailored Depth Value Network (DVN).

The labels for LHB are obtained by VCM-BGF-HB. The LHB can be considered supervised learning with optimal labels. The labels for LGF are obtained using the current VCM-BGF, which is GST without the historical best solution set. We adopt VCM-BGF-HB as the optimal baseline and illustrate the training curves in Figure 5. The results indicate that GST outperforms competitors in terms of both efficiency and stability.

GST achieves the same performance as the supervised LHB in the early stages of the training process while requiring at least $50\\%$ fewer epochs. Although LGF can reach local optimum from time to time, its training process experiences fluctuations due to the unstable quality of the labels outputted by VCM-BGF alone.

The depth is crucial for ensuring interaction and coherence between row and column features in DVN graph convolution. As shown in the Parameter Study in Appendix F.2, increasing the training depth of DVN improves feature extraction precision, leading to consistent enhancement in VCM performance. It is logical to hypothesize that a VCM trained at a particular depth $d$ would perform better at deeper testing depths. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluate six VCMs on benchmark B2500 across eight testing depths. The results (illustrated in Figure 7(a) and detailed in Appendix J) show that all VCMs exhibit significant performance gains as testing depth increases. Even at the training depth of 10, VCM already learns an iterative feature extraction pattern.

For instance, the default $\\mathrm{VCM50-}d40$ achieves an average gap of merely $0.034\\%$ when the testing $d$ hits 300, as opposed to its original gap of $0.362\\%$ . This performance enhancement can be generalizable to very large instances, as demonstrated by our evaluations on well-known instances (see Appendix J) and G instance with 10,000 and 20,000 variables (see Appendix L), and is achieved without additional training costs.

For comparative validation, we apply the Traditional Greedy Flip (TGF) method as the competitor, which calculates the OFI in a sequential and instance-by-instance way. We plot the running time curve in Figure 13 and detail the data in Table 2. The results reveal that the OFI batch calculation can significantly enhance the computing efficiency of the Greedy Flip method, which brings orders of magnitude efficiency improvement. With a batch size of 1, BGF-01 operates similarly to TGF, calculating instance by instance, where the difference between these two methods lies in the OFI calculation process of all variables in each decision step. Based on the batch calculation, BGF distinguishes itself by calculating the OFI for all variables simultaneously within a single step, as opposed to the sequential approach of TGF. This capability affords BGF a marked efficiency edge which grows with problem size, exemplified by its requirement of only $0.696\\%$ of the traditional calculation time for G1000 instances. The efficiency gains from OFI batch calculation are even more pronounced when dealing with batch instance computing. This improvement stems from the lower computational complexity afforded by the matrix computation process and the GPU acceleration. Consequently, the proposed OFI batch calculation method represents a potent computational tool for QUBO research, with promising applications beyond the scope of this work to potentially expedite a broad range of existing QUBO methods.
