Understanding generalization in such models is crucial.  Prior works often relied on asymptotic analysis, limiting their practical applicability.  This work tackled these issues. \nThis paper introduces a novel, dimension-free deterministic equivalent for random feature regression's test error.  This means they developed a closed-form approximation highly accurate even with high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional features. This method is validated using real and synthetic data, offering new insights into the relationship between overparametrization, feature map properties, and generalization performance.  They also derived sharp error rates, demonstrating the model's efficiency and advancing our understanding of neural network generalization.", "affiliation": "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "FBLJIfW64D/podcast.wav"}
