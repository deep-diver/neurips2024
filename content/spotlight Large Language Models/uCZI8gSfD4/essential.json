This leads to diminishing returns and overfitting issues.  The lack of comprehensive scaling laws tailored to protein sequence data also hampers efficient PLM development.  This research aims to address these issues.\nThis study introduces novel scaling laws for PLMs, addressing the limitations of existing methods.  It utilizes a massive protein sequence dataset including metagenomic sequences to enhance diversity and training efficiency. Experiments reveal the efficacy of transfer learning between different PLM training objectives, offering an optimized training strategy with equivalent pre-training compute budgets.  These findings offer practical guidelines for building compute-optimal PLMs.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "uCZI8gSfD4/podcast.wav"}
