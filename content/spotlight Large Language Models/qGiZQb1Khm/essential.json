Current methods for detecting synthetic data usage, like membership inference attacks, are often unreliable or require prior knowledge of the training data. This paper investigates the 'radioactivity' of LLM watermarking\u2014whether traces of watermarked data used to train one LLM can be detected in a subsequently trained LLM.  This is a significant challenge as it impacts AI safety, security, and intellectual property.\nThe researchers developed new radioactivity detection methods to address this issue. These methods, specialized for detecting weak residual watermark signals, reliably detect the presence of watermarked data in fine-tuned models. They found that the detection success is linked to watermark robustness, proportion of watermarked data in training, and the fine-tuning process.  Their findings highlight the potential for using watermarking not only to identify AI-generated text, but also to reveal the training data of other models\u2014a crucial development for AI governance and intellectual property protection.", "affiliation": "Meta FAIR", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "qGiZQb1Khm/podcast.wav"}
