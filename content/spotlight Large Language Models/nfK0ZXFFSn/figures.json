It shows two distinct clusters of data points, representing truthful (orange) and hallucinated (purple) LLM generations. Each point is an embedding vector from a language model.  A line (v1, the top singular vector) is drawn through the origin, representing the subspace identified by HaloScope that best separates these two clusters. The distance from each data point to this line (its projection onto the line) is used as the membership score.  Hallucinated samples tend to project farther from the origin along v1 than truthful samples, making it possible to distinguish them based on their projection.", "section": "3.2 Estimating Membership via Latent Subspace"}, {"figure_path": "nfK0ZXFFSn/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: (a) Generalization across four datasets, where \u201c(s)\u201d denotes the source dataset and \u201c(t)\u201d denotes the target dataset.

The AUROC is plotted against different values of k, showing that a moderate number of components leads to optimal results.
