Current model growth methods lack comprehensive evaluations, tested scalability, and clear guidelines for efficient LLM pre-training, creating obstacles for wider adoption.  This limits the potential of accelerating LLM development and deployment.\nThe study introduces four atomic growth operators and evaluates them in a standardized LLM pre-training setting.  It finds that a depth-wise stacking operator, Gstack, significantly accelerates training, reducing loss and improving performance on NLP benchmarks. The research shows Gstack's scalability through experiments with up to 7 billion parameter LLMs and 750 billion training tokens, providing empirical guidelines on growth timing and factor to ensure practical application.  This work overcomes critical obstacles hindering the adoption of model growth in LLM pre-training.", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Data Science, The University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "FXJDcriMYH/podcast.wav"}
