Similar to LoRA and OFT, HRA may suffer from some potential issues like inappropriate (even illegal) abuse, amplifying the social prejudice intrinsically in LLM when the finetuning data are biased, and so on. It should be noted that these potential issues are neither purely attributed to the technique itself nor specific to HRA\u2014LoRA and OFT also suffer from them. Solving these issues depends on developing new techniques, social policies, and data quality improvement. How to mitigate (even eliminate) these issues is left to our future work.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
