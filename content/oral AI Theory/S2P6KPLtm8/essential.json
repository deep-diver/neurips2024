However, **traditional MR methods often assume a one-directional relationship and struggle with invalid instrumental variables (IVs)**.  This research addresses these limitations by focusing on bi-directional MR, where causal effects flow in both directions.  The presence of unmeasured confounding and invalid IVs makes accurate causal effect estimation challenging.\nThis study introduces a novel algorithm, PReBiM, to tackle these issues.  **PReBiM uses a cluster fusion-like method to identify valid IV sets** and subsequently estimates causal effects using a two-stage least squares approach.  The paper provides theoretical justification for the algorithm's correctness and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulations and real-world examples.  **The findings advance causal inference methods, particularly in scenarios with bi-directional relationships and potential invalid IVs.**", "affiliation": "Beijing Technology and Business University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "S2P6KPLtm8/podcast.wav"}
