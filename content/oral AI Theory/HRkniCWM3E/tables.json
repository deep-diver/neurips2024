The full envelope has a total of 3200 parameters, with 1600 for \u03c3 and 1600 for \u03c0. The memory-efficient envelope significantly reduces the number of parameters, with a total of 13400 parameters (640 for \u03c3 and 12800 for \u03c0). This highlights the efficiency gains achieved by using the memory-efficient envelope.", "section": "Appendix B"}, {"figure_path": "HRkniCWM3E/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Hyperparameters used for the experiments.", "description": "This table lists the hyperparameters used in the experiments described in the paper.
