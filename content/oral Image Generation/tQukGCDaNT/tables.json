The metrics used for comparison are FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), Patch FID, CLIP score, and diversity score. The FID and Patch FID scores measure the visual quality of the generated images, while the CLIP score and diversity score assess how well the generated images align with the text prompts and how diverse they are, respectively.  Lower FID and Patch FID scores indicate better image quality, higher CLIP scores represent better text alignment, and higher diversity scores suggest greater variety in the generated images.", "section": "5.3 Ablation Studies"}]
