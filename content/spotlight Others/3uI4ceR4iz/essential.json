These limitations lead to inaccurate results and hinder progress in this crucial field of computer vision.  Existing benchmarks also suffer from annotation inconsistencies, further complicating evaluation and comparison of different approaches. \nSA3DIP tackles these challenges directly. It generates improved 3D primitives by incorporating both geometric and textural information from the point cloud, minimizing errors in the initial segmentation stage.  Furthermore, it leverages a 3D detector to constrain the merging process, addressing over-segmentation issues. To address benchmarking shortcomings, the study introduces the ScanNetV2-INS dataset, which features improved and more complete annotations for fairer evaluations.  Extensive experiments demonstrate SA3DIP's effectiveness, particularly on challenging datasets.", "affiliation": "Xidian University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "3uI4ceR4iz/podcast.wav"}
