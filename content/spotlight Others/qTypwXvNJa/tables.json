Each row represents a specific combination of source sites used to train the models, while the remaining sites served as target domains for evaluating the models. The table shows the mean performance and standard deviation across 100 stratified shuffle splits for each metric and method.  The results are useful for comparing the effectiveness of each method in generalizing across different recording sites in the HarMNqEEG dataset.", "section": "4 Empirical benchmarks"}, {"figure_path": "qTypwXvNJa/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Performance scores for different combinations of source sites.

The remaining sites not listed as source sites served as target domains.  The table shows the performance of several methods, including DO Dummy, No DA, GREEN, Re-center, DO Intercept, and GOPSA, highlighting the comparative performance of the proposed GOPSA method against existing approaches for handling multi-source domain adaptation in EEG data with shifts in both X (data) and y (predictive variable).", "section": "A.6 Table of performance scores"}]
