Vision Transformers, despite superior learning capabilities, suffer from self-attention's quadratic complexity, hindering their application in high-resolution images.  This necessitates efficient network architectures, hence this research. \nVMamba uses a stack of Visual State Space (VSS) blocks containing a novel 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module.  SS2D enhances the collection of contextual information compared to traditional methods. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and other datasets show VMamba outperforms existing benchmarks in accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly with larger inputs. This highlights VMamba's superior input scaling efficiency and potential for future efficient vision models.", "affiliation": "UCAS", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "ZgtLQQR1K7/podcast.wav"}
