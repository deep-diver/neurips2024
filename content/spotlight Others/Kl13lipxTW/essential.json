However, the robustness of these models to malicious attacks remains largely uninvestigated, posing significant risks in high-stakes scenarios. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the vulnerabilities of MTS forecasting models to backdoor attacks.\nThe paper proposes BACKTIME, a novel attack method that subtly injects triggers into the MTS data to manipulate model predictions. BACKTIME employs a bi-level optimization process with a GNN-based trigger generator to synthesize stealthy and effective triggers.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that BACKTIME is effective, versatile, and stealthy across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art models.  The research also contributes to enhancing the trustworthiness of MTS forecasting systems by suggesting strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "Kl13lipxTW/podcast.wav"}
