Conditioning these models to incorporate observed data is challenging, particularly for nonlinear processes.  Existing methods often rely on discretization, which can introduce inaccuracies and limitations. This paper addresses these challenges.\nThis research introduces a novel approach using an infinite-dimensional version of Doob's h-transform and score-matching techniques. The method allows conditioning without prior discretization.  It is successfully applied to analyze the shapes of organisms evolving over time.  **The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach in handling complex, infinite-dimensional data**, paving the way for broader applications in various fields.", "affiliation": "University of Copenhagen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "FV4an2OuFM/podcast.wav"}
