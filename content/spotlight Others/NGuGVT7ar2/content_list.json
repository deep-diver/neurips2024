It\u2019s worth noting that when the number of cities in a problem instance increases to 20, the performance of LLM-based algorithms significantly decreases as the search space of TSP grows exponentially with the problem size. Such a huge search space poses a significant challenge for LLMs not specifically tailored to solve TSP. Nonetheless, VAP\u2019s superiority over other LLM-based methods is still evident when the problem size increases.

The results demonstrate that removing any of the key components causes a performance degradation, except for self-alignment in Time Series Prediction. This is because there is no error in the drawing module, as discussed in Subsection 4.5. Hence, in this scenario, self-alignment plays no effect. Interestingly, removing planning step causes the most significant performance drop for Geometry Intersection Problems and TSP. The reason is that planning is crucial for visualizing problems requiring precise spatial relationships. Furthermore, iterative reasoning proves to be an essential component, as its removal leads to considerable performance degradation across all tasks. This finding highlights the importance of our view that all problem-solving is a step-by-step process. Self-alignment plays an important role in the task of Sudoku. For example, the LLM will occasionally draw the incorrect coordinate range for the Sudoku board, resulting in a board with the wrong size. However, with self-alignment, the model first describes the board size in the figure and cross-checks this against the original plan, preventing such issues.

VAP leverages the external image synthesis tools to generate visual representations that augment the textual input. The procedure of VAP follows a three-step algorithm: first, it automatically generates a high-level plan for reasoning; second, it engages in iterative drawing and reasoning based on the partially-completed image; and finally, original problem, all thoughts and generated image are jointly to derive a solution. To enhance robustness, we introduced a self-alignment technique, where the MLLM describes the image content, and the image channel is discarded if the self-description fails to align with the initial high-level plan. We conducted extensive experiments across four diverse reasoning tasks: intersection counting in Geometry Intersection Problems, Sudoku Puzzles, Time Series Prediction, and the Travelling Salesman Problem. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of VAP, establishing new state-of-theart performance compared to other training-free LLM-based methods.
