In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions.

The noise caused by sensors in the real world is filtered out, which allows the model to focus on learning underlying patterns. By learning feature representations that are robust to noise, the prediction accuracy is improved. Second, since the diffusion process introduces randomness into the inherently deterministic prediction task, it can provide a measure of uncertainty for each prediction by averaging over a set of hypotheses, notably without any modifications to the training process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, FlyingThings3D [24], KITTI Scene Flow [25], and Waymo-Open [33], demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method.

Many existing methods [2, 23, 25, 27, 31, 35, 42] assume scene objects are rigid and break down the estimation task into sub-tasks involving object detection or segmentation, followed by motion model ftiting. While effective for autonomous driving scenes with static background and moving vehicles, these methods struggle with more complex scenes containing deformable objects, and their non-differentiable components impede end-to-end training without instance-level supervision. Recent advancements in scene flow estimation focus on end-to-end trainable models and are categorized into encoder-decoder, coarse-to-fine, recurrent, soft correspondence methods, and runtime optimization-based methods. Encoder-decoder techniques, exemplified by FlowNet3D [22, 39] and HPLFlowNet [9], utilize neural networks to learn scene flow by adopting an hourglass architecture. Coarse-to-fine methods, such as PointPWC-Net [41], progressively estimate motion from coarse to fine scales, leveraging hierarchical feature extraction and warping. Recurrent methods like FlowStep3D [17], PV-RAFT [40], and RAFT3D [34] iteratively refine the estimated motion, thus enhancing accuracy. Some approaches like FLOT [26], STCN[18], and GMSF [43] frame scene flow estimation as an optimal transport problem, employing convolutional layers and point transformer modules for correspondence computation. Different from the previously mentioned methods, which are fully trained and supervised offline, the runtime optimization-based methods [19, 20, 6] are optimized during the evaluation time based on each pair of inputs. While these methods have the advantage of without the need for training datasets, it also means that they can not take advantage of large-scale training datasets. Due to the online optimization, they also suffer from slow inference speed. Moreover, most of them focus only on autonomous driving scenes. On the other hand, we aim to estimate the scene flow of more general scenarios. Our proposed method takes the current state-of-the-art soft correspondence method GMSF [43] as a baseline. Given the fact that being able to indicate uncertainty of the estimation is an important feature for safety-critical downstream tasks, we propose to leverage the diffusion models for this purpose, whose ability of uncertainty indication has been proven by other relevant research areas [11, 29].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
