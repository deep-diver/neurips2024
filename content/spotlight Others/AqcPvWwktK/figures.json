The VDFD is calculated separately for semi-supervised and supervised learning methods. The x-axis represents the training epoch, and the y-axis represents the VDFD value. The figure visually demonstrates the variance bias problem in semi-supervised multi-label learning, where the VDFD is often larger in the semi-supervised setting compared to the supervised setting. This variance bias problem is a key motivation for the proposed Balanced Binary Angular Margin Loss in the paper.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "AqcPvWwktK/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of VDFD on VOC2012.", "description": "This figure compares the variance difference between feature distributions (VDFD) of positive and negative samples for the VOC2012 dataset across different methods (CAP, SoftMatch, FlatMatch, and S2ML2-BBAM).  The x-axis represents the training epoch, and the y-axis represents the VDFD value.  The figure visually demonstrates that the proposed S2ML2-BBAM method effectively reduces the VDFD compared to other methods, indicating improved balance between positive and negative sample distributions.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "AqcPvWwktK/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The sensitivity analysis of the rescaled norm and magnitude {s,m} of cosine margin on VOC2012 with \u03c0 = 5%.", "description": "This figure shows the sensitivity analysis of the rescaled norm (s) and magnitude (m) parameters of the cosine margin in the Balanced Binary Angular Margin loss (BBAM) on the VOC2012 dataset with 5% labeled data.  The left panel displays how the Micro-F1, Macro-F1, and mAP performance metrics vary as the scaling factor 's' changes. The right panel shows the same metrics' sensitivity to variations in the margin parameter 'm'.  The goal is to find the optimal values for s and m that maximize the model's performance.", "section": "4.4 Parameter Evaluation"}]
