This imbalance can lead to inaccurate model training and suboptimal performance. Existing methods using binary loss functions and negative sampling often struggle to overcome this variance bias. \nThe paper introduces a novel SSMLL method, S2ML2-BBAM, which tackles this issue head-on. **It extends the binary angular margin loss by incorporating Gaussian transformations of feature angles**, enabling a better balance in feature distributions for each label. Moreover, an efficient prototype-based negative sampling strategy ensures high-quality negative samples.  **Experimental results demonstrate that S2ML2-BBAM significantly outperforms existing methods**, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the variance bias issue and improving the overall performance of SSMLL.", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "AqcPvWwktK/podcast.wav"}
