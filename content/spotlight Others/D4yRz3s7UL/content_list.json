While vision transformers have excellent representational capabilities, the computational demands of their transformer blocks make them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. These demands mainly arise from the quadratic number of interactions (inter-/intra-calculations) between tokens [13]. Therefore, to reduce the computational requirements, various techniques have been proposed to improve their resource efficiency. Token sparsification (TS), in which tokens are dynamically sampled based on their significance, is a prominent technique used for this purpose. The TS approaches proposed include: ATS [5], AdaViT [20], and A-ViT [33], each of which adaptively allocates resources based on the complexity of the input image (i.e., input-dependent inference) by deactivating uninformative tokens, resulting in improved throughput with a slight drop in accuracy. Despite the fact that TS has been proven to be effective in improving the resource efficiency of vision transformers, their test-time dynamism and average-case performance assumption creates a new attack surface for adversaries aiming to compromise model availability. Practical implications include various scenarios, such as: attacks on cloud-based IoT applications (e.g., surveillance cameras) and attacks on real-time DNN inference for resource- and time-constrained scenarios (e.g., autonomous vehicles) [10].

We place the patch on the left upper corner of the image and limit its size to $64\\times64$ , and we do not bound the perturbation budget.

We hypothesize that this occurs due to the distinct mechanism used by each model. Another strategy we evaluate is the ensemble training strategy. In this strategy, the adversarial example is trained concurrently on all of the sparsification mechanisms, and in each training iteration a different mechanism is randomly selected. The goal is to explore the synergistic advantages of leveraging the strengths of multiple models to generate adversarial perturbations that are more broadly applicable. The results of the ensemble training, which are also presented in Figure 4, show that when a perturbation is trained on all TS mechanisms, it is capable of affecting all of them, achieving nearly the same performance as when the perturbations are trained and tested on the same mechanism.

However, when the TS mechanism is based on parameters that were not optimized for this specific goal (e.g., ATS attention scores), the model is even less vulnerable. To actively mitigate the threats, an upper bound can be set to the number of tokens used in each transformer block, which can be determined by computing the average number of active tokens in each block on a holdout set. This approach preserves the ability to sparsify tokens while setting an upper bound, balancing the trade-off between performance and security. To verify the validity of this approach, we evaluated two different policies for the token removal when the upper bound is surpassed: random and confidence-based policy. The results show that the proposed approach substantially decreases the adversarial capabilities compared to a clean model, i.e., adversarial image GFLOPS are almost reduced the level of clean images. For example, the GFLOPS reduce from 4.2 to 3.17 when tested on ATS (clean images GFLOPS are 3.09).

The primary focus of DeSprasify is vision transformers designed for image classification, which can be deployed in security-sensitive applications on edge devices, with potential repercussions on the system\u2019s availability. However, discovering a new threat vector, assessing the security vulnerability of integrating TS techniques into vision transformers, and mitigating its threats are necessary to raise the awareness of their users and improve the robustness of the models. Safeguarding the availability and ethical dimensions of vision transformers that utilize TS techniques is crucial to ensure the best interests of individuals and society. We believe that future work can eliminate the threat of the proposed attack, and it is important to focus research on availability-based defenses.
