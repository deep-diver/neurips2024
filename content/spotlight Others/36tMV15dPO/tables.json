For each representation, it provides the memory usage, encoding method, encoding time, decoding method, decoding time, and Chamfer Distance (CD). The metrics are designed to evaluate the efficiency of each representation for 3D generation. Lower values for Memory, Encoding Time, Decoding Time, and CD indicate better efficiency. The X-Ray representation shows a significant advantage in terms of memory usage and encoding time compared to other methods.", "section": "5.2 Efficient Comparison with Different 3D Representation"}, {"figure_path": "36tMV15dPO/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative reconstruction comparison on the GSO [6] and OmniObject3D [56] datasets", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed X-Ray method with existing state-of-the-art methods for image-to-3D mesh generation.  It shows the Chamfer Distance (CD) and F-Score (FS@0.1) metrics on the Google Scanned Objects (GSO) and OmniObject3D datasets. Lower CD values and higher FS@0.1 values indicate better reconstruction performance.

The evaluation metrics are Chamfer Distance (CD) and F-Score at a threshold of 0.1 (FS@0.1).  Training time (in days), inference time (in seconds), batch size, and model size (in GB) are also reported for each configuration. The results demonstrate the impact of different model sizes and initialization strategies on the model's performance in 3D reconstruction tasks.", "section": "A.3 Ablation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "36tMV15dPO/tables/tables_15_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Quantitative evaluation of the effect of Hit H attribute on the GSO [6] dataset", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the performance of the X-Ray generation model with and without the Hit H attribute. The results are evaluated using the Chamfer Distance (CD) and F-Score (FS@0.1) metrics on the Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset. The Hit H attribute indicates the presence of a surface in each layer of the X-Ray representation. The results show that including the Hit H attribute improves the model's performance, suggesting its importance in ensuring accurate 3D object generation.", "section": "A.3 Ablation Studies"}]
