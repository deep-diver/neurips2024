Existing methods for synthesizing sounds often struggle to capture fine details or generalize well to new situations. They often lack physical constraints that should govern sound wave propagation. This has hindered the development of truly immersive audio experiences.\nThe paper introduces Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR) to solve these issues. AVR uses a novel approach that models sound waves in the frequency domain, making it more efficient and accurate. The frequency-domain method also incorporates spherical integration to better capture the spatial characteristics of sound. To make the method more accurate, a new physical simulator called AcoustiX is also introduced, which produces more realistic simulation data. The results show that AVR surpasses existing methods in synthesizing impulse responses and provides highly accurate, physics-based rendering.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Acoustic Scene Analysis"}, "podcast_path": "YCKuXkw6UL/podcast.wav"}
