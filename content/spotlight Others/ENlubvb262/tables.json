[{"figure_path": "ENlubvb262/tables/tables_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Sample complexities of learning halfspaces with \u03b3 margin, omitting logarithmic factors and failure probabilities for brevity. All the algorithms above run in polynomial time.", "description": "The table compares the sample complexities of various algorithms for learning halfspaces with a margin under different noise models.  It shows the sample complexity as a function of the margin (\u03b3) and error (\u03b5). The columns indicate whether the algorithm handles Random Classification Noise (RCN), Massart noise, and produces a proper or improper hypothesis. The table highlights that the proposed Perspectron algorithm achieves a sample complexity comparable to state-of-the-art RCN learners, even under the more challenging Massart noise.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
