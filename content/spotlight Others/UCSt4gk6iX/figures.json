Existing methods cannot be used for MCMC as they broaden the extent of the selected Gaussian, significantly violating distribution invariance.", "description": "This figure compares three different strategies for cloning or respawning Gaussians in the context of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.  The original 3D Gaussian Splatting method (a) and a recent variant (b) both significantly alter the shape of the Gaussian after cloning, making them unsuitable for MCMC. In contrast, the proposed method (c) maintains a similar Gaussian shape, preserving the sample probability and ensuring a valid MCMC update.", "section": "3.4 Heuristics as state transitions via relocation"}, {"figure_path": "UCSt4gk6iX/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Qualitative highlights with the same number of Gaussians \u2013 We provide examples of novel-view rendering of 3DGS [19] and our approach on multiple scenes from different datasets (with either random or SFM initialization).
