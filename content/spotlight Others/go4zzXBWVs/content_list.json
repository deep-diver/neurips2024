This principle is central in the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP [50], which learns visual representations through natural-language supervision. In the pre-training phase, an input image x and associated text description c are encoded by separate vision and text encoders. This yields feature representations $\\mathbf{f}=\\bar{\\theta_{v}}(\\mathbf{x})$ and $\\mathbf{t}=\\theta_{t}(\\mathbf{c})$ , which can be aligned by contrastive learning. Such a joint embedding space for the visual and textual modalities facilitates zero-shot recognition and yields powerful adaptation capabilities for a large variety of tasks. The recent literature on adapting VLMs has grown substantially, in both the zero-shot and few-shot learning settings [73, 72, 16, 70, 74, 25, 43].

However, as we will show in our experiments (Table 4), the direct application of existing transductive few-shot methods to VLMs yields poor performances, sometimes underperforming the inductive zero-shot predictions. This might explain why the transductive paradigm has been overlooked in zero-shot and few-shot learning for VLMs so far. The low performance of current transductive few-shot methods in the context of VLMs could be explained by the fact that the underlying objective functions do not account for the text knowledge. In this new multi-modal paradigm, additional supervision could be leveraged from the textual descriptions of the classes (prompts) [50], e.g., $\\mathbf{c}_{k}=\\mathsf{a}$ photo of a [kth class name], along with their corresponding representation $\\mathbf{t}_{k}=\\theta_{t}(\\mathbf{c}_{k})$ derived from the language encoder.

Motivated by findings in NLP, which indicate that better prompt strategies could enhance performance [53, 26, 22], substantial efforts were directed towards prompt tuning [35] for VLMs, with CoOp [73] standing out as the pioneering work along this line. Following CoOp, prompt tuning has become the favorite strategy for adapting VLMs in a variety of contexts, including unsupervised [25, 43, 15, 41, 1] and few-shot [73, 72, 40, 12, 65, 6, 74, 8, 9, 29, 30, 67] learning. Meanwhile, there have been a few efforts towards computationally more efficient adapters [70, 48, 66]. Our transduction formulation aligns with this initiative. By operating solely on the output embeddings (i.e., in a black-box setting), TransCLIP is computationally efficient and does not make assumptions on the underlying encoder architectures. Still, our method is orthogonal to these design choices and could be applied atop any of the above-mentioned inductive approaches. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Main contributions.

The use of unlabeled test data at inference time has received attention lately in rapidly emerging subjects, such as few-shot learning and unsupervised testtime adaptation. Examples include adjusting batch normalization layer statistics [46] and minimizing the entropy of predictions [60], which can be supplemented by pseudo-labeling strategies [36]. In the few-shot literature solely based on vision models, transduction leverages both the few labeled samples and unlabeled test data, outperforming inductive methods [76, 5, 24, 37, 75]. One of the first works introducing transduction in vision-based few-shot learning proposes propagating the labels from the support (labeled) to the query (unlabeled) set with a meta-learned graph [39]. Building on this idea, another work proposes to iteratively augment the support set to improve label propagation [34]. LaplacianShot [76] also exploits the inherent structure of the data through a graphLaplacian clustering, which discourages disparate class predictions for samples with close features, while matching each query set point to the nearest support prototype. Alternative approaches propose directly learning the class prototypes. For instance, Transductive Fine-Tuning (TF) [13] uses the prediction entropy on the query samples as a regularization term, while TIM and its variants [5, 59] employ the mutual information between the query samples and their predictions. BD-CSPN [37] refines the class prototypes by reducing the feature biases between the support set and the most confident query samples. An additional group of methods performs clustering in the feature space, for instance, by solving an optimal transport problem like PT-MAP [24], by projecting features into sub-spaces to facilitate clustering [75], or by revisiting the standard K-means with an additional partition-complexity regularizer to control the number of predicted classes [44]. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Zero- and few-shot learning in VLMs. Thanks to their extensive pre-training, VLMs exhibit stronger generalization capabilities than vision-only models but may also fail [50, 69, 57]. In response, substantial recent efforts have been directed towards using their general knowledge and adapting them on more specific tasks [63, 73, 70]. Arguably, the most popular strategy is prompt tuning [35], which is explored both in the unsupervised [43, 15, 41, 1] and few-shot [73, 72, 40, 12, 65, 6, 74, 8, 9, 29, 30] settings. The pioneering work, CoOp [73], updates input text-prompt tokens by leveraging the context provided by the few labeled samples (i.e., the support set). Building on this success, various strategies have been developed to enhance this approach, especially through additional regularization. For instance, ProGrad [74] guides the prompts towards the original hand-crafted ones by gradient projection. Prompt tuning has also been explored in the zero-shot setting, e.g., using the predictive confidence to generate pseudo-labels [25, 41]. Despite its popularity, prompt tuning remains tedious in terms of computations, due to the many back-propagations through the text encoder. This challenge is compounded in the recent developments, which introduce visual tokens [29, 30] alongside the text tokens. In contrast, there has been limited efforts so far in developing black-box methods [48, 17, 16, 66, 62], which only access the final embedding states. These methods often rely on the so-called adapters [23], like Tip-Adapter(-F) [70], which adds a classifier at the output of the vision encoder, in the form of a cache model involving the few-shot samples. Lately, a strong baseline based on Gaussian discriminant analysis clustering [62] demonstrates VLMs\u2019 adaptation abilities with a Gaussian hypothesis on the embedding space.

However, the method in [45] may not be computationally tractable for large-scale query sets, due to expensive inner loops for estimating the Dirichlet distribution\u2019s parameters. We provide a computationally efficient solution, which can scale up to large target datasets (such as ImageNet), while being easily amenable as a plug-and-play module on top of state-of-the-art inductive methods. It is worth mentioning that test-time adaptation methods also employ the transduction paradigm, but their settings are very different from those studied in this work. For instance, SwapPrompt [41] has been designed to make batch predictions on-the-fly, and has continual-learning mechanisms such as an exponential moving average prompt across batches. TPT [43] work on a single sample with many data augmentations to train one prompt per image. Both methods require access to model weights for training (i.e., do not operate in a black-box setting) and an expensive training procedure. We also note that prompt tuning does not scale well with the model size and is even impractical on very large models such as EVA-CLIP-8B [55].

These results underline the value of considering the structure of the unlabeled test samples during prediction, especially on top of zero- and low-shot models or when facing domain shifts, an aspect not leveraged by the current zero- and few-shot VLM literature. More detailed results for five different backbone architectures and comparisons with unsupervised non-transductive methods are provided in Appendix C.1 for the zero-shot setting, in Appendix C.2 for TransCLIP on top of popular few-shot methods, in Appendix C.3 for cross-dataset transferability and in Appendix C.4 for domain generalization.

It is important to note that these few-shot methods were primarily developed for vision-centric tasks. Hence, they rely on visual information, omitting the textual elements. This allows us to study the impact of our text-based regularization term. Table 4 shows that incorporating language in the transductive paradigm boosts the performance over vision-only methods. Especially for the 1- to 4-shot settings, our language-driven KL penalty enhances the performance by a large margin on many tasks (e.g., ImageNet, SUN397, StanfordCars, DTD). As the number of shots increases, the text-driven penalty becomes less useful, especially for the datasets capitalizing on the visual shots rather than the text-encoder knowledge (e.g., EuroSat and Flowers). This points to promising future directions involving more flexible text regularization (e.g., an adaptable $\\lambda$ taking into account the number of shots and the quality of the text embeddings).

Additional results on the sensitivity of $\\lambda$ in the few-shot setting are depicted in Figure 2 of the Appendix. Alongside the prior findings from Table 4, it is evident that incorporating text information is key to the success of TransCLIP and its wide applicability across the zero- and few-shot learning scenarios. The number of nearest-neighbors considered in the Laplacian term (Eq. (2)) does not make a significant difference in TransCLIP\u2019s performance as suggested by Table 6c. However, removing the Laplacian regularization (Table 6a) leads to inferior results on some datasets such as ImageNet and EuroSAT.

Our algorithm is highly efficient, as it operates solely in the output embedding space (i.e., black-box setting), making it suitable for a wide range of models, including very large ones. This also enables TransCLIP to be compatible with models that are accessible only through APIs. We first showed how TransCLIP can bring transduction to the inductive zeroshot setting, achieving consistent gains without additional supervision. Then, we proposed a new setting that applies transduction on top of popular few-shot methods, offering a convenient strategy to combine computationally intensive supervised fine-tuning with efficient test-time transduction. Finally, we highlighted the limitations of current transductive few-shot methods and proposed a simple extension of TransCLIP to incorporate labeled samples. In all our experiments, TransCLIP\u2019s text-guided KL divergence term appears as a key factor in its success. Future work may focus on further enhancing this regularization term, for example, by making it more resilient (e.g., with adaptive class-wise weighting) when text prompts are less reliable.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
