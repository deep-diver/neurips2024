This paper focuses on improving the reproducibility and consistency of neuronal embeddings obtained from these models, which are essential for meaningful downstream analyses, such as defining functional cell types.\nThe researchers address this by introducing an adaptive L1 regularization technique that adjusts the regularization strength per neuron, significantly improving both predictive performance and the consistency of neuronal embeddings.  Furthermore, they propose an iterative feature pruning strategy to reduce model complexity without losing predictive power, thus enhancing reproducibility.  The findings reveal that improved identifiability is crucial for building objective taxonomies of cell types and achieving compact representations of functional landscapes. **This work highlights the importance of addressing overparametrization and improving model identifiability for reliable and robust deep learning models in neuroscience.**", "affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VXxj3XZ1X8/podcast.wav"}
