Traditional Krylov subspace methods, though widely used, often suffer from slow convergence.  This research addresses the issue by exploring data-driven approaches to improve efficiency.\nThe proposed method, NeurKItt, uses a neural network to predict the invariant subspace of the linear system and integrates this prediction into the Krylov iteration process. This approach significantly reduces the number of iterations needed to achieve the solution, resulting in notable speedups across various datasets and problem settings.  The authors demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, showcasing its potential to significantly improve the efficiency of linear system solvers.", "affiliation": "MoE Key Laboratory of Brain-inspired Intelligent Perception and Cognition, University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cqfE9eYMdP/podcast.wav"}
