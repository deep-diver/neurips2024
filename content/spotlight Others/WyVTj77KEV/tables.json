The performance of different models (DEPACT, dyMEAN, FAIR, RFDiffusionAA, and PocketFlow, along with several ablation studies of PocketFlow) is evaluated using three metrics: Amino Acid Recovery (AAR), self-consistency Root Mean Squared Deviation (scRMSD), and Vina score.  Higher AAR indicates better sequence similarity, lower scRMSD indicates better structural similarity to the reference, and lower Vina score indicates higher binding affinity.
