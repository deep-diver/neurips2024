It iteratively removes elements from L until all the remaining elements are close to each other. The algorithm uses samples from Di and the list L to estimate a smaller subspace that preserves the norm of the gradient for sub-population i, reducing the minimum length of medium-size batches required for testing and the number of medium-size batches required for estimation. The algorithm runs in polynomial-time and has a sample complexity that is within a factor of  \u00d5(1/a) from that required in a single-component setting.", "section": "B Selecting a regression vector from a given list"}]
