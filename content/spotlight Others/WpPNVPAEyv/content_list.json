Since the samples of the head classes account for the vast majority in the datasets while the tail class samples are extremely scarce [21, 16, 6, 17], this extreme imbalance in the data makes the model prone to overfitting towards the head classes during training, resulting in poor performance on the tail classes [34, 8, 30, 20, 39]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address the long-tailed distribution problem, existing research has proposed a series of methods such as re-sampling [25, 5, 24, 10] and modifying the loss function [17, 6], with the common idea of focusing on improving the performance of the tail classes. However, these methods typically assume that the distributions of the training and test data remain invariant, and thus cannot well handle the common situations of distribution shift between training and testing in real-world scenarios. Some more recent works such as RIDE [32] and LADE [12] propose using multiple expert models to obtain stronger distribution adaptability. Building on this, SADE [38] further adaptively combines the outputs of these experts during testing to adapt to the current test distribution. These approaches alleviate the problem of distribution mismatch between training and testing to some extent [23].

But in different application scenarios, users may have different preferences and needs for the relative trade-off between head and tail classes. Simply pursuing the overall optimal solution may not meet this flexibility requirement[17, 35, 43]. For example, in classifying lung CT images, when screening for difficult cases, we care more about whether all possible disease types (i.e., tail classes) can be covered to avoid missed diagnoses, compared to routine physical examinations. For some serious diseases such as lung cancer, we may also be willing to moderately increase the false positive rate in exchange for higher coverage of the tail classes, to ensure that no patients are missed. Another example is wildlife detection. Within nature reserves, we want the model to accurately detect common species (i.e., head classes) to understand their population sizes. But when looking for rare species (i.e., tail classes), we care more about covering all species, even at the cost of some false detections.

For the first challenge, existing multi-expert model-based methods train fixed expert models for specific distributions, requiring strong distribution assumptions and struggling to handle more complex and variable distributions. Therefore, instead of maximizing the performance of each expert individually, we pursue modeling and optimizing the hypervolume over the entire Pareto front curve, learning a set of solutions that cover all possible distribution scenarios. This requires us to sample with the goal of covering the entire Pareto front during optimization. For the second challenge, unlike LADE and SADE which output a fixed trade-off solution under distribution shift, we can flexibly output a dedicated model solution that matches the user\u2019s preference in any test distribution scenario.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
