### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Long-tailed learning struggles with imbalanced datasets, where some classes have many examples while others have few. Existing methods often fail to adapt to different test data distributions and cannot handle user preferences for head vs. tail class trade-offs. This creates challenges for applications requiring flexible adaptation.



This paper proposes PRL, a paradigm that generates diverse expert models using hypernetworks. These experts cover various distribution scenarios, allowing the system to adapt to any test distribution and output a user-preference-matched model solution. **PRL achieves higher performance ceilings and effectively overcomes distribution shifts while allowing controllable adjustments according to user preferences**.  This offers a new, interpretable, and controllable approach to long-tailed learning, significantly expanding its applicability.

> This figure compares three different approaches to long-tailed learning. (a) shows the traditional approach where a single model is trained on the imbalanced dataset, often resulting in poor performance on tail classes during testing with different distributions. (b) illustrates a multi-expert approach where multiple experts are trained on different distributions from the same dataset, but still lacks flexibility to adapt to arbitrary test-time distributions. (c) presents the proposed method which samples diverse preference vectors during training to generate a diverse set of expert models via hypernetworks to address any possible distribution scenarios. The ensemble model is optimized to flexibly adapt to any test distribution and output a dedicated model solution according to the user's preference.

> This table presents the top-1 accuracy results achieved by various long-tailed recognition methods on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR100-LT, Places-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and ImageNet-LT).  The key aspect is that the test data distribution is uniform, meaning the class balance is even during testing, in contrast to the imbalanced training data. This allows for a comparison of how well different methods can generalize to balanced data after training on long-tailed data.  The table shows the performance of each method across different imbalance ratios in CIFAR100-LT (IR=10, IR=50, IR=100) and the overall accuracy for Places-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and ImageNet-LT.





### In-depth insights


#### Long-Tail Learning
Long-tail learning tackles the challenge of **highly imbalanced datasets**, where a few classes (head) dominate while many classes (tail) have scarce data.  Traditional machine learning methods struggle with this imbalance, often neglecting the under-represented tail classes and resulting in poor performance.  **Addressing this requires specialized techniques** that focus on balancing the class distribution, such as oversampling minority classes, modifying loss functions to weigh tail classes more heavily, or employing sophisticated ensemble methods that integrate multiple models to better handle the class distribution skew.  **Effective strategies strive to improve the representation and prediction accuracy of tail classes without compromising the overall model performance**.  The field is actively evolving, seeking robust and adaptable solutions that handle real-world distribution shifts and accommodate varying user preferences, making long-tail learning a critical area of research within machine learning.

#### Hypernetwork Experts
The concept of "Hypernetwork Experts" presents a novel approach to long-tailed learning.  A hypernetwork acts as a central generator, creating diverse expert models tailored to various data distributions and user preferences.  This contrasts with traditional single-model or fixed multi-expert approaches. **The hypernetwork's flexibility is key**, allowing for the dynamic generation of models optimized for specific needs, such as prioritizing tail class accuracy or balancing performance across all classes. This adaptability makes the approach especially robust to distribution shifts often encountered in real-world scenarios. **The diverse expert models created by the hypernetwork likely cover a wider range of data characteristics**, leading to better generalization and performance ceilings. However, challenges exist; efficient training of both the hypernetwork and the generated experts needs attention, and managing the computational cost associated with multiple models should be considered.  **Control over the generated experts' behaviors is a significant advantage**, facilitating adjustable trade-offs between competing objectives depending on the application's needs. The interpretability of the method, linked to the controllable generation of specialized models, makes it promising.

#### Preference Control
The concept of 'Preference Control' in a long-tailed learning context is groundbreaking.  It moves beyond simply optimizing overall accuracy, acknowledging that real-world applications often prioritize different aspects depending on the specific task and user needs.  **The ability to flexibly adjust the model's focus on head versus tail classes is crucial**, especially when dealing with imbalanced data. This approach introduces a new level of interpretability and control, enabling users to specify their preferred trade-offs between recall and precision for head and tail classes. The preference vector, used to guide the model's behavior during inference, allows for a **dynamic and adaptive model**, responsive to the changing demands of different scenarios. The described method's capability to control the head-tail trade-off offers considerable practical advantages, particularly in domains with safety and cost implications. This represents a significant advancement in making long-tailed learning methods more versatile and user-friendly.

#### Distribution Shift
The concept of 'Distribution Shift' in machine learning, particularly within the context of long-tailed learning, is crucial. It highlights the discrepancy between training and testing data distributions, impacting model generalization.  **Methods that assume similar distributions during training and testing often fail when applied to real-world scenarios where distribution shifts are common.**  This necessitates more robust approaches that can adapt to diverse and unseen data distributions, a key challenge in applying long-tailed learning to practical problems. The research emphasizes the importance of creating models that are not only high-performing but also robust to various distribution shifts encountered in real-world datasets, which are often imbalanced.  Addressing distribution shift is paramount for building reliable and effective long-tailed learning models that generalize well beyond the confines of their training data. **A controllable paradigm that dynamically adjusts to user preferences, and differing degrees of imbalance, is shown to be highly desirable**. This ensures the produced model not only adapts to data distribution shifts but also prioritizes different classes according to the specific requirements of the application.

#### Future of PRL
The future of PRL (Preference-controlled Robust Long-tailed learning) is promising, building upon its success in addressing long-tailed learning challenges and distribution shifts.  **Further research could focus on enhancing the hypernetwork's efficiency and scalability**, perhaps through novel architectures or training techniques.  Investigating the application of PRL to other challenging machine learning domains, like **few-shot learning or domain adaptation**, is also warranted.  **Exploring different preference elicitation methods** could improve usability and interpretability. Finally, **rigorous empirical evaluations on diverse, real-world datasets** are needed to solidify its robustness and establish benchmarks for future comparison.  Future work could also incorporate uncertainty quantification and explainability aspects, boosting trustworthiness and practical adoption.
