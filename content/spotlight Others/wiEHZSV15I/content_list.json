Before introducing our design, we reflect on why existing methods struggle to maintain their optimal effectiveness with a reduced number of parameters. Existing methods predominantly adopt data patching over either the temporal or spatial dimensions (Zhou et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022; Nie et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a; Zhang & Yan, 2023), which, in conjunction with the attention mechanism, allows them to capture complex temporal and spatial dependencies. However, a significant drawback of data patching is the elimination of temporal (or spatial) identities along with the destruction of temporal (or spatial) correlations, resulting in the potential loss of complex temporal (or spatial) information. To counteract this undesirable information loss, these methods establish a high-dimensional latent space to accommodate the encodings of the temporal and spatial identities in addition to the embeddings of the real-time observations. As a result, the dimensionality of the latent space typically scales with the number of identities to be encoded, inevitably leading to the exponential inflation of parameter scale.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
