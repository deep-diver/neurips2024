Traditional methods struggle to provide useful bounds for realistic scenarios. This often hinders the development and optimization of algorithms and systems involving Markov chains.  This is particularly challenging in stochastic optimization and machine learning applications.\nThis paper introduces the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), a novel sample-based algorithm to address the limitations of existing approaches. **DCDC uses a neural network to solve the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), which is derived from a new single-condition convergence analysis framework**.  By solving the CDE, DCDC generates explicit convergence bounds in Wasserstein distance for realistic Markov chains.
