However, many real-world problems involve operators mapping between Banach spaces, presenting a significant challenge. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by focusing on learning holomorphic operators\u2014a class with wide applications\u2014between Banach spaces.\nThis research introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology combining approximate encoders/decoders with feedforward DNNs. The method achieves optimal generalization bounds, meaning it performs as well as any other method up to logarithmic factors.  Crucially, the proposed DNN architectures' width and depth depend only on the training data size, not the operator's regularity, showing their adaptability and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Simon Fraser University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "vBlzen37i0/podcast.wav"}
