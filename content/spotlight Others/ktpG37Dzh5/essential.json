However, existing methods often lack theoretical grounding and require manual threshold tuning which limits their performance. This creates a need for a more principled approach.\n\nThis paper presents **BMRS**, a novel Bayesian method for structured pruning. BMRS leverages recent advancements in Bayesian structured pruning with multiplicative noise and Bayesian model reduction for efficient model comparison.  The authors demonstrate that two versions of BMRS, one based on a truncated log-normal prior and another on a truncated log-uniform prior, provide reliable compression and accuracy without threshold tuning while achieving a better performance-efficiency trade-off compared to existing methods on multiple datasets and network architectures.", "affiliation": "University of Copenhagen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ktpG37Dzh5/podcast.wav"}
