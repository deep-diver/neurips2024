While recent advancements in deep generative models enable realistic image synthesis from text, precise 3D control remains a challenge, especially in multi-object scenarios.  Existing methods often lack the 3D understanding needed for intuitive manipulation, hindering their ability to handle complex real-world scenes effectively.  Furthermore, using only text as a conditioning input for image generation proves insufficient for achieving the level of precise control desired.\nThis paper introduces Neural Assets, a novel method that leverages per-object visual representations and 3D pose information to control individual objects within a scene.  By training on paired video frames, the model learns disentangled representations for appearance and pose, enabling fine-grained control.  The researchers demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing the method's ability to handle multi-object editing tasks with high accuracy and efficiency. This approach also enables compositional scene generation, such as transferring objects between different scenes, leading to more flexible and versatile 3D-aware scene editing.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "eDNslSwQIj/podcast.wav"}
