Existing methods often lack reliable uncertainty estimates, hindering their practical use in design and optimization.  This makes it challenging to determine which mutations are most promising and trustworthy, especially in a Bayesian Optimization setting where uncertainties are essential to guide the selection of the next mutation to test. \n\nThe paper introduces Kermut, a Gaussian Process regression model with a novel composite kernel designed to capture mutation similarities.  Kermut demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in predicting the effects of mutations while offering uncertainty estimates.  The model's uncertainty calibration is analyzed, showing reasonable overall calibration but highlighting challenges in instance-specific calibration.  Furthermore, Kermut is significantly faster than competing methods, making it a practical tool for researchers in the field.", "affiliation": "University of Copenhagen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jM9atrvUii/podcast.wav"}
