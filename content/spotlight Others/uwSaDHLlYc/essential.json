However, existing methods often struggle to generate truly diverse synthetic data, impacting model performance.  This limits the benefit of the approach, as homogenous synthetic datasets do not effectively represent the original dataset's variability.\nThe proposed method, Diversity-Driven Synthesis, addresses this by using dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques during the synthesis process. This ensures that each batch of synthetic data reflects the characteristics of a large, diverse subset of the original data.  The method significantly enhances diversity and representativeness. Experiments across various datasets showcase that the method achieves superior performance with minimal computational overhead.", "affiliation": "Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "uwSaDHLlYc/podcast.wav"}
