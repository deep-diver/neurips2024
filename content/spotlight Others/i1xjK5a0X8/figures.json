In 2D (image) MAEs, if 100% of the image patches are masked, and only the positional embeddings (indices) are provided to the decoder, reconstruction is impossible. However, in 3D (point cloud) MAEs, even with 100% masking, and only using the positional embeddings (coordinates of patch centers), the decoder can still reconstruct the point cloud relatively well. This indicates that patch centers in point clouds contain rich information that the 2D indices in images do not.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "i1xjK5a0X8/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the proposed PCP-MAE.

It shows how the point cloud is divided into patches, which are then processed by the encoder and decoder. The encoder uses self-attention on visible patches and cross-attention with the PCM (Predicting Center Module) to predict the centers of masked patches.  The decoder then uses these predicted centers, along with the visible patches, to reconstruct the masked patches. The overall objective is to minimize the Chamfer distance between the reconstructed point cloud and the original point cloud.", "section": "3 PCP-MAE"}, {"figure_path": "i1xjK5a0X8/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the proposed PCP-MAE.
