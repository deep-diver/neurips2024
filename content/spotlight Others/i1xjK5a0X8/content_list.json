These methods typically include an encoder accepting visible patches (normalized) and corresponding patch centers (position) as input, with the decoder accepting the output of the encoder and the centers (position) of the masked parts to reconstruct each point in the masked patches. Then, the pre-trained encoders are used for downstream tasks. In this paper, we show a motivating empirical result that when directly feeding the centers of masked patches to the decoder without information from the encoder, it still reconstructs well. In other words, the centers of patches are important and the reconstruction objective does not necessarily rely on representations of the encoder, thus preventing the encoder from learning semantic representations. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, i.e., learning to Predict Centers for Point Masked AutoEncoders (PCP-MAE) which guides the model to learn to predict the significant centers and use the predicted centers to replace the directly provided centers. Specifically, we propose a Predicting Center Module (PCM) that shares parameters with the original encoder with extra cross-attention to predict centers.

This versatility has led to their broad adoption across various application scenarios, including autonomous driving [28], robotics [10, 30], and the metaverse [32]. In the early developing stage of point cloud understanding, there are lots of related work proposed to enhance the ability of networks for understanding point cloud [13, 18, 25, 26, 39] where the networks typically need fully-supervised training from scratch. However, point cloud data are difficult to annotate compared to the data in 2-D vision and NLP owing to the complexity of the toughness of discriminating them. It leads to a phenomenon called data desert [9] in 3-D which refrains the development of these fully-supervised methods. Recently, numerous self-supervised learning (SSL) methods [47, 24, 9, 27] were proposed for point cloud understanding to alleviate the negative effect brought by data desert because self-supervised learning methods can utilize unlabeled data effectively by performing designed pretext task (e.g., reconstruction-based or contrastive-based) for pre-training and the learned semantic representation benefits the performance of downstream tasks.

The architecture of MAE is distinctly asymmetric, featuring an encoder and a decoder. The typical process involves dividing an image into patches, which are then selectively masked prior to encoding. The encoder only accepts visible patches as input along with their positional embedding, i.e. embedding of patch indices. The decoder receives both the latent representations of the visible patches and the tokens representing the masked patches, along with their corresponding positional embeddings. Following MAE in 2-D, Point-MAE [24] and its variants [48, 51, 14, 27] are proposed, which divide point cloud into patches where points in patches undergo normalization, achieved by subtracting the coordinates of corresponding centers and apply the mask-reconstruction paradigm in 3-D domain.

We answer this question with an interesting phenomenon observed through experimental results in Fig. 1: We first set the mask ratio to $100\\%$ in Point-MAE for pre-training on ShapeNet [3], i.e., the encoder is removed to verify whether the point cloud can be reconstructed by only feeding the masked positional embeddings of the center points to the decoder after training. Intriguingly, the reconstruction results are pretty well, which are shown in Fig. 1. This is irreproducible for 2-D MAE since when masking $100\\%$ patches and only providing the positional embedding of the masked patches (i.e., 2-D indices of patches), 2-D MAE cannot identify what the images are (as all the images with the same resolution share the same positional embeddings).

To this end, we propose a method, which learns to Predict Centers for Point Masked AutoEncoders, termed as PCP-MAE. While existing MAE-based methods [24, 9, 27, 48, 51] overlook the importance of centers during pre-training and directly leak the masked centers for the decoder, our PCP-MAE learns more semantic representation by performing point cloud reconstruction under the auxiliary of learning to predict centers, using predicted centers replace real masked centers.

Specifically, we propose a custom pre-training task that forces the encoder to not only learn representations for visible patches but also predict the centers of the masked ones.

Visible patches (with centers) perform self-attention in each block as in Point-MAE, while masked patches (without centers) leverage a cross-attention mechanism simultaneously to acquire center information from themselves and the visible ones. Additionally, a dedicated objective is introduced to minimize the difference between the predicted masked centers and the ground truth values (positional embeddings). Furthermore, the predicted positional embeddings of the masked centers are used to replace the real positional embeddings, which will be fed into the decoder. This allows the network to not only encode visible centers effectively but also learn the inter-relationships between visible and masked centers.

As shown in Fig. 1, point clouds are well reconstructed by the decoder under $100\\%$ masking ratio, indicating that the decoder does not necessarily rely on the representations learned by the encoder.

Inspired by the recent successes of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in NLP and 2-D vision, an increasing amount of research has been conducted to explore the potential and strengths of SSL in the realm of 3-D vision [24, 47, 41, 1]. Existing 3-D SSL methods can be mainly divided into two categories: contrastive learning [41, 1, 17, 29, 19] and generative learning [47, 24, 50, 48, 51]. PointContrast [41] pioneers the contrastive learning in 3-D by borrowing the idea of contrastive learning in 2-D and performing point-level invariant mapping learning on two transformed views of the given point cloud. CrossPoint [1] advances this approach by engaging in intra-modal learning while also introducing an auxiliary cross-modal contrastive objective that facilitates the learning of transferable 3-D point cloud representations through 3D2D correspondence. Generative learning in 3-D typically trains autoencoders to learn semantic latent representation during pre-training with a pre-designed task, i.e., reconstructing the original input. Inspired by BERT, Point-BERT [47] firstly devises a Masked Point Modeling (MPM) task to pre-train point cloud Transformers auxiliary by a point cloud Tokenizer with a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE). Masked Autoencoders (MAE) [16], which mask random patches from the input image and reconstruct the missing patches at the pixel level, have demonstrated substantial potential and established a significant milestone in the field of SSL.

Following the masked-reconstruction paradigm established by MAE in vision, Point-MAE [24] is proposed, which pioneers designing a neat and efficient architecture entirely built upon standard Transformer blocks for point cloud understanding. Motivated by the success of Point-MAE, numerous works based on it are proposed [50, 9, 27, 14, 51, 48], showing notable improvement compared to Point-MAE. On the basis of Point-MAE, Point-M2AE [50] tailors the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures, which allows for progressive modeling of spatial geometries, facilitating the capture of both intricate details and overarching semantics of 3D shapes. ACT [9], as an MAE-based method, acquires knowledge from other modalities by adopting cross-modal auto-encoders as teachers. ReCon [27] harmoniously combines the generative framework (MAE-based) and contrastive framework to share the merits of them. Joint-MAE [14] enables better cross-modal interaction by constructing two hierarchical 2-D-3-D embedding modules. I2P-MAE [51] introduce a 2-D guided masking strategy and 2-D semantic reconstruction apart from point cloud reconstruction. Point-FEMAE [48] extends global random masking to two branches consisting of a global branch and a local branch to capture latent semantic features, with extra modules Local Enhancement Modules introduced. We find almost all existing MAE-based methods focus on structural improvement, employing the same reconstruction objective as Point-MAE.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
