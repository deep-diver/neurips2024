This limitation restricts the models' reliability and ability to effectively convey the uncertainty associated with the forecasts.  Accurately representing forecast uncertainty is crucial for diverse applications. \n\nTo address these challenges, the paper introduces Graph-EFM, a probabilistic forecasting model that uses a hierarchical graph neural network architecture. This method enhances the efficiency of ensemble forecasting by enabling the generation of large ensembles using a single forward pass per time step. Through experiments on global and limited-area datasets, Graph-EFM demonstrates superior performance in capturing forecast uncertainty and achieving equivalent or lower forecast errors when compared to deterministic methods. **The hierarchical structure of Graph-EFM encourages spatially coherent forecasts**, further improving prediction quality. **This model represents a significant advancement in probabilistic weather forecasting,** offering improved decision-making capabilities for various sectors dependent on accurate and reliable weather information.", "affiliation": "Link\u00f6ping University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wTIzpqX121/podcast.wav"}
