Traditional mesh movement methods are computationally expensive and struggle with complex geometries.  Learning-based approaches lack generalization, requiring retraining for each new PDE or geometry.  They often suffer from robustness issues, such as inverted elements.\n\nThis research introduces Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N).  UM2N uses a Graph Transformer encoder and Graph Attention Network decoder.  Trained on a PDE-independent dataset, UM2N generalizes to unseen PDEs and geometries without retraining. Evaluation shows UM2N outperforms existing methods in accuracy and speed, even handling cases where traditional methods fail. The method also exhibits enhanced robustness to mesh tangling.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lcALCNF2qe/podcast.wav"}
