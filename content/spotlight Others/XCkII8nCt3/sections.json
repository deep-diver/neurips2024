This contrasts with classical machine learning models.  **The key question is whether quantum systems offer an advantage in representing high-dimensional functions.**  Research into quantum expressivity often involves deriving bounds on approximation errors, showing how well a quantum circuit can approximate a target function given its size and depth.  **A significant challenge lies in demonstrating that the improvement comes from quantum mechanics and not from clever classical data processing**.  This is typically addressed by explicitly constructing quantum circuits without relying on classical pre- or post-processing steps.  **Data encoding schemes and the choice of measurements play crucial roles**, affecting a quantum circuit\u2019s ability to approximate specific function classes. Theoretical results often establish the conditions under which quantum circuits achieve universal approximation, meaning they can approximate any function with sufficient resources.  **Practical applications hinge on the efficiency of quantum circuits**, making it essential to compare their sizes and parameter counts against classical counterparts to gauge any quantum advantage.
