However, many tasks require multi-humanoid collaboration, such as carrying large and heavy furniture together. Given the scarcity of motion capture data on multi-humanoid collaboration and the efficiency challenges associated with multi-agent learning, these tasks cannot be straightforwardly addressed using training paradigms designed for single-agent scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Cooperative Human-Object Interaction (CooHOI), a framework designed to tackle the challenge of multi-humanoid object transportation problem through a two-phase learning paradigm: individual skill learning and subsequent policy transfer. First, a single humanoid character learns to interact with objects through imitation learning from human motion priors. Then, the humanoid learns to collaborate with others by considering the shared dynamics of the manipulated object using centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms. When one agent interacts with the object, resulting in specific object dynamics changes, the other agents learn to respond appropriately, thereby achieving implicit communication and coordination between teammates. Unlike previous approaches that relied on tracking-based methods for multi-humanoid HOI, CooHOI is inherently efficient, does not depend on motion capture data of multi-humanoid interactions, and can be seamlessly extended to include more participants and a wide range of object types.

Some previous efforts [44] tried to address these challenges using tracking-based methods, capturing interactions between two characters during tasks like box carrying, and training policies to mimic these actions. However, obtaining comprehensive motion data on interactions involving multiple participants is costly, and tracking-based methods struggle to adapt to scenarios with varying object sizes and an increased number of agents. Another straightforward idea might be to directly train a multi-agent policy from scratch, using an approach similar to that for single agents.

In the initial stage, we train a single-agent object carrying policy utilizing the AMP framework [25, 7]. To ensure agents focus significantly on the dynamics of the objects they are tasked with transporting, we include the state and velocity information of the object\u2019s bounding box in the agent\u2019s observation space. The second stage aims to transfer these individual carrying skills into collaborative strategies. When two humans collaborate to carry a long object, they typically hold it at opposite ends. Moreover, when one individual takes action, it affects the dynamics of the object, enabling the other individual to perceive this change and adjust their actions accordingly for effective cooperation. Therefore, we adjust the observation for both agents to focus on the bounding boxes located at the ends of the long objects. This refinement aligns with the observation space used during the single-agent training phase, effectively leveraging the previously developed single carrying skills. Additionally, the inherent rigid body characteristic of long objects facilitates implicit communication between agents. This setup allows an agent to adeptly adjust to their teammate\u2019s actions by observing changes in the object\u2019s dynamics, thereby enhancing coordination and cooperation in carrying tasks.

To facilitate the training process, some strategies employ tracking-based techniques [16, 23, 1, 38, 20, 44], which rely on the availability of high-quality reference motions. This reliance often limits their application in humanscene interactions due to the scarcity of suitable data and affects their versatility across different scenarios.

We examined the robustness of the single-agent policy from various perspectives, including object shape, scale, weight, and trajectory length, as shown in Figure 5. First, we observed that a single agent can handle approximately $13\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ of weight. Continuously increasing the weight makes it difficult for the agent to lift the object. As mentioned in 4.2, since our policy input does not include object density, it is challenging for the agents to generalize across different weights. When the weight reaches $20\\;\\mathrm{kg}$ , the accuracy drops to just $30\\%$ . Additionally, due to the limited reach of human arms and the lack of dexterous hands in our agent, it is challenging for the agent to lift boxes that are either too large or too small. To validate this hypothesis, we restricted the object\u2019s width to 1x while scaling the length and height to $1.5\\mathrm{x}$ . As shown by the green circle in the second figure of Figure 5, the success rate could reach $97.8\\%$ . Furthermore, our strategy is quite robust to distance variations and is generally unaffected by them. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Multi-Agent-Based Box Carrying. We conducted upper-limit testing on the multi-agent policy using a similar evaluation method as the single-agent case. As shown in Figure 5, the conclusions for two agents are similar to those for a single agent. The curves in the first figure demonstrate that with an increase in the number of agents, we can easily lift larger and heavier objects that a single person cannot handle, highlighting the necessity of having multiple agents. However, due to the increased complexity of coordinating two agents, boundary conditions have a more pronounced impact on the policy. For instance, objects that are excessively large or small can cause the policy to fail. As shown by the purple circle in the second figure of Figure 5, we conducted a similar experiment to the single-agent scenario. By restricting the object\u2019s width to $1\\mathbf{x}$ and scaling the length and height to $1.5\\mathrm{x}$ , the success rate increased from 0 to $88.67\\%$ . ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Analysis of CooHOI Framework. To thoroughly investigate the contribution of CooHOI, we analyzed the results of each method mentioned in Section 3 separately, as shown by the training curves in Figure 8. The first factor is the influence of the Stand Point, which refers to whether an extra point is introduced in front of the object to encourage the agent to walk toward it. During the experiments, we discovered that without this, the agent sometimes fails to approach the shortest edge of the object, resulting in a lower hold reward. This leads to an incomplete lift and the subsequent inability to carry the object. Dynamic Observation is the second factor, indicating whether we use dynamic information as observation for each agent. Without it, the observation for each agent is limited to the state information of the long object. We found that without the dynamics information, the agent just stands in front of the object, seemingly unsure of what to do. Reverse Walk indicates whether the training process includes motion data for walking backward and a reward function focused on learning this movement. We found that if the policy for a single agent is restricted to only forward movement, training with two agents then leads to a deadlock state. As shown in Figure 8, the agents might be able to contact the box, but they cannot carry it to the destination. Initialization refers to whether the two-agent policy is initialized using the single-agent policy and then be fine-tuned. In our experiment, even with extended training duration, training the two-agent policy from scratch still failed to achieve successful carrying, as shown in Figure 8. Based on the results above, the absence of any of the aforementioned methods causes our policy to fall into a locally suboptimal solution, preventing the completion of the transportation task. Moreover, you can also find more interesting visual examples of the above failure cases while extending agent numbers from one to two in the appendix.
