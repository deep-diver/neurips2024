It shows how the model uses learnable recurrent cycles to model periodic patterns in the input time series data. The input data is first processed to remove the cyclic components, leaving only the residual components. These residuals are then passed through a linear layer or a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to obtain predictions for the residual components. Finally, the predicted residual components are added back to the cyclic components to obtain the final predictions.
