For c = x0, we see that the VLB degrades with increasing T, but for VDM and MULAN, it improves with increasing T. This empirical observation is consistent with our mathematical insights earlier. As these models consistently exhibit inferior performance w.r.t VDM, in line with our initial conjectures, we refrain from training them beyond 300k iterations due to the substantial computational cost involved.", "description": "This figure shows the test loss (bits/dim) over iterations for different settings of the diffusion process. The settings include using class labels or the input image itself as context (c), and varying the number of timesteps (T).  The results show that using the input image as context generally leads to worse performance compared to using class labels, especially when the number of timesteps is increased.
