Rasterization-based approaches offer speed improvements but are limited to homogeneous data, failing to handle complex variations in appearance and geometry caused by weather, lighting, and seasonal changes.  They also cannot efficiently model dynamic objects like vehicles and pedestrians.\nThe paper introduces 4DGF, a novel hybrid neural scene representation that combines the efficiency of 3D Gaussian primitives with the flexibility of neural fields to overcome these limitations.  4DGF utilizes a graph-based scene representation to handle scene dynamics effectively and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis across various benchmarks, exceeding existing methods in speed and visual quality by a significant margin.  This efficient and scalable solution opens new possibilities for applications in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "xZxXNhndXU/podcast.wav"}
