This paper introduces Training-Free Guidance (TFG), a novel algorithmic framework that unifies these methods and systematically analyzes their design space.  This allows researchers to efficiently search the hyperparameter space for optimal settings. \nTFG offers a superior hyperparameter search strategy, significantly improving performance across various tasks and diffusion models. The framework's comprehensive benchmark, including diverse datasets and tasks, and improved performance demonstrate TFG's potential for advancing training-free conditional generation. The findings provide a valuable resource for researchers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their applications.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "N8YbGX98vc/podcast.wav"}
