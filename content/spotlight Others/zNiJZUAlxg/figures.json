Panel (a) shows how a unified model, trained on multiple known classes, can generalize to detect anomalies in unseen classes without retraining.  Panel (b) highlights the advantage of using residual features (differences between input features and reference normal features).  Residual features exhibit less variation across different classes, enabling the model to more effectively distinguish anomalies from normal instances in new, unseen classes.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "zNiJZUAlxg/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Framework overview. Note that the training samples belong to different classes. First, few-shot normal reference samples are fed into a pre-trained Feature Extractor to obtain normal reference features. Each initial feature will match the nearest normal reference feature and subtract it to form the residual feature. Then, a Feature Constraintor is utilized to transform the normal residual features into a constrained spatial hypersphere. Finally, we employ a normalizing flow model as the Feature Distribution Estimator to learn and estimate the residual feature distribution.", "description": "This figure illustrates the ResAD framework's architecture.  It shows the process of how a test image is processed to detect anomalies.  First, a pre-trained feature extractor is used to obtain initial features from both the test image and few-shot normal reference images. These initial features are then converted into residual features by subtracting the nearest normal reference feature for each. Next, a Feature Constraintor shapes the normal residual features into a hypersphere. Finally, a Feature Distribution Estimator, using a normalizing flow model, learns the normal residual feature distribution, enabling the detection of anomalies (outliers) in the test image.  The loss functions used in training are also indicated.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "zNiJZUAlxg/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (a): Intuitive illustration of class-generalizable anomaly detection (b): Conceptual illustration of residual features.
