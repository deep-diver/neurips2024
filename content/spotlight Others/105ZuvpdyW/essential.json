Existing methods often struggle with complex structures and lack user-friendly interaction.  This necessitates a universal model capable of handling various anatomical structures efficiently.\nSegVol addresses these challenges with a novel 3D foundation model trained on a massive dataset.  It incorporates a zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism to optimize inference and allows user interaction via spatial and semantic prompts.  **SegVol outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on 22 anatomical segmentation tasks**, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential to advance volumetric medical image analysis.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "105ZuvpdyW/podcast.wav"}
