The Pareto optimal sets for two different cones, C\u03c0/2 and C\u03c0/3, are shown in pink and blue, respectively.  The grey points represent the reward vectors of 200 randomly selected arms.  The figure illustrates that the geometry of the preference cone significantly impacts the size and composition of the Pareto optimal set.", "section": "2 Preference-based Pure Exploration Problem"}]
