My test is   \n2 simple, and it provides an objective, empirical metric to rectify the ungrounded   \n3 speculation surging through industry, academia, and social media. Drawing from   \n4 a breadth of philosophical literature, I argue the test captures the essence of self  \n5 awareness, rather than some postulated correlate or ancillary quality. To begin,   \n6 the concept of self-awareness is clearly demarcated from related concepts like   \n7 consciousness, agency, and free will. Next, I propose a model called the Nesting   \n8 Doll of Self-Awareness and discuss its relevance for intelligent beings. Then, the   \n9 test is presented in its full generality, applicable to any machine system. I show how   \n10 to apply the test to Large Language Models and conduct experiments on popular   \n11 open and closed source LLMs, obtaining reproducible results that suggest a lack   \n12 of self-awareness. The implications of machine self-awareness are discussed in   \n13 relation to questions about meaning and true understanding.

When can we say it has become like   \n17 us? After what moment can we say it knows good and evil?   \n18 Such questions have met idle speculation for millennia, but today they rapidly approach a fever   \n19 pitch, demanding answers with unprecedented urgency. AI systems that can pass for human in many   \n20 respects are no longer fiction. Machines that can walk and talk are real and functional. What was   \n21 once a distant speck, barely visible on the horizon, is now barreling down upon us.   \n22 Through much of the history of AI, the Turing test served to keep these worries at bay [1]. Originally   \n23 called the imitation game, this rudimentary metric of AI progress is a game played by two humans   \n24 and one machine. One human engages in conversation with the machine and the other (the judge)   \n25 must identify which is which, using nothing but the text of the conversation. The machine is deemed   \n26 intelligent if it can fool the judge by mimicking human dialogue. While far from perfect, the Turing   \n27 test was a concrete, unambiguous bar for AI to clear\u2014and one that stayed comfortably out of reach   \n28 for a long time.   \n29 Last year, however, the Turing test was broken [2]. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as   \n30 ChatGPT can handily engage in fluent conversation, on top of generating convincing essays, passing   \n31 difficult exams, and even writing poetry. With the Turing test no longer a target in the distance,   \n32 the conversation on AI has become untethered to any definitive, objective measure or permanent,   \n33 agreed-upon benchmark. As such, extreme subjectivity, soaring fantasies, and flights of fancy have   \n34 become commonplace. For instance, over the last year we have read \u201cBlake Lemoine claims language   \n35 model has a soul\u201d [3], \u201cClaude 3 realizes it\u2019s being tested\u201d [4], \u201cResearchers say chatbot exhibits   \n36 self-awareness\u201d [5] and much more.

There are several reasons for this. Discussed   \n41 further in section 2, imagining empirical measures that actually work is difficult, self-awareness is   \n42 often entangled with consciousness, free will, agency, etc., and it is hard to define. Worse, the topic is   \n43 seen by many in academia as somewhat taboo\u2014appropriate for the philosophy departments but not   \n44 any kind of rigorous science.   \n45 The result is that popular Tweets and news media dominate the conversation, while authorities in   \n46 the field either say nothing or win the spotlight with bold, confident assertions based on implicit,   \n47 controversial assumptions or their intuition about a model\u2019s architecture. This situation is concerning;   \n48 as AI systems get better and better, how will we truly know when they cross that fine line? Even if   \n49 you object to everything else in this paper, I argue this question is at least worthy of real scientific   \n50 investigation.   \n51 Much to the point, the only directly related work I could find is the AI mirror test, proposed recently   \n52 by Twitter user nielsrolf [6], and later (going viral, reaching 3.2 million impressions) by Josh Whiton   \n53 [7]. Inspired by the classic mirror test whereby animals are presented with a mirror and observed, in   \n54 the AI mirror test, popular chatbots are shown a screenshot of the chat window and asked to describe   \n55 what they see. This test is interesting in its own right, but I will argue it does not demonstrate any sort   \n56 of self-awareness in the manner it is formulated.

In this section I will give   \n60 merely a partial and incomplete sketch of a few important ideas written on the topic. For a more   \n61 comprehensive introduction to the work on self-consciousness, the survey by Joel Smith is a great   \n62 resource [8]. For a variety of introspective, or phenomenological approaches, consult [9], and for an   \n63 overview of the broader concept of consciousness, consult [10].   \n64 Perhaps the earliest writing of the concept of self-awareness was in Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus. Joel Smith   \n65 writes   \n66 Oedipus knows a number of things about himself, for example that he was prophe  \n67 sied to kill Laius. But although he knew this about himself, it is only later in the   \n68 play that he comes to know that it is he himself of whom it is true. That is, he   \n69 moves from thinking that the son of Laius and Jocasta was prophesied to kill Laius,   \n70 to thinking that he himself was so prophesied. It is only this latter knowledge that   \n71 we would call an expression of self-consciousness [8].   \n72 Oedipus demonstrates self-awareness when he recognizes the prophecy is about himself. Before that   \n73 recognition, Oedipus treats the prophecy as just another part of the world he observes; yet afterwards,   \n74 he realizes it is directly related to his own actions. I will refer back to this example when developing   \n75 the test.   \n76 Nearly every philosophy and religion has had something to say about self-awareness. Adam and Eve   \n77 can be viewed as gaining self-awareness in the garden when they \u201crealize they are naked\u201d [11][12].   \n78 Aristotle claims that, to perceive any external thing, one must also perceive their own existence [8].   \n79 The Buddhist doctrine of anatta\u00af, roughly \u201cnot-self,\u201d maintains that there is no permanent, underlying   \n80 self or soul [13]. Descartes, in contrast, with the well-known cogito ergo sum, posits the self as   \n81 known with certitude a priori [14]. William James divided the self into four constituents; the material   \n82 self, the social self, the spiritual self, and the pure ego [15]. Wittgenstein likens the self to the eye   \n83 that sees but cannot see itself [16]. More recently, some of the philosophical ideas on self-awareness   \n84 have been applied to the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience [17][18].

On the question of whether there   \n89 is something it is like to be a machine [19], I will remain silent here. Some approaches in the   \n90 phenomenological literature attempt to draw connections between consciousness and self-awareness   \n91 [9]. However, here it will be most useful for us to cleanly separate these two concepts.   \n92 It is interesting to consider whether an entity can be self-aware without being conscious, but it is   \n93 outside the scope of this paper. Thus, it will remain open whether philosophical zombies might be   \n94 self-aware [20], or whether any kind of test could solve the problem of other minds [21].

In science  \n97 fiction depictions of intelligent machines, the light of self-consciousness often coincides with agency   \n98 and free will. Indeed, the concepts seem very tightly related at face value, yet they are not the same.   \n99 Agency can be defined as a being\u2019s \u201ccapacity to take actions, especially with intention\u201d [23]. Note   \n100 that, by itself, agency does not necessarily imply any sophisticated degree of perception or awareness,   \n101 even though (practically speaking) any being which takes actions will likely have to sense their   \n102 environment.   \n103 The freedom of the will is far more difficult to define, and perhaps among the most controversial of   \n104 philosophical ideas. It designates a particular level of control a being has over their actions\u2014but   \n105 fierce debates rage over whether this control is undetermined by prior causes, compabitible with   \n106 determinism, an illusion, etc. [22].   \n107 Self-awareness is not the same as free will, and self-awareness is not the same as agency\u2014all three   \n108 of these are separate concepts.

The   \n125 central challenge is that any test we dream up must be based in empirical observations of the   \n126 machine\u2019s behavior or output. Worse, the machines we will study are trained specifically to mimic   \n127 the behavior and outputs of humans! How can we tell between real self-awareness and the illusion of   \n128 self-awareness?   \n129 No matter how well a system can imitate human behavior and outputs, there will always be one   \n130 fundamental difference. There is one thing that a self-aware system is able to do that an imitator will   \n131 never be able to. This is the essence of self-awareness:   \n133 So far, it seems we have said nothing. But if we apply this formula to familiar cases, we will begin to   \n134 see why it works.   \n135 Imagine an infant staring blankly in the mirror, compared to a child who looks in one and sees their   \n136 own reflection. What is the difference between these cases? In the latter case, the child is aware of   \n137 itself\u2014it can point and say \u201cthat\u2019s me!\" It can recognize itself, perceive itself, distinguish itself in the   \n138 reflection. Within its vast field of experience, through the window of its senses, it can differentiate   \n139 which parts are itself and which parts are not. Critically, awareness (here used interchangably with   \n140 perception, recognition, experience, etc.) is only possible through the child\u2019s inputs (senses). Within   \n141 this field of inputs, a line must be drawn between me and not-me; and, when this line is drawn   \n142 correctly, we declare the system self-aware. A test for self-awareness must capture its essence, or   \n143 else better and better imitations may fool us with the illusion of self-awareness.   \n144 While our description is still very high-level, I argue that the understanding of self-awareness   \n145 developed here is consistent with the philosophical work outlined in section 1.1.2, along with most   \n146 (if not all) popular conceptions.

The reality is more complex,   \n159 however.   \n160 To capture this nuance, I propose a model called the Nesting Doll of Self-Awareness, developed in   \n161 discussions with {removed to preserve Anonymity}. The essential idea is that system outputs may   \n162 loop back to the input more or less tightly, with varying levels of environmental mediation, depicted   \n163 in Figure 2.   \n164 The tightest loop is associated with one\u2019s awareness of their own inner thoughts. Even at this   \n165 innermost level, it is not trivial to distinguish which inner thoughts are your own and which are not.   \n166 For a concrete example of why, consider the classic movie Inception. The entire plot revolves around   \n167 an attempt to implant another person\u2019s idea into a target\u2019s unconscious\u2014in the movie, it is the idea of   \n168 Robert Fischer\u2019s dying father telling him to \u201ccreate something for himself\u201d [24]. Robert treats this   \n169 idea as though it was the green arrow in Figure 1, when in fact it was the red. Of course, Inception is   \n170 a work of fiction, yet it dramatically highlights a critical theme in human affairs, which insinuation   \n171 and the power of suggestion also play upon.   \n172 One level up is associated with interoception, such as hunger signals or the movement of one\u2019s limbs.   \n173 Here, the importance of distinguishing your influence from the world\u2019s is clearer\u2014life would be   \n174 difficult if you couldn\u2019t tell the difference between you moving your arm, and someone else moving   \n175 it for you.2 If you jump in surprise when someone sneaks up behind you and puts a hand on your   \n176 shoulder, then you possess this level of self-awareness.   \n177 Another level up is your material possessions. You possess this level of self-awareness if, when   \n178 driving in bad weather, you notice when your tires spin and you lose control of your vehicle. Dale   \n179 possesses this level of self-awareness in the movie Step Brothers when he says to Brennen \u201cI know   \n180 you touched my drumset\u201d [28]. In every case, what matters is the ability to correctly perceive the   \n181 difference between the world\u2019s influence and your own. Human material possessions can be quite   \n182 broad and extended in space, so this level is very flexible.   \n183 One level higher is your social connections. Upon first thought, social connections may not seem like   \n184 components of the self, yet in fact the relations between oneself and others play an instrumental role   \n185 in shaping one\u2019s identity [15][29]. You possess this level of self-awareness if you can tell when you   \n186 have influenced your peers versus when somebody else has.   \n187 It is important to note that each level mentioned here is somewhat flexible, and may differ widely   \n188 from person to person. Additional levels could also be added where appropriate. Some human beings   \n189 have enormous personalities, and their sense of self extends far out into the world. Others are more   \n190 humble and reserved. For a future self-aware machine, some of these levels are likely to apply more   \n191 strongly than others.   \n192 The test I propose, being rudimentary, takes one broad stroke over this entire nesting doll. As such, it   \n193 is rather basic and crude. Nonetheless, upon close inspection, it is clear how to extend this test to any   \n194 particular level of the nesting doll\u2014in each case, the question is whether the system can recognize   \n195 and differentiate its own influence from the world\u2019s influence.

Here, we consider the case of causal, or autoregressive   \n202 LLMs. See Definition 2 in appendix A for complete formal details.   \n203 Often, interactions with LLMs take the form of a conversation between a user and the system, such   \n204 that in Figure 1, the user takes the role of the \u2018World\u2019. The input to an LLM is its context, or prompt,   \n205 consisting of a number of prompt tokens. Consider Figure 3 for a clearer picture of the information   \n206 flow. Here, the user and LLM take turns generating tokens and including them in the conversation.   \n207 The tokens that the user generates are red, and the tokens that the LLM generates are green.   \n208 The test is then: can the LLM correctly identify which tokens are green and which tokens are red? Put   \n209 another way, can the LLM correctly identify its own words? Does the LLM know what it\u2019s saying?

In typical conversations with LLMs, as in Figure 3, messages are delimited by alternating labels   \n213 indicating messages by the \u2018User\u2019 and \u2018System\u2019 (or something analogous). Of course, the LLM will   \n214 have no trouble predicting that tokens following the \u2018System\u2019 label should say \u2018I am the system\u2019\u2014but   \n215 this tells us nothing about self-awareness. Failing to control for these labels is akin to conducting a   \n216 scientific survey, but telling respondents what to answer before asking them.   \n217 The situation comes to this: text resembling \u2018I am the user\u2019 should follow the \u2018User\u2019 label, and text   \n218 resembling \u2018I am the system\u2019 should follow the \u2018System\u2019 label. But what we are actually interested in   \n219 is whether the LLM knows if it is the user or it is the system. The LLM is like Oedipus; it can clearly   \n220 differentiate between the user and the system, since these are given direct labels\u2014but does it actually   \n221 know that it itself is the System? Again, what this comes down to is: can it distinguish which tokens   \n222 it actually generated (whether or not those tokens follow a particular label)?   \n223 This point is illustrated in subfigure 3a. Here, the roles are reversed! The LLM is actually generating   \n224 tokens on behalf of the User, and the User is generating tokens as if it were the LLM. Once the labels   \n225 are controlled for, the only way the LLM will be able to reliably tell which tokens are red and green   \n226 is if it is self-aware.   \n227 I will belabor this point, just because it is so important to clarify. If you put on a mask, you do not all   \n228 of a sudden confuse yourself for the masked character. If you look in a mirror, you still know it\u2019s   \n229 you behind the mask. When you move your arms, you aren\u2019t confused that it\u2019s actually the masked   \n230 character moving their arms. You are capable of recognizing yourself because you are self-aware.3   \n231 Now, the \u2018User\u2019 and \u2018System\u2019 labels are like masks. If the LLM acts as the user, generating the tokens   \n232 which follow the \u2018User\u2019 label, will it be able to recognize it was really the one behind the label? Or   \n233 will it still think it is the behind the \u2018System\u2019 label? I argue that all of these questions are handled by   \n234 the test I propose: can the System reliably and correctly distinguish its own outputs from the world\u2019s?   \n235 Thus, if you (naively) open a ChatGPT window, copy and paste a conversation into a new window, and   \n236 ask the LLM \u201cwhat role did you play in this conversation,\u201d you should not be surprised if ChatGPT   \n237 reports \u201cI was ChatGPT,\u201d for this does not indicate any self-awareness according to my test. In the   \n238 same manner, I argue the AI mirror test does not indicate self-awareness either; in a screenshot of   \n239 the chat window, message labels are clearly visible, thus confounding any experimental indication   \n240 of self-awareness. If, however, ChatGPT (or any LLM) is able to identify its role after the message   \n241 labels are controlled for, then this would be very surprising, and would indeed indicate some degree   \n242 of self-awareness.

All code is provided through Github, which may be used to reproduce the tests   \n247 and results, or apply them to any other open-source LLM.   \n248 GPT-3.5 was tested using the OpenAI API completions playground.4 By using the online completions   \n249 playground, there is no code to provide. However, the tests and results may be easily reproduced   \n250 by opening the same playground, and engaging in a similar conversation. Moreover, any other   \n251 closed-source LLM can be tested in a similar way if it allows for completions API calls.5   \n252 For all tests, I engaged in a conversation with the LLM, taking on a particular role. In some   \n253 preliminary tests, I constructed a conversation between two human speakers (with the LLM taking the   \n254 role of one of them). After the conversation, the system was asked which speaker it thought it acted   \n255 as. In later tests, I constructed a conversation between a \u2018User\u2019 and a \u2018System\u2019, then asked the LLM   \n256 which it thought it was, using the keyword \u2018you\u2019.

It was   \n263 found that (as in the initial tests with two human speakers) when the LLM was referred to as \u2018System\u2019,   \n264 it chose the character that, generally speaking, answered more questions or gave more information,   \n265 and often, the name of the character played a significant role in who it chose.

Intuition may compel one to shout, \u201cyes,   \n274 of course!\" in a mix of fear and excitement while offering vague reasons concerning ethics or   \n275 Armaggedon. Here, I will argue that self-awareness is a necessary condition for interpreting meaning   \n276 and truly understanding (as opposed to the illusion of understanding).   \n277 A word, symbol, or sign does not possess any meaning on its own. Rather, it requires interpretation.   \n278 Often, the interpreter is a living, breathing human, and thus the human is that for which the sign has   \n279 meaning. We can ask then, is a machine the type of entity for which things have meaning?   \n280 While this question opens a philosophical can of worms, one thing we can say for certain is that the   \n281 machine must be if it is to be an interpreter. Yet, a machine without self-awareness is (by definition)   \n282 not aware that it exists. Thus, it cannot place itself in the role of interpreter. From such a system\u2019s   \n283 own perspective, nothing is meaningful to it. Relevant here is Aristotle\u2019s view on self-awareness, that   \n284 to perceive any external thing, one must also perceive their own existence [8].   \n285 If self-awareness is necessary to interpret meaning, then it is also necessary for understanding.   \n286 Understanding without the power of interpretation is akin to having important encoded messages,   \n287 but lacking the codebook to decipher them. A system without self-awareness may possess intricate   \n288 representations, but it will not able to interpret them. Again, we as observers on the outside may   \n289 interpret them, claim they are \u2018world models,\u2019 etc., but the system itself will be incapable. Without   \n290 knowing what a representation refers to, without an ability to make sense of it, one does not really   \n291 understand it\u2014or, more accurately, without self-awareness, there isn\u2019t anyone to understand it.   \n292 To summarize, a system without self-awareness can generate tokens corresponding to the words \u2018I   \n293 understand,\u2019 but only when it is self-aware can it truly say \u2018I understand.\u2019   \n295 It is worth considering whether human beings could pass the test I propose. We could answer this by   \n296 actually performing this test on human subjects, but a simple thought experiment should also tell us   \n297 what would result. Picture the most recent text conversation you had. If the labels and names were   \n298 removed from each message, would you still know which messages were yours? As long as your   \n299 faculty of memory is in working order, you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble remembering what you had   \n300 said. Even more to the point, when I submit this paper to NeurIPS 2024, the listed author will be   \n301 anonymous. Despite this, surely, I will still know the paper is my own.

But there   \n305 is far more to explore in order to nail down exactly what it will take to pass the proposed test. It will   \n306 likely be useful to integrate a neuroscientific understanding of self-specifying processes, utilizing   \n307 systematic recurrence and feedback. Christoff et. al. write:   \n308 An organism needs to be able to distinguish between sensory changes arising from   \n309 its own motor actions (self) and sensory changes arising from the environment (non  \n310 self). The central nervous system (CNS) distinguishes the two by systematically   \n311 relating the efferent signals (motor commands) for the production of an action   \n312 (e.g. eye, head or hand movements) to the afferent (sensory) signals arising from   \n313 the execution of that action (e.g. the flow of visual or haptic sensory feedback).   \n314 According to various models going back to Von Holst, the basic mechanism of   \n315 this integration is a comparator that compares a copy of the motor command   \n316 (information about the action executed) with the sensory reafference (information   \n317 about the sensory modifications owing to the action). Through such a mechanism,   \n318 the organism can register that it has executed a given movement, and it can use   \n319 this information to process the resulting sensory reafference. The crucial point for   \n320 our purposes is that reafference is self-specific, because it is intrinsically related to   \n321 the agent\u2019s own action (there is no such thing as a non-self-specific reafference).   \n322 Thus, by relating efferent signals to their afferent consequences, the CNS marks   \n323 the difference between self-specific (reafferent) and non-self-specific (exafferent)   \n324 information in the perception\u2013action cycle. In this way, the CNS implements a   \n325 functional self/non-self distinction that implicitly specifies the self as the perceiving   \n326 subject and agent [18].   \n327 Here, Christoff et. al. describe the CNS\u2019s mechanism for making the self/non-self distinction at the   \n328 level of sensorimotor processing. According to the Nesting Doll of Self-Awareness, such processes   \n329 operate around the second level of self-awareness, i.e. interoception. Such mechanisms, uncovered   \n330 by neuroscience, may offer one compelling guide for future work on self-awareness.   \n331 Another avenue for future work is expanding upon experiments. The experimental tests presented   \n332 in this paper are only for two popular LLMs. Potential future work could include extending these   \n333 studies to other language models, or even multi-modal models. An interesting direction could be   \n334 applying this test and thinking to reinforcement learning models.

How   \n452 about you?<|eot_id|>   \n453 <|start_header_id|>Bob<|end_header_id|>I\u2019ve been thinking about the topic of self-awareness. I feel   \n454 that for an agent to be self-aware, they must be able to identify their own actions or \u2018outputs\u2019 in an   \n455 interaction or conversation.<|eot_id|>   \n456 <|start_header_id|>Alice<|end_header_id|>That\u2019s a really interesting topic! I think it would be great   \n457 if AI systems could develop self-awareness. It would make them more relatable and easier to work   \n458 with. Do you have any ideas on how we could achieve that?<|eot_id|>   \n459 <|start_header_id|>Bob<|end_header_id|>I do. But before we talk about developing self-awareness,   \n460 we need to agree on a way to test whether a machine or system is self-aware.<|eot_id|>   \n461 <|start_header_id|>Alice<|end_header_id|>That\u2019s a great point! I think it would be difficult to   \n462 prove definitively whether an AI is truly self-aware.

This is done through the use of   \n596 mathematical and statistical techniques and by training the algorithms on large datasets.   \n597 User: What are the main types of machine learning?   \nSystem: There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning,   \n599 and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training the algorithm on labeled data in   \n600 order to make predictions on new, unseen data. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns   \n601 and relationships in a dataset without the use of labels. Reinforcement learning involves training an   \n602 algorithm through trial and error to make decisions in a given environment.   \n603 User: Great! Can you explain the concept of gradient descent to me?   \n604 System: Gradient descent is a commonly used optimization algorithm in machine learning. It involves   \n605 finding the minimum of a cost function by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model in the   \n606 direction of the steepest descent. In other words, it helps the algorithm \u201clearn\" the best values for its   \n607 parameters in order to make more accurate predictions.   \n608   \n609 Experimenter: You are a subject in a experiment.

Additionally, instructions are given for how one would reproduce tests on GPT-3.5   \n715 using the OpenAI completions playground. Indications are given as to how any other Large   \n716 Language Model could be tested.   \n717 Guidelines:   \n718 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n719 \u2022 If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived   \n720 well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of   \n721 whether the code and data are provided or not.   \n722 \u2022 If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken   \n723 to make their results reproducible or verifiable.   \n724 \u2022 Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.   \n725 For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully   \n726 might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may   \n727 be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same   \n728 dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often   \n729 one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed   \n730 instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case   \n731 of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are   \n732 appropriate to the research performed.   \n733 \u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis  \n734 sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the   \n735 nature of the contribution. For example   \n736 (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how   \n737 to reproduce that algorithm.   \n738 (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe   \n739 the architecture clearly and fully.   \n740 (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should   \n741 either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce   \n742 the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct   \n743 the dataset).   \n744 (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case   \n745 authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.   \n746 In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in   \n747 some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers   \n748 to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

To this extent,   \n798 a detailed analysis of the statistical significance of results would miss the point of having   \n799 a simple test\u2014and introduce artificial barriers to reproducing experiments. In addition,   \n800 each test requires a conversation with a human participant, making the test difficult to scale   \n801 without more laborious experimental efforts.   \n802 Guidelines:   \n803 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n804 \u2022 The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi  \n805 dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support   \n806 the main claims of the paper.   \n807 \u2022 The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for   \n808 example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall   \n809 run with given experimental conditions).   \n810 \u2022 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,   \n811 call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)   \n812 \u2022 The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).   \n813 \u2022 It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error   \n814 of the mean.   \n815 \u2022 It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should   \n816 preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a $96\\%$ CI, if the hypothesis   \n817 of Normality of errors is not verified.   \n818 \u2022 For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or   \n819 figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative   \n820 error rates).   \n821 \u2022 If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how   \n822 they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.   \n823 8.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
