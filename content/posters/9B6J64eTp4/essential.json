Accurately modeling these objects in 3D is crucial for applications like robotics and animation, but existing methods often rely on expensive, manually annotated data. This makes creating large-scale datasets for training very difficult.\nThis paper introduces \"Articulate Your NeRF,\" a novel unsupervised method to overcome this limitation. It learns the geometry and movement of an articulated object's parts using only two sets of images showing the object in different poses. This eliminates the need for manual annotations. By using an implicit neural representation and a clever training strategy, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires fewer images, addressing a key challenge in the field.", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "9B6J64eTp4/podcast.wav"}
