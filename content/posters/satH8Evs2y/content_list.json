As AdvRM decouples patches from obstacles, the generation and deployment of patches are independent of specific obstacles, significantly increasing the adaptability of AdvRM in complex traffic scenarios, rendering it capable of changing the depth of unknown obstacles.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
