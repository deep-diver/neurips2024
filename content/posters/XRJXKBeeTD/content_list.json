On an orthogonal dimension, [49] showed that fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier with a subset of classes it had learned led to a huge accuracy drop in the other classes.

[57] showed that a weight interpolation between the pre-trained and fine-tuned models reclaims the pre-trained model\u2019s generalizability. [49] investigated many approaches, including weight interpolation, but found they are insufficient to preserve the accuracy in the other classes.

Compared to domain-incremental learning [33, 31], we do not ask the fine-tuned model to retain its performance in the pre-training domain. That said, the accuracy drop observed in our study and continual learning can all be considered certain forms of catastrophic forgetting [37, 12]. Indeed, a recent survey by Wang et al.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
