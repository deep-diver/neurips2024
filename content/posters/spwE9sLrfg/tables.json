The results demonstrate the performance comparison between the existing tool (C2TACO) and the proposed LLM-based approach (LLMLIFT).", "section": "4.3 TACO"}, {"figure_path": "spwE9sLrfg/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Accuracy on various benchmarks for TACO.", "description": "This table presents the accuracy results of LLMLIFT and C2TACO on various benchmarks for the TACO tensor compiler.  It shows that both tools achieve high accuracy (100%) on most benchmarks, highlighting their effectiveness in generating correct TACO code from C++. However, there are a few benchmarks where C2TACO's accuracy is lower, which are likely more challenging for its enumerative approach. LLMLIFT achieves comparable or better accuracy compared to C2TACO even in these more challenging benchmarks.", "section": "4.3 TACO"}, {"figure_path": "spwE9sLrfg/tables/tables_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Accuracy on various benchmarks for TACO.", "description": "This table presents the accuracy results of LLMLIFT and C2TACO on various benchmarks for the TACO tensor processing compiler.
