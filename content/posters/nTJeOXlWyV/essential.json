This leads to incomplete models of human visual perception, lacking a critical integration of vision and decision-making processes.  Existing attempts to model reaction times (RTs) have limitations, either requiring extensive searches for optimal thresholds or relying on surrogates like uncertainty, which don't fully capture the relationship between RTs and the decision process.\nThe proposed RTify framework addresses these limitations by learning to align a recurrent neural network's (RNN) dynamics with human RTs, using an approximation to constrain the number of time steps an RNN takes to solve a task. RTify can be trained using direct human RT supervision, or via self-penalty, achieving optimal speed-accuracy tradeoffs without human data. The resulting model accurately predicts human RTs and achieves superior performance to existing methods. This framework is extended to integrate with existing CNN models, advancing our understanding of visual decision-making.", "affiliation": "Brown University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "nTJeOXlWyV/podcast.wav"}
