### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) trains agents using pre-collected data, but faces challenges in estimating values of unseen behaviors. Model-based methods address this by creating synthetic data through model rollouts. However, a common practice of truncating rollouts to prevent error accumulation creates 'edge-of-reach' states, where value estimations are bootstrapped from the void, leading to value overestimation and performance collapse. This is the central problem that the paper addresses. 

The paper introduces Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), a novel method directly tackling the edge-of-reach problem by identifying and preventing value overestimation in these critical states.  Unlike existing methods, RAVL maintains high performance even when given perfect dynamics models, making it more reliable and robust than previously proposed methods.  This is achieved by applying a simple value pessimism technique that mitigates the impact of edge-of-reach states.  The results demonstrate that RAVL significantly outperforms existing methods on standard offline RL benchmarks.

### In-depth insights


#### Offline RL Failure
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from pre-collected data, avoiding costly and risky online data collection.  A significant challenge is that offline RL algorithms struggle to accurately estimate the value of actions not present in the dataset. **Model-based methods attempt to overcome this by using a learned dynamics model to generate synthetic data**. However, this paper reveals a critical failure mode: when these methods are given a perfect dynamics model (no model errors), their performance collapses.  This exposes a previously unrecognized limitation, termed the 'edge-of-reach' problem.  The core issue is that training involves limited-horizon rollouts from the dataset, leading to the existence of 'edge-of-reach' states‚Äî**states only reachable at the very end of a rollout**.  These states are used as targets in value updates but are never themselves updated, triggering pathological overestimation and ultimately, failure. The findings challenge prevailing theoretical assumptions, demonstrating that the failure isn't solely due to model inaccuracies. Instead, **it highlights a critical limitation related to the fundamental design of current model-based methods and the way they interact with finite datasets**. This new understanding is crucial for developing more robust and reliable offline RL algorithms.

#### Edge-of-Reach Issue
The "Edge-of-Reach" issue, a novel problem identified in offline model-based reinforcement learning (RL), arises from the **truncation of model rollouts**.  Existing methods, assuming that performance gaps stem solely from model inaccuracies, fail when presented with perfect dynamics. The core problem is that **edge-of-reach states**, reachable only in the final rollout step, are used as targets for Bellman updates but are never updated themselves. This leads to **pathological value overestimation** and complete performance collapse.  The paper highlights the critical oversight in assuming full-horizon rollouts, contrasting with the practical necessity of truncated rollouts to prevent accumulating model errors.  Addressing this "bootstrapping from the void" is crucial for robust offline RL,  especially considering the inevitable improvement of world models in the future.  **Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL)** is proposed as a solution that directly addresses the edge-of-reach problem through value pessimism, maintaining stability even with perfect dynamics, unlike existing approaches.

#### RAVL Solution
The RAVL solution tackles the **edge-of-reach problem** in offline model-based reinforcement learning by directly addressing the issue of value misestimation at states that are only encountered at the end of truncated rollouts.  **Unlike prior methods**, which primarily handle model inaccuracies through uncertainty penalties that vanish when using a perfect dynamics model, RAVL uses value pessimism via an ensemble of Q-functions.  This approach effectively detects and penalizes overestimation at these edge-of-reach states, preventing catastrophic failure even as the model improves. The method's simplicity and robustness are demonstrated through experiments, showing strong performance on standard benchmarks and stability across hyperparameters, a significant step towards creating more robust and reliable offline RL agents.

#### Unified RL View
A unified RL view seeks to bridge the gap between model-based and model-free offline reinforcement learning methods.  **Model-free methods** typically address the out-of-sample action problem through conservatism, while **model-based methods** leverage learned dynamics models for synthetic data generation. A unified perspective reveals that both approaches implicitly grapple with the core issue of value misestimation due to limited data coverage and horizon truncation.  **The edge-of-reach problem**, a key insight, highlights how model-based methods, despite their focus on model accuracy, can still fail due to states only reachable after k-step rollouts, leading to catastrophic overestimation. **A unified approach** would recognize that both model-free and model-based methods suffer from similar fundamental limitations regarding out-of-distribution states and actions, offering a chance for developing more robust and generalized offline RL algorithms.

#### Future Offline RL
Future offline reinforcement learning (RL) research should prioritize addressing the **edge-of-reach problem**, a critical oversight in current model-based methods.  This problem arises from the truncation of model rollouts, leading to pathological value overestimation and performance collapse, even with perfect dynamics models.  Future work must focus on **robust methods that explicitly handle edge-of-reach states**, such as Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL) or similar techniques.  Furthermore, research should explore **unified frameworks that bridge the gap between model-based and model-free offline RL**, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to address the limitations of each.  This will require addressing **out-of-distribution action problems** and developing effective methods for handling uncertainty in both dynamics and reward models.  Finally, extensive empirical evaluation on diverse and challenging benchmarks is crucial to ensure the generalizability and robustness of future offline RL algorithms.  **Improving dynamics models alone is insufficient; a more comprehensive solution necessitates robust value estimation techniques.**

> This figure illustrates the edge-of-reach problem in offline model-based reinforcement learning. The left panel shows how k-step rollouts from a fixed dataset can lead to states (edge-of-reach states) that are only reachable in the final step of a rollout and are never updated during training. The right panel shows how this affects the Bellman update, leading to value overestimation and performance collapse.  The figure highlights the difference between states that are updated (because they are reachable in less than k steps) and states that are used for targets but never updated (edge-of-reach states).

> This figure shows the results of the base offline model-based RL algorithm on the D4RL Walker2d-medexp benchmark.  The left panel shows the normalized score over training epochs, indicating that the algorithm fails to learn a good policy. The right panel shows the Q-values over training epochs, illustrating a dramatic, exponential increase that signifies pathological value overestimation.  This comparison highlights the significant performance degradation and instability of the base method, which serves as a key motivation for introducing the proposed RAVL algorithm.

> This figure shows the results of experiments conducted on a simple environment designed to isolate the edge-of-reach problem.  It compares four different approaches: the base model-based offline RL method (which fails), a version of the base method where oracle Q-values are patched into edge-of-reach states (which succeeds), and RAVL (the proposed solution, which also succeeds).  The visualization includes reward functions, final policies, training returns, and Q-value evolution over training. This illustrates that the edge-of-reach problem is causing the failures of base methods, and that RAVL successfully addresses the problem by preventing overestimation of values in the edge-of-reach states.

> This figure shows the distribution of the effective RAVL penalty for within-reach and edge-of-reach states in the simple environment described in Section 4.  The box plot summarizes the distribution, while the histogram provides a more detailed view. As intended, the penalty is significantly higher for edge-of-reach states than for within-reach states, demonstrating that RAVL successfully identifies and penalizes these critical states.

> This figure shows the positive correlation between the dynamics uncertainty penalty used in MOPO and the variance of the value ensemble in RAVL.  This suggests that existing methods, which focus on dynamics uncertainty, might indirectly address the edge-of-reach problem, even without explicitly acknowledging it.  The correlation coefficients provided quantify the strength of this relationship across three different D4RL benchmark environments.

> This figure visualizes the rollouts sampled during training in a simple environment for three different methods: the base method, Base-OraclePatch (which uses oracle Q-values to correct for edge-of-reach states), and RAVL.  It shows how the base method's rollouts are increasingly concentrated in edge-of-reach states (red), leading to its failure. Base-OraclePatch successfully avoids this issue by using oracle values. RAVL mimics the behavior of Base-OraclePatch, indicating its effectiveness in addressing the edge-of-reach problem.
