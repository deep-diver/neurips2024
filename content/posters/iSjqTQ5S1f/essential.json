However, traditional CBMs treat concepts independently, limiting intervention effectiveness.  They also require manual concept annotation, a time-consuming process. \n\nThis work introduces Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (SCBMs), which model concept dependencies using a multivariate normal distribution.  This approach enables efficient, scalable computation of intervention effects.  SCBMs also use a novel intervention strategy based on confidence regions and demonstrate improved intervention effectiveness on various datasets, even with CLIP-inferred concepts, thereby bypassing the need for manual annotation.  The study demonstrates significant improvements in intervention effectiveness, particularly when utilizing a small number of interventions.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "iSjqTQ5S1f/podcast.wav"}
