### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) struggle with compositional generalization‚Äîcombining learned skills in novel ways.  A recent study, SKILL-MIX, showed that while larger models performed well, smaller models struggled. This creates a significant challenge in advancing AI capabilities.  This limitation poses a major obstacle for research, limiting the ability to create more versatile and intelligent AI systems that can handle complex real-world tasks effectively. 

This work tackles this challenge by investigating whether fine-tuning smaller LLMs on examples of combined skills can improve their composition abilities.  **The researchers fine-tuned smaller models on data generated by a larger model (GPT-4) exhibiting combinations of 1, 2, or 3 skills.**  Their results demonstrated noticeable improvements in composing texts with up to 5 skills‚Äîeven those not seen during training, showing enhanced generalization.  **This suggests that training on skill combinations is more effective than training on individual skills alone.** This finding offers a potentially more efficient approach to improve the compositional skills of LLMs.

#### Why does it matter?

> This figure illustrates the three-stage pipeline used to evaluate the models' ability to generalize skill combinations.  First, a dataset is generated using GPT-4, where the generated texts exhibit combinations of up to three training skills on training topics. Then, smaller language models (LLaMA-2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) are fine-tuned using this dataset. Finally, the fine-tuned models are evaluated on their ability to combine up to five skills (including held-out skills unseen during training) on held-out topics. The evaluation measures the models' compositional generalization capabilities.

> This table summarizes the notations used in the data generation section (Section 3.1) of the paper.  It defines various symbols representing the skill sets (all skills, training skills, held-out skills), topic sets (all topics, training topics, held-out topics), and the datasets generated for different numbers of skills (k=1,2,3). The table also specifies the size of each set and provides additional context about how the datasets were created.





### In-depth insights


#### Skill Composition
The concept of 'Skill Composition' in large language models (LLMs) explores the ability of these models to combine multiple learned skills in novel ways, going beyond simple memorization or retrieval.  **Effective skill composition is crucial for demonstrating genuine intelligence and compositional generalization**, enabling LLMs to solve complex problems that require combining diverse capabilities.  The research delves into how LLMs learn this skill, often investigating the impact of training data and model architecture.  **Fine-tuning LLMs on data explicitly showcasing combinations of skills seems to improve their compositional abilities significantly**, even when tested on unseen combinations.  This suggests that LLMs learn a higher-order skill, a meta-skill, enabling them to generalize beyond the training examples.  However, **limitations remain**, as the ability to compose many skills concurrently is still challenging, highlighting the need for further research in enhancing the compositional capabilities of LLMs.

#### Fine-tuning Effects
Fine-tuning's effects on language models are multifaceted and significant.  **Improved performance on downstream tasks** is frequently observed, showcasing the model's enhanced ability to adapt to specific requirements.  However, the extent of improvement is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of the fine-tuning data.  **Overfitting** can be a considerable concern, especially with smaller datasets or insufficient regularization, leading to decreased generalization to unseen data.  **Catastrophic forgetting**, where the model loses proficiency in previously learned skills, is another potential risk. Therefore, careful consideration of data selection, model architecture, and regularization techniques are crucial for successful fine-tuning and achieving the desired balance between enhanced performance and robust generalization.

#### Generalization Limits
The heading 'Generalization Limits' prompts a deep dive into the boundaries of a model's ability to extrapolate learned skills to unseen situations.  A key consideration is **compositional generalization**, where the model's capacity to combine previously learned skills in novel ways is examined.  This section would likely explore the scenarios where this ability breaks down, perhaps focusing on the complexity of skill combinations or the presence of **unseen skill interactions**.  It may also delve into the data requirements, analyzing how much training data is needed to achieve robust generalization and how the characteristics of the dataset (diversity of skills, distribution of skill combinations) affect the limits.  Furthermore, a discussion of the model's architecture and its inherent inductive biases will likely be included, as these factors significantly influence generalization capabilities.  Ultimately, this section would pinpoint the critical factors that constrain a model's generalization ability, offering insights into the future research directions needed to overcome these limitations and enable more versatile AI systems.  **The impact of model size and pretraining on generalization** would be a major theme, as well as the challenges of evaluating generalization performance effectively.

#### Data Efficiency
The study reveals crucial insights into data efficiency in achieving compositional generalization.  **Fine-tuning on a smaller dataset comprising texts with fewer skill combinations (k=1,2,3) demonstrably improves the model's ability to compose texts with a higher number of skills (k=4,5), even those unseen during training.** This suggests that the models are not merely memorizing specific skill combinations but are learning a higher-order, generalizable skill of composition.  **The inclusion of texts with a larger 'k' during fine-tuning proves significantly more data-efficient than using only simpler combinations**, highlighting the importance of training data diversity and complexity.  These findings challenge existing assumptions about the scaling requirements for compositional generalization and pave the way for more efficient training strategies. The results strongly suggest that carefully curated, skill-rich datasets, even if small, can be exceptionally effective in enhancing model capabilities.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Expanding the scope of skills** beyond those used in the SKILL-MIX evaluation is crucial to assess generalization more broadly.  **Investigating the impact of training data size** and composition on the compositional abilities of smaller models would also refine our understanding.  **A deeper dive into the interplay between model size and compositional generalization** is warranted, especially given the current findings. **Exploring alternative training paradigms** beyond fine-tuning, perhaps focusing on meta-learning or transfer learning techniques, may lead to significant improvements. Finally, **robust evaluation methods** are needed to accurately measure compositional generalization across various skill sets and model architectures.  This multifaceted approach would solidify our understanding of skill composition and its implications for enhancing LLM capabilities.

The models tested include LLaMA-2-13B-Chat, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and GPT-4.  Both the fine-tuned and original versions of LLaMA-2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct are included.
