Each game type is tested under full feedback and noisy feedback conditions.  The plots show the convergence rate (measured by the gap function for random payoff games and the tangent residual for hard concave-convex games) over iterations.  Shaded areas represent the standard error of the results.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "TI7Vy90B9j/figures/figures_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Dynamic regret for GABP, APGA, and OGA with full and noisy feedback.", "description": "This figure compares the dynamic regret of three algorithms (GABP, APGA, and OGA) under two feedback settings (full and noisy).  The dynamic regret measures how much worse an algorithm performs compared to the best strategy in hindsight.  The plot shows the dynamic regret against the number of iterations, enabling a direct comparison of the algorithms' performance and stability in both full and noisy feedback environments.  The results indicate the relative efficiency and robustness of the algorithms in handling noisy information.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
