For input image with size H \u00d7 W, DCDepth estimates the DCT coefficients for each S \u00d7 S depth patches. The prediction follows a global-to-local strategy, starting with the initial estimation of lower-frequency components to capture the global scene structure. Subsequently, higher-frequency components are estimated to enhance the local details, while the lower-frequency estimates are refined. The estimation is carried out at H \u00d7 W resolution, and spatial-domain estimation is achieved through inverse DCT.", "description": "This figure illustrates the progressive depth estimation process used in DCDepth.  The input image is divided into SxS patches, and their DCT coefficients are predicted progressively, starting with low-frequency components to establish the global structure and then iteratively refining the prediction with higher-frequency components to add finer details. The process continues until all frequency components are predicted, after which inverse DCT reconstructs the final depth map.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "463TE4N8VJ/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Evolution of intermediate depth estimations.
