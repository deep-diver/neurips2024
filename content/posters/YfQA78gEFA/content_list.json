Most neural VRP methods learn construction heuristics, which are mainly divided into two categories, i.e., autoregressive and non-autoregressive ones. Autoregressive methods sequentially construct the solution by adding one feasible node at each step. [71] proposes the Pointer Network (Ptr-Net) to solve TSP with supervised learning. Subsequent works train Ptr-Net with RL to solve TSP [1] and CVRP [51]. [37] introduces the attention model (AM) based on the Transformer architecture [69] to solve a wide range of COPs including TSP and CVRP. [38] further proposes the policy optimization with multiple optima (POMO), which improves upon AM by exploiting solution symmetries. Further advancements [39, 34, 3, 24, 13, 44, 27, 45, 21, 12] are often developed on top of AM and POMO. Regarding non-autoregressive methods, the solution is typically constructed in a one-shot manner without iterative forward passing through the model. [31] leverages the graph convolutional network to predict the probability of each edge appearing on the optimal tour (i.e., heat-map) using supervised learning. Recent works [17, 36, 56, 64, 49, 82, 33, 77] further improve its performance and scalability by using advanced models, training paradigms, and search strategies. We refer to [40, 28, 83, 88] for scalability studies, to [30, 5, 90, 18, 41, 16, 89, 4] for generalization studies, and to [11, 59, 84, 61] for other COP studies. On the other hand, some neural methods learn improvement heuristics to refine an initial feasible solution iteratively, until a termination condition is satisfied. In this line of research, the classic local search methods and specialized heuristic solvers for VRPs are usually exploited [8, 43, 10, 76, 47, 78, 46]. In general, the improvement heuristics can achieve better performance than the construction ones, but at the expense of much longer inference time.

There is a recent research trend on the robustness of neural methods for COPs [68, 20, 42], with only a few works on VRPs [87, 20, 42]. In general, they primarily focus on attacking neural construction heuristics by introducing effective perturbation models to generate adversarial instances that are underperformed by the current model. Following the AT paradigm, [87] perturbs node coordinates of TSP instances by solving an inner maximization problem (similar to the fast gradient sign method [22]), and trains the model with a hardness-aware instance-reweighted loss function. [20] proposes an efficient and sound perturbation model, which ensures the optimal solution to the perturbed TSP instance can be directly derived. It adversarially inserts several nodes into the clean instance by maximizing the cross-entropy over the edges, so that the predicted route is maximally different from the derived optimal one. [42] leverages a noworse optimal cost guarantee (i.e., by lowering the cost of a partial problem) to generate adversarial instances for asymmetric TSP.

The vanilla AT, as formulated by [48] through min-max optimization, has inspired significant advancements in the field [65, 60, 85, 7, 86]. 2) Language: This domain investigates how malicious inputs (e.g., characters and words) can deceive (large) language models into making incorrect decisions or producing unintended outcomes [14, 72, 50, 91, 74]. Challenges include the discrete nature of natural languages and the complexity of linguistic structures, necessitating sophisticated techniques for generating and defending against adversarial attacks. 3) Graph: Graph neural networks are also susceptible to adversarial perturbations in the underlying graph structures [92], prompting research to enhance their robustness [29, 15, 19, 23, 63]. Similar to the language domain, challenges stem from the discrete nature of graphs and the interconnected nature of graph data.

Most ML research on adversarial robustness focuses on the continuous image domain [22, 48]. We would like to highlight two main differences in the context of discrete VRPs (or COPs). 1) Imperceptible perturbation: The adversarial instance $\\tilde{x}$ is typically generated within a small neighborhood of the clean instance $x$ , so that the adversarial perturbation is imperceptible to human eyes. For example, the adversarial instance in image related tasks is typically bounded by $\\mathcal{N}_{\\epsilon}[x]:\\|x-\\tilde{x}\\|_{p}\\leq\\epsilon$ under the $l_{p}$ norm threat model. When the attack budget $\\epsilon$ is small enough, $\\tilde{x}$ retains the GT label of $x$ . However, it is not the case for VRPs due to the nature of discreteness. The optimal solution can be significantly changed even if only a small part of the instance is modified. Therefore, the subjective imperceptible perturbation is not a realistic goal in VRPs, and we do not exert such an explicit imperceptible constraint on the perturbation model (see Appendix A for further discussions). In this paper, we set the attack budget within a reasonable range based on the attack methods. 2) Accuracy-robustness trade-off: The standard generalization and adversarial robustness seem to be conflicting goals in image related tasks. With increasing adversarial robustness the standard generalization tends to decrease, and a number of works intend to mitigate such a trade-off in the image domain [66, 85, 73, 57, 80]. By contrast, a recent work [20] claims the existence of neural solvers with high accuracy and robustness in COPs. They state that a sufficiently expressive model does not suffer from the trade-off given the problem-specific efficient and sound perturbation model, which guarantees the correct GT label of the perturbed instance. However, by following the vanilla AT, we empirically observe that the undesirable trade-off may still exist in VRPs (as shown in Fig. 1), which is mainly due to the insufficient model capacity under the specific perturbation model. Furthermore, similar to combinatorial optimization, although the language and graph domains are also discrete, their methods cannot be trivially adapted to VRPs (see Appendix A).

For each model, the neural router distributes the instances with TopK-largest predicted probabilities as a batch for its training (line 10-13). In doing so, all models have the same amount $(\\mathcal{K})$ of training instances, which explicitly ensures the load balancing (see Appendix A).

Instead of simply training multiple models, the effectiveness of the proposed collaboration mechanism in CNF can be attributed to its diverse adversarial data generation and the reasonable exploit of overall model capacity. As shown in the ablation study (Fig. 3(a)), the diverse adversarial data generation is helpful in further improving the adversarial robustness (see results of CNF vs. W/O Global Attack). Meanwhile, the neural router has a bigger effect in mitigating the trade-off (see results of CNF vs. W/O Router). Intuitively, by distributing instances to suitable submodels for training, each submodel might be stimulated to have its own expertise. Accordingly, the overlap of their vulnerability areas may be decreased, which could promote the collaborative performance of CNF. As shown in Fig. 5, not all models perform well on each kind of instance. The expertise of $\\theta_{0}$ lies primarily in handling clean instances, whereas $\\theta_{1}$ specializes in dealing with adversarial instances. Such diversity in submodels contributes to the collaborative efficacy of $\\Theta$ and the mitigation of the undesirable trade-off between standard generalization and adversarial robustness, thereby significantly outperforming vanilla AT with multiple models.

The collaborative performance of our framework depends on the best-performing model $\\theta_{b}$ w.r.t. each instance, since its solution will be chosen as the final solution during inference. The goal of inner maximization is to construct the adversarial instance that can successfully fool the framework. Intuitively, if we choose to attack other models (rather than $\\theta_{b}$ ), the constructed adversarial instances may not successfully fool the best-performing model $\\theta_{b}$ , and therefore the final solution to the adversarial instance could still be good, which contradicts the goal of inner maximization. Therefore, to increase the success rate of attacking the framework and generate more diverse adversarial instances, for each instance, we choose the corresponding best-performing model $\\theta_{b}$ as the global model in each attack iteration.

During training, in each step of solution construction, the decoder of the neural solver selects the valid node to be visited by sampling from the probability distribution, rather than using the argmax operation. Even though we initialize all models using the same pretrained model, given the same attack hyperparameters (e.g., attack iterations), the adversarial instances generated by different models are generally not the same at the beginning of the training. Therefore, the same initial models can diverge to different models due to the training on different (adversarial) instances. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Larger Model. In addition to training multiple models, increasing the number of parameters for a single model is another way of enhancing the overall model capacity. However, technically, 1) a larger model needs more GPU memory, which puts more requirements on a single GPU device. It is also more sophisticated to enable parallel training on multiple GPUs compared to the counterpart with multiple models; 2) currently, our method conducts AT upon the pretrained model, but there does not exist a larger pretrained model (e.g., larger POMO) in the literature. Despite the technical issues, we try to pretrain a larger POMO (i.e., 18 encoder layers with 3.64M parameters in total) on the uniform distributed data, and further conduct the vanilla AT. The performance is around $0.335\\%$ and $0.406\\%$ on clean and adversarial instances, respectively, which is inferior to the counterpart with multiple models (i.e., POMO_AT (3)). The superiority of multiple models may be attributed to its ensemble effect and the capacity in learning multiple diverse policies. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Advanced AT Methods in Other Domains. In this paper, we mainly focus on the vanilla AT [48]. More advanced AT techniques, such as TRADES [85], AT in RL [55], and ensemble-based AT [65, 32, 53, 79, 81] can be further considered. However, some of them may not be applicable to the VRP domain due to their needs for ground-truth labels or the dependence on the imperceptible perturbation model. 1) TRADES is empirically effective for trading adversarial robustness off against standard generalization on the image classification task. Its loss function is formulated as $\\bar{\\mathcal{L}}=\\mathrm{CE}(f(x),y)\\bar{+}\\,\\beta\\mathrm{KL}(f(x),f(\\tilde{x}))$ , where CE is cross-entropy; KL is KL-divergence; $x$ is a clean instance; $\\tilde{x}$ is an adversarial instance; $f(x)$ is the logit predicted by the model; $y$ is the ground-truth label; $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter. By explicitly making the outputs of the network (logits) similar for $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ , it can mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off. However, the above statement is contingent upon the imperceptible perturbation model, where the ground-truth labels of $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ are kept the same. As we discussed in Section 3.2, in the discrete VRPs, the perturbation model does not have such an imperceptible constraint, and the optimal solutions to $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ are not the same in the general case. Therefore, it does not make sense to make the outputs of the model similar for $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ . 2) Another interesting direction is AT in RL, where the focus is the attack side rather than the defense side (e.g., most of the design in [55] focuses on the adversarial agent). Specifically, it jointly trains another agent (i.e., the attacker or adversary), whose objective is to impede the first agent, to generate hard trajectories in a two-player zero-sum way. Its goal is to learn a policy that is robust to modeling errors in simulation or mismatch between training and test scenarios. In contrast, our work focuses on the defense side and aims to mitigate the trade-off between standard generalization and adversarial robustness. Moreover, this method is specific to RL while our framework has the potential to work with the supervised learning setting. Overall, it is non-trivial to directly apply this method to address our research problem (e.g., the trade-off). But it is an interesting future research direction to design attack methods specific to RL (e.g., by training another adversarial agent or attacking each step of MDP). 3) Similar to the proposed CNF, ensemble-based AT also leverages multiple models, but with a different motivation (e.g., reducing the adversarial transferability between models to defend against black-box adversarial attacks [79]). Concretely, ADP [53] needs the ground-truth labels to calculate the ensemble diversity. DVERGE [79] depends on the misalignment of the distilled feature between the visual similarity and the classification result, and hence on the imperceptible perturbation model. Therefore, it is non-trivial to directly adapt them to the discrete VRP domain. DivTrain [32] proposes to decrease the gradient similarity loss to reduce the overall adversarial transferability between models, and TRS [81] further uses a model smoothness loss to improve the ensemble robustness. Technically, their methods are computational expensive due to the needs to keep the computational graph before taking an optimization step. We show their empirical results in Table 7. Compared with others, their empirical results are not superior in VRPs. For example, for TSP100, POMO_TRS (3), which is adapted from [81], achieves $0.098\\%$ and $0.528\\%$ on the metrics of Uniform and Fixed Adv., respectively, failing to mitigate the undesirable trade-off. We leave the discussion on defensive methods from other domains (e.g., language and graph) to Section 2. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Attack Budget. As discussed in Section 3.2, we do not exert the imperceptible constraint on the perturbation model in VRPs. We further explain it from two perspectives: 1) different from other domains, there is no theoretical guarantee to ensure the invariance of the optimal solution (or groundtruth label), given an imperceptible perturbation. A small change on even one node\u2019s attribute may induce a totally different optimal solution. Therefore, we do not see the benefit of constraining the attack budget to a very small (i.e., imperceptible) range in VRP tasks. Moreover, even with the absence of the imperceptible constraint on the perturbation model, unlike the graph learning setting, we do not observe a significant degradation on clean performance. It reveals that we don\u2019t need explicit imperceptible perturbation to restrain the changes on (clean) objective values in VRPs. In our experiments, we set the attack budget within a reasonable range following the applied attack method (e.g., $\\alpha\\in[1,100]$ for [87]). Our experimental results show that the proposed CNF is able to achieve a favorable balance, given different attack methods and their attack budgets; 2) in VRPs (or COPs), all generated adversarial instances are valid problem instances regardless of how much they differ from the clean instances [20]. In this sense, the attack budget models the severity of a potential distribution shift between training data and test data. This highlights the differences to other domains (e.g., vision), where unconstrained perturbations may lead to non-realistic or invalid data. Technically, the various attack budgets can help to generate diverse adversarial instances for training. Considering the above aspects, we believe our adversarial setting, including diverse but valid problem instances, may benefit the VRP community in developing a more general and robust neural solver. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "With that said, this paper can also be viewed as an attempt to improve the generalization of neural VRP solvers from the perspective of adversarial robustness. ", "page_idx": 17}, {"type": "text", "text": "Attack Scenarios and Practical Significance. Actually, there may not be a person or attacker to deliberately invade the VRP model in practice. However, the developers in a logistics enterprise should consider the adversarial robustness of neural solvers as a sanity check before deploying them in the real world. The adversarial attack can be viewed as a way of measuring the worst-case performance of neural solvers within the neighborhood of inputs. Without considering adversarial robustness, the neural solver may perform very poorly (see Fig. 1(c)) when the testing instance pattern in the real world is 1) different from the training one, and 2) similar to the adversarial one. For example, considering an enterprise like Amazon, when some new customers need to be added to the current configuration or instance, especially when their locations coincidentally lead to the adversarial instance of the current solver (i.e., the node insertion attack presented in Appendix B.2), the model without considering adversarial robustness may output a very bad solution, and thus resulting in unpleasant user experience and financial losses. Furthermore, one may argue that this robustness issue can be ameliorated by using other solvers, i.e., NCO alongside traditional heuristics. We would like to note that traditional solvers may be non-robust as well, as discussed in a recent work [42]. The availability of traditional solvers cannot be guaranteed for novel problems as well. ", "page_idx": 17}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Selection Basis of Attackers. There are three attackers in the current VRP literature [87, 20, 42]. We select the attacker based on its generality. Specifically, 1) [20] is an early work that explicitly investigates the adversarial robustness in COPs. Their perturbation model needs to be sound and efficient, which means, given a clean instance and its optimal solution, the optimal solution to the adversarial instance can be directly derived without running a solver. However, this direct derivation requires unique properties and theorems of certain problems (e.g., the intersection theorem [9] for Euclidean-based TSP), and hence is non-trivial to generalize to more complicated VRPs (e.g., CVRP). Moreover, their perturbation model is limited to attack the supervised neural solver (i.e., ConvTSP [31]), since it needs to construct the adversarial instance by maximizing the loss function so that the model prediction is maximally different from the derived optimal solution. While in VRPs, RL-based methods [37, 38] are more appealing since they can gain comparable performance without the need for optimal solutions. 2) [42] requires that the optimal solution to the adversarial instance is no worse than that to the clean instance in theory, which may limit the search space of adversarial instances. It focuses on the graph-based COPs (e.g., asymmetric TSP) and satisfies the requirement by lowering the cost of edges. Similar to [20], their method is not easy to design for VRPs with more constraints. Moreover, they resort to the black-box adversarial attack method by training a reinforcement learning based attacker, which may lead to a higher computational complexity and relatively low success rate of attacking. Therefore, for better generality, we choose [87] as the attacker in the main paper, which can be applied to different VRP variants and popular VRP solvers [37, 38]. Moreover, we also evaluate the versatility of CNF against [42] as presented in Appendix D.3. ", "page_idx": 17}, {"type": "text", "text": "Training Efficiency. As mentioned in Section 6, the limitation of the proposed CNF is the increased computational complexity due to the need to synergistically train multiple models. Concretely, we empirically observe that CNF requires more training time than the vanilla AT variants on TSP100 (e.g., POMO_AT (3) 32 hrs vs. CNF (3) $85\\;\\mathrm{hrs})$ ). However, simply further training them cannot significantly increase their performance since the training process has nearly converged. For example, given roughly the same training time, POMO_AT achieves $0.246\\%$ and $0.278\\%$ while CNF achieves $0.118\\%$ and $0.236\\%$ on the metrics of Uniform and Fixed Adv., respectively. On the other hand, our training time is less than that of advanced AT methods (e.g., POMO_TRS (3) [81] needs around 94 hrs). The above comparison indicates that CNF can achieve a better trade-off to deliver superior results within a reasonable computational budget. Moreover, we find that the global attack generation consumes much more training time than the neural router $_{\\sim0.05}$ million parameters). During inference, the computational complexity of CNF only depends on the number of models, since the neural router is only activated during training, and is discarded afterwards. Therefore, all methods with the same number of trained models have the same inference time.

Generally, the adversarial robustness measures the generalization capability of a model over the perturbed instance $\\tilde{x}$ in the proximity of the clean instance $x$ . In the context of VRPs (or COPs), adversarial instances are neither anomalous nor statistical defects since they are valid problem instances regardless of how much they differ from the clean instance $x$ [20]. In contrast to other domains (e.g., vision), 1) the attack budget models the severity of a potential distribution shift between training data and test data; 2) the set of valid problems is not just a low-dimensional manifold in a high-dimensional space, and hence the manifold hypothesis [62] does not apply to combinatorial optimization. Therefore, it is critical for neural VRP solvers to perform well on adversarial instances when striving for a broader OOD generalization. Based on experimental results, we empirically demonstrate that raising robustness against attacks through CNF favorably promotes various forms of generalization of neural VRP solvers (as shown in Section 5.3), indicating the potential existence of neural VRP solvers with high generalization and robustness concurrently.

Test-time adaptation methods [26, 56, 82] are relatively robust. This degree of \"robustness\" primarily comes from 1) traditional local search heuristics and metaheuristics, which can effectively handle perturbations but bring much postprocessing runtime, or 2) the costly fine-tuning that incurs more inference time on each test instance. Our CNF can also be combined with them to pursue better performance. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on DIMES [56] and DeepACO [82]. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4, where we observe that 1) CNF outperforms them in most cases (e.g., w/o advanced search) with a much shorter runtime, and 2) test-time adaptation methods (i.e., the purple columns) improve robustness by adopting much post-search effort and consuming hours of runtime. According to the results, we note that 1) directly comparing CNF with these methods with advanced searches (e.g., MCTS, NLS) is somewhat unfair, since the additional post-processing search makes the analysis of model robustness difficult. For example, recent work finds that MCTS is so strong that using an almost all-zero heatmap can achieve good solutions [77], raising doubts about the real robustness of learned models; 2) the post-processing searches are typically time-consuming and problem-specific, making them non-trivial to be adapted to other COPs. Finally, we highlight that studies on robustness in COPs are still rare, and most work focused on investigating the robustness of neural solvers themselves, due to their advantages in generality on more complex COPs and inference speed.
