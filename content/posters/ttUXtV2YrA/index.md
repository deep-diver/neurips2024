### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often considered as alternatives. While some works try to integrate both, they apply these operators simultaneously at the finest granularity. This approach causes scalability issues, making it difficult to adapt ViTs to high-resolution images.  Previous works usually apply heavy multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to every pixel of the input. This is computationally expensive. In addition, Convs are already efficient in extracting per-pixel features. Therefore, it is unnecessary to apply MHSA to every pixel.

This paper proposes GLMix, a novel approach to address this issue by using convolutions and MHSAs at different granularities.  It represents images using both a fine-grained grid (for convolutions) and a coarse-grained set of semantic slots (for MHSAs).  A fully differentiable soft clustering module bridges these representations, enabling local-global fusion.  Experiments demonstrate GLMix's efficiency and superior performance on various vision tasks, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs.

### In-depth insights


#### Conv-Attn Fusion
Conv-Attn fusion strategies in vision models aim to synergistically leverage the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers.  CNNs excel at capturing local spatial features efficiently, while transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies and global context.  Naive approaches often apply both simultaneously at the same granularity, which is computationally expensive and may not fully realize the potential benefits of each.  **A more effective strategy is to integrate them at different granularities**.  For example, CNNs can be employed for high-resolution, fine-grained feature extraction, and transformers can operate on a coarser level to model global relationships between semantic regions.  This hierarchical approach reduces computational cost.  **Key challenges include designing mechanisms to effectively bridge the different feature representations (fine-grained and coarse-grained) for fusion**.  This might involve attention-based mechanisms to selectively incorporate global context into local feature maps or clustering strategies to group pixels into semantically meaningful regions. The effectiveness of a Conv-Attn fusion architecture hinges on balancing computational efficiency with performance gains, especially for high-resolution images.  **Careful design of the fusion mechanism is vital** to avoid introducing artifacts or hindering performance.

#### Granularity Matters
The concept of 'Granularity Matters' in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) highlights the crucial role of the level of detail at which operations are performed.  **Effective integration of CNNs and ViTs necessitates a nuanced approach to granularity**, recognizing that CNNs excel at fine-grained local feature extraction while ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global relationships.  A single granularity for both approaches is suboptimal; instead, **a hybrid model leveraging parallel processing at different granularities, merging local and global information, demonstrates superior performance**.  This involves applying convolutions to a fine-grained image grid for local features and self-attention mechanisms to a coarser, semantically meaningful representation for global context, potentially achieving a balance between efficiency and accuracy. The success of such an approach depends on **a clever mechanism to seamlessly fuse the information extracted at these disparate levels of detail**, emphasizing the significance of thoughtful design in combining these powerful architectures.

#### Soft Clustering
Soft clustering, in the context of the provided research paper, appears to be a crucial component of a novel approach to integrating convolutional and self-attention mechanisms in vision backbones.  **Instead of using hard clustering methods like k-means, which are computationally expensive and non-differentiable, the authors propose a fully differentiable soft clustering module.**  This allows for seamless integration within a neural network architecture, facilitating end-to-end optimization. The soft clustering module seemingly achieves meaningful semantic grouping of features, even with only image-level classification supervision, suggesting **a potential for improved interpretability and inspiration for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation approaches.** This innovative technique efficiently bridges local (convolutional) and global (self-attention) feature representations, significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of the vision backbone while mitigating the scalability issues associated with traditional methods. The **use of a soft clustering mechanism stands out as a key differentiator and a significant contribution of this research.**

#### GLNet: Efficiency
The efficiency of GLNet stems from its novel integration of convolutions and multi-head self-attentions at different granularities.  **Offloading the burden of fine-grained feature extraction to lightweight convolutions allows the computationally expensive MHSA modules to operate on a smaller set of semantic slots**, significantly reducing computational cost. This approach contrasts with existing methods that apply both operators at the same fine-grained level, leading to scalability issues with high-resolution inputs.  The use of a fully differentiable soft clustering mechanism to bridge the grid and set representations further enhances efficiency by enabling a more effective local-global feature fusion without the need for iterative or heuristic approaches.  **GLNet's architecture, combined with these optimizations, achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high throughput and reducing FLOPs**, demonstrating its significant efficiency gains compared to existing vision backbones.

#### Future: Dynamic Slots
The concept of "Future: Dynamic Slots" suggests a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed GLMix architecture.  **Static slots**, as currently implemented, limit the model's ability to respond effectively to the diverse range of visual information present in different images. A system with **dynamically allocated slots** would allow the model to focus computational resources where they are most needed, improving performance on complex scenes.  This could involve a mechanism that adjusts the number of slots or their spatial distribution based on the scene's content. **Computational efficiency** will be crucial; any added complexity must not outweigh the performance gains.  Implementing such a system would likely require a novel slot allocation strategy, perhaps incorporating a learned attention mechanism that guides resource allocation.  **Interpretability** could also benefit, as visualizing the dynamic slot assignments may provide further insight into the model's decision-making process. The research should focus on both enhancing efficiency and maintaining or improving the model's accuracy. **Success** will require careful consideration of computational cost, training stability, and the impact on overall model accuracy.

The GLMix block integrates convolutional and multi-head self-attention operations at different granularities.

A pair of fully differentiable soft clustering and dispatching modules are used to bridge these representations, enabling the fusion of local and global features. The clustering module groups the fine-grained features into semantic slots, while the dispatching module redistributes the processed features from the slots back to the grid.  This architecture aims to combine the strengths of both local (convolution) and global (self-attention) feature processing, achieving efficient local-global feature fusion.
