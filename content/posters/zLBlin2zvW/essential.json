This bias negatively impacts reconstruction fidelity and the interpretability of extracted features.  Addressing this limitation is crucial for advancing research in mechanistic interpretability.\nThe paper introduces Gated Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which overcome the limitations of SAEs by separating feature selection and magnitude estimation. The key is applying the L1 penalty only to the feature selection process. Results show that GSAEs achieve Pareto improvements over baseline SAEs across various models and layers, offering better reconstruction fidelity at similar sparsity levels, thus resolving the shrinkage issue.  Human evaluation suggests comparable interpretability.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "zLBlin2zvW/podcast.wav"}
