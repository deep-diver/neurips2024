The x-axis represents the lower bound on the minimum gap (Amin) which is varied from 0.1 to 0.5. The y-axis shows the sample complexity (number of queries).  As can be seen, the sample complexity of KC-FC is much smaller than that of Uniform-FC. The sample complexity of Uniform-FC makes the algorithm prohibitive even for small instances. As Amin increases, the sample complexity of KC-FC becomes smaller, a desirable property not possessed by Uniform-FC.", "section": "5 Experimental evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "WRCFuoiz1h/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Cost of clustering of KC-FC & KwikCluster having the access to the unknown similarity.", "description": "This figure compares the cost of clustering obtained by KC-FC (the proposed algorithm) and KwikCluster (a baseline algorithm that has access to the true similarity). The x-axis represents the lower bound on the minimum gap (Amin) and y-axis represents the cost of clustering. For each dataset (Lesmis, Adjnoun, Football, Jazz), it shows that KC-FC achieves comparable clustering quality to KwikCluster.

The algorithms compared are KC-FB (the proposed algorithm), Uniform-FB (a baseline method), and KwikCluster (an optimal algorithm having access to true similarity).  The x-axis represents the budget T (number of queries) that varies from n<sup>2.1</sup> to n<sup>3</sup>, and the y-axis is the cost of the clustering.  The figure demonstrates that KC-FB consistently outperforms Uniform-FB in terms of clustering cost, showing the effectiveness of KC-FB's adaptive sampling strategy. KwikCluster, which uses the true similarity, naturally performs the best, serving as an upper bound.", "section": "5 Experimental evaluation"}]
