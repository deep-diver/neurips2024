For each graph, the number of vertices (nodes), the number of edges (connections between nodes), and a short description of what the graph represents are provided.  These graphs represent diverse network structures, including social networks, word adjacency networks, and a sports team network, and are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed query-efficient correlation clustering algorithms.", "section": "5 Experimental evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "WRCFuoiz1h/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Cost of clustering of KC-FB & baselines (n \u2265 1,000).", "description": "This table presents the results of comparing the cost of clustering produced by three different algorithms: KC-FB, Uniform-FB, and KwikCluster (with full knowledge of similarity).  The comparison is made for three real-world datasets (Email, ego-Facebook, Wiki-Vote) with a minimum of 1000 vertices each.  For each algorithm and dataset, the average cost and standard deviation are reported.  The table is designed to show how the cost of KC-FB compares with a naive sampling approach (Uniform-FB) and an ideal scenario where the similarity is fully known (KwikCluster).", "section": "Experimental evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "WRCFuoiz1h/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Different problem settings in correlation clustering with queries.", "description": "This table compares different approaches to query-efficient correlation clustering. It highlights key differences in the similarity function used (binary or weighted), the type of oracle used (strong or noisy), and whether the approach provides a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the results.  The table is useful for understanding the novelty and contributions of the authors' proposed method in the context of existing work.", "section": "Appendix"}]
