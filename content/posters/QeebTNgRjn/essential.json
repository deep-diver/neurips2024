Traditional methods, like those based on diffusion models, often suffer from slow convergence and high computational costs. This research addresses these limitations.  The problem of time series imputation is framed as a conditional optimal transport problem. \nThe proposed solution, Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF), leverages optimal transport theory and Lagrangian mechanics. Unlike diffusion models that rely on iterative simulations, CLWF adopts a simulation-free approach by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy to directly learn the probability flow. This leads to fast convergence and competitive performance in time series imputation.  Moreover, a Rao-Blackwellized sampler is incorporated to boost the imputation quality. Extensive experiments showcase CLWF's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly regarding convergence speed.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QeebTNgRjn/podcast.wav"}
