This often leads to misclassifications, especially when dealing with subtle inter-class variations.  The challenge is further compounded by the need for real-time feedback, making offline methods impractical.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE), a novel framework that leverages multiple prototypes per category to capture intra-class diversity. PHE consists of two stages: Category-aware Prototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE). CPG generates category-specific prototypes, while DCE encodes them as hash centers to generate discriminative hash codes.  Extensive experiments demonstrate PHE's significant performance improvements over existing methods across various fine-grained datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the 'high sensitivity' issue and improving overall accuracy.", "affiliation": "University of Trento", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "seYXqfGT0q/podcast.wav"}
