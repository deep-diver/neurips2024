However, existing research focuses primarily on bag-level learnability, overlooking the crucial instance-level perspective. This creates a knowledge gap about whether a MIL algorithm is actually capable of learning at the instance level. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel theoretical framework based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory.  \nThe study uses the PAC learning framework to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that deep MIL algorithms must satisfy to achieve instance-level learnability.  It considers two key scenarios: statistically independent instances and the general case where instances might be dependent.  The theoretical findings are then applied to analyze various existing deep MIL algorithms, revealing significant differences in their instance-level learnability.  Experiments validate the theoretical analysis, confirming the accuracy of the proposed conditions and providing empirical support for the conclusions.", "affiliation": "Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cUcvlgkQxP/podcast.wav"}
