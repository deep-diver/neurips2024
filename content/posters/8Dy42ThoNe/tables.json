Three different LLMs (OPT-1.3B, OPT-2.7B, and Llama 2 (7B)) were tested using two different unlearning methods: Gradient Ascent (GA) and Gradient Ascent with Random Mismatch (GA+Mismatch). The table shows the harmful rate, diversity, and fluency of the LLM's responses to harmful prompts before and after unlearning, as well as the utility and similarity to the original LLM's responses to normal prompts.  'NM' indicates that the fluency score was not meaningful due to low diversity in the generated text. The results demonstrate that both GA and GA+Mismatch effectively reduce harmful responses and generalize well to unseen harmful prompts, achieving near-zero harmful rates, while maintaining reasonable utility and similarity to the original model on normal prompts.", "section": "4.1 Evaluation Design"}, {"figure_path": "8Dy42ThoNe/tables/tables_42_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Experimental results on unlearning harmfulness.

Three different LLMs (OPT-1.3B, OPT-2.7B, and Llama 2 (7B)) were used in the experiments. Two unlearning methods, Gradient Ascent (GA) and Gradient Ascent with Random Mismatch (GA+Mismatch), were compared to a baseline fine-tuning method. The metrics evaluated include the harmful rate (the percentage of harmful responses), diversity (the number of unique tokens in the generated text), fluency (perplexity of generated text), reward (quality of generated text as measured by a reward model), and similarity to the original model's outputs. The results show that both GA and GA+Mismatch effectively reduce harmful responses and maintain a similar level of performance on normal prompts.", "section": "4.1 Evaluation Design"}, {"figure_path": "8Dy42ThoNe/tables/tables_43_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Experimental results on unlearning harmfulness.
