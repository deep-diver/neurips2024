Conformal prediction provides prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, but often suffers from suboptimal conditional coverage and excessive interval length.  This limits their practical use in high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis.  Prior work has attempted to improve these shortcomings through model retraining or modification. \nThis paper introduces a post-training method called \"boosted conformal prediction.\" This novel approach uses gradient boosting to refine an existing conformity score function to achieve improved conditional coverage and shorter intervals. This allows for improved prediction quality without needing to modify the pre-trained model itself.  The approach shows superior performance compared to conventional methods across several benchmark datasets, reducing interval length and improving conditional coverage.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Tw032H2onS/podcast.wav"}
