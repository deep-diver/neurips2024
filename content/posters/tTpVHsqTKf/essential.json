Existing DETR-based VIS methods often employ asynchronous designs, either using only video-level queries or query-sensitive cascade structures, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in complex scenarios. These asynchronous designs hinder the effective modeling of intricate spatial-temporal relationships in videos.  \nSyncVIS addresses these issues by introducing a novel synchronized framework.  It employs both video-level and frame-level query embeddings and incorporates two key modules: a synchronized video-frame modeling paradigm that promotes mutual learning between frame-level and video-level embeddings and a synchronized embedding optimization strategy that tackles the optimization complexity of long videos by dividing them into smaller clips. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS and OVIS benchmarks demonstrate that SyncVIS achieves state-of-the-art results, highlighting its effectiveness and generality.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "tTpVHsqTKf/podcast.wav"}
