The overall charge density is represented as a sum over spherical-harmonics-based atomic orbital basis functions (spherical fields) centered at each atom. (b) Left: Illustration of the probe-based method for charge density representation. The charge density is represented as a voxel where each grid point (probe node) represents a scalar density at that coordinate. The voxel for the example molecule is of size 108 \u00d7 96 \u00d7 40. Grid points with very small charge densities (< 0.05) are not visualized. Right: For a probe-based machine learning prediction model, the voxel contains too many grid points to be processed simultaneously. Sampling of the voxel points is needed during training and inference. All charge densities use the same colormap scale at the right-most side of the figure. Atom color code: H (white), C (gray), N (blue). The charge density is from the QM9 charge density dataset [7].", "description": "This figure illustrates two different approaches for representing charge density in machine learning models: orbital-based and probe-based.  The orbital-based method represents the charge density as a sum of spherical functions centered at each atom, while the probe-based method uses a 3D grid (voxel) where each point represents the charge density. The figure highlights the difference in representation and the challenges associated with the probe-based method, especially concerning scalability due to the large number of grid points.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "b7REKaNUTv/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Efficiency-accuracy trade-off for SCDP models.

The Pareto front represents the set of models that offer the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.  The x-axis represents the efficiency (measured in molecules processed per minute), and the y-axis shows the accuracy (1-NMAE).  Each point on the graph represents a different model configuration, with different hyperparameters affecting the model's complexity and training performance. The models with scaling factor fine-tuning achieve the best balance between efficiency and accuracy and dominate the others in the Pareto sense.

The first column is the ground truth charge density with the corresponding color scale. The next five columns are prediction errors from various models which all use the same color scale in the rightmost for error magnitude. The prediction errors significantly reduce with larger model size, virtual orbitals, orbital exponent scaling, and a larger basis set. VO stands for virtual orbitals. Scaling stands for scaling factor fine-tuning. The virtual orbitals significantly reduce errors around chemical bonds.
