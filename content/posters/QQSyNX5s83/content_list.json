Given the explicit expression nature of 3DGS, recent studies [11, 13, 14] represent dynamic scenes by defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. Specifically, during the execution of the deformation field, the coordinates xyz along with time $t$ are used as input, and the output corresponds to the changes in Gaussian properties. It is noteworthy that the existing methods, when designing deformable networks, either directly map the 4D coordinates of each input point to the latent space using MLPs [13, 14], or use HexPlane [15] to interpolate a series of learnable embeddings to obtain the latent of each point [11].

Due to the presence of dynamic regions and the specific design of A (canonical 3D gaussians) $+\\mathrm{~B~}$ (deformable network), canonical 3D gaussians exhibit significant noise, as illustrated in Figure 2. This noise is inevitably transferred to the deformable field after the input $x y z$ is passed through the deformable network. To elaborate on the \u201cNoise\u201d: In the canonical $^+$ deformable design, we input the canonical Gaussian coordinates $x y z$ and time $t$ into the deformable network. The deformable network essentially performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the coordinates $x y z$ and time $t$ . Since the point-topoint relationships within the canonical Gaussians are chaotic and erroneous, as shown in Figure 2, it is predictable that feeding these erroneous coordinates into the deformable network will transfer this error into the deformation field, introducing inaccuracies in the final deformations $\\Delta x,\\Delta y,\\Delta z$ . 2) There is a lack of feature aggregation for spatial-temporal information, yet due to the presence of noise in canonical 3D gaussians\u2019 $x y z$ , direct feature aggregation for spatial information would further amplify noise, affecting the learning of the deformable field.

To address the initial issue, the design of NSS incorporates two deformation operations. The first deformation operation is a standard deformation. It takes the coordinates $x y z$ of the canonical 3D gaussians and time $t$ as input and outputs corresponding coordinate deformations $\\Delta x,\\Delta y,\\Delta z$ . The second deformation builds upon the first by adding $\\Delta x,\\Delta y,\\Delta z$ to the original $x y z$ , creating a modified set of coordinates that is then input into a new feature extraction network. The entire process is illustrated by image 3, 4 and 5 in Figure 2. This strategy achieves a successful alteration of the distribution of coordinates $x y z$ through the initial coordinate deformation, resulting in noise reduction and the generation of a more accurate deformation field. It\u2019s worth noting that during the early stage of training, we only perform the first deformation operation. Only after achieving acceptable results with the first deformation operation do we proceed to the second deformation operation to further enhance accuracy. To address the second problem, we design the DTS. The reason we decouple spatial-temporal aggregation is due to the presence of noise in the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians. If we directly perform spatial aggregation on the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians, the noise information is inevitably amplified after a series of aggregation operations such as $\\mathbf{k}$ -nearest neighbors (KNN) [16], significantly affecting the results of the deformation field. Therefore, based on the first design NSS, we conduct spatial aggregation during the second deformation operation. Considering that temporal information is unrelated to the canonical 3D gaussians, temporal aggregation can be directly incorporated into the first deformation operation to enhance feature extraction capabilities.

HyperNeRF [2] models object topology deformation using higher-dimensional inputs, while DyNeRF [1] employs time-conditioned NeRF to represent a 4D scene.

Due to the incorporation of the Noise Suppression Strategy, which alters the distribution of canonical 3D gaussians coordinates to suppress noise, as well as the utilization of the Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module for feature aggregation, our approach demonstrates superior reconstruction quality across all metrics compared to the baseline (4DGaussian [11]).

Moreover, under the Dense Init setting, our method achieves the current state-of-the-art performance.

In contrast, our approach benefits from noise suppression and feature aggregation, resulting in a more pronounced performance improvement under the sparse setting.
