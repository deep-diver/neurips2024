It shows the regret (difference between the expected total fair gain from trade achieved by the best fixed price and that achieved by the algorithm) in terms of the number of rounds (T). The settings vary across deterministic and stochastic (independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)) scenarios for seller and buyer valuations, and the amount of feedback received by the platform (two-bit or full feedback).", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "I90ypQpLgL/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of our results.", "description": "This table summarizes the main results of the paper regarding the regret bounds achieved by different algorithms under various settings.  It shows the regret (in terms of big-O notation) for both the two-bit and full feedback cases, considering deterministic and stochastic settings (with and without the assumption of independent seller and buyer valuations). The rows represent the feedback setting, and the columns show the different learning scenarios, from deterministic to stochastic i.i.d. valuations.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
