Existing methods often struggle with semi-supervised scenarios (using both labeled and unlabeled data), especially when dealing with noisy or inaccurate information. The problem is further complicated by the issue of *catastrophic forgetting*, where learning a new task causes the model to 'forget' previously learned ones.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach called Persistence Homology Distillation (PsHD) to address these challenges. **PsHD leverages topological data analysis**, a field of mathematics that studies shapes and their properties, to capture the underlying structure of the data. This allows the model to learn new information without losing information from previous tasks, even if the data is noisy.  **PsHD shows improved stability and outperforms existing methods** across various benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Tianjin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qInb7EUmxz/podcast.wav"}
