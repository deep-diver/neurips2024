This inconsistency negatively impacts model generalization and creates a need for advanced optimization techniques to maintain performance across diverse data sources. Existing solutions often suffer from high communication overhead and sample complexity, limiting their practical applicability. \nThis paper proposes novel, communication-efficient algorithms to optimize Federated Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (FGDRO).  The algorithms introduced, FGDRO-CVaR and FGDRO-KL, are tailored for specific regularization techniques (CVaR and KL, respectively), achieving substantial reductions in communication costs compared to existing methods.  Furthermore, a new algorithm, FGDRO-KL-Adam, integrates adaptive Adam-type local updates within the FGDRO-KL framework, potentially surpassing the performance of standard SGD-type local steps, all while maintaining a low communication overhead.", "affiliation": "Texas A&M University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xNZEjFe0mh/podcast.wav"}
