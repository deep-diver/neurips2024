We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth. We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Communication of quantum states that potentially limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters may also lead to improved privacy guarantees for distributed computation. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks.

The choice of architecture for large-scale training and inference must not only make the best use of computational and memory resources, but also contend with the fact that communication may become a bottleneck [97]. This is particularly pertinent as models grow so large that they cannot rely on high-bandwidth interconnects within datacenters [17], but are instead trained across multiple datacenters [108]. When using modern optical interconnects, classical computers exchange bits represented by light. This however does not fully utilize the potential of the physical substrate; given suitable computational capabilities and algorithms, the quantum nature of light can be harnessed as a powerful communication resource. Here we show that for a broad class of parameterized models, if quantum bits (qubits) are communicated instead of classical bits, an exponential reduction in the communication required to perform inference and gradient-based training can be achieved. This protocol additionally guarantees improved privacy of both the user data and model parameters through natural features of quantum mechanics, without the need for additional cryptographic or privacy protocols. To our knowledge, this is the first example of generic, exponential quantum advantage on problems that occur naturally in the training and deployment of large machine learning models. These types of communication advantages help scope the future roles and interplay between quantum and classical communication for distributed machine learning.

However, much of the data that one would like to compute with in practice seems to come from an emergent classical world rather than directly exhibiting quantum properties. While there are some well-known examples of exponential quantum speedups for classical problems, most famously factoring [106] and related hidden subgroup problems [31], these tend to be isolated and at times difficult to relate to practical applications that involve learning from data. In addition, even though significant speedups are known for certain ubiquitous problems in machine learning such as matrix inversion [48] and principal component analysis [73], the advantage is often lost when including the cost of loading classical data into the quantum computer or of reading out the result into classical memory. This is because the complexity of loading dense classical data into the amplitudes of a quantum state (which is typically the encoding needed to obtain an exponential runtime advantage) and of reading out the amplitudes from a quantum state into classical memory, are both polynomial in the number of amplitudes [1]. In applications where an efficient data access model avoids the above pitfalls, the complexity of quantum algorithms tends to depend on condition numbers of matrices which scale with system size in a way that reduces or even eliminates any quantum advantage [82]. It is worth noting that much of the discussion about the impact of quantum technology on machine learning has focused on computational advantage. However quantum resources are not only useful in reducing computational complexity \u2014 they can also provide an advantage in communication complexity, enabling exponential reductions in communication for some problems [101, 15]. Inspired by these results, we study a setting where quantum advantage in communication is possible across a wide class of machine learning models. This advantage holds without requiring any sparsity assumptions or elaborate data access models such as QRAM [42].

While there are a number of strategies for distributing machine learning workloads that are influenced by the requirements of different applications and hardware constraints [115, 61], splitting up a computational graph in a compositional fashion (Figure 1) is a common approach. We describe distributed, parameterized quantum circuits that can be used to perform inference over data when distributed in this way, and can be trained using gradient methods.

Training and inference then require communication of features between nodes. Pipelining enables flexible changes to the model architecture in a task-dependent manner, since subsets of a large model can be combined in an adaptive fashion to solve many downstream tasks. Additionally, pipelining allows sparse activation of a subset of a model required to solve a task, and facilitates better use of heterogeneous compute resources since it does not require storing identical copies of a large model. The potential for large models to be easily fine-tuned to solve multiple tasks is well-known [25, 20], and pipelined architectures which facilitate this are the norm in the latest generation of large language models [99, 16]. Data parallelism, in contrast, involves storing multiple copies of the model on different nodes, training each on a subsets of the data and exchanging information to synchronize parameter updates. In practice, different parallelization strategies are combined in order to exploit trade-offs between latency and throughput in a task-dependent fashion [115, 61, 97].

The key object of study in this area is the tree induced by a communication protocol whose nodes enumerate all possible communication histories and whose leaves correspond to the outputs of the protocol. The product structure induced on the leaves of this tree as a function of the inputs allows one to bound the depth of the tree from below, which gives an unconditional lower bound on the communication complexity. The power of replacing classical bits of communication with qubits has been the subject of extensive study [30, 23, 27]. For certain problems such as Hidden Matching [15] and a variant of classification with deep linear models [101] an exponential quantum communication advantage holds, while for other canonical problems such as Disjointness only a polynomial advantage is possible [102]. Exponential advantage was also recently shown for the problem of sampling from a distribution defined by the solution to a linear regression problem [83]. While there are many models of both quantum and classical communication, our results apply to randomized classical communication complexity, wherein the players are allowed to exchange random bits independent of their problem inputs, and are allowed to output an incorrect answer with some probability (bounded away from $1/2$ for a problem with binary output).

Communication constraints may become even more relevant if such models are trained on data that is obtained by inherently distributed interaction with the physical world [37]. The ability to compute using data with privacy guarantees can be potentially applied to proprietary data. This could become highly desirable even in the near future as the rate of publicly-available data production appears to be outstripped by the growth rate of training sets of large language models [110].

Additionally, the advantages we study require deep $(\\mathrm{poly}(N))$ , fault-tolerant quantum circuits. While this is a common feature of problems for which quantum communication advantages hold, the overhead of quantum error-correction in such circuits may be considerable. Detailed resource estimates would be necessary to understand better the practicality of this approach for achieving useful quantum advantage. Our results naturally raise further questions regarding the expressive power and trainability of these types of circuits, which may be of independent interest. We collect some of these in Appendix I.

The rapid growth of complexity of random circuits composed from local gates with depth suggests that this might be possible [24]. This is particularly interesting since Algorithm 1 requires only a single measurement per iteration and may thus be suitable for implementation on near-term devices whose coherence times restrict them to implementing shallow circuits. It has also been recently shown that an exponential quantum advantage in communication holds for a problem which is essentially equivalent to estimating the loss of a circuit of the form Definition 3.1 with $L=2$ , under a weaker model of quantum communication than the standard one we consider [10].

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
