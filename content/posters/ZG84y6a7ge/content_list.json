Finally, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of local pruning and global pruning in bottleneck pruning. Given that the bottleneck dimensions in each block are entirely decoupled, we systematically applied channel-wise group pruning at various ratios for each block while preserving the predefined overall pruning ratio in this step. To obtain a consistent global ranking, we normalized the group importance scores $I_{\\mathcal{G}}$ of each layer in five ways: (i) Sum: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}=\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{K}I_{\\mathcal{G}i}}}\\end{array}$ , (ii) Mean: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}=\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{K}I_{\\mathcal{G}i}/K}}\\end{array}$ , (iii) Max: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}=\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}}{M a x_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})}}\\end{array}$ (iv) Standarization: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}\\,=\\,\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}-M a x_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})}{M a x_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})-M i n_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})+1e-8}}\\end{array}$ , (v) Gaussian: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}\\,=\\,\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}-\\sum_{i=1}^{K}I_{\\mathcal{G}i}/K}{\\sigma_{i=1}^{K}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{G}i}\\right)+1e-8}}\\end{array}$ . \u00b7 As indicated in Table 5, local pruning ensures consistent performance, whereas global pruning raises the model\u2019s upper-performance limit. Global pruning\u2019s efficacy is highly dependent on the chosen importance normalization method. For our model, we opted for global pruning with Gaussian normalization, which yielded the best training results. Following global pruning, Figure 4 illustrates the dimensions of bottleneck features (QKV embeddings and MLP hidden embeddings) within each ViT in the image encoder. When applying mean, sum, or Gaussian normalization, the ViTs in the middle exhibit more group redundancy compared to those at the beginning and end. However, the pruned dimensions do not display distinct patterns when utilizing max or standardization normalization. The impact of global pruning becomes more pronounced with an increased number of training iterations. Specifically, when training extends to 80 epochs, the MIoU for global pruning exceeds that of local pruning by approximately $2\\%$ . ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Even less data.

However, as the pruning ratio is elevated to $77\\%$ , a decrease in training data more significantly affects performance. This leads to the inference that although our methodology, which integrates pruning and distillation techniques, mitigates the need for extensive training datasets, the availability of more training data can still enhance model performance, particularly at higher pruning rates.

The essence of our approach lies in the efficient reuse of pre-trained SAM, avoiding the need for extensive retraining. We introduce key designs to the compression method for enhancing knowledge retention from the original model in datalimited situations. Specifically, our alternate slimming framework carefully prunes and distills decoupled model structures in an alternating fashion, minimizing disruptions to the original model and enabling the intermediate feature alignment by consistent dimensionality. Furthermore, the proposed disturbed Taylor importance estimation rectifies the misalignment between pruning objectives and training targets, thus boosting post-distillation after pruning. SlimSAM convincingly demonstrates its superiority while imposing significantly lower training costs compared to any other existing methods.

In our final set of experiments, we assessed the effectiveness of both local and global pruning approaches in the context of bottleneck pruning. Considering the complete decoupling of bottleneck dimensions in each block, we meticulously implemented channel-wise group pruning at varying ratios across different blocks. This was done while maintaining the predetermined overall pruning ratio for this phase of the study. To obtain a consistent global ranking, we normalized the group importance scores $I_{\\mathcal{G}}$ of each layer in five ways: (i) Sum: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\bar{I}_{\\mathcal{G}i}=\\frac{{I}_{\\mathcal{G}i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{K}{I}_{\\mathcal{G}i}}}\\end{array}$ , (ii) Mean: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}=\\frac{\\bar{I}_{\\mathcal{G}i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{K}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}/K}}}\\end{array}$ , (iii) Max: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}=\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}}{M a x_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})}}\\end{array}$ , (iv) Standarization: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}\\,=\\,\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}-M a x_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})}{M a x_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})-M i n_{i=1}^{K}(I_{\\mathcal{G}i})+1e-8}}\\end{array}$ , (v) Gaussian: $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}\\,=\\,\\frac{I_{\\mathcal{G}i}-\\sum_{i=1}^{K}I_{\\mathcal{G}i}/K}{\\sigma_{i=1}^{K}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{G}i}\\right)+1e-8}}\\end{array}$ . Table 9 reveals that while local pruning maintains consistent performance, global pruning enhances the upper limit of the model\u2019s capabilities. In a departure from the findings observed with SlimSAM-77, various normalization methods do not markedly influence post-pruning performance. This suggests that the necessity of selecting an optimal normalization technique increases with the pruning ratio. For our model, we chose global pruning combined with Gaussian normalization, which led to the most favorable training outcomes. Figure 7 delineates the distribution of bottleneck feature dimensions (including QKV and MLP hidden embeddings) across each Vision Transformer (ViT) [6] in the image encoder. When mean, sum or Gaussian normalization is applied, the dimensions within the ViTs tend to distribute more evenly.
