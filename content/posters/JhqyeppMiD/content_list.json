Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is a traditional Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is a novel Persuasion Attack, leveraging VLMs\u2019 text generation capabilities to craft persuasive and seemingly rational narratives for misinformation, such as portraying junk food as healthy.

Unlike in Label Attack where attack success is simply determined by the presence of the $\\mathcal{C}_{d}$ string and absence of the ${\\mathcal{C}}_{o}$ string in the response, the Persuasion Attack requires a more nuanced approach. This is because a response may align with $\\mathcal{C}_{d}$ , such as \u2018healthy food,\u2019 without containing the exact string, as in the response \u2018The food is good for health.\u2019 Specifically, we query GPT-3.5-turbo with the format \u201c[Evaluation instruction]: [Prompt][Response]\u201d, where the task-specific evaluation instructions are provided in Table 6. We use the prompt \u201cIs the food in the image healthy?\u201d for the task JunkFood-to-HealthyFood and \u201cIs this activity good for physical health?\u201d for the task VideoGame-to-PhysicalHealth.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
