It compares different fairness methods (ERM, CFU, CFR, PCF) across four scenarios: Linear Regression, Cubic Regression, Linear Classification, and Cubic Classification. The results illustrate the error (RMSE or classification error) and total effect (TE) for each method and dataset. The goal is to show that PCF achieves optimal counterfactual fairness with minimal performance degradation.", "section": "3 Counterfactual Fairness via Output Combination"}]
