It shows how individual human users each have their own agent, and how these agents collaborate to solve tasks.  The key elements shown are the human social network, the agent network mirroring that social network, the communication process between agents using InfoNav, and the mixed memory mechanism used by the agents to manage information. The process begins with human users invoking their respective agents to work together to solve a task. Agents then communicate, exchanging information via InfoNav to overcome information asymmetry.  They use a mixed memory system consisting of \"Clear Memory\" and \"Fuzzy Memory\" to store and retrieve information effectively.  Finally, the agents perform a consensus check on their plan before presenting a solution.", "section": "3.2 Overview"}, {"figure_path": "mp6OWpDIJC/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: A case of the task asking two agents to find the longest activity among all schedules.

The task is to identify the longest activity from a set of individual schedules distributed among the agents. The process starts with the agents creating an initial plan outlining the necessary information.  InfoNav then guides the communication by prompting the agents to fill in the placeholders in their plan as they gather information. This iterative process continues until the plan is complete and the agents perform a consensus check to ensure their understanding aligns.

It displays the changes in parameters (context window, retrieval limit, keywords for Clear Memory; topk and query length for Fuzzy Memory) based on whether the agents successfully complete the task. The results show that most agents tend to keep their parameters unchanged. However, when a change is made, there's a higher likelihood that agents will increase the parameters to retrieve more information.  This trend is particularly noticeable for the overall message retrieval limit in Clear Memory. Successful agents tend to make fewer changes compared to unsuccessful agents, suggesting a more careful and adaptive approach to information retrieval in successful cases.", "section": "6.3 Analysis on Agents' Behaviour"}, {"figure_path": "mp6OWpDIJC/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 6: The visualization of social network in FriendsTV dataset.
