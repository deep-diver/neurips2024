### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many existing multi-agent systems (MAS) struggle when dealing with collaborative tasks where agents lack complete information.  This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a new MAS paradigm called iAgents.  The core problem stems from information asymmetry, where each agent only has access to the information of its human user, hindering effective teamwork.  Previous systems either share all data among agents or struggle with asymmetric information, both of which are not ideal due to privacy concerns or system inefficiency.



iAgents solves this problem by mirroring the human social network in its agent network. Agents proactively exchange necessary information using a new agent reasoning mechanism called InfoNav.  InfoNav helps agents make informed decisions about which information to share with whom.  To facilitate evaluation, they introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark designed to assess performance in information asymmetry scenarios. Their experiments show that iAgents performs well in large-scale simulations and successfully completes complex tasks.

### In-depth insights


#### InfoAsym MAS
InfoAsym MAS, or Information Asymmetry Multi-Agent Systems, presents a significant challenge and opportunity in AI research.  Traditional MAS assume perfect information sharing, but **real-world scenarios often involve information asymmetry**, where different agents possess unique knowledge.  This necessitates new approaches that go beyond simple information exchange.  **Effective InfoAsym MAS must incorporate mechanisms for agents to actively seek, evaluate, and integrate information from diverse sources**, potentially including human input. The design of such systems demands a focus on agent communication strategies, reasoning methods, and information representation techniques optimized for incomplete data and decentralized knowledge.  **Developing robust benchmarks for evaluating InfoAsym MAS is critical** for furthering research in this field, as such systems will play an increasingly important role in complex collaborative applications.

#### iAgents Design
The iAgents design centers around overcoming information asymmetry in multi-agent systems using Large Language Models.  **Key to this design is the mirroring of the human social network within the agent network**, allowing agents to proactively exchange information relevant to their respective human users' tasks.  This is facilitated by a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, which guides communication towards efficient information exchange.  **InfoNav utilizes a mixed memory system (Clear and Fuzzy Memory) to effectively manage and retrieve information**, providing agents with a comprehensive context for decision-making.  The system is designed for scalability, as demonstrated by its ability to handle complex social networks with numerous individuals and relationships.  **The use of InfoNav and the mixed memory system allows iAgents to overcome the limitations of previous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that struggled with information asymmetry** by enabling agents to perform effective communication and collaboration, even with limited individual information access.  The system's design is further supported by a benchmark, InformativeBench, specifically created for evaluating LLM agents' performance under information asymmetry.

#### InfoNav Reasoning
InfoNav Reasoning, as presented in the paper, is a novel agent reasoning mechanism designed to address information asymmetry in multi-agent systems.  It employs a **planning-based approach**, where agents proactively create plans outlining the information needed to complete a collaborative task. The key to InfoNav is its ability to **dynamically update these plans** based on communication progress, enabling agents to focus their information-seeking efforts on the most crucial data. This proactive strategy, coupled with a mixed-memory system, allows agents to overcome the limitations of previous multi-agent systems which often struggled under conditions of information asymmetry. The **mixed-memory mechanism** is also critical as it facilitates the efficient retrieval of both precise (clear memory) and contextual (fuzzy memory) information, greatly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the communication process. In essence, InfoNav represents a significant advancement in enabling autonomous agents to efficiently collaborate in the face of incomplete information, paving the way for more robust and effective multi-agent systems.

#### Benchmarking iA
Benchmarking iA (Informative Agents) would require a multifaceted approach, going beyond simple accuracy metrics.  **A robust benchmark should assess iA's ability to handle information asymmetry** across diverse social network structures and communication complexities.  It needs to evaluate not only task completion rates but also the efficiency and effectiveness of information exchange, including the number of communication turns, the amount of information retrieved, and the accuracy of retrieved information. The benchmark should also incorporate various difficulty levels, allowing for the evaluation of iA across different task types and complexity levels.  Furthermore, the scalability of iA in handling larger social networks with extensive information should be rigorously assessed. **The design must also consider incorporating metrics for evaluating the agents' reasoning capabilities**, especially in scenarios requiring complex inference and collaborative problem-solving. Finally, **the benchmark needs to account for the impact of various LLM backends** on iA's overall performance, emphasizing the need for benchmark results to be consistent across different underlying models.

#### Future of iAgents
The future of iAgents hinges on addressing current limitations and capitalizing on its strengths.  **Scalability** remains a crucial challenge, requiring efficient memory management and communication protocols for handling extensive social networks and information volumes.  **Privacy preservation** needs robust mechanisms to balance collaborative information sharing with individual data protection.  **Integration with diverse data sources** beyond text, such as images and sensor data, could greatly enhance iAgents' capabilities.  **Enhanced reasoning capabilities**, moving beyond simple information retrieval to complex inference and decision-making, are vital. **Developing more sophisticated benchmarks** is necessary to fully evaluate iAgents' capabilities across various task complexities and information asymmetry levels.  Ultimately, the future of iAgents involves navigating the complex interplay between human and artificial intelligence, achieving a seamless balance of autonomy, collaboration, and responsible information handling.

> üîº This figure illustrates the overall architecture of the iAgents system.  It shows how individual human users each have their own agent, and how these agents collaborate to solve tasks.  The key elements shown are the human social network, the agent network mirroring that social network, the communication process between agents using InfoNav, and the mixed memory mechanism used by the agents to manage information. The process begins with human users invoking their respective agents to work together to solve a task. Agents then communicate, exchanging information via InfoNav to overcome information asymmetry.  They use a mixed memory system consisting of 'Clear Memory' and 'Fuzzy Memory' to store and retrieve information effectively.  Finally, the agents perform a consensus check on their plan before presenting a solution.

> üîº This figure illustrates a step-by-step example of how the InfoNav mechanism works in a collaborative task.  The task is to identify the longest activity from a set of individual schedules distributed among the agents. The process starts with the agents creating an initial plan outlining the necessary information.  InfoNav then guides the communication by prompting the agents to fill in the placeholders in their plan as they gather information. This iterative process continues until the plan is complete and the agents perform a consensus check to ensure their understanding aligns.  Finally, they arrive at the correct answer.

> üîº This figure illustrates the two main task types in the InformativeBench benchmark.  The left side shows the 'Needle-Oriented Task', where agents must collaborate to find a piece of information (the 'needle') hidden within a social network. Each agent only has access to the information of its assigned human user, creating information asymmetry. The right side depicts the 'Reasoning-Oriented Task', where agents need to collaborate to solve a problem using distributed information and an algorithm. Again, information asymmetry is present as each agent only has access to a subset of the total information.

> üîº This figure shows the distribution of how agents modify their memory retrieval strategies during communication.  It displays the changes in parameters (context window, retrieval limit, keywords for Clear Memory; topk and query length for Fuzzy Memory) based on whether the agents successfully complete the task. The results show that most agents tend to keep their parameters unchanged. However, when a change is made, there's a higher likelihood that agents will increase the parameters to retrieve more information.  This trend is particularly noticeable for the overall message retrieval limit in Clear Memory. Successful agents tend to make fewer changes compared to unsuccessful agents, suggesting a more careful and adaptive approach to information retrieval in successful cases.
