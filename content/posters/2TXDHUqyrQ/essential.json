This significantly limits their applicability in real-time systems like robotics. The core problem is the expensive iterative sampling in generating long-horizon trajectories, where much of the detailed information is often redundant.\n\nTo tackle this, the authors propose DiffuserLite, a lightweight framework that leverages a plan refinement process (PRP). PRP generates coarse-to-fine trajectories, thus drastically reducing redundant information and improving efficiency.  Experiments show DiffuserLite achieves a remarkable 122.2Hz decision-making frequency (112.7x faster than existing methods) while maintaining state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. **DiffuserLite is presented as a flexible plugin** that can be integrated with other diffusion planning methods, offering a valuable structural design for future work.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2TXDHUqyrQ/podcast.wav"}
