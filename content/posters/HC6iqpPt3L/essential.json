Existing methods either rely on inefficient fixed policies or pre-collected data, leading to high variance in return estimations and inaccurate GVF predictions. This problem becomes more pronounced as the number of GVFs increases, making it computationally expensive and challenging to obtain reliable estimates.\nThis paper introduces GVFExplorer, a novel method that adaptively learns a single behavior policy to efficiently gather data for multiple GVFs. **GVFExplorer minimizes the total variance in return across all GVFs, directly reducing the required environmental interactions.**  Theoretically, each behavior policy update guarantees a non-increase in overall mean squared error (MSE). Experiments in tabular, non-linear, and continuous control environments showcase significant performance improvements compared to several baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of GVFExplorer in optimizing data usage and reducing prediction errors across multiple GVFs.", "affiliation": "McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HC6iqpPt3L/podcast.wav"}
