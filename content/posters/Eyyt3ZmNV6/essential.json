{"importance": "This paper is crucial because **it addresses a critical challenge in dataset ownership verification**: existing methods often compromise privacy by revealing watermarks.  By proposing ZeroMark, a novel approach, this research opens up avenues for more secure and robust copyright protection of datasets, driving further research in secure machine learning and data provenance.", "summary": "ZeroMark revolutionizes dataset ownership verification by enabling copyright protection **without exposing watermarks**, leveraging the intrinsic properties of DNNs trained on watermarked data.", "takeaways": ["ZeroMark verifies dataset ownership without disclosing watermarks, addressing privacy concerns of existing methods.", "The method leverages the intrinsic properties of DNNs trained on watermarked data, specifically boundary gradients, for verification.", "Extensive experiments demonstrate ZeroMark's effectiveness and robustness against adaptive attacks."], "tldr": "Protecting the copyright of high-quality public datasets is crucial for the advancement of deep learning research. Existing methods for dataset ownership verification (DOV) rely on watermarks embedded within the dataset, but these methods are vulnerable because the watermark itself can be revealed during the verification process, potentially jeopardizing security. This can lead to unauthorized use and copyright infringement. This vulnerability necessitates a new approach that prioritizes security and privacy. \nZeroMark offers a solution by performing ownership verification **without directly using watermarks**. This innovative approach leverages the inherent properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on watermarked datasets. It uses boundary samples and their gradients, calculated without exposing watermarks, to determine whether a model was trained on the protected dataset.  The method is shown to be effective and resistant to common attacks. This contribution is important to researchers as it advances the field of data security and protection, introducing new methods to protect intellectual property rights while maintaining privacy.", "affiliation": "University of Maryland College Park", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "Eyyt3ZmNV6/podcast.wav"}
