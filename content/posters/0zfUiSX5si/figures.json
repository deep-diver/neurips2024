It starts with biological samples that are enzymatically digested into a mixture of peptides.  These peptides are then analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry which produces two types of spectra: MS1 (precursor ion information) and MS2 (fragment ion information). The core challenge is peptide sequencing where the goal is to accurately predict the amino acid sequence of the peptide based on the MS2 spectrum.  The figure highlights the MS2 spectrum with signal peaks in blue and noisy peaks in grey, along with the resulting predicted peptide sequence (ATASPPRQK).", "section": "2 Background and Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "0zfUiSX5si/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Schematic diagram of AdaNovo framework.", "description": "This figure shows the schematic of the AdaNovo framework, illustrating how mass spectrum encoder, two peptide decoders, conditional mutual information (CMI) calculations, and re-weighting strategies work together to improve peptide sequencing. The MS encoder processes mass spectrum peaks (x) and precursor (z) to generate features.  Two peptide decoders (#1 and #2) are used; Decoder #1 predicts amino acid probabilities (p(yj|x, z, y<j)), and Decoder #2 predicts probabilities based on the previous amino acids (p(yj|y<j)). The CMI between the spectrum and amino acids is computed (I(x, z; yj|y<j)) and used for re-weighting. PSM-level mutual information is used (I(x,z;y)) for another level of re-weighting, combining to give the adaptive loss (L_Ada).", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "0zfUiSX5si/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Empirical comparison of de novo sequencing models in terms of PTMs identification.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of four different de novo peptide sequencing models (DeepNovo, PointNovo, Casanovo, and AdaNovo) in identifying Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs).
