However, actions are often correlated, offering potential for improved exploration. Existing methods like Thompson Sampling (TS) can be enhanced with informative priors to capture these correlations, but effectively modeling these complex relationships remains a challenge. \nThis research proposes Diffusion Thompson Sampling (dTS), a novel algorithm that uses pre-trained diffusion models to capture action correlations as priors for TS.  This allows dTS to efficiently explore large action spaces and provides both theoretical guarantees (Bayes regret bound) and improved empirical results.  The researchers derive efficient posterior approximations, improving the computational efficiency of dTS.  Experiments demonstrate dTS's superior performance compared to existing methods across various settings.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "nEnazjpwOx/podcast.wav"}
