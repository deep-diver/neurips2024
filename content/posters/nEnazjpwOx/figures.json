The settings vary the diffusion model (linear vs. non-linear), reward type (linear vs. non-linear), and problem dimensions (number of actions K, context dimension d, number of latent layers L). Error bars show standard error across 50 independent runs. The figure demonstrates dTS's superior performance across many different settings, showing consistently lower regret compared to other methods like LinTS, LinUCB, HierTS, GLM-TS, and UCB-GLM.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "nEnazjpwOx/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Prior misspecification effect.", "description": "This figure shows the impact of prior misspecification on the performance of dTS and HierTS. The true parameters are replaced by misspecified parameters W + e1 and \u03a3 + e2, where e1 and e2 are sampled uniformly from [v, v+0.5]dxd, with v controlling the level of misspecification. The regret increases with increasing misspecification, but dTS still outperforms HierTS except when v = 1.5, demonstrating that even an imperfect pre-trained diffusion model can be beneficial when used as a prior.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "nEnazjpwOx/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Regret of dTS with varying diffusion and reward models and varying parameters d, K, L.", "description": "This figure shows the cumulative regret of the dTS algorithm under different conditions.  The x-axis represents the number of rounds in the bandit problem. The y-axis shows the cumulative regret.  Four different settings are presented, each using a combination of linear or non-linear diffusion models and linear or non-linear reward models.  Different parameter values of d (dimensionality of the context vector), K (number of actions), and L (number of latent parameters in the diffusion model) are used to show the effect of these parameters on the performance of the algorithm.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "nEnazjpwOx/figures/figures_8_3.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Regret of dTS-LL and LinTS with varying K.", "description": "This figure displays the final cumulative regret for both dTS-LL and LinTS across a range of K values, from 10 to 50,000. The x-axis represents the number of actions (K), while the y-axis shows the cumulative regret.  It demonstrates how the performance gap between the two algorithms increases as the number of actions grows, highlighting dTS-LL's improved scalability for large action spaces.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
