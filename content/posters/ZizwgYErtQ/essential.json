This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently selecting the best pre-trained model for a given task while minimizing the need for expensive label acquisition. Existing methods for model selection often lack the context-awareness and label-efficiency needed for optimal performance in dynamic environments.\nThe researchers propose CAMS, a novel contextual active model selection algorithm that uses both context information and active learning to choose the most suitable model for each instance.  CAMS demonstrates significant improvements in label efficiency (less than 10% labeling effort compared to existing methods) on various benchmark datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. The theoretical analysis of CAMS provides guarantees on its regret and query complexity, making it a robust and effective method for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZizwgYErtQ/podcast.wav"}
