This is achieved by training the smaller model on a dataset generated by GPT-4, effectively distilling GPT-4's knowledge into a more resource-friendly model.  This process usually involves crafting prompts to guide GPT-4 in generating high-quality training data that encompasses a wide range of mathematical problems and difficulty levels. **The key advantage lies in reducing the computational cost and resource requirements associated with using large models like GPT-4 directly**, making the technology more accessible and scalable.  The effectiveness of the distillation process depends on several factors, including the quality and diversity of the GPT-4 generated dataset, the architecture of the smaller model, and the training methodology.  A successful distillation would result in a model that performs comparably to GPT-4 on specific mathematical tasks but with significantly lower computational cost and resource needs.  **The technique represents a powerful strategy for democratizing access to advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities**."}}, {"heading_title": "Gradient-Based Value Estimation", "details": {"summary": "Gradient-based value estimation is a crucial technique for **efficiently selecting high-quality synthetic data** in training machine learning models.
