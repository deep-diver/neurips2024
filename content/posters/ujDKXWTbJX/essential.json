This leads to high costs and limits accessibility for researchers with limited resources. \nThis paper introduces JiuZhang3.0, which tackles this issue by training a small, efficient LLM to synthesize a large number of high-quality math problems. This approach significantly reduces the cost of data creation, making it a more accessible solution for researchers.  The generated problems were then used to pre-train JiuZhang3.0, which demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks.", "affiliation": "School of Information, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ujDKXWTbJX/podcast.wav"}
