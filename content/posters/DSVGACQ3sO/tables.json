These parameters control various aspects of the transformer architecture, including the size of the hidden state, the number of encoder and decoder layers, the number of attention heads, the optimizer, the learning rate, the number of samples per dataset, the number of training datasets, the number of iterations, and the batch size.", "section": "3.1 Experimental design"}]
