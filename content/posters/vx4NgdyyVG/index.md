### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world datasets suffer from class imbalance, where some classes have significantly more data than others. This leads to deep learning models performing poorly on underrepresented classes. Existing re-weighting methods often fail to adequately address this issue because they don't adapt well to the changing data distributions during training.

This paper introduces a new method called RDR (Re-weighting with Density Ratio) that uses density ratio estimation to dynamically adjust the weights of different classes during training. This adaptive approach ensures that the model is always focusing on the underrepresented classes, even as the data distribution shifts over time. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that RDR leads to significant improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to existing methods, especially in cases of severe class imbalance.

> This figure shows the dynamic trend of RDR weights in different categories (many and few) throughout the training process.  The RDR weights show an inverse relationship with B', a value calculated based on the minimal prediction on the ground truth class. This demonstrates that RDR weights effectively adapt to the changing importance of classes during training, aligning well with the theoretical prediction. The experiment was done using the CIFAR-10-LT dataset with an imbalance factor of 10.

> This table presents the top-1 accuracy results for four long-tailed image classification datasets.  The results are categorized by dataset and imbalance factor (IF).  The IF represents the ratio between the number of samples in the most frequent class and the least frequent class.  Lower IF indicates a less severe imbalance problem. The table compares the performance of several common loss functions (Cross Entropy, Focal Loss, Class-Balanced Loss, and Logit Adjustment) with and without the proposed RDR method.





### In-depth insights


#### Density Ratio RDR
The proposed Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR) method offers a novel approach to handling class imbalance in training data.  It dynamically adjusts class weights during training, **mitigating overfitting on majority classes** and improving generalization.  This is achieved by using density ratio estimation to continuously adapt weights to changing class densities, addressing limitations of prior static re-weighting methods.  **Real-time density ratio estimation** using feature extractors enhances adaptability. RDR shows promising results in experiments, especially with severe class imbalance. **Robustness and adaptability** are key features, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for imbalanced learning problems.

#### Dynamic Weighting
Dynamic weighting, in the context of imbalanced learning, is a crucial technique to address the class imbalance problem.  It involves assigning weights to samples or classes during training, **adaptively adjusting the influence of each class to mitigate the dominance of the majority class and improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.**  This adaptive nature distinguishes it from static weighting, where weights remain constant throughout the training process. The effectiveness of dynamic weighting hinges on the method used to determine the weights.  **Successful methods typically leverage real-time information about the training process, class distributions, or even model performance itself** to dynamically adjust weights.  This approach enhances the model's ability to learn from imbalanced data and generalize well to unseen data, leading to more robust and fair predictions.

#### Imbalanced Datasets
Imbalanced datasets, where some classes significantly outnumber others, pose a major challenge in machine learning.  **Standard algorithms often exhibit bias toward the majority class**, leading to poor performance on the minority classes, which are frequently the most critical.  This issue is prevalent in real-world applications like medical diagnosis and fraud detection, where misclassifying minority instances can have severe consequences. Addressing this requires techniques that **re-weight samples**, **oversample minority classes**, or **undersample majority classes** to balance the class distribution.  **Recent methods employ density ratio estimation to dynamically adjust class weights**, enhancing model adaptability and performance, particularly in scenarios with severely skewed data.  **Generalization bounds** offer theoretical justification for these approaches and emphasize the importance of accurately reflecting class distribution during training for robust model behavior.

#### Generalization Bounds
Generalization bounds in machine learning offer a crucial perspective on a model's ability to generalize beyond its training data.  **Tight bounds are highly desirable**, indicating strong generalization capacity, implying that the model's performance on unseen data will closely reflect its training performance. Conversely, **loose bounds raise concerns**, suggesting potential overfitting and unreliable performance on new data.  Analyzing generalization bounds involves considering factors such as model complexity, data distribution, and the learning algorithm. **Understanding these bounds helps to guide model selection and hyperparameter tuning**, allowing researchers to build robust models that reliably generalize to real-world scenarios.  The study of generalization bounds is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to refine theoretical analyses and develop more practical techniques for assessing a model‚Äôs generalization capabilities.

#### Future Works
The paper's core contribution is a novel re-weighting method, RDR, which dynamically adjusts class weights during training for imbalanced datasets.  **Future work could explore several promising avenues.**  First, extending RDR to handle extremely large-scale datasets, such as those encountered in some real-world applications (e.g., image recognition with millions of classes) by exploring more computationally efficient density ratio estimation techniques would be valuable. Second, **rigorous theoretical analysis of RDR's generalization properties** under various levels of class imbalance would strengthen the method's foundation. Third, **investigating RDR's robustness to noisy labels** and its sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning is crucial for practical implementation.  Finally, applying RDR to diverse tasks beyond image classification, such as imbalanced regression or time series analysis, to demonstrate its wider applicability would be significant.  **Detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methods** on various benchmark datasets should be included as well.  Addressing these areas would solidify RDR's position as a robust and versatile tool in the arsenal of imbalanced learning techniques.

> This figure illustrates the framework of the Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR) method. The left side shows the ordinary process of feature extraction (f) and classification (g), where the feature extractor learns features from the training data and updates its feature prototypes using a momentum update mechanism. The extracted features are then used by the classifier for classification. The right side shows the dynamic re-weighting process. The RDR method dynamically adjusts the weights of different classes by using the density ratio estimation. The weights are calculated based on the difference between the balanced data distribution and the real data distribution. The figure highlights the difference between constant re-weighting and dynamic re-weighting. Constant re-weighting doesn't adapt to changes during training, while dynamic re-weighting adjusts the importance of each class during training, thereby mitigating learning disparities in imbalanced distributions.
