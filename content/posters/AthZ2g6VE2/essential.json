Existing methods often struggle with the slow and costly transfer of high-dimensional data between clients and a central server. Reducing communication is critical for scalability and practicality, but current approaches often only partially solve this problem. \nLoCoDL tackles communication issues by smartly combining two popular techniques: Local Training (LT) and Communication Compression (CC). LT reduces communication frequency, while CC transmits shorter bitstreams instead of full-data vectors. LoCoDL offers theoretical proof and empirical evidence of a \"doubly accelerated\" communication complexity.  This means significant speedups compared to existing algorithms in both communication rounds and the amount of data transmitted, especially beneficial in large-scale deployments.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "AthZ2g6VE2/podcast.wav"}
