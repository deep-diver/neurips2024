A core challenge in DRL is determining the minimum number of samples needed for accurate distribution estimation, particularly in model-based settings where transitions are provided by a generative model. Prior work revealed a significant gap between theoretical lower and upper bounds on sample complexity.\nThis paper introduces the Direct Categorical Fixed-Point algorithm (DCFP), which is proven to be near-minimax optimal for approximating return distributions.  The analysis introduces a new distributional Bellman equation and provides theoretical insights into categorical approaches to DRL.  Empirical results comparing DCFP to other model-based DRL algorithms highlight the importance of environment stochasticity and discount factors in algorithm performance.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "JXKbf1d4ib/podcast.wav"}
