The x-axis represents either the number of samples per state or wall-clock time, and the y-axis shows the approximation error (Wasserstein distance).  Different plots show the results for varying discount factors (\u03b3), numbers of atoms (m), and algorithms.", "section": "6 Empirical evaluation"}]
