This addresses a major limitation in the field, enabling broader application of these computationally cheaper methods and opening avenues for future work in similar settings.", "summary": "Greedy algorithms for linear contextual bandits achieve poly-logarithmic regret under the novel Local Anti-Concentration condition, expanding applicable distributions beyond Gaussians and uniforms.", "takeaways": ["A new Local Anti-Concentration (LAC) condition allows exploration-free greedy algorithms to achieve provable efficiency in linear contextual bandits.", "The LAC condition is satisfied by a wide array of distributions, including Gaussian, exponential, uniform, and others, significantly expanding applicability.", "Under the LAC condition, the greedy algorithm achieves a sharp poly-logarithmic regret bound of O(poly log T)."], "tldr": "Linear contextual bandits require balancing exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative rewards.  Existing efficient exploration-free greedy algorithms were limited to Gaussian and uniform distributions, thus limiting real-world application.  This restriction hinders progress in situations where exploration is costly or impractical.\nThis paper introduces a new condition, Local Anti-Concentration (LAC), enabling efficient greedy algorithms for a wider range of distributions.  **The LAC condition guarantees a poly-logarithmic regret bound (O(poly log T))**, meaning the algorithm performs efficiently even without exploration. This is a significant step forward, expanding the applicability of simple, computationally efficient greedy strategies to many more real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "Columbia University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "rblaF2euXQ/podcast.wav"}
