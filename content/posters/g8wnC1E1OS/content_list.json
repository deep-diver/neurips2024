Specifically, the evils clients makes normal predictions on benign samples and outputs the pre-defined target when the input contains a specific pattern trigger [89, 7, 17, 38, 30, 4, 98, 52].

The former two groups focus on detecting and mitigating malicious attack based on calculating individual distance differences or overall statistical characteristics to detect the outlier behavior. However, these two forms struggle to work under the data heterogeneous federation, where distributed data presents non-IID (independently identically distribution) and local optimization directions are dramatically distinct from each other. Therefore, they normally require the data homogeneous assumption for realistic settings. As regards the Proxy Evaluation Defense, they utilize the additional validation datasets with the same semantics for the ensemble distillation [87], prediction marginal contribution [102], and prediction confidence [8, 74]. Therefore, the qualified proxy dataset acts as a prerequisite to its feasibility and poses a huge collection obstacle in challenging scenarios, e.g., medical applications [78] and financial markets [120]. Towards the Client Side Defense, it designs the client-wise regularization term to control the client updating direction such as unlearning and smoothing theory [104, 1], Hessian matrix [123], and meta-learning [75].

Thus, we estimate the importance of client parameters using the Fisher Information Matrix FIM on the corresponding local distribution. First, we introduce the Fisher Client Discrepancy Cluster (FCDC) to quantify the client gradient discrepancy via respective parameter importance. Clients with substantial gradient divergences are flagged as potentially malicious and excluded from the aggregation process. To be precise, After client optimization, we collect updated gradients along with their respective parameter importance, which adjusts the weight of the uploaded gradients with the expectation to accentuate crucial element updates and weaken trivial ones for the local distribution. Subsequently, we cluster the gradient updates discrepancy, identifying clients with notable discrepancies as potentially malicious. Second, we argue that during the parameter aggregation, each parameter element is allocated equal attention, which ignores the fact that parameters behave with different importance towards the target distribution. Then, we propose the Fisher Parameter Rescale Aggregation (FPRA) to rescale the element updates based on the assessed parameter importance. We argue that allocating high updating rangeability for those important parameters would increase the optimization stage and potentially weaken the trivial elements effect.

However, its performance is limited by the distributed data, which poses non-independent and identically distribution (called data heterogeneity) [119, 53, 96, 28]. Derived from the milestone methodology, FedAvg [67], a growing body of literature has been devoted to rectifying the local drift caused by the data heterogeneity. Typical works mainly leverage the global signals such as shared model [86, 54, 51, 47, 106, 97], statistical distribution [61, 115, 122, 70, 34, 91, 92], and gradient collection [39, 22]. Some focus on self regularization [55, 114, 115, 68, 85, 32] to calibrate the biased updating direction. However, existing federated optimization methods focus on calibrating the client optimization objective to acquire a well-performing global model under the assumption of trustworthy clients. Thus, they fail to establish a defense against backdoor attacks and their effectiveness can be arbitrarily manipulated by malicious clients [29, 5, 89, 109]. In our work, we consider the client parameter importance difference and argue that malicious clients focus on fitting a largely different distribution and thus appear the different parameter important attitude.

To deal with backdoor attackers, existing Backdoor Defense solutions could be basically classified into four categories: i) Distance Difference Defense [6, 21, 93, 10, 10, 118, 27, 18, 33] mainly focus on distinguishing benign clients from malicious attackers via the local party updates difference and regard those significantly far from the overall direction as evils, excluded from the aggregation process. For instance, Multi Krum [6] selects the candidate gradient that is the closest to its neighboring clients. DnC [83] leverages singular value decomposition-based spectral methods for outliers detection and removal. ii) Statistics Distribution Defense [112, 25, 79, 117, 9] construct diverse statistical criteria to select and remove the evil clients. RFA [79] calculates the geometric median with an alternating minimization function. FLDetector [117] considers the historical client updates and votes for those with large discrepancies between the predicted and received client updates as attackers. Despite these advantages, the above two streams are sensitive to the degree of data heterogeneity and require complicated hyper-parameter configurations to adapt to various heterogeneous federated scenarios. iii) Proxy Evaluation Defense turn to seek help from the relative proxy datasets to conduct additional evaluation [8, 74, 31]. Specifically, FLTrust [8] collects a clean small training dataset and thus introduces Relu-clipped cosine similarity to allocate high trust scores for those reliable clients. However, the central server faces the qualified dataset collection burden, which hampers their practicability. iv) Client Side Defense [104, 123, 116, 1, 75] proposes the client-side defense based on different optimization targets, e.g., clipping and smoothing operations [104]. However, these approaches necessitate that clients adhere to specific optimization regularization, rendering them vulnerable under adaptive tasks. Overall, current defense solutions demand one or more of the following: specialized hyper-parameter configuration, accessible supplementary datasets, or uniform regularization strategies. In our research, driven by the distinct characteristics of deep neural networks, we contend that parameters exhibit varied levels of importance relative to the target distribution.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
