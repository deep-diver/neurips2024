It compares the proposed methods (Theorem 1 and Theorem 2) against existing methods like signSGD, EF-signSGD, signSGD-SIM, SignSVRG, SignRVR, and SignRVM. The table shows the setting (stochastic or finite-sum), the measure (l\u2081-norm or l\u2082-norm), and the resulting convergence rate O(f(N)) in terms of the number of stochastic gradient calls (N) and the number of component functions (m) for finite-sum problems. Note that some existing results reported in the literature use the squared l\u2081-norm or l\u2082-norm, which are converted to the standard l\u2081-norm or l\u2082-norm for a fair comparison.", "section": "Related work"}, {"figure_path": "uaNZvF1VFe/tables/tables_2_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Summary of results for sign-based algorithms under the majority vote setting, where n is the number of workers.

It compares the performance of different algorithms under both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, highlighting the impact of data heterogeneity on convergence. The convergence rates are expressed in terms of the number of iterations (T) and the data dimension (d), with some algorithms also including the number of workers (n) or the number of component functions (m) in their complexity.", "section": "Summary of results for sign-based algorithms under the majority vote setting"}]
