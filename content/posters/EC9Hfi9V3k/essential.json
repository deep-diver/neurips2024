This necessitates efficient semi-streaming algorithms that can process data sequentially with limited memory. The challenge lies in balancing the need for uniform sampling with memory constraints and pass efficiency.\nThe proposed algorithm, STREAM-UGS, tackles this challenge head-on.  It uses a novel two-phase approach: preprocessing and sampling.  The preprocessing phase computes an approximate topological order and probability distribution, requiring only O(log n) passes. The sampling phase efficiently generates multiple independent uniform k-graphlets in O(k) passes, using memory M = \u03a9(nlogn).  The algorithms demonstrate near-optimal trade-offs between memory and the number of passes, running efficiently on very large graphs.", "affiliation": "Saarland University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "EC9Hfi9V3k/podcast.wav"}
