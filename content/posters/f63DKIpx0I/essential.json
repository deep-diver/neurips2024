Current adaptation strategies often react without understanding the root cause, leading to inefficient or even harmful corrections. This paper introduces a novel approach called self-healing machine learning (SHML) which equips ML models with the ability to autonomously diagnose the reason for performance issues and select appropriate corrective actions.  This addresses limitations of existing reason-agnostic approaches.\nThe core of SHML involves four stages: monitoring performance, diagnosing the cause of degradation, selecting an appropriate adaptation action based on the diagnosis, and testing the effectiveness of the action.  The paper introduces H-LLM, a novel self-healing algorithm that employs large language models to perform self-diagnosis and adaptation.  Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that H-LLM effectively improves model performance under various conditions compared to traditional methods. This establishes SHML's effectiveness and suggests exciting future research avenues.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "f63DKIpx0I/podcast.wav"}
