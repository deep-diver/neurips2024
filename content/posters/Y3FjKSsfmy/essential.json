Existing solutions primarily focused on representation collapse, neglecting the impact on weight matrices and hidden features. This limited the effectiveness of existing methods.\nThis paper introduces orthogonal regularization (OR) to mitigate dimensional collapse by promoting orthogonality within the encoder's weight matrices.  Empirical results demonstrate that OR consistently boosts performance across diverse SSL methods and network architectures (CNNs and Transformers). The method shows a consistent gain across various benchmark datasets, highlighting its broad applicability and robustness.  The approach is theoretically sound and easy to implement, making it a valuable contribution to the SSL field.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Y3FjKSsfmy/podcast.wav"}
