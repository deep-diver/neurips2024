{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in multi-modal learning as it systematically investigates factors affecting the performance of multi-modal in-context learning (MM-ICL).  It identifies key performance determinants, including the importance of **multi-modal retrievers**, **intra-demonstration ordering**, and **introductory instructions** in prompts. This work is highly relevant to current research trends in large language models and opens new avenues for optimizing MM-ICL strategies, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of VLLMs.", "summary": "Unlocking the full potential of multi-modal in-context learning requires understanding its core factors. This research systematically explores these factors, highlighting the importance of a multi-modal retriever, intra-demonstration ordering, and introductory instructions for improved performance.", "takeaways": ["Multi-modal alignment is crucial for MM-ICL success, with multi-modal retrievers significantly outperforming single-modal ones.", "Intra-demonstration ordering (especially modality order) matters more than inter-demonstration ordering for effective MM-ICL.", "Introductory instructions in prompts enhance task comprehension and improve MM-ICL performance compared to summative or intra-demonstration instructions."], "tldr": "Multi-modal in-context learning (MM-ICL) shows great promise but lacks a comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness. Existing research focuses primarily on optimization techniques, neglecting the underlying factors affecting its performance. This paper addresses this gap by systematically investigating MM-ICL's three core steps: demonstration retrieval, ordering, and prompt construction.  The researchers conducted extensive experiments on six vision large language models and twenty strategies across four tasks. \nThe study reveals three key factors: a multi-modal retriever significantly improves performance over single-modal ones; intra-demonstration ordering, especially modality sequence, is more important than inter-demonstration ordering; and using introductory instructions in prompts greatly enhances task comprehension and performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for researchers to optimize MM-ICL strategies and improve the capabilities of vision-language models. The research contributes a foundational guide for future research in optimizing MM-ICL, offering insights into demonstration retrieval, ordering, and prompt construction.", "affiliation": "Central South University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "REVdYKGcfb/podcast.wav"}
