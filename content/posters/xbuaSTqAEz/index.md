### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing multiple clustering methods struggle to adapt to diverse user needs, often requiring manual interpretation of results. This paper introduces Multi-Sub, a novel end-to-end approach that uses multi-modal subspace proxy learning to align textual user preferences with visual data representations. By utilizing CLIP and GPT-4, Multi-Sub automatically generates proxy words reflecting user interests as subspace bases, facilitating customized data representation. 



Multi-Sub's key contribution is its simultaneous learning of representations and clustering, unlike traditional methods that separate these stages.  This simultaneous optimization significantly improves performance and efficiency. Experiments across numerous datasets consistently demonstrate Multi-Sub's superiority over existing baselines in visual multiple clustering tasks. **The simultaneous learning and enhanced user interaction significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of multiple clustering.**

> This figure illustrates the Multi-Sub framework, a two-phase iterative approach aligning images with user-defined preferences for clustering.  Phase I learns proxy word embeddings by aligning textual prompts with image features in a subspace defined by reference words (common categories from a large language model).  Phase II refines the image encoder using a clustering loss, resulting in clustering tailored to the user's interest. The process iteratively refines both the proxy word embeddings and the image representation, achieving customized clustering results.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-modal Fusion
Multi-modal fusion, in the context of the provided research paper, likely refers to the integration of visual and textual data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences for customized multiple clustering.  The core idea revolves around leveraging the strengths of both modalities: visual data (images of objects) provides rich features, while textual data (user prompts, keywords generated from LLMs) offers explicit semantic meaning and user intent. **Effective fusion techniques are crucial**, as simply concatenating visual and textual embeddings may not capture the nuanced relationships between them.  The paper likely explores methods to align these modalities, perhaps using techniques like cross-attention or subspace projection, to create a unified representation that is then utilized for the clustering tasks. This alignment would ensure that the resulting clusters reflect both the visual characteristics and the underlying textual intent of the user. The success of such fusion depends heavily on the choice of models (e.g., CLIP, GPT-4) and the specific fusion methods employed. **A critical aspect is the generation of proxy words from large language models, which act as bridge between textual prompts and visual features**; this step is likely crucial for effectively embedding user-specific preferences into the clustering process.

#### Proxy Learning
Proxy learning, in the context of the research paper, is a crucial technique for bridging the gap between high-level user preferences and low-level visual data representations.  Instead of directly relying on complex, potentially noisy data features, it leverages **intermediate representations (proxies)** to capture user intent more effectively. These proxies might be generated from large language models, using textual descriptions of user interests to create a subspace within the visual feature space. The method's ingenuity lies in **aligning these proxies with visual data**, enabling the model to focus on relevant aspects specified by the user. By automatically learning and refining these proxies, the model implicitly learns to express user preferences in the visual domain, creating a more personalized and effective clustering approach.  The effectiveness of proxy learning directly contributes to the **enhanced accuracy and efficiency** of the multiple clustering system, addressing the challenges of adapting to diverse user needs in data grouping tasks.

#### Subspace Alignment
Subspace alignment, in the context of multi-modal learning and clustering, focuses on aligning the feature representations from different modalities (e.g., images and text) within a shared subspace.  This is crucial because different modalities typically have distinct feature spaces.  **Direct comparison or integration becomes challenging without proper alignment.** Effective subspace alignment techniques enable models to learn joint representations, capturing the synergistic information across modalities.  In the specific case of the research paper, it seems subspace alignment is achieved by leveraging the capabilities of large language models and multi-modal encoders.  By generating proxy words representing user preferences, the method effectively bridges the gap between textual and visual representations.  The generated proxy words act as basis vectors to define the target subspace, enabling a customized and refined alignment for specific clustering tasks. **The success of this approach relies on the ability of the large language model to effectively capture and convey user preferences into semantically meaningful word choices, and the effectiveness of the multi-modal encoder in generating suitable visual and textual representations.**  This alignment process is an integral part of the entire framework, impacting both the effectiveness of clustering and the interpretability of the results.  Ultimately, this alignment method shows potential for improving the efficiency and relevance of multi-modal clustering algorithms for diverse user needs and applications.

#### Clustering Loss
The 'Clustering Loss' section is crucial for refining the model's ability to group similar data points together and separate dissimilar ones.  It leverages pseudo-labels derived from the proxy word embeddings and image embeddings. This combined representation helps capture the desired user-defined clustering aspect.  **The loss function itself is composed of two main parts: intra-cluster loss, which aims to minimize distances within clusters promoting compactness, and inter-cluster loss, which maximizes distances between clusters enhancing separability.** The combination of these losses, balanced by a hyperparameter lambda (Œª), aims for optimally distinct and internally cohesive clusters. The iterative refinement of the image encoder‚Äôs projection layer, using this loss function, ensures that the final image representations truly align with the intended clustering defined by the proxy words.  **Simultaneously learning both the representation and clustering, as opposed to sequential approaches, is a key strength, leading to greater efficiency and improved clustering performance.**

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the efficiency and scalability** of Multi-Sub, perhaps through architectural optimizations or more efficient proxy word generation methods, is crucial for handling larger datasets and more complex user preferences.  **Investigating alternative methods** for aligning textual interests with visual features, beyond CLIP and GPT-4, could enhance robustness and adaptability.  **A deeper exploration of the interplay** between the choice of large language model and the resulting clustering quality would be valuable, potentially informing better selection criteria based on task characteristics.  Finally, applying Multi-Sub to diverse applications beyond image clustering, such as multi-modal data analysis in other domains, would demonstrate its broader utility and impact.
