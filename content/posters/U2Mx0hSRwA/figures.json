Each colored block represents a scaled gradient (\u03b7g) from a worker.  Blue blocks represent gradients that have already arrived at the server, while red blocks represent gradients that haven't yet arrived. The equation shows how the momentum is a weighted sum of these gradients, with weights determined by the momentum coefficient (\u03b2) and the order of arrival.  The order is crucial because SSGDm uses a synchronous scheduler, meaning all gradients from a given iteration must arrive before the model is updated. Gradients from earlier iterations are weighted less (higher power of \u03b2).", "section": "3.1 Reformulation of SSGD with Momentum"}, {"figure_path": "U2Mx0hSRwA/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Test accuracy curves on CIFAR10 with different numbers of workers.", "description": "This figure displays test accuracy curves for various asynchronous SGD methods (ASGD, naive ASGDm, shifted momentum, SMEGA2, OrMo, OrMo-DA) and synchronous SGD with momentum (SSGDm) on the CIFAR10 dataset.
