This is a generalization of the channel simulation problem, which has recently found applications and achieved state of the art results in realistic image compression, neural network compression, and communication-efficient federated learning. In this problem, the transmitter wants the receiver to generate multiple independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a target distribution $P$ , while the transmitter and the receiver have access to independent samples from a reference distribution $Q$ The core idea is to employ channel simulation in multiple rounds while updating the reference distribution $Q$ after each round in order to reduce the KL-divergence between $P$ and $Q$ , thereby reducing the communication cost in subsequent rounds. We derive a lower bound on the expected communication cost and construct a practical algorithm that achieves the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant. We then employ this algorithm in communication-efficient federated learning, in which model updates correspond to samples from a distribution, and achieve a $\\bar{3}7\\%$ reduction in the communication load. To further highlight the potential of sample communication for generative models, we show that the number of bits needed to communicate samples from a large language model can be reduced by up to 16 times, compared to entropy-based data compression.

The obvious procedure is to sample from $P$ at the encoder, compress it, and transmit over the network. The minimum number of bits necessary for lossless transmission of this sample is bounded by the entropy of distribution $P$ , $\\mathbf{H}(P)$ bits per sample. However, unlike in classical source coding theory, in our problem, the decoder is interested only in drawing of \u2018an arbitrary\u2019 sample from $P$ , and not the particular sample generated at the encoder. If the encoder and decoder have access to samples from another reference distribution $Q$ , then it is possible for the encoder to communicate a sample from $P$ using approximately $\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ bits instead. Thus, if we are able to sample from a distribution $Q$ that is close to $P$ , the bandwidth required to communicate a sample from $P$ can be greatly reduced. This is known as \u2018channel simulation\u2019 or \u2018reverse Shannon coding\u2019 (Bennett et al., 2002; Cuff, 2008; Harsha et al., 2010).

Another recent application of channel simulation is in federated learning (FL). Many communication efficient FL methods require sending a sample from a client-only distribution after local training. Instead of deterministic weights, the models can be parameterized with a probability distribution and the central server samples realizations from each client\u2019s updated model to construct the global model update. Recently, it was shown in Isik et al. (2023, 2024) that the overall communication cost of sending the model updates from the clients to the parameter server can be greatly reduced using channel simulation, achieving state-of-the-art results. In each iteration, the client can enable the parameter server to sample from its locally updated distribution while using the global model distribution as the common reference distribution. As the client\u2019s local distribution is typically close to the global model, the communication cost, proportional to the KL-divergence between the two, will will extremely low compared to deterministic alternatives. Channel simulation can also help in enabling differential privacy of the communicated models (Triastcyn et al., 2021; Hasircioglu and Gunduz, 2024; Hegazy et al., 2024; Shahmiri et al., 2024) since it allows for shaping the distribution of the noise.

This problem can directly find an application in the FL framework, where the global model is estimated from samples of local models. A procedure to efficiently communicate more samples would allow the parameter server to approximate the global model more accurately, which would reduce the noise and variance in its estimation, and speed up training.

Generative models are one of the most successful examples among the recent advances in machine learning.

They are trained to mimic some data distribution $P$ based on samples $X\\sim P$ drawn from it, and allow to generate novel samples from the learned distribution. With growing popularity and deployment of generative AI across a wide variety of applications, communicating the outputs of these models (particularly for image, audio and video modalities) will put an increasing burden on the underlying communication network infrastructure. However, instead of generating and then compressing a sample at the cloud server, we can exploit channel simulation to enable the users to locally generate samples at a much lower communication cost. Drawing multiple samples is a common use case for generative models. For instance, in text to image models, such as DALL-E or Midjourney, multiple images are often generated and communicated to the user based on a single prompt to allow the user choose the desired one. Other instances include translation (Lee et al., 2021; Eikema and Aziz, 2022), code generation (Chen et al., 2021) and planning (Yao et al., 2023), which can be improved by discriminating among multiple generated samples.

Firstly, by imposing additional assumptions on the probability distribution, we could substitute counting-based estimation with a Bayesian approach.

This model would be incrementally fine-tuned with the communicated samples to more accurately reflect their underlying distribution. As evidence for the potential of this idea, we apply sample communication for generating samples from a large language model on a server, using a smaller reference model at the client. While the space of text is not continuous, it is too large to estimate using count-based methods. The experimental setup and further discussion are detailed in Appendix D. As demonstrated in Table 3, the application of sample communication results in a 4- to 16-fold reduction in communication rate, depending on the auxiliary model employed. This motivates further exploration into model fine-tuning effects. Although this research currently focuses on text generation, future work will aim to extend these results to image and video generation, which represent a substantial portion of network traffic.

In the universal setting, the decoder would not know this marginal distribution.

Hence, as the receiver acquires more samples, the marginal communication cost decreases. In machine learning, many models, such as classifiers or generative models, describe (conditional) probability distributions. Thus, this recipe straightforwardly translates to such scenarios, where samples from a model can be communicated in the same way, and the estimation step can be replaced by an auxiliary model that learns based on communicated samples. Specifically, let there be a server and a client, where the client wants to use a model located at the server - for instance an artificial neural network. The model represents a conditional probability distribution $P_{X\\mid Z=z}$ , where $z$ is the input to the model. In addition, both the client and the server have access to an auxiliary model describing $Q_{X\\mid Z=z}$ . The client sends $z$ to the server, and then a sample $x\\sim P_{X\\mid Z=z}$ generated by the server\u2019s model can be communicated back with approximately $\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P_{X|Z=z}\\|Q_{X|Z=z})$ bits. Then, the data point $(z,x)$ , can be used for updating the common reference model $Q_{X\\mid Z=z}$ . If models $P$ and $Q$ are of the same size, this scheme could be understood as model compression, where $P$ is communicated by using samples from it, and then reconstructed at the client as $Q$ . However, if model $P$ is much bigger than $Q$ , then presumably the clients\u2019 model could not fit the same distribution perfectly, and the distributions may differ significantly. As such, there is a trade-off between computation/ complexity at the client and the required communication. Additionally, the model at the server might be capable at the whole range of $z\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}$ , while the client might only be interested in some smaller subset of values of $z\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}^{\\prime}\\subseteq{\\mathcal{Z}}$ . In this case, even less powerful model $Q$ could learn good approximation of $P_{X\\mid Z=z}$ for the desired input space.

Instead of the estimation/learning step, we use models of different sizes from the family of Open Pre-train Transformer (OPT) models Zhang et al. (2022) (MIT license). In particular, we use the 13 billion (13B) parameter model to represent the desired conditional probability $P$ , while $Q$ is represented by one of the smaller OPT models with $\\{125\\mathbf{M},350\\mathbf{M},1.3\\mathbf{B},2.7\\mathbf{B},6.\\bar{7}\\mathbf{B}\\}$ parameters, where M denotes million, and B billion. The classical way to communicate such samples is to generate the distribution at the server, sample from it, and then encode and transmit the result - we refer to this method as source coding, and, as mentioned before, it has the minimal cost $\\mathbf{H}(P)$ , while the sample communication approach would have an approximate cost of $\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ (per sample).

A LLM describes the probability of the next token conditioned on the all the previous ones. This is enough to describe any distribution over a sequence, as it can be factorized in an autoregressive way $\\begin{array}{r}{P(\\check{X^{n}})=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(\\check{X_{i}}|X^{i-1})}\\end{array}$ . To sample from such distributions, we can sample the first element, then conditioned on it sample the second one, and so on so forth.

For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
