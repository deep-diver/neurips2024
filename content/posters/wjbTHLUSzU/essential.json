Current methods rely on heuristics that don't guarantee optimal data distribution for specific tasks, leading to suboptimal finetuned models.  The process of manually identifying suitable data from a massive dataset is also infeasible. This paper tackles these challenges.\nThe paper introduces TSDS, a novel framework that formulates data selection as an optimization problem.  It cleverly uses optimal transport to align the data distribution with the target task's distribution. A regularizer is also added to promote the diversity of the selected data, thus mitigating negative effects of near-duplicate data.  TSDS connects this optimization problem to nearest neighbor search, enabling efficient computation even with massive datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method surpasses existing techniques, outperforming baseline models in both instruction tuning and continued pretraining tasks.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "wjbTHLUSzU/podcast.wav"}
