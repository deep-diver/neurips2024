This paper introduces hierarchical reinforcement learning to enable scalable oversight, efficiently acquiring feedback and learning optimal policies with sub-linear regret.", "takeaways": ["Hierarchical RL structures enable scalable oversight of large AI models by leveraging the structure of outputs to manage human labeling.", "Novel algorithms enable efficient human feedback integration for both cardinal and ordinal feedback settings.", "Theoretical analysis demonstrates that sub-linear regret is achievable in hierarchical RL when using appropriate reward functions and feedback strategies."], "tldr": "Training next-generation AI models is hampered by the vast size of model outputs and the limitation of human labeling resources.  This means that human feedback, critical for ensuring model alignment and safety, becomes time-consuming and expensive to acquire for models producing long-form outputs, such as long-form text and videos. This paper proposes addressing this issue using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a popular approach that leverages the hierarchical structure often inherent in complex AI model outputs to provide scalable oversight. \nThe paper focuses on two feedback settings: cardinal (numerical ratings) and ordinal (preference feedback). For the cardinal feedback setting, a novel algorithm, Hier-UCB-VI, is developed, which is proven to learn optimal policies with sub-linear regret. The efficiency comes from using an 'apt' sub-MDP reward function and strategic exploration of sub-MDPs. For the ordinal feedback setting, a hierarchical experimental design algorithm, Hier-REGIME, is proposed to efficiently collect high-level and low-level preference feedback. This addresses the difficulty of assessing model outputs at all levels. Both algorithms aim to manage the trade-off between human labeling efficiency and model learning performance, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical structures in enabling scalable oversight.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3tj3A26wsV/podcast.wav"}
