The results indicate that TwinAct surpasses all baseline methods.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of TwinAct against several baseline methods for generating customized action images.  The comparison uses both objective metrics (SAction: action similarity, SActor: actor identity similarity) and user study scores (UAction: user rating for action quality, UActor: user rating for actor identity consistency).  Higher scores indicate better performance.  The results clearly show that TwinAct outperforms all the other methods in both objective measures and user evaluation.", "section": "4.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods"}]
