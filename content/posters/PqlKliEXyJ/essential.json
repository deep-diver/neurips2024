These maps also raise privacy concerns.  This is problematic for applications like drone navigation, where resource constraints are significant.  This paper addresses these issues by proposing LoD-Loc.\n\nLoD-Loc uses Level of Detail (LoD) 3D maps, which are significantly smaller and less detailed than traditional textured 3D maps, offering advantages in terms of size and privacy.  The method cleverly aligns predicted wireframes from a neural network with projected wireframes from the LoD map to estimate the drone's pose.  **LoD-Loc demonstrates excellent performance and introduces two new datasets with LoD maps and ground truth data**, advancing the state-of-the-art and making significant contributions to the field of aerial visual localization.", "affiliation": "National University of Defense Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "PqlKliEXyJ/podcast.wav"}
