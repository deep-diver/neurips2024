Traditional metrics like accuracy require ground truth labels, which are often expensive or unavailable in this setting. This limitation hinders the progress and wider application of weakly supervised learning.  This paper tackles this problem by shifting the evaluation from the search for point estimates to deriving reliable performance bounds. \n\nThe researchers propose using Fr\u00e9chet bounds to estimate these bounds. Their method efficiently calculates the upper and lower bounds on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score without using ground truth labels. They achieve this through scalable convex optimization, solving computational limitations of previous approaches.  The paper presents a practical algorithm, quantifies uncertainty in estimations and demonstrates the approach's robustness in high-dimensional scenarios, **expanding the practical applicability of weakly supervised learning**.", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VOVyeOzZx0/podcast.wav"}
