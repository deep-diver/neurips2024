The left side shows the input ST observations from sensor deployment, which are processed by a pre-trained Vision Transformer for reconstruction.  The reconstruction step allows CaPaint to identify causal and non-causal regions (patches). A binarization step then distinguishes between causal and non-causal patches. This information is utilized in an inpainting step where the non-causal regions are selectively masked and re-generated by a diffusion model, resulting in augmented ST data. The right side of the figure compares the computational complexity of CaPaint (quasi-linear) with SOTA approaches (exponential). This comparison showcases CaPaint's efficiency in generating data, which is crucial for handling large-scale ST data.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "1ONdF1JHyJ/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The details of CaPaint.
