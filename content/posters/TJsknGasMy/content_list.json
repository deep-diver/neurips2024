At the core of this computation lies a subsampling method that uses a privacy amplification lemma to enhance the privacy guarantees provided by the additive noise. Fixed size subsampling is appealing for its constant memory usage, unlike the variable sized minibatches in Poisson subsampling. It is also of interest in addressing class imbalance and federated learning. Current computable guarantees for fixed-size subsampling are not tight and do not consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency relationships. We present a new and holistic R\u00e9nyi differential privacy (RDP) accountant for DP-SGD with fixed-size subsampling without replacement (FSwoR) and with replacement (FSwR). For FSwoR we consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency, where we improve on the best current computable bound by a factor of 4.

DP-SGD allows a so-called moments accountant technique to sequentially track privacy leakage (Abadi et al., 2016). This technique is subsumed by R\u00e9nyi differential privacy (RDP) (Mironov, 2017), a relaxation of standard differential privacy (DP) (Dwork and Rothblum, 2016) that is widely used in private deep learning and implemented in modern DP libraries such as Opacus (Meta Platforms, 2024) and autodp (Zhu and Wang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2022). RDP facilitates rigorous analysis when the dataset is accessed by a sequence of randomized mechanisms as in DP-SGD. While other privacy accountant frameworks such as $f$ -DP (Dong et al., 2022), privacy loss distributions (PLD) (Koskela et al., 2020), Privacy Random Variable (PRV) (Gopi et al., 2021), Analytical Fourier Accountant (AFA) (Zhu et al., 2022), and Saddle-Point Accountant (SPA) Alghamdi et al. (2023) have been proposed to improve conversion to privacy profiles, RDP is still one of the main privacy accountants used in popular deep learning tools and applications. Thus, we expect providing tighter bounds specific to RDP will have important practical implications for the community. Each iteration of DP-SGD can be viewed as a private release of information about a stochastic gradient. DP accounting methods bound the total privacy loss incurred by applying a sequence of DP-SGD mechanisms in training. Privacy of the overall mechanism is ensured through the application of two random processes: 1) a randomized mechanism that subsamples minibatches of the training data, 2) noise applied to each gradient calculation (e.g.. Gaussian). Informally, if a mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ -DP then a mechanism that subsamples with probability $q\\in(0,1)$ ensures privacy $(O(q\\epsilon),q\\dot{\\delta})$ -DP; a result known as the \u201cprivacy amplification lemma\" (Li et al., 2012; Zhu and Wang, 2019). Computing the privacy parameters of a mechanism requires an accounting procedure that can be nontrivial to design. Abadi et al. (2016) compute DP parameters for the special case of Gaussian noise, which was later extended to track RDP parameters by Mironov (2017). These analyses are limited to Poisson subsampling mechanisms which produce minibatches of variable size. This creates engineering challenges in modern machine learning pipelines and also does not allow for sampling with replacement. Fixed-size minibatches are preferable as they can be aligned with available GPU memory, leading to higher learning throughput. In practice, fixed size minibathces are of interest in practical applications such as private federated learning. To address the issue, Wang et al. (2019) and Zhu et al. (2022) propose the latest fixed-size accounting methods. Wang et al. (2019) provide computable RDP bounds for FSwoR that cover general mechanisms under replace-one adjacency, while Zhu et al. (2022) give computable bounds for FSwoR under add/remove adjacency. Specifically, the study in Wang et al. (2019) provides a general formula to convert the RDP parameters of a mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ to RDP parameters of a subsampled (without replacement) mechanism, but the bounds they provide are only tight up to a constant factor at leading order (i.e., comparing dominant terms in the asymptotic expansion in $q$ ). Moreover, while the FSwoR results under add/remove adjacency relationship in (Zhu et al., 2022) are in parallel to our results, their accountant is not readily applicable to FSwoR under replace-one adjacency relationship.

RDP and many other flavors of DP rely on subsampling for privacy amplification to ensure that privacy guarantees hold when DP-SGD is applied on samples (i.e., minibatches) of training data (Bun et al., 2018; Balle et al., 2018). Later works such as (Mironov et al., 2019; Zhu and Wang, 2019) propose a generic refined bound for subsampled Gaussian Mechanism that improves the tightness of guarantees in RDP. However, these methods also produce variable-sized minibatches. Bun et al. (2018), Balle et al. (2018), and Wang et al. (2019) propose fixed-size subsampled mechanisms. Balle et al.

However, in the context of DP-SGD, there are still technical and practical difficulties. For instance, in DP-SGD there is generally a large number of training steps, in which case the numerical integrations required by Algorithm 1 in Zhu et al. (2022) involve the sum of a large number of oscillatory terms. This can lead to numerical difficulties, especially in light of the lack of rigorous error bounds for the double (Gaussian) quadrature numerical integration approach as discussed in their Appendix E.1. In addition, the bounds in Zhu et al. (2022) are not readily applicable under replace-one adjacency. Due to these considerations, and the fact that RDP is still widely used, in this work we focus on improving the RDP bounds from Wang et al. (2019).Hayes et al. (2024) uses the results in (Zhu et al., 2022) to provide a bound specific to DP-SGD when one is only concerned with training data reconstruction attacks rather than the membership inference attacks, which leads to a relaxation of DP to provide a bound that is only applicable to defending against data reconstruction and not membership inference.

Our setup closely follows the procedure in (Abadi et al., 2016).

To tackle this issue, the Opacus implementation requires the additional complication of wrapping the Pytorch DataLoader object into a BatchMemoryManager object, to alleviate the memory intensive nature of Poisson subsampling. BatchMemoryManager requires privacy practitioners to define two minibatch sizes: one is a logical minibatch size for Poisson sampling and the other is a physical minibatch size that determines the actual space allocated in memory and is determined by the practitioner via a variable named max_physical-batch_size (Meta Platforms, 2024).

For subsampling without replacement under replace-one adjacency, we obtained significantly tighter RDP bounds (4 times improvement) over the most recent computable results (Wang et al., 2019). For subsampling with replacement we obtained the first non-asymptotic upper and lower RDP bounds for DP-SGD. We also provided the first comparison of gradient estimator's variance and privacy guarantees between FS-RDP and Poisson subsampled RDP commonly used in DP libraries. Our analysis revealed that FS-RDP reduces the variance of the gradient estimator.
