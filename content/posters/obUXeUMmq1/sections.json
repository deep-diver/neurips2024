[{"heading_title": "DEQ's NC Behavior", "details": {"summary": "The analysis of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) through the lens of Neural Collapse (NC) reveals interesting insights into DEQ's representational capabilities, especially under imbalanced data conditions.  **Theoretically, DEQ exhibits NC under balanced datasets**, mirroring the behavior of traditional explicit networks. However, **under imbalanced settings, DEQ demonstrates advantages**. Unlike explicit networks that often suffer from minority class collapse, DEQ shows a more robust feature convergence.  The theoretical analysis provides conditions under which DEQ's extracted features converge to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame, aligning with classifier weights.  This superior behavior in imbalanced scenarios highlights **DEQ's potential for handling real-world data**, where class imbalances are common.  Empirical validation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets confirms these theoretical findings, showcasing DEQ's improved performance and robustness compared to its explicit counterparts."}}, {"heading_title": "Imbalanced DEQ", "details": {"summary": "In the context of deep equilibrium models (DEQ), handling imbalanced datasets presents a unique challenge.  Standard DEQ training might struggle to adequately represent minority classes due to their limited data.  A thoughtful approach would involve modifications to the DEQ architecture or training process to address class imbalance. **Strategies such as data augmentation, cost-sensitive learning, or incorporating a re-weighting scheme** could help balance the influence of different classes during training. Furthermore, **theoretical analysis of the impact of class imbalance on DEQ's convergence properties and generalization ability** is crucial. Analyzing whether DEQ retains its memory efficiency and competitive performance under imbalanced conditions is critical.  Finally, empirical evaluation on various imbalanced datasets would validate the effectiveness of proposed methods, comparing DEQ's performance against traditional explicit neural networks under similar conditions. **The goal is to determine if DEQ maintains its advantages or exhibits unique strengths in addressing imbalanced classification problems.**"}}, {"heading_title": "Theoretical Analysis", "details": {"summary": "The theoretical analysis section of this research paper would likely delve into a rigorous mathematical framework to support the claims made regarding the Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) and its behavior under both balanced and imbalanced datasets.  It would likely leverage tools from optimization theory, matrix analysis, and potentially other areas of mathematics. **Key aspects of the theoretical analysis would center on establishing convergence properties of DEQ's iterative process,** particularly in proving the existence and convergence to a fixed point under well-defined conditions. Another critical component would involve the rigorous study of Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, **demonstrating mathematically how DEQ exhibits NC under balanced settings and analyzing the deviations from NC under imbalanced scenarios.** The analysis may include establishing upper and lower bounds on loss functions to prove DEQ's superior performance compared to explicit neural networks in certain situations. Furthermore, the analysis should provide a formal mathematical treatment of the conditions under which DEQ exhibits the observed advantages in imbalanced settings. The theoretical arguments will likely involve the exploration of the geometric properties of the learned features and classifier weights in various scenarios.  **Mathematical proofs and theorems are expected to be a central part of this section, forming the cornerstone of the paper's credibility and providing strong support for the experimental findings.**"}}, {"heading_title": "Experimental Setup", "details": {"summary": "The \"Experimental Setup\" section of a research paper is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the methodology.  It should detail all aspects of the experiments, enabling others to replicate the results.
