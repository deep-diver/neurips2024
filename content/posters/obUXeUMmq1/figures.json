After extracting feature maps H\u00ba, further features H or z* can be obtained by passing through an explicit neural network or DEQ. The final step involves the classifier to obtain predicted logits. To ensure a fair comparison, we standardize the backbone network and its output H\u00ba across all conditions.", "description": "This figure illustrates the feature extraction process for both explicit neural networks and DEQs.  An image encoder processes the input image (x) to produce initial features (H\u00ba). These features then pass through either a series of explicit layers (in the explicit neural network branch) or a deep equilibrium model (DEQ) solver to produce refined features (H for explicit networks, z* for DEQ). Finally, a classifier (W) maps these refined features to logits (predictions). For consistent comparison, the image encoder and the initial feature output (H\u00ba) are standardized across both approaches.", "section": "3 Comparison under balanced setting"}, {"figure_path": "obUXeUMmq1/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Under the imbalanced setting for CIFAR-10 with K\u2081 = 3 and R = 10, the disparity in the learned features between Explicit Neural Networks (left) and DEQ (right).", "description": "This figure compares the learned features from Explicit Neural Networks and Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) under imbalanced settings using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
