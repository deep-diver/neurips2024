### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are a type of implicit neural network known for memory efficiency and performance. However, their representation and behavior, especially under imbalanced data conditions (where some classes have significantly fewer samples than others), are not well understood. This creates challenges in model training and generalization, limiting the applicability of DEQs in real-world scenarios where data imbalance is common. 

This paper systematically analyzes the representation of DEQs using the Neural Collapse (NC) framework. NC describes the geometric properties of class features and classifier weights during the final stages of neural network training. The authors show theoretically and experimentally that DEQs, unlike explicit networks, exhibit advantageous properties under imbalanced conditions. These advantages stem from the convergence of extracted features to vertices of a simplex, and their self-duality with classifier weights. This enhanced behavior is demonstrated through experiments using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification datasets.

> This figure illustrates the feature extraction process for both explicit neural networks and DEQs.  An image encoder processes the input image (x) to produce initial features (H¬∫). These features then pass through either a series of explicit layers (in the explicit neural network branch) or a deep equilibrium model (DEQ) solver to produce refined features (H for explicit networks, z* for DEQ). Finally, a classifier (W) maps these refined features to logits (predictions). For consistent comparison, the image encoder and the initial feature output (H¬∫) are standardized across both approaches.

The results show that DEQ achieves slightly higher accuracy than Explicit NN on both datasets, though the differences are relatively small.





### In-depth insights


#### DEQ's NC Behavior
The analysis of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) through the lens of Neural Collapse (NC) reveals interesting insights into DEQ's representational capabilities, especially under imbalanced data conditions.  **Theoretically, DEQ exhibits NC under balanced datasets**, mirroring the behavior of traditional explicit networks. However, **under imbalanced settings, DEQ demonstrates advantages**. Unlike explicit networks that often suffer from minority class collapse, DEQ shows a more robust feature convergence.  The theoretical analysis provides conditions under which DEQ's extracted features converge to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame, aligning with classifier weights.  This superior behavior in imbalanced scenarios highlights **DEQ's potential for handling real-world data**, where class imbalances are common.  Empirical validation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets confirms these theoretical findings, showcasing DEQ's improved performance and robustness compared to its explicit counterparts.

#### Imbalanced DEQ
In the context of deep equilibrium models (DEQ), handling imbalanced datasets presents a unique challenge.  Standard DEQ training might struggle to adequately represent minority classes due to their limited data.  A thoughtful approach would involve modifications to the DEQ architecture or training process to address class imbalance. **Strategies such as data augmentation, cost-sensitive learning, or incorporating a re-weighting scheme** could help balance the influence of different classes during training. Furthermore, **theoretical analysis of the impact of class imbalance on DEQ's convergence properties and generalization ability** is crucial. Analyzing whether DEQ retains its memory efficiency and competitive performance under imbalanced conditions is critical.  Finally, empirical evaluation on various imbalanced datasets would validate the effectiveness of proposed methods, comparing DEQ's performance against traditional explicit neural networks under similar conditions. **The goal is to determine if DEQ maintains its advantages or exhibits unique strengths in addressing imbalanced classification problems.**

#### Theoretical Analysis
The theoretical analysis section of this research paper would likely delve into a rigorous mathematical framework to support the claims made regarding the Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) and its behavior under both balanced and imbalanced datasets.  It would likely leverage tools from optimization theory, matrix analysis, and potentially other areas of mathematics. **Key aspects of the theoretical analysis would center on establishing convergence properties of DEQ's iterative process,** particularly in proving the existence and convergence to a fixed point under well-defined conditions. Another critical component would involve the rigorous study of Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, **demonstrating mathematically how DEQ exhibits NC under balanced settings and analyzing the deviations from NC under imbalanced scenarios.** The analysis may include establishing upper and lower bounds on loss functions to prove DEQ's superior performance compared to explicit neural networks in certain situations. Furthermore, the analysis should provide a formal mathematical treatment of the conditions under which DEQ exhibits the observed advantages in imbalanced settings. The theoretical arguments will likely involve the exploration of the geometric properties of the learned features and classifier weights in various scenarios.  **Mathematical proofs and theorems are expected to be a central part of this section, forming the cornerstone of the paper's credibility and providing strong support for the experimental findings.**

#### Experimental Setup
The "Experimental Setup" section of a research paper is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the methodology.  It should detail all aspects of the experiments, enabling others to replicate the results.  Key elements include a description of the datasets used, their preprocessing steps (if any),  **model architectures**, **hyperparameters** and their selection process (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization), the **training procedure** (e.g., optimizer, learning rate schedule, batch size, early stopping criteria), **evaluation metrics**, and **hardware and software used**.  The level of detail should be sufficient for another researcher to conduct the same experiment independently.  **Clear reporting of hardware specifications** is important for assessing computational efficiency, and the reproducibility of experiments is significantly enhanced through open-source availability of code and datasets. A comprehensive and precise experimental setup description ensures the work's credibility and contributes to the advancement of scientific knowledge.

#### Future Work
The paper's conclusion mentions future research directions, suggesting several avenues for extension.  **Extending the analysis beyond simple imbalanced scenarios and linear DEQ models** is crucial. Exploring more complex imbalanced settings and nonlinear DEQs would provide a more robust understanding.  **Investigating the impact of different solver algorithms and their effect on NC phenomenon** is another key direction, as is **analyzing the generalization performance of DEQs under NC**.  Furthermore, a comparative study encompassing a wider range of implicit networks and the integration of DEQs with other architectures could reveal further insights. Finally, **empirical validation on larger and more diverse datasets**, beyond CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, is necessary to confirm the broader applicability and generalizability of the theoretical findings.
