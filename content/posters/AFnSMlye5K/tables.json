It shows the HSIC values (both linear and Gaussian kernels) and the Grassmann distance between the subspaces.  The HSIC measures the dependence between the subspaces, while the Grassmann distance quantifies their separability.  The results demonstrate that increasing \u03bb leads to a greater separation of the aging and cancer subspaces, suggesting that it effectively controls for confounding factors during subspace disentanglement.  \u03bb = 0 represents the supervised PCA (sPCA) baseline.", "section": "4.3.2 Quantitative performance of subspace quality"}, {"figure_path": "AFnSMlye5K/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Information density in each sisPCA subspace.", "description": "This table presents the information density for each subspace obtained by PCA, sPCA and sisPCA with different regularization strengths (\u03bb). The information density is measured using the maximum Spearman correlation with age and the Silhouette score with cancer type.  The results show how the different methods and regularization parameters affect the ability to separate information related to aging and cancer in the different subspaces.", "section": "4.3.2 Quantitative performance of subspace quality"}, {"figure_path": "AFnSMlye5K/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative evaluation of subspace representation quality.", "description": "This table quantitatively evaluates the quality of subspace representations learned by different models (PCA, sPCA, sisPCA, VAE, supVAE, hsVAE) on a scRNA-seq dataset.  It uses two metrics: Grassmann distance, measuring the separation between subspaces, and silhouette score, evaluating the quality of clustering within each subspace for both infection status and time points.  Higher Grassmann distance indicates better subspace separation. Higher silhouette scores signify better-defined clusters.  The results show that sisPCA achieves a good balance between subspace separation and cluster quality.", "section": "4.4 Disentangling infection-induced changes in the mouse single-cell atlas of the Plasmodium liver stage"}, {"figure_path": "AFnSMlye5K/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: General comparison of baseline models.", "description": "This table compares several baseline models used in the paper, including PCA, sPCA, sisPCA, VAE, supVAE, and hsVAE.  It contrasts their approaches to supervision (none, HSIC-based, prediction), disentanglement (none, HSIC-based), interpretability (linear projection features vs. black box), hyperparameters (number and type), and optimization methods (closed-form, simple iterative, or complex deep learning).
