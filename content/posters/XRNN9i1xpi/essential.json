Existing methods often struggle with the complexity of such multidomain graph data, relying on discrete operations which cause over-smoothing and limited receptive fields.  This limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies crucial for accurate predictions in areas like traffic and weather forecasting.\n\nThis paper introduces Continuous Product Graph Neural Networks (CITRUS), a novel approach that uses continuous heat kernels to process multidomain graph data more effectively. **CITRUS leverages the separability of these kernels to efficiently implement graph spectral decomposition**.  The results show that CITRUS significantly outperforms existing methods in spatiotemporal forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for a wide range of applications involving multidomain graph data.  The stability and over-smoothing properties are thoroughly analyzed, which ensures robustness.", "affiliation": "Telecom Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Smart Cities"}, "podcast_path": "XRNN9i1xpi/podcast.wav"}
