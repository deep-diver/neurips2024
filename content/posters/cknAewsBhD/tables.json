Three conditions are compared: TAC Inactive (TAC module disabled), TAC Active (TAC module always enabled), and TAC Adaptive (TAC module dynamically enabled based on the output of the Spatiotemporal Sensitivity Module (SSM)).  The metrics presented are mean Average Precision (mAP), processing time (in milliseconds), and the number of model parameters (in millions). The results show that a dynamic approach (TAC Adaptive) balances accuracy and efficiency, achieving a good compromise between the always-on TAC (high mAP but longer processing time) and the completely inactive TAC (lower mAP but faster processing time).", "section": "4.5 Ablation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "cknAewsBhD/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison after incorporating CNN.
