Existing approaches often lose temporal precision or suffer from computational inefficiency. Hybrid methods, while showing progress, still face challenges in efficiently managing both spatial and temporal dimensions.\nThe proposed EGSST framework uses graph structures to model event data while preserving temporal information and capturing spatial details.  **It incorporates a Spatiotemporal Sensitivity Module (SSM) and an adaptive Temporal Activation Controller (TAC) to mimic the human eye's attention mechanism**, focusing on dynamic changes.  A lightweight multi-scale Linear Vision Transformer (LViT) further enhances processing efficiency.  **EGSST achieves high accuracy and speed while conserving computational resources, providing a practical solution for object detection in dynamic environments.**", "affiliation": "School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "cknAewsBhD/podcast.wav"}
