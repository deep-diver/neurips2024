However, real-world changes necessitate model updates after deployment.  Existing model editing techniques often fail to maintain overall accuracy while correcting specific errors, especially in complex GNNs where information propagates across nodes. This paper identifies a significant issue: gradient inconsistency between target and training nodes during model editing.  Direct fine-tuning leads to decreased performance on the training data.\nTo solve this, the authors propose Gradient Rewiring (GRE).  GRE first stores \"anchor gradients\" from the training data to maintain local performance.  Then, it re-wires the gradient for the target node, ensuring that edits do not negatively impact the training data.  Extensive experiments across different GNN architectures and datasets confirm that GRE effectively addresses model editing challenges, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.", "affiliation": "Texas A&M University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XY2qrq7cXM/podcast.wav"}
