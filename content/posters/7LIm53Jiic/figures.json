The red diamond represents the perturbed output (with weight errors), while the blue dot represents the clean output (without weight errors). The black dots represent the codewords.  The corollary states that if the distance between the clean output and its nearest codeword (bottom left) is smaller than a threshold (determined by the normalized distance between codewords, DNN architecture and weight error scale) plus the perturbation of the output due to weight errors, then the DNN's prediction remains unaffected by weight-errors, despite the perturbation of the output.  If the distance is greater than this threshold,  the perturbed output might be decoded to a different codeword.", "section": "4.3 Efficacy of ECOCs on the Robustness of DNNs"}, {"figure_path": "7LIm53Jiic/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: An illustration for Corollary 1.", "description": "This figure provides a geometric explanation of Corollary 1, which establishes a threshold for the robustness of a DNN using ECOCs against weight errors.

Including more complement pairs means higher average distance while larger correlation. 0 complement pair is Hadamard code.

The x-axis represents the number of complement pairs, and the y-axis represents the accuracy. Three lines represent the results with different noise levels (weight errors). The figure demonstrates that increasing the number of complement pairs increases both the average distance between codewords and the correlation among them.  A balance is found with 40 complement pairs, achieving optimal accuracy by finding the best trade-off between these two factors. The experiment is performed on the CIFAR100 dataset using the VGG-16 model and a code length of 1024.", "section": "A.3 Additional Experiments"}]
