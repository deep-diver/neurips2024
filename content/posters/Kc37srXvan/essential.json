These Transformer-based models rely on the attention mechanism, which has quadratic complexity. This quadratic scaling limits their applicability to resource-constrained environments and large-scale datasets.\nThis research introduces PointMamba, a novel state-space model that addresses the limitations of Transformer-based methods.  **PointMamba employs a linear complexity algorithm**, making it significantly more efficient than quadratic methods. The model leverages space-filling curves for efficient point tokenization and a simple, non-hierarchical Mamba encoder.  **Experimental results demonstrate superior performance** across several datasets, with **significant reductions in GPU memory usage and FLOPs**.  This makes PointMamba a promising alternative to current methods.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science & Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "Kc37srXvan/podcast.wav"}
