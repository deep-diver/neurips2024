Existing fine-tuning methods often overlook the fundamental transfer characteristics of these models, leading to suboptimal performance.  The challenge lies in effectively transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a specific downstream task without causing catastrophic forgetting or overfitting.\n\nThis paper proposes Diff-Tuning, a novel method that addresses these limitations.  Diff-Tuning leverages the observed 'chain of forgetting'\u2014a trend where the transferability of a pre-trained model decreases monotonically along the reverse denoising process. By integrating two objectives\u2014knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation\u2014Diff-Tuning strategically balances the retention of general knowledge and the adaptation of task-specific information, resulting in significant performance improvements over standard fine-tuning in both conditional and controllable generation tasks.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "S98OzJD3jn/podcast.wav"}
