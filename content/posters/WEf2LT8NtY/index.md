### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Decision Transformer struggle in adversarial settings where an opponent actively works against the agent.  This is because the training data may not represent the worst-case scenarios the agent might encounter at test time.  Standard methods, conditioned on the highest return, may choose actions that perform poorly against a strategic adversary.

The paper proposes Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT). ARDT enhances robustness by training the model to anticipate and counteract the worst-case outcomes. The model is conditioned on the minimax return, learning strategies that perform well even when facing powerful, adaptive adversaries. ARDT shows significant improvements on benchmark tasks, demonstrating superior robustness and higher worst-case returns compared to existing methods.

> This figure demonstrates a simple sequential game to illustrate the robustness of the proposed Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT) against an adversary. The left-hand side (LHS) shows the game tree, where the decision-maker (P) chooses an action, followed by the adversary (A), resulting in a final reward. The right-hand side (RHS) presents the action probabilities and worst-case returns obtained by three different algorithms (DT, ERC-DT, and ARDT) when trained on uniformly collected data with full trajectory coverage. The results highlight ARDT's superior ability to select the robust action (a1) that maximizes the worst-case return, unlike DT and ERC-DT.

> This table presents the average returns achieved by three different algorithms (ARDT, DT, and ESPER) when trained on datasets containing a mix of near-random and near-optimal trajectories. The performance is evaluated against adversaries with varying levels of optimality (30%, 50%, 70%, and 100%). The results show how the different algorithms perform under different adversary strengths and highlight the improved robustness of ARDT.





### In-depth insights


#### Adversarial RvS
Adversarial RvS (Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning) tackles the challenge of training robust RL agents in adversarial environments. **Standard RvS methods often fail in such scenarios because they overfit to the training data, which may not reflect the behavior of a powerful adversary at test time.**  Adversarial RvS addresses this by explicitly considering the worst-case scenarios during training, learning policies that are robust against various adversarial strategies. This often involves techniques like minimax optimization or adversarial training to enhance the agent's resilience and maximize its worst-case performance.  A key benefit of Adversarial RvS is its ability to **improve the generalization of RL agents to unseen or adversarial environments**, leading to more reliable and trustworthy decision-making in real-world applications.

#### Minimax Returns
The concept of "Minimax Returns" in adversarial reinforcement learning focuses on finding the optimal strategy for a decision-maker in a worst-case scenario. It involves calculating the **minimum expected return** that can be achieved, considering the adversary's optimal counter-strategy. This approach is crucial for creating robust policies that perform well even when facing powerful adversaries.  **Minimax Returns directly address distributional shift** problems encountered during offline learning. By optimizing for the worst-case scenario, the policy becomes more robust to unexpected changes in the adversary's behavior during deployment.  The core idea is to **relabel trajectories** using the estimated in-sample minimax returns-to-go, enabling the decision transformer to learn policies conditioned on these more robust estimates, instead of possibly overly optimistic returns.  This technique results in **significantly improved worst-case performance** over existing methods, demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial actions, which is particularly beneficial in challenging and uncertain environments.

#### ARDT Algorithm
The Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT) algorithm presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of Decision Transformers (DTs) in adversarial environments.  **ARDT's core innovation lies in its use of minimax expectile regression to relabel trajectories with worst-case returns-to-go.** This crucial step effectively conditions the policy on the most challenging scenarios, thereby improving its resilience against powerful, test-time adversaries.  Unlike standard DTs that learn from potentially misleading trajectories‚Äîwhere high returns might be achieved due to suboptimal adversary behavior‚ÄîARDT directly targets a maximin equilibrium strategy.  **This approach is particularly effective in offline RL settings where the distribution of adversary policies during training may differ significantly from test-time.** By aligning the target return with the worst-case return, ARDT effectively mitigates distributional shifts, thereby achieving superior performance in games with full data coverage and continuous adversarial RL environments with partial data coverage. **The algorithm's use of expectile regression is particularly advantageous for its avoidance of out-of-sample estimation and its capacity to approximate minimax values efficiently**, improving both the accuracy and training efficiency of the model.  Overall, ARDT offers a significant improvement in robustness compared to conventional DT methods, demonstrating its value for a wide array of applications where adversarial robustness is paramount.

#### Robustness Tests
A robust model should perform well under various conditions and not be overly sensitive to small changes.  In a research paper, a section on 'Robustness Tests' would be crucial for evaluating the model's ability to withstand various challenges.  **The tests should cover several aspects:**  First, it should assess the model's performance when presented with noisy or incomplete data, simulating real-world scenarios where perfect information is unavailable. Next, the test should investigate the impact of distributional shifts, where the characteristics of the data encountered during deployment differ from those seen during training.  **Adversarial attacks**, designed to intentionally mislead the model, are also important to simulate malicious inputs. The results of these tests should be carefully analyzed, potentially using statistical measures, to quantitatively assess the model's robustness.  Ultimately, a comprehensive 'Robustness Tests' section allows for a well-rounded evaluation of the model's reliability and practical applicability, ensuring that its performance is not merely an artifact of favorable training conditions.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **extending ARDT to handle stochastic environments**, a significant limitation of the current approach.  Investigating the impact of **different minimax estimators** beyond expectile regression is also warranted.  **Addressing partial observability** in adversarial settings would significantly broaden the applicability of ARDT.  Finally, exploring the effectiveness of ARDT in **multi-agent scenarios beyond zero-sum games** and its scalability to **high-dimensional continuous control problems** would be valuable future endeavors.  These extensions would enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed method in more complex and realistic scenarios.

> This figure illustrates the two-step training process of the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT).  The left side shows the minimax expectile regression used to estimate the worst-case returns-to-go. This involves iteratively updating two networks: one to estimate the minimum return given the adversary's actions, and the other to estimate the maximum return given the protagonist's actions. The result is Q*, which represents the minimax returns-to-go. The right side shows the standard Decision Transformer (DT) training but now using Q* as the target return instead of the actual observed returns. This conditioning on worst-case returns makes the policy robust against adversarial actions.

> This figure compares the worst-case return achieved by three different algorithms (ARDT, DT, and ESPER) across three different game scenarios (Single-stage Game, Gambling, and Multi-stage Game) under varying target returns.  The shaded regions represent the standard deviation across 10 different runs. The plot illustrates how the worst-case performance of each algorithm changes as the target return is adjusted.  The results demonstrate ARDT's superior robustness to test-time adversaries compared to DT and ESPER, particularly when the target return is high.  In the single-stage game, ARDT consistently achieves the Nash Equilibrium, while DT and ESPER exhibit suboptimal worst-case performance. The Gambling and Multi-stage game results also show ARDT's consistently better performance.

> This figure displays box plots comparing the average returns achieved by Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT) and vanilla Decision Transformer (DT) in the Connect Four game under various conditions.  The training data used for both ARDT and DT was suboptimal in the sense that the data was generated by agents that were only partially optimal (30%, 40%, 50%). The testing was done against an adversary that acted optimally only 50% of the time, with the remaining actions chosen randomly. The figure shows three sets of box plots, each corresponding to a different level of optimality for the protagonist (30%, 40%, 50%), and within each set there are three box plots, one for each level of adversary optimality (10%, 30%, 50%).  The results show that ARDT consistently outperforms DT.

> This figure displays the results of an ablation study on the impact of the expectile level (Œ±) in the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT) algorithm.  Three different game environments were tested: a single-stage game, a multi-stage game, and Connect Four. Each game was tested against a worst-case adversary. The results are presented as line graphs showing average return against target return for different values of Œ± and boxplots showing the average return against the expectile level in the Connect Four game.  The study reveals that a smaller Œ± leads to better robustness in most scenarios, but in Connect Four, a too small alpha results in the algorithm acting too conservatively.  Overall, the figure illustrates the importance of tuning the expectile level (Œ±) to balance robustness and performance.
