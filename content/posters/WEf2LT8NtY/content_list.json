Training a probabilistic model conditioned on observed return to predict action can fail to generalize, as the trajectories that achieve a return in the dataset might have done so due to a suboptimal behavior adversary. To address this, we propose a worst-case-aware RvS algorithm, the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT), which learns and conditions the policy on in-sample minimax returns-to-go. ARDT aligns the target return with the worst-case return learned through minimax expectile regression, thereby enhancing robustness against powerful test-time adversaries. In experiments conducted on sequential games with full data coverage, ARDT can generate a maximin (Nash Equilibrium) strategy, the solution with the largest adversarial robustness. In large-scale sequential games and continuous adversarial RL environments with partial data coverage, ARDT demonstrates significantly superior robustness to powerful test-time adversaries and attains higher worst-case returns compared to contemporary DT methods.

Consequently, there is a need for data curation to indicate the potential worstcase returns associated with each action in the Decision Transformer (DT), improving the robustness against adversarial actions. Building on this concept, we introduce the first robust training algorithm for Decision Transformer, the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT). To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first exploration of the robustness of RvS methods from an adversarial perspective. In ARDT, we leverage Expectile Regression [29, 1] to transform the original returns-to-go to in-sample minimax returns-to-go, and train DT with the relabeled returns. In the experiments, we illustrate the robustness of ARDT in three settings (i) Games with full data coverage (ii) A long-horizon discrete game with partial data coverage (iii) Realistic continuous adversarial RL problems. We provide evidence showcasing the robustness of ARDT to more powerful adversary compared to the behavior policy and the distributional shifts of the adversary\u2019s policy in the test time.

Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning is a promising direction for solving general offline RL problems by converting the RL problem into the outcome-conditioned prediction problem [17, 37, 10, 31, 8]. Decision Transformer (DT) is one of the RvS instance [2, 15], leveraging the strength of the sequence model Transformer [45]. The variants of DT have been extensively investigated to address the trajectory stitching [50, 53], stochasticity [31, 30, 32, 54], goal-conditioned problems [9], and generalization in different environments [26, 51, 21, 52]. For different problems, it is critical to select an appropriate target as the condition of the policy. $Q$ -Learning DT [53] relabels the trajectories with the estimated $Q$ -values learned to achieve trajectory stitching [18]. ESPER [32], aims at solving the environmental stochasticity via relabeling the trajectories with expected returns-to-go. Although our method also transform the returns-to-go to estimated values, we instead associate worst-case returns-to-go with trajectories, aiming at improving its robustness against adversarial perturbations.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
