This is because the training data may not represent the worst-case scenarios the agent might encounter at test time.  Standard methods, conditioned on the highest return, may choose actions that perform poorly against a strategic adversary.\nThe paper proposes Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT). ARDT enhances robustness by training the model to anticipate and counteract the worst-case outcomes. The model is conditioned on the minimax return, learning strategies that perform well even when facing powerful, adaptive adversaries. ARDT shows significant improvements on benchmark tasks, demonstrating superior robustness and higher worst-case returns compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "University College London", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "WEf2LT8NtY/podcast.wav"}
