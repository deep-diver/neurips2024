Existing pruning methods rely on pre-set parameters or thresholds, which require multiple training rounds to optimize for each scene and may vary across different scenes. This is inefficient and suboptimal. \nThis work introduces LP-3DGS, a novel learning-to-prune approach. LP-3DGS uses a trainable binary mask applied to the importance score of each Gaussian to automatically determine a favorable pruning ratio. Unlike previous methods, LP-3DGS leverages the Gumbel-Sigmoid method for a differentiable masking function. This makes LP-3DGS compatible with the existing 3DGS training process, resulting in a single round of training and an optimized pruning ratio that maximizes efficiency and quality. Extensive experiments show LP-3DGS consistently outperforms existing methods in various datasets.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "kzJ9P7VPnS/podcast.wav"}
