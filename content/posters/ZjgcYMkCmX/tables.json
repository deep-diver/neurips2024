The problems share similarities, particularly in the use of exploration to learn about an unknown environment before solving a specific task, but differ in the type of task and the information provided.", "section": "Four Problems"}, {"figure_path": "ZjgcYMkCmX/tables/tables_37_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of the problems.", "description": "This table summarizes four reinforcement learning problems: Best Policy Identification (BPI), Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), Matching Performance (MP), and Imitation Learning from Observation (ILO).
