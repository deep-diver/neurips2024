Existing methods struggle to efficiently estimate the feasible reward set, which encompasses all rewards explaining observed expert behavior. This is problematic because the size of the feasible set grows exponentially with state space dimensions. This paper addresses these issues. \nThe solution proposed is CATY-IRL, a novel algorithm based on the concept of 'rewards compatibility'.  **CATY-IRL efficiently classifies rewards according to their compatibility with expert demonstrations, sidestepping the need to explicitly compute the computationally expensive feasible set.** Its complexity is independent of the state space size in linear MDPs.  For tabular settings, the algorithm's efficiency is proven to be minimax optimal, improving existing bounds on the related problem of reward-free exploration.", "affiliation": "Politecnico di Milano", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZjgcYMkCmX/podcast.wav"}
