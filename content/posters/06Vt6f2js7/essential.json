Additionally, finetuning pretrained models to generate new types of visual content is often expensive and can lead to overfitting. This paper tackles these issues by focusing on diffusion models, a powerful class of generative models that have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, directly applying diffusion models to diverse visual content types is challenging due to the lack of suitable training datasets for each type. \nThe paper introduces SyncTweedies, a general framework for synchronizing multiple diffusion processes.  It achieves synchronization without finetuning by cleverly averaging outputs in a canonical space, preserving the richness of pretrained models while maintaining high performance. The authors demonstrate SyncTweedies' efficacy across a variety of applications, such as generating ambiguous images, panoramic images, and 3D textures, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in each scenario. This innovative approach significantly expands the capabilities of pretrained diffusion models and opens doors for future research in zero-shot, high-quality visual content generation.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "06Vt6f2js7/podcast.wav"}
