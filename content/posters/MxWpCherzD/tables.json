It compares performance at high and low angular resolutions, showing metrics such as PR AUC, F1 score, angular error, FNR, and FPR.  Confidence intervals are included where applicable. The models were trained on one volume, validated on another, and tested on a third. ", "section": "4.2.1 Super-resolved fODF estimation: synthetic DiSCo and real human HCP datasets"}]
