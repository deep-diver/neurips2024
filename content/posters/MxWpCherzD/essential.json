Current deep learning approaches often rely on full-sphere computations and are hampered by high computational demands, especially when dealing with higher angular resolutions.  Furthermore, many methods depend on supervised training and/or large ground-truth datasets, limiting their applicability and generalizability.\nThis paper introduces a novel spatio-hemispherical deconvolution (SHD) method that leverages the antipodal symmetry of neuronal fibers to significantly reduce computational costs.  The proposed SHD method uses hemispherical sampling, efficient graph convolutions, and pre-computed Chebyshev polynomials.  This approach achieves state-of-the-art results in deconvolution accuracy while offering substantial performance gains over existing methods.  It also demonstrates improved robustness to low-angular resolution scans commonly encountered in clinical settings, showcasing its potential for practical applications.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "MxWpCherzD/podcast.wav"}
