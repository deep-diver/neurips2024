Existing methods struggle to safely optimize these unknown time-varying systems, often relying on ad-hoc techniques or lacking theoretical guarantees.  This creates a need for algorithms capable of safely tracking changing safe regions, maintaining safety while optimizing performance. \nTVSAFEOPT directly addresses this. This algorithm uses a Bayesian optimization approach with a spatio-temporal kernel, enabling it to effectively model the time-varying nature of the problem.  **It achieves this without needing explicit change detection, providing formal safety guarantees.** Furthermore, **it provides optimality guarantees for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary**, showcased through experiments on synthetic data and real-world case studies.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "yKvHJJE9le/podcast.wav"}
