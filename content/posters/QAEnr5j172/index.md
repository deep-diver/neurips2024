### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Creating lifelike digital clothing remains challenging due to limitations in 3D modeling and rendering.  Current methods struggle with generating realistic textures and often lack controllability. This leads to a significant gap between rendered images and real-world photos, hindering the use of digital assets in e-commerce. 

FashionR2R tackles this issue by introducing a novel framework using diffusion models. This method involves two key stages: 1) injecting domain knowledge into a pre-trained model; 2) generating realistic images using a texture-preserving attention mechanism. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments using both existing and a newly created (SynFashion) dataset, showcasing significant improvements in realism and texture preservation compared to existing techniques. **The paper thus offers a promising approach to bridge the gap between digital and real-world fashion imagery.**

> This figure illustrates the two-stage framework for rendered-to-real fashion image translation. Stage 1, Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), involves fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model on real fashion photos and then using a negative domain embedding to guide the model away from the characteristics of rendered images. Stage 2, Realistic Image Generation (RIG), employs DDIM inversion to convert the rendered image into latent space, and uses the negative domain embedding and a texture-preserving attention control mechanism to generate a realistic counterpart while maintaining fine-grained clothing textures.

> This table presents a quantitative comparison of different image-to-image translation methods on two datasets: Face Synthetics and SynFashion.  The metrics used for comparison are: KID (Kernel Inception Distance), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). Lower KID values indicate better realism, lower LPIPS values indicate higher perceptual similarity to the ground truth, and higher SSIM values indicate better structural similarity. The table allows for a comparison of the performance of various methods in terms of realism, image quality, and texture preservation.





### In-depth insights


#### Diffusion Model Power
Diffusion models demonstrate **remarkable generative power** in image synthesis, enabling the creation of high-quality, realistic images.  Their strength lies in the ability to iteratively refine noisy data, gradually recovering intricate details and textures.  This process is particularly effective for tasks like rendered-to-real image translation where the goal is to enhance the photorealism of synthetically generated images. **Controllability remains a challenge**, though techniques like classifier-free guidance and textual inversion offer improved control over the generation process.  By leveraging pretrained models and incorporating domain-specific knowledge, **photorealism can be significantly improved**, while preserving fine-grained details like clothing textures. This approach leverages the strengths of diffusion models while mitigating their limitations, paving the way for realistic image generation in various applications.

#### DKI & RIG Stages
The paper introduces a novel framework for rendered-to-real image translation using diffusion models, which consists of two key stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG).  **DKI focuses on adapting a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to the specific domain of fashion images**. This is achieved through fine-tuning on real fashion photos and embedding negative (rendered) examples to guide the model away from the artifacts of rendered images, effectively bridging the gap between the source and target domains.  **The RIG stage leverages the refined diffusion model to generate realistic images from rendered inputs**, utilizing a texture-preserving mechanism to maintain fine-grained details crucial for fashion imagery.  The incorporation of both positive (real) and negative (rendered) domain knowledge during DKI is a key innovation, enhancing the model's ability to synthesize highly realistic images. The thoughtful design of RIG ensures that the process is not only realistic but also preserves the key characteristics that define the fashion images.

#### TAC Texture Control
The paper introduces a novel texture-preserving attention control mechanism, termed TAC, to enhance the realism of generated images while maintaining fine-grained details.  **TAC leverages the attention maps within the UNet architecture of a diffusion model**. By selectively injecting query and key from the rendered image inversion and generation pipeline into the rendered-to-real generation process, **TAC successfully preserves intricate clothing textures**.  This method is particularly effective in handling fine-grained details that are often lost in other image-to-image translation approaches. The use of attention maps, specifically in the shallow UNet layers, proves crucial in decoupling texture information from broader semantic features.  This careful control is key to preventing the loss of texture details which frequently occurs in other image translation methods.  **The effectiveness of TAC is empirically demonstrated through comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods**, highlighting its superiority in preserving high-quality textures during the image translation process.

#### SynFashion Dataset
The creation of the SynFashion dataset represents a significant contribution to the field of fashion image research.  **Its high-quality images, featuring diverse textures and garment categories, address a crucial gap in existing resources.**  The use of professional design software (Style3D Studio) ensures a level of realism and detail not readily available in publicly accessible datasets. This commitment to quality is vital as it directly impacts the reliability and generalizability of research findings.  **The dataset's detailed annotations and metadata provide researchers with structured information**, facilitating precise analysis and training of models.  While the current size might be considered modest, its carefully curated nature makes it a valuable tool, especially for fine-grained analysis of clothing textures and styles.  The **public availability of this dataset, once released**, will foster collaboration and accelerate progress in computer vision applications, particularly those focused on fashion and virtual try-on technologies.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the efficiency of the current model** is crucial, potentially through exploring more efficient diffusion model architectures or optimizing the inversion process.  **Expanding the dataset** to include a wider variety of clothing styles, poses, and lighting conditions would significantly enhance the model's generalizability.  Furthermore, investigating the potential for **incorporating additional modalities**, such as 3D garment information, into the process could lead to even more realistic image translations.  A key area of investigation could be the development of **techniques for fine-grained control** over the generated images, allowing users to selectively adjust specific aspects of clothing textures and appearances.  Finally, exploring applications beyond fashion, such as creating realistic renderings in other domains like movie production or virtual try-on tools, offers exciting potential.

> This figure illustrates the Texture-preserving Attention Control (TAC) mechanism.  It shows how queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) from both the rendered image (cg) and the generated image (r) are used in the self-attention process. Specifically, the self-attention features from the rendered image are injected into the shallow layers of the UNet, decoupling texture details from general characteristics to preserve fine-grained textures during image generation. The process involves projection, softmax calculation, and the use of queries and keys from both the rendered and real domains to guide attention.

> The figure illustrates the overall pipeline of the proposed method for rendered-to-real fashion image translation. It consists of two main stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG). In the DKI stage, a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is fine-tuned on real fashion photos and then uses negative domain embedding to inject knowledge. The RIG stage uses a texture-preserving attention control mechanism to generate realistic images from rendered images.  The pipeline shows the flow of data from rendered images through the two stages, to the final realistic output.
