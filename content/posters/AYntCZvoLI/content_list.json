Most present learned techniques are VAE-based with an autoregressive entropy model, which obviously promotes the RD performance by utilizing the decoded causal context. However, extant methods are highly dependent on the fixed hand-crafted causal context. The question of how to guide the auto-encoder to generate a more effective causal context benefit for the autoregressive entropy models is worth exploring. In this paper, we make the first attempt in investigating the way to explicitly adjust the causal context with our proposed Causal Context Adjustment loss (CCA-loss). By imposing the CCA-loss, we enable the neural network to spontaneously adjust important information into the early stage of the autoregressive entropy model. Furthermore, as transformer technology develops remarkably, variants of which have been adopted by many state-of-the-art (SOTA) LIC techniques. The existing computing devices have not adapted the calculation of the attention mechanism well, which leads to a burden on computation quantity and inference latency. To overcome it, we establish a convolutional neural network (CNN) image compression model and adopt the unevenly channel-wise grouped strategy for high efficiency.

Since then, numerous entropy models have been investigated. One category of studies investigates advanced network architectures for accurately predicting the distribution of latent representations. Meanwhile, another line of research study a more fundamental perspective of the entropy model, i.e. conditional distribution modeling, to pursue a better rate-distortion trade-off.

Our CCA-loss makes the first attempt on explicitly imposing loss to adjust the causal context, making the latter representation more accurately predicted by the previously decoded representations. To be more specific, considering a two stage autoregresive context model with hyperprior $_{\\textit{z}}$ , denote the latent representation to be decoded in the first and second stage as $\\pmb{y}_{1}$ and $\\pmb{y}_{2}$ ; in addition to minimizing the cross entropy loss for reducing bitstream, we introduce an auxiliary entropy model and a tailored context causal adjustment loss, which let $\\pmb{y}_{2}$ can be accurately estimated by $\\pmb{y}_{1}$ and $_{\\textit{z}}$ , while, at the same time, let $\\pmb{y}_{2}$ can not be accurately estimated by merely $_{\\textit{z}}$ . In this vein, our CCA-loss explicitly guides the encoder to adjust important information into the early stage of the autoregressive entropy model, providing the LIC framework a more rational causal context sequence for entropy coding.

In this paper, we propose the causal context adjustment loss (CCA-loss), which compels the analysis transform to generate a more potent causal context, that is, the enhanced estimation gain of early-stage context towards the latter latent representation. Theoretically, our proposed CCA-loss is architecture-agnostic and can be utilized to train various encoders to adjust the causal context according to the given conditional modeling architecture. However, compared to the checkerboard context model that leverages adjacent spatial information as context, it is easier for our convolutional encoder to adjust information across feature channels. We therefore adopt a channel-wise grouped autoregressive architecture to design our entropy model. Furthermore, since our CCA-loss could explicitly adjust the significant information into the earlier channels, we explore an unevenly grouped strategy to take full advantage of the first several informative channels. On account of the accumulated contexts $[\\hat{y}_{1},\\hat{y}_{2},\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\;,\\hat{y_{i-1}}]$ as input to the autoregressive entropy model to predict $\\hat{\\pmb y}_{i}$ , the unevenly grouped strategy also brings us advantages in the number of parameters and run time. Following our auto-encoder structure, we also utilize NAF-blocks [8] for a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed. For detailed network architectures of our entropy model as well as auxiliary entropy model, please refer to our Supplementary Materials. The comprehensive analysis of the beneftis of the evenly and unevenly grouped strategies brought by our CCA-loss will be presented in the ablation study section.

The stacking NAF-blocks can enhance the concatenated features input to the entropy model, in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of the latent representation. The dimension of the latent representation in NAF-block is set as 224. Please note that we do not conduct the special training strategy like [8] for the simple channel attention (SCA) in the NAF-block, on account of no performance loss caused by this. Following the previous work [36], we append the latent residual prediction (LRP) to restore the error introduced by the quantization operation.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
