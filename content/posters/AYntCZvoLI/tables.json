It compares the performance of different autoregressive models with and without the proposed Causal Context Adjustment (CCA) loss.  The models are categorized by whether they use an even or uneven channel-wise grouping strategy. The inference time (in milliseconds) and BD-rate (relative to BPG) are reported for each model, showing the effectiveness of CCA loss in improving compression performance.
