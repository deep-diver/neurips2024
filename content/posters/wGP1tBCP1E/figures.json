We derive the Lipschitz constant and the corresponding certified radius for diffusion classifiers [3]. Additionally, we introduce two novel evidence lower bounds, which are used to approximate the log likelihood. These lower bounds are then employed to construct classifiers based on Bayes' theorem. By applying randomized smoothing to these classifiers, we derive their certified robust radii.", "description": "This figure illustrates the paper's main contributions: deriving the Lipschitz constant and certified robustness for diffusion classifiers, introducing novel evidence lower bounds to approximate log-likelihood, constructing classifiers using Bayes' theorem, and applying randomized smoothing to derive tighter certified robust radii.

Subfigure (a) shows the effect of the number of timesteps (T') on the accuracy of diffusion classifiers, comparing the method proposed in the paper with a baseline method. Subfigures (b) and (c) present the certified robustness (certified accuracy as a function of radius) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, respectively.  The authors' method (APNDC) is compared against other state-of-the-art techniques.", "section": "4 Experiment"}]
