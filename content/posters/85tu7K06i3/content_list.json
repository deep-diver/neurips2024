Further advancements include HyperIQA [74] that leverages self-adaptive hyper networks to blindly assess image quality in the wild, while LIQE [88] and QAlign [84] utilize large language models to capture high-level semantic similarity and alignment between the restored and original images.

The Bayesian paradigm defines uncertainty by assuming a distribution over the model parameters and/or activation functions [1].

To improve efficiency, approximation methods have been developed, including Monte Carlo dropout [24, 25], stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo [67, 18], Laplacian approximations [63] and variational inference [16, 51, 60]. Alternative Bayesian techniques encompass deep Gaussian processes [20], deep ensembles [7, 33], and deep Bayesian active learning [26]. In contrast to Bayesian methods, frequentist approaches operate assume fixed model parameters with no underlying distribution.

Our theoretical framework is grounded in empirical observations, leading us to validate our findings through experiments on common benchmark tasks: image super-resolution and inpainting.

Distortion is evaluated using traditional measures: MSE, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM) [82]. Accurately estimating entropy in high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges [46]; hence, we utilize an upper bound for uncertainty, $N(\\hat{X}_{G}-X_{G}\\vert Y)$ , as detailed in Appendix F.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
