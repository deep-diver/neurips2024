The x-axis represents the perceptual quality of the restored image, while the y-axis represents the uncertainty associated with the restoration.

The curve starts at the inherent uncertainty (Uinherent) of the restoration problem and gradually increases to twice this value as the perceptual quality approaches perfection. The shaded red region indicates an impossible region where it's impossible to achieve both high perceptual quality and low uncertainty simultaneously. The green region shows the possible region of attainable uncertainty and perceptual quality.

The algorithms are ordered from left to right, with each subsequent algorithm producing higher perceptual quality.  However, as the perceptual quality improves, so does the level of uncertainty (hallucinations) and distortion in the generated images.  The reference image is on the far left, followed by the measurements(input) and then results from three different algorithms. This illustrates the tradeoff between achieving high perceptual quality and the risk of generating unrealistic details (hallucinations) that were not present in the original image.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "85tu7K06i3/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The uncertainty-perception plane (Theorem 3).
