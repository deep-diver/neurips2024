The success rate is determined by whether the model can maintain its height within 3% of the initial maximum height after simulation for a sufficiently long time. The table compares the success rates with and without the stability loss applied during training.  The results show a significant decrease in success rate when the stability loss is not used, indicating the importance of the stability loss in ensuring robustness under perturbation.", "section": "5.1 Simulation Verification"}, {"figure_path": "5x69CL2w3F/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative Evaluation", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed Atlas3D method and the Magic3D baseline using three metrics: TRD (Time-Averaged Rotation Deviation Loss), CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), and Elo (GPT-40). Lower TRD values indicate better stability, while higher CLIP and Elo scores suggest better alignment with text prompts and higher overall quality.
