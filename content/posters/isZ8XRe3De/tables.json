It shows the performance of various models (traditional methods like GRU4Rec, Caser, SASRec, and LLM-based methods like Llama2, ChatRec, MoRec, TALLRec, and LLaRA) across three datasets (LastFM, MovieLens, and Steam) using two metrics: ValidRatio and HitRatio@1.  The improvement percentage (Imp.%) of iLoRA over the baselines is also reported. This comparison highlights the effectiveness of iLoRA in improving recommendation accuracy compared to existing approaches.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
