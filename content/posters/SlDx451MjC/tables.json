The metrics used to evaluate the methods are L2, LPIPS, ID (Identity), and FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance).  The L2, LPIPS, and ID scores measure the fidelity of the reconstruction to the input image, while the FID score measures the quality and realism of the generated images from novel viewpoints.  The table shows results on three datasets: FFHQ + LPFF, CelebAHQ and includes the time (in seconds) taken for each method.  The results highlight the proposed method's superior performance in terms of both reconstruction fidelity and novel-view generation quality.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "SlDx451MjC/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative scores on multi-view MEAD dataset.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for 3D head reconstruction on the MEAD dataset, focusing on multi-view performance.
