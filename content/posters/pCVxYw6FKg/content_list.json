Bayesian deep learning is a promising approach to improve several deficits of mainstream deep learning methods, such as uncertainty quantification and integration of priors [30, 51]. However, parameter symmetries are problematic in Bayesian neural networks, as they are a major source of statistical nonidentifiability [30]. Parameter symmetries introduce modes in the posterior $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$ that make the posterior harder to approximate [2, 34, 72], sample from [50, 71], and otherwise analyze [36]. For instance, one common technique for training Bayesian neural networks is variational inference via ftiting a Gaussian distribution to the true posterior $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$ . This approach suffers because the Gaussian distribution has only one mode, whereas the true posterior has at least one mode for every parameter symmetry. As such, some approaches treat kernel matrices are random variables, which has less symmetries than treating features or weights as random variables, and allows better approximation by unimodal posteriors [74, 43]. Instead, we consider traditional, commonly-used Bayesian deep learning techniques applied on the features or weights of our Asymmetric networks.

One common method of studying the loss landscapes of neural networks is by studying the one-dimensional line segment of parameters attained by linear interpolation between parameters at initialization and parameters after training. Many works have observed monotonic linear interpolation (MLI), which is when the training loss monotonically decreases along this line segment [21, 17, 41, 68]. Loss landscapes of convex problems have this property as well, so presence of the monotonic linear interpolation property has been used as a rough measure of how well-behaved the loss landscape is. However, with many types of models, tasks, or hyperparameter settings, monotonic linear interpolation does not hold [41, 68], or there is a large plateau where the loss barely changes for much of the line segment [17, 70]; neither of these properties can happen for convex objectives trained to completion. To the best of our knowledge, there has been little work on the role of parameter symmetries \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 in monotonic linear interpolation (besides one minor experiment in [41] Appendix C.9). Nonetheless, since removing parameter symmetries substantially improves linear interpolation between trained networks (Section 5.1), one may expect removing parameter symmetries to improve monotonic linear interpolation.

Likewise, in our datasets of 10,000 standard and W-Asymmetric ResNets, the average distance per parameter between the weights of trained standard classifiers is .0034, which is actually lower than the distance per parameter of .0051 for W-Asymmetric ResNets (estimated on 20,000 pairs of networks).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
