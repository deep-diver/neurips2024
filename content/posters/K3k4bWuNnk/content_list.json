Many attempts have been made to make Transformers more efficient (see Tay et al. (2020) for a survey on efficient transformers for sequence modeling). One major line of work involves sparsifying the attention mechanism, constraining attention from all $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ pairs to some smaller set of connections. For instance, for sequential data, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) constructs a sparse attention mechanism by combining sliding windows, Erdo\u02dds-R\u00e9nyi auxiliary graphs, and universal connectors. On the other hand, for graph data, Exphormer (Shirzad et al., 2023) constructs a sparse interaction graph consisting of edges from the input graph, an overlay expander graph, and universal connections.

Heterophily may not necessarily mean long-range dependencies, label of each node may just depend on the neighbor nodes, but still label of the neighbor nodes may be different most of the time. For example, for finding the grammatical function of the words in a sentence from a very long text, neighboring words are usually enough for this identification, and nearby words would be from different classes. On the other hand, some tasks may require long-range dependencies \u2014 identifying if there are other people in a social network with similar interests or the synthetic task introduced in 1 are some examples. Local models such as MPNNs would require deeper networks for modeling long-range dependencies that makes them prone to common problems such as oversquashing and oversmoothing (Topping et al., 2021; Di Giovanni et al., 2023b,a; Rusch et al., 2023). Our approach can be reduced to MPNN by giving lower attention scores to the expander edges, for learning on the tasks with short-range dependencies only.

This approach has shown promising results in many works such as (Zeng et al., 2020; Hamilton et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021). However, there are many cases in which these approaches are not expressive enough. Clustering the nodes or batching and subsampling based on the neighborhood will not have the required inductive biases to solve the tasks with long-range dependencies. Approaches such as neighbor sampling or connected-subgraph sampling not only inherit the limits of the MPNN networks, but may even miss short-range dependencies.

Random subset of node selection that has been used in several promising papers such as Wu et al. (2022, 2023, 2024) gives a chance for nodes from the same label to appear in the same batch, but the batch-size should increase with the graph size accordingly. Very small ratio of batch size to graph size would mean many edges or possible pair of nodes will never be appear in any batch and depending on the task this can limit the power of these models. Also, these models are usually not memory efficient, as graph size grows, they can not keep the batches small, and the required memory grows accordingly. On the other hand, our approach (1) makes smarter selection of neighbors based on the small network\u2019s attention scores; (2) our sampling allows making k-hop neighborhood subgraphs from the extended graph connectivity, and (3) allows the training by trading off memory and time, without critical harm to the model\u2019s expressive power.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
