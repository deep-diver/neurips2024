The comparison results shown in Table 4 reveal that increasing the number of training epochs does not always lead to performance enhancements; instead, it may cause a performance decline due to overfitting. In contrast, mixing skip-step data from the iterative process not only maintains or improves performance in in-domain and OOD-easy tasks but also achieves consistent gains in OODhard setting.

Addressing the absence of intrinsic motivation for step skipping in models, we design an approach that not only enables models to spontaneously develop the ability but also iteratively encourages models to actively adopt and enhance this behavior. Through experiments on three tasks, we demonstrate that models equipped with step-skipping capabilities can solve tasks more efficiently in fewer steps, without sacrificing accuracy. Further empirical results suggest that training on easy data containing both full steps and skipped reasoning steps can potentially help models generalize to harder scenarios. We hope this work offers insights into the relationship and transition between System 1 and System 2 thinking and contributes to advancing easy-to-hard generalization in language model reasoning.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
