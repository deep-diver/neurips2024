Robust regression, where errors can have heavy tails, poses additional challenges in accurately tracking this performance. Existing methods often focus solely on the final iterate and are not suitable for high-dimensional settings. This leaves a gap in evaluating iterates' generalization performance throughout the optimization process.\nThis work introduces novel, consistent estimators to precisely track the generalization error along the trajectory of Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and proximal variants.  These estimators are rigorously proven to be consistent under suitable conditions and are shown to work across a range of loss functions and penalty terms commonly used in robust regression.  Extensive simulations show effectiveness of the proposed estimates, confirming their practical utility in identifying the optimal stopping iteration.", "affiliation": "Rutgers University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ntF7D8tAlQ/podcast.wav"}
