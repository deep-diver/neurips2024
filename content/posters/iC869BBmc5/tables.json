The metrics used are User Study of Overall Quality (USO), User Study of 3D Consistency (US3D), GPT Evaluation Score (GPT), CLIP score (CTIDS and CDC), and Running Time.  ProEdit demonstrates significant improvements in USO, US3D, and GPT scores compared to the baselines, with a substantially shorter running time than ConsistDreamer while maintaining comparable performance on CLIP metrics.", "section": "4.2 Experimental Results and Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "iC869BBmc5/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study of our \u201cno subtask decomposition (ND)\u201d variant shows that our full ProEdit significantly outperforms the \u201cND\u201d variant across all metrics, validating that progression is crucial to achieving high-quality editing results.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study comparing the full ProEdit model with a variant that does not utilize subtask decomposition.  The comparison shows that the full model significantly outperforms the no-decomposition variant across all metrics (USO, US3D, USP, GPT, CTIDS, CDC).  This demonstrates the crucial role of the progressive subtask approach in achieving high-quality scene editing.", "section": "4.2 Experimental Results and Analysis"}]
