In this paper, our goal is to control how frequently a decision support system based on prediction sets may cause harm, by design. To this end, we start by characterizing the above notion of harm using the theoretical framework of structural causal models. Then, we show that, under a natural, albeit unverifiable, monotonicity assumption, we can estimate how frequently a system may cause harm using only predictions made by humans on their own. Further, we also show that, under a weaker monotonicity assumption, which can be verified experimentally, we can bound how frequently a system may cause harm again using only predictions made by humans on their own. Building upon these assumptions, we introduce a computational framework to design decision support systems based on prediction sets that are guaranteed to cause harm less frequently than a userspecified value using conformal risk control.

As a result, in all of these domains, rules and guidelines have been established to prevent decision makers\u2014doctors or judges\u2014from making decisions that harm individuals\u2014patients or suspects.

Here, the most studied setting assumes the decision support system uses a classifier to predict the value of a (ground-truth) label of interest and a human expert uses the predicted value to update their own prediction [8\u201312]. Unfortunately, in this setting, it is yet unclear how to guarantee that the (average) accuracy of the predictions made by an expert who uses the system is higher than the accuracy of the predictions made by the expert and the classifier on their own, what is often referred to as human-AI complementarity [13\u201316]. In this context, a recent line of work [17, 18] have argued, both theoretically and empirically, that an alternative setting may enable human-AI complementarity. In this alternative setting, the decision support system helps a human expert by providing a set of label predictions, namely a prediction set, and asking them to always predict a label value from the set. The key principle is that, by restricting human agency, good performance does not depend on the expert developing a good sense of when to predict a label from the prediction set. In this context, it is also worth noting that Google has recently developed a tool that uses patient history and skin condition images to provide decision support using prediction sets [19], and a study by Jain et al.

We start by formally characterizing the predictions made by a decision maker using a decision support system based on prediction sets using a structural causal model (SCM) and, based on this characterization, formalize our notion of counterfactual harm.

However, we show that, under a natural counterfactual monotonicity assumption on the predictions made by decision makers using decision support systems based on prediction sets, counterfactual harm is identifiable. Further, we show that, under a weaker interventional monotonicity assumption, which can be verified experimentally, the average counterfactual harm is partially identifiable. Then, building upon these assumptions, we develop a computational framework to design decision support systems based on prediction sets that are guaranteed to cause, in average, less counterfactual harm than a user-specified value using conformal risk control [22].

That means, under their definition, one would need to deploy the system to estimate the harm it may cause, potentially causing harm.

However, the sets are often conservative and do not include all the harm-controlling $\\lambda$ values due to estimation error in the the empirical estimate $\\hat{H}_{n}(\\lambda)$ of the average counterfactual harm using data from the calibration set. In Appendix D, we show that using larger calibration sets reduces the above mentioned estimation error and results in sets of $\\lambda$ values that are less conservative. Third, we find that there is a trade-off between accuracy and counterfactual harm and this trade-off is qualitatively consistent across decision support systems using different pre-trained classifiers.
