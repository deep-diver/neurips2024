### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current AI decision support systems often improve average prediction accuracy but can cause harm; sometimes, human experts would've made better decisions without the system.  This is problematic in high-stakes settings (medicine, law) where "first, do no harm" is paramount. This necessitates a better understanding of this 

counterfactual harm".



This paper proposes a solution using structural causal models to formally define and quantify counterfactual harm within decision support systems.  It shows that under specific assumptions, this harm is measurable, even estimable, with only human-only predictions. Using this, the authors build a framework that designs systems with less harm than a user-defined threshold, validated on real human prediction data. This significantly advances the development of safer and more beneficial AI systems.

> This figure presents a structural causal model (SCM) illustrating how a decision support system based on prediction sets affects human expert predictions.  The model depicts the relationships between exogenous variables (V, U, Œõ representing data generation, expert characteristics, and threshold), endogenous variables (X, Y, CŒª(X), ≈∂ representing features, ground truth, prediction set, and expert prediction), and the causal flows between them. It serves as the foundation for the paper's analysis of counterfactual harm.







### In-depth insights


#### Counterfactual Harm
The concept of "Counterfactual Harm" explores the potential negative consequences of using a decision support system.  It focuses on situations where a human, having successfully made a decision independently, would have performed worse using the system's assistance. **This highlights the crucial tension between improving accuracy and potentially hindering human judgment.** The framework presented aims to mitigate this harm by design, incorporating a user-specified harm threshold. This is a significant step toward responsible AI development, emphasizing not only accuracy but also the ethical implications of AI-assisted decision-making.  **The use of structural causal models (SCMs) provides a robust theoretical foundation for analyzing counterfactual scenarios** and making reliable estimations of potential harm.  By leveraging this, the authors propose a computational framework, validated through human subject studies, to ensure that the decision support system causes less harm than a predetermined threshold. This approach emphasizes the trade-off between accuracy and harm, offering a more nuanced perspective on AI deployment in high-stakes decision settings.

#### Prediction Set Design
Designing effective prediction sets is crucial for successful human-AI collaboration.  A well-designed prediction set should **minimize counterfactual harm**, while **maximizing human accuracy**. This involves a trade-off: overly restrictive sets might hinder human performance, while overly permissive sets negate the AI's assistance.  Therefore, the design needs to carefully consider the characteristics of both the AI's predictions and the human's decision-making capabilities. **Conformal prediction methods** offer a principled approach, controlling the risk of including incorrect labels, but further refinements are needed to directly optimize for human performance.  Future research should explore **adapting set sizes based on individual human expertise** and the specific task context, for instance, by dynamically adjusting the prediction set's size based on the perceived difficulty of the task and the human's confidence.  Ultimately, the design of prediction sets needs to be guided by empirical evidence regarding human behavior and decision-making processes, moving beyond simple accuracy metrics to consider the broader impact on human decision making.

#### Conformal Risk Control
Conformal risk control, as discussed in the context of decision support systems, presents a valuable framework for mitigating counterfactual harm.  It elegantly addresses the challenge of balancing improved human accuracy with the potential for unintended negative consequences by design. **The core idea is to constrain the risk of harm to a user-specified level** by carefully choosing the prediction sets used in the system.  This is achieved using conformal prediction, offering a distribution-free approach that doesn't rely on specific model assumptions. **The key is to find a set of parameters (e.g., threshold values) for the conformal predictor that guarantees the average counterfactual harm remains below a predefined threshold** . By incorporating real-world human prediction data in the evaluation, the proposed framework offers a practical approach for designing responsible AI systems that prioritize both accuracy and ethical considerations.

#### Monotonicity Assumptions
The concept of monotonicity, in the context of decision support systems and prediction sets, is crucial for understanding and controlling counterfactual harm.  **Counterfactual monotonicity** posits that if a human expert successfully predicts a label using a less restrictive prediction set (more options), they would also succeed with a more restrictive set. This assumption, while intuitive, is difficult to empirically verify.  **Interventional monotonicity**, a more experimentally tractable assumption, focuses on the probability of success given different prediction set sizes. It implies that restricting options, while potentially improving average accuracy, might increase the chance of harm by preventing an expert from reaching a correct prediction they could have made independently.  The authors leverage these monotonicity assumptions to establish identifiability results for counterfactual harm, crucial for designing decision support systems that balance accuracy and harm reduction. The choice between these assumptions reflects a trade-off between theoretical elegance and practical verifiability, highlighting a key challenge in this area of research.

#### Human-AI Tradeoffs
The concept of "Human-AI Tradeoffs" in decision support systems highlights the inherent tension between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving human agency.  **Improved accuracy often comes at the cost of reduced human control and potential for counterfactual harm**.  A system that restricts human decision-making to a subset of options (e.g., prediction sets) might boost average performance but also prevents humans from utilizing their full expertise when it would lead to superior outcomes. This trade-off necessitates careful system design, balancing accuracy gains against the risks of diminished human autonomy and the possibility of detrimental consequences resulting from restricted options. **Effective decision support should empower, not replace, human judgment** by providing assistance within a framework that respects the limitations of AI and the unique capabilities of human intelligence.
