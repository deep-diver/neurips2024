Global convolutions offer a promising alternative but are challenging to train due to overfitting and difficulty in capturing long-range relationships.  Current approaches to parameterization often involve complex mathematical methods or low-rank approximations that limit performance.\n\nThis paper introduces MRConv, which uses a novel approach to parameterize global convolutional kernels. By leveraging multi-resolution convolutions, a structural reparameterization scheme, and learnable kernel decay, MRConv learns expressive kernels that perform well across different data modalities. The authors demonstrate that MRConv achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets and improves efficiency compared to existing methods.  The proposed reparameterization scheme is crucial to the improvement in performance and efficiency.", "affiliation": "University College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "RwgNbIpCpk/podcast.wav"}
