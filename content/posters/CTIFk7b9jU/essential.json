These limitations often lead to inaccurate motion analysis, hindering the effectiveness of cardiac image processing. \n\nGPTrack uses sequential Gaussian processes to model the temporal dynamics and incorporates spatial information to account for regional variability. By using a bidirectional recursive manner, GPTrack effectively captures long-term relationships in motion, mimicking the behavior of diffeomorphic registration.  This approach significantly improves the accuracy of motion tracking in both 3D and 4D medical images, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's novel design enhances the robustness and precision of cardiac motion analysis.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "CTIFk7b9jU/podcast.wav"}
