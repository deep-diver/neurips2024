Through training and testing on data with varying degrees of granularity in natural scenarios, as well as conducting algorithm metric evaluation and subjective human assessment, the superiority of this method is demonstrated. However, there is still potential for further improvement, especially in the areas of image content editing and integrating multiple style concepts. By combining current controllable generation capabilities can boost the overall playability of AI-generated artwork. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitation. The complex interactions and occlusion order of overlapping areas are significant challenges for HiCo model and even the field of layout-to-image generation. HiCo achieves hierarchical generation by decoupling each object\u2019s position and appearance information into different branch, meanwhile controlling their overall interactions through a background branch with global prompt and the Fuse Net. HiCo is capable of handling complex interactions in overlapping regions by FuseNet. The occlusion order of overlapping objects is also specified via the global prompt by text description. But since there lacks corresponding occlusion order train data, the success rate is far from optimal. For current version of HiCo, there indeed lacks of more explicit mechanism for occlusion order controlling. For more results, please refer to Appendix A.3. We also found that the HiCo model still does not handle the generation of complex layouts for multiple concepts of LoRA very well.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
