This makes the development of efficient and accurate models paramount.  \n\nThe proposed E2ENet model tackles this challenge by introducing two key innovations: a Dynamic Sparse Feature Fusion (DSFF) mechanism and a Restricted Depth-Shift strategy in 3D convolution. DSFF selectively integrates multi-scale features, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Restricted Depth-Shift reduces computational complexity while preserving 3D information.  Evaluated on multiple datasets, E2ENet demonstrates a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, achieving competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to state-of-the-art methods.
