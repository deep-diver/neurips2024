Existing methods often rely on handcrafted rules or separately learned modules for boundary detection, limiting performance. This paper introduces REBORN, a novel approach that addresses this by iteratively training a segmentation model (using reinforcement learning) and a phoneme prediction model. The segmentation model is trained to favor segmentations that improve the phoneme prediction model's performance (lower perplexity). REBORN significantly improves the state-of-the-art in unsupervised ASR performance across various datasets and languages.\nREBORN's iterative training effectively refines both the segmentation and prediction models, leading to more accurate transcriptions.  By analyzing the learned segmental boundaries, the researchers found that these are smaller than phonemes, which enhances the accuracy of the phoneme predictions. This method also offers robustness and generalizability, outperforming existing methods regardless of the underlying speech foundation model used. The improved accuracy and efficiency hold considerable promise for advancing unsupervised ASR, especially in low-resource scenarios.", "affiliation": "National Taiwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Speech Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "V3QZCM1AQv/podcast.wav"}
