Existing sketching methods, while reducing data size, often introduce significant bias, impacting accuracy.  Previous approaches to mitigate bias involved costly techniques or imposed strong assumptions, limiting their practical use. This created a need for efficient methods that minimize bias while maintaining computational efficiency.\nThis work introduces a novel sparse sketching method that addresses these limitations.  By focusing on bias reduction rather than error minimization, the method achieves a nearly unbiased least squares estimator.  It utilizes only two passes over the data, operates in optimal space complexity, and runs within current matrix multiplication time.  This leads to significant advancements in distributed averaging algorithms for least squares and related tasks, improving upon various existing methods.
