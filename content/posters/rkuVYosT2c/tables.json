We include the fully sequential Weighted Mb-SGD as a reference.", "description": "This table compares the time complexity and the number of parallel passes required by different methods for solving a least squares problem with a given preconditioner. The methods compared are Gaussian Sketch, Leverage Score Sampling, Determinantal Point Process, and Weighted Mb-SGD (sequential). The comparison is based on achieving a (1+\u03b5)-approximation using O(d\u00b2log(nd)) bits of space.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
