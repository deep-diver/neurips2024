The model was trained on a subset of categories from the Quick, Draw! dataset, and different combinations of augmentations (local, structural, and false strokes) were applied. The table shows the impact of each augmentation type on several metrics: SSIM (structural similarity index), CD (Chamfer distance), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), CLIP I2I (CLIP image-to-image similarity), and CLIP I2T (CLIP image-to-text similarity).  The goal was to assess how each augmentation affects the faithfulness of the model's output to the original sketch.", "section": "5.2 Ablations"}]
