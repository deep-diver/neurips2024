However, existing methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, retraining needs, and a lack of theoretical guarantees.  These methods also struggle with high-dimensional data and complex distributions.\n\nThis paper introduces Neural Conditional Probability (NCP), a novel approach that addresses these limitations.  NCP leverages the power of neural networks to learn the conditional expectation operator, allowing efficient computation of various statistics without retraining. The method is supported by theoretical guarantees ensuring both optimization consistency and statistical accuracy. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate NCP's competitive performance, even compared to more complex models.", "affiliation": "CSML, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "zXfhHJnMB2/podcast.wav"}
