Existing methods often train and test on the same dataset, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.  This leads to a significant barrier in developing robust pre-trained models for human activity analysis.\nUniMTS tackles these challenges head-on. It introduces a unified pre-training procedure using contrastive learning to align motion time series with text descriptions. This approach, combined with synthetic data generation and rotation-invariant augmentation, enables the model to learn the semantic meanings of motion data and generalize effectively.  UniMTS achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 benchmark datasets, demonstrating exceptional zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot performance.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "DpByqSbdhI/podcast.wav"}
