In contrast to HeO, which requires only one sample per iteration, they necessitate a large number of samples per iteration.

Denoising diffusion model (DDM) [24] has been applied for solving combinatorial optimization problems [48]. Although the diffusion process in DDMs akin to the heat diffusion in our HeO, DDMs require a substantial data for training and necessitate reversing the diffusion process to generate data that from the target distribution. In contrast, HeO needs no training, and it is unnecessary to strictly adhering to the monotonic $\\tau_{t}$ in the optimization process, as under different $\\tau$ , the function $u(\\tau,\\pmb\\theta)$ shares the same optima with that of the original problem $h(\\pmb\\theta)$ .

GC has been applied for non-convex optimization, though it has not yet been used for combinatorial optimization. The optimal convexification of GC [50] underpins potentially theoretical advantages of HeO. One key distinction is that GC typically optimizes each sub-problem (corresponding to $u(\\pmb\\theta,\\tau_{t})$ ) at each $t$ up to some criteria, whereas HeO merely performs a single-step gradient descent. Also, Eq. (8) corresponds to a variation of the evolution strategy, a robust optimizer for non-differentiable function [51], while HeO use a different gradient estimation (Eq. (11)), see Appendix for details. Additionally, our HeO is related to randomized smoothing, which has been applied to non-smooth optimization [52] or neural network regularization [53]. The distinctive feature of our HeO is that, across different $\\tau$ , the smoothed function $u(\\tau,\\pmb\\theta)$ retains the optima of the original function $h(\\theta)$ (Thm. 1). This distinguishes our HeO from methods based on quantum adiabatic theory [9], bifurcation theory [12] and other relaxation strategies [54], in which the optima of the smoothed function can be different from the original one [27, 55].

Prior researches have demonstrated that the optimization procedure can be significantly accelerated by preconditioning [57] or Fisher information matrix [58], implying that choosing a proper matrix $A$ could substantially improve the efficacy of the HeO. Additionally, since $\\tau_{t}$ does not necessarily have to be monotonic due to the cooperative optimization property of HeO, it is feasible to explore various $\\tau_{t}$ schedules (possibly non-monotonic) to further enhance performance.

In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n\u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. ", "page_idx": 23}, {"type": "text", "text": "3.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
