Recently, significant research has been devoted to explainable machine learning [1]. These efforts aim to either employ interpretable models or explain the decisions of black-box models using posthoc explanation methods. In the audio domain, however, only a few works exist on interpretable audio classifiers [2, 3, 4] as well as on posthoc explanation methods [5, 6, 7, 8]. The latter contributions are limited to standard closed-set classification and do not explore the challenging topic of interpreting zero-shot classifiers. Zero-shot classifiers, on the other hand, are gaining popularity for their exceptional adaptability, as they define audio classes based on a set of textual prompts [9]. The class labels are not necessarily predefined but can be generated dynamically during inference via natural language. The increased flexibility of zero-shot classifiers comes with a drawback: their predictions are challenging to interpret. This difficulty arises from their multi-modal nature, as learning an interpreter in the joint representation space between text and audio is required. A notable example of a zero-shot classifier is Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) [10], which jointly trains audio and text representations using contrastive learning, that we also work with in this paper.

To the best of our knowledge, this has never been attempted before in the literature. Following the masking idea proposed in [8], we propose LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers in the ZeroShot context), which consists of a decoder (the interpreter) that outputs a saliency map capable of highlighting the regions within the input audio that trigger the zero-shot classification. We introduce a novel loss function that incentives faithfully following the similarity between the original audio and the corresponding text prompt. Our method provides listenable explanations for linear and non-linear frequency-scale short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representations of audio waveforms. It can also operate on the raw audio domain directly. We applied our explanation method on top of a pretrained version of the popular CLAP [10] by considering different zero-shot classification datasets, including the ESC50 [11], UrbanSound8K [12], as well as versions of ESC50 and UrbanSound8K where different types of contaminations are applied. We show extensive experimental results suggesting that the produced saliency maps correlate well with the corresponding text prompts and faithfully follow the original zero-shot classifier. In particular, our evaluation using various faithfulness metrics highlights that LMAC-ZS is able to provide explanations that are highly relevant to the decisions made by the CLAP model in the zero-shot context.

These include the standard saliency method [14], GradCAM [15], GradCAM++ [13], SmoothGrad [16], Integrated Gradients (IG) [17], and several others. However, as suggested in [18], these methods often fail to follow the classifier very faithfully and tend to be insensitive even to random model weights. Another category of post-hoc explanation methods in computer vision generates explanations by applying masks to the input data. Key approaches in this category include [19, 20, 21, 22], which use optimization-based techniques to learn and generate these masks. There also exists a series of works that are most closely related to this paper, where a decoder is trained to produce explanations.

Other examples include Posthoc Interpretation via Quantization [7], which trains a VQ-VAE [32]-based decoder as an explanation module, and Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers [8], which trains a decoder using a classification loss to promote faithfulness. These works are not directly applicable to zero-shot classification as they require a predefined set of labels to train the interpreter. In this paper, our goal is to produce explanations in a true zero-shot fashion. To achieve that, we train our decoder on the same data as the CLAP model (without using class labels that we will later test on). Subsequently, LMAC-ZS can produce explanations for arbitrary labels, encoded as natural language. This includes labels not previously seen during the training of the interpreter.

Our quantitative and qualitative comparisons show that LMAC-ZS outperforms or is comparable to the most popular baseline saliency methods on most quantitative faithfulness metrics.
