The table reports faithfulness metrics (AI, AD, AG, FF, Fid-In, SPS, COMP) for each method and condition, allowing for an assessment of the quality and reliability of the explanations generated under various degrees of audio contamination. Two versions of LMAC-ZS are included, trained on the Clotho dataset only (CT) and trained on the full CLAP dataset (Full).  The Mask-Mean (MM) column indicates the average value of the generated saliency masks.  The performance of each explanation method is evaluated in terms of how well the explanations align with the predictions made by the underlying model and how robust the explanations are to noise.", "section": "4.2 Experimental Setup"}, {"figure_path": "lV1wGHKd5x/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Out-of-Domain quantitative evaluation for the ESC50 Dataset.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of LMAC-ZS and several baseline methods (GradCam, GradCam++, SmoothGrad, and IG) for zero-shot audio classification on the ESC50 dataset under various out-of-domain conditions (ESC50 contamination, White Noise contamination, LJ-Speech contamination).
