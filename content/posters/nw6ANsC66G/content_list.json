(11) is therefore the key step in our federated fine-tuning framework, whose overall flow is summarized in Alg. 1. Our algorithm proceeds in multiple iterations. At each iteration, a set of $m$ clients is sampled. Each client selects the most relevant subset of summarizing prompts from the server using a mechanism adapted from continual visual prompt-tuning [49]. The selected subset of summarizing prompts are then fine-tuned using local data (see lines 3-4). The sets of fine-tuned prompts are subsequently uploaded to the server, which performs the aggregation via solving Eq. (11) (see line 6). The aggregation step has two subtleties: (1) the total number of global prompts, $n=n_{1}+...+n_{t}$ , is proportional to the total number of prompts across clients, making the entire algorithm non-parametric; and (2) once the optimal assignment parameters z are found via solving Eq. (11), global prompts that were not assigned to any client will be removed (see lines 7 and 8). Intuitively, if the sampled clients are similar, their prompt sets will substantially overlap, which reduces the total number of distinct prompts selected by all clients. Otherwise, if the sampled clients are dissimilar, there will be less overlapping and the union set of selected global prompts will expand, increasing the complexity of the resulting model to match the increased data heterogeneity.

(11) above is however not trivial due to its mixed set of discrete/continuous variables.

Among which, solving sub-task (2) is straight-forward since it only requires being able to differentiate the expression in Eq. (9) and Eq.

On the other hand, solving sub-task (1) is seemingly prohibitive expensive because it involves optimizing the (discrete) assignment parameters $\\mathbf{z}$ .

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
