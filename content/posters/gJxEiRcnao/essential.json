This is a significant limitation, as the human visual system uses top-down signals to guide attention. Moreover, existing models face challenges with backpropagation, which is crucial for effective learning.  These issues necessitate a new learning model that combines BU and TD processing effectively. \nThis research presents a new model that addresses these limitations. It uses a cortical-like combination of BU and TD processing to integrate both learning and visual guidance, achieving this through novel connectivity, processing cycles, and a 'Counter-Hebb' learning mechanism that approximates backpropagation.  The model shows significant improvements in learning efficiency and achieves competitive performance on standard multi-task learning benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Weizmann Institute of Science", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "gJxEiRcnao/podcast.wav"}
