Due to the wide variety of applications that this problem captures, it has received a lot of attention from different perspectives. A notable example is the strategic version of this problem which is motivated by the fact that the participating agents may be able to strategically misreport their preferences, leading to a facility location choice that they prefer over the one that would be chosen if they were truthful. In the strategic facility location problem, the goal is to design truthful mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that elicit the agents\u2019 true preferences by carefully removing any incentive for the agents to lie [Moulin, 1980, Procaccia and Tennenholtz, 2013]. This problem has played a central role in the broader literature on mechanism design without money and a lot of prior work has focused on optimizing the quality of the returned location subject to the truthfulness constraint (see Section 1.2 for a brief overview).

This leaves open the question of whether mechanisms equipped with more refined predictions can, indeed, achieve better trade-offs between robustness and consistency. Also, Agrawal et al.

The median mechanism is known to be truthful, providing an optimal solution for the Utilitarian Social Cost and achieving a 2-approximation for the Egalitarian Social Cost, as demonstrated by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013]. Notably, Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013] showed that this 2-approximation factor represents the best performance achievable by any deterministic truthful mechanism. Building on this, Border and Jordan [1983] extended these results to the Euclidean space by employing median schemes independently in each dimension. Subsequently, Barber\u00e0 et al. [1993] further generalized this outcome to any $L_{1}$ - norms.

The reason is that the design space for two-dimensional mechanisms is much richer, and the known lower bounds apply only to the more restricted class of one-dimensional mechanisms. For example, consider a simple instance with just two agents in two dimensions.

Specifically, returning points that are not on the line allows us to induce previously impossible cost vectors. For a simple example, in a one-dimensional instance involving two agents at distance 1 from each other, the only facility location that yields the same cost to both agents is the midpoint between them, leading to a cost vector of (0.5, 0.5).
