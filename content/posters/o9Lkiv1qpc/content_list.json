For example, VideoCrafter1 [12] only utilizes CLIP Image Embedding, and I2VGENXL [69] adds $\\pmb{y}_{0}$ to the first frame of the noisy input. However, as shown in Fig. 6, the videos generated by these methods do not fully capture the details of $\\pmb{y}_{0}$ . To address this, models like Dynamicrafter [63] directly incorporate $\\pmb{y}_{0}$ into I2V-DMs, improving detail preservation but also increasing the risk of leakage. Dynamicrafter selectively refines spatial layers while preserving the pre-trained temporal layers, which contain motion priors and thus maintain motion dynamics to a certain extent. However, it does not inherently solve the leakage issue. Moreover, some methods introduce external signals [9, 70, 65, 62, 60], forcing the model to align with additional conditions, which reduces its dependence on $\\pmb{y}_{0}$ and helps mitigate leakage. However, we argue that they do not address the core challenge of I2V-DMs, which should predict clean video primarily from noisy input to capture motion information. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the SVD often results in static objects with excessive camera movements to meet high motion score requirements. In contrast, our method generates videos with natural, vivid object movements.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
