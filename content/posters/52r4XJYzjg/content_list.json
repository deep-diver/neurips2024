Direct preference feedback is uninterpretable, difficult to provide where multidimensional criteria may apply, and often inconsistent, either because it is based on incomplete instructions or provided by diverse principals. To address these challenges, we consider the two-step preference modeling procedure that first resolves the under-specification by selecting a context, and then evaluates preference with respect to the chosen context. We decompose reward modeling error according to these two steps, which suggests that supervising context in addition to context-specific preference may be a viable approach to aligning models with diverse human preferences. For this to work, the ability of models to evaluate context-specific preference is critical. To this end, we contribute contextconditioned preference datasets and accompanying experiments that investigate the ability of language models to evaluate context-specific preference. We use our datasets to (1) show that existing preference models benefit from, but fail to fully consider, added context, (2) finetune a context-aware reward model with context-specific performance exceeding that of GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B on tested datasets, and (3) investigate the value of context-aware preference modeling.

The prevailing approach for aligning an LM to human preferences uses pairwise preferences between different outputs to finetune the LM [52, 6], which falls short of addressing the critical challenges presented by the reality of diverse user intents and contexts [51, 50, 13]. In the presence of unspecified contexts, such as the user\u2019s identity or goals, preference queries are notoriously ambiguous [62] and one typically observes poor agreement $(\\sim65\\%)$ between human annotators on binary preference queries [35, 59].

First and foremost, this approach explicitly identifies contextual assumptions that underlie preference, and shifts the alignment burden from preference modeling to a hybrid of preference modeling and context supervision. Second, this approach is naturally pluralistic [51], allowing the model to adapt to diverse users and use cases. Finally, it offers more flexibility for principled aggregation: whereas the Bradley-Terry approach corresponds to aggregating contexts using the Borda rule [50], which may under-serve certain subgroups [13], the context-decomposition approach can additionally be used for jury learning [22] and cardinal utility aggregation [7].

It made its way into finetuning language models via a line of work originating in reinforcement learning [2, 15, 62, 52], and has now become the dominant approach for finetuning language models to follow human instructions [44, 6, 4, 46]. While this approach has achieved remarkable results and enabled the performance of state-of-the-art models, several authors have pointed to its limitations [12, 45, 32, 51], which include the ambiguity problem that motivates our work. Notably, recent works have identified shortcomings that arise from implicitly aggregating diverse perspectives with a single choice rule [50, 13, 40, 18, 19]. In particular, Siththaranjan et al. [50] have recently shown the standard Bradley-Terry approach (Figure 1, left), implicitly uses the Borda rule to aggregate preferences across hidden contexts, and proposed to learn distributional reward models as a way to account for this. Rather than leave hidden context implicit in a distributional model, which does not resolve the indeterminate preference problem highlighted by our RPR datasets (see Section 4), we propose to make context explicit, either via specification or inference. Given a preference problem that has been decomposed into contexts and context-specific preferences, as described in Section 3, we can then choose to apply the Borda rule or an alternative such as an expected utility aggregation [23] or jury learning [22] (see \u201cdistributionally pluralistic models\u201d in Sorensen et al.

This approach has also become common in the literature on summarization, where multi-dimensional evaluation criteria are well recognized, with common dimensions including conciseness, coherence, consistency and fluency [60, 26, 16]. However, our work (Table 3) and others [24] find that current models often ignore or confuse added context. Preferences driven by diverse individual principles have been aggregated within frameworks such as Constitutional AI [6, 53], and alternative approaches to aligning models with human preferences, such as AI safety via debate [25] and consensus based approaches [7], can be understood as ways of supervising the context or assumptions underlying preference rather than the preference itself.

However, despite the prevalence of context conditioning in deployed systems (e.g., system prompts and \u201cMy GPTs\u201d [43]), when we began our work, there were no open source preference datasets where preference is strongly determined by context, and limited studies of the context-specific preference modeling capabilities of current models [30]. To this end, we introduced the RPR datasets (Table 2) and investigated a series of interesting empirical questions in Section 5). We found that (1) while current preference models generally benefit from context, they sometimes ignore added context, (2) finetuning on our preference reversal datasets greatly improves contextspecific performance, and (3) a single persistent context, which might be inferred from data, may be sufficient to significantly improve preference prediction performance.

Further, while we have open sourced a set of context-conditioned preference datasets, these datasets have limited diversity (for example, they are primarily English, and are limited to single turn conversations), and were synthesized rather than collected from real human feedback, which limits their practical relevance, as the preferences may not align with all potential user perspectives. Additional open, preferably human sourced datasets with context annotations are needed to more fruitfully pursue this research direction.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
