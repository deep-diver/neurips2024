### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current language model alignment via finetuning on pairwise preferences faces challenges due to the inherent ambiguity and inconsistency of human feedback, especially in multidimensional contexts.  Direct preference feedback is difficult to interpret and often inconsistent. 

This paper introduces a two-step context-aware preference modeling approach. It first resolves the under-specification by selecting a context, and then evaluates preference with respect to that context.  This decomposition clarifies the alignment problem, enabling more robust adaptation to diverse user preferences and offering enhanced flexibility for principled aggregation.  The researchers contributed context-conditioned preference datasets and demonstrated that their context-aware model outperforms other leading models in aligning with diverse human preferences.

> This figure illustrates two approaches to preference modeling. The left side shows the standard approach where a preference model directly evaluates preferences from ambiguous queries. The right side shows a two-step context-aware approach.  First, a context is identified, then a context-specific preference is evaluated.  Both approaches can utilize reward models to independently evaluate alternatives.

### In-depth insights


#### Context-Aware LMs
Context-aware Language Models (LMs) represent a significant advancement in natural language processing.  Instead of treating input text in isolation, **context-aware LMs leverage contextual information to enhance understanding and generate more relevant and nuanced responses.** This contextual information can encompass various elements, such as prior conversation turns in a dialogue, user profiles reflecting individual preferences, or even the specific task being performed. By incorporating this contextual richness, context-aware LMs can better disambiguate meaning, adapt to different user needs, and generate outputs that align more closely with human expectations.  **A core challenge in developing context-aware LMs lies in effectively representing and integrating diverse contextual elements.**  Different approaches may prioritize specific types of context or employ different mechanisms for context integration.  Furthermore, **the evaluation of context-aware LMs requires careful consideration of the multifaceted nature of context and its impact on performance.**  Simple metrics may not fully capture the nuances of context-aware generation. Research in this area is vital for creating truly intelligent and adaptable language models capable of handling the complexity of real-world communication.

#### Preference Reversal
The concept of "Preference Reversal" in the context of this research paper centers on the **inconsistency** observed in human preferences when presented with different contexts.  It highlights the **ambiguity** inherent in natural language, where preferences aren't inherently fixed, but rather **heavily influenced** by various contextual factors.  The authors challenge the traditional methods of directly evaluating preferences, which often produce unreliable and inconsistent results due to this inherent ambiguity.  Instead, they propose a **two-step process** that separates context selection from preference evaluation, creating a more robust and accurate way of understanding how context shapes human judgment and modeling this phenomenon.

#### Dataset Creation
The creation of a robust and reliable dataset is crucial for evaluating context-aware preference models.  The paper highlights the need for datasets that explicitly disentangle context from preference, addressing the ambiguity inherent in natural language.  **Synthetic data generation** is employed, leveraging a powerful language model like GPT-4 to create controlled scenarios and responses, ensuring consistency and minimizing annotation bias.  The use of **multiple prompt structures** helps in capturing diverse contextual influences. The **iterative refinement process** emphasizes quality control, with human validation playing a key role in identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies.  This meticulous approach underscores the authors' commitment to developing high-quality data that accurately reflects the complexities of human preferences and their contextual nuances, ultimately leading to more reliable model evaluation.

#### Model Finetuning
Model finetuning in the context of large language models (LLMs) is a crucial process for aligning model outputs with human preferences.  The provided text highlights the challenges inherent in directly finetuning models based on pairwise preferences, citing issues of **ambiguity**, **inconsistency**, and **multidimensional criteria**.  The authors propose a two-step context-aware approach, where a context is first selected to address underspecification, followed by preference evaluation specific to that context. This decomposition of the reward modeling error into context selection and context-specific preference highlights the potential of **context supervision** alongside preference supervision to improve model alignment with diverse human preferences.  The paper introduces novel datasets to facilitate the evaluation of context-aware preference models, demonstrating that context is critical, but existing models often fail to fully utilize it.  Finetuning on these datasets significantly improves context-specific performance, surpassing the capabilities of even powerful models such as GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B in specific test scenarios.  This research underscores the importance of explicitly modeling context in LLM training for achieving better alignment and robustness to diverse user intents.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Improving context inference** is crucial; current models struggle to fully utilize provided context, and creating more robust methods for context disambiguation is key.  **High-quality, diverse datasets** are also needed, ideally sourced from real human preferences,  to improve generalizability and address biases. Exploring alternative aggregation methods beyond the Borda rule could further enhance context-aware preference modeling.  Finally, researching **more principled approaches to handling diverse user intents** is vital. This might involve developing better methods for uncertainty quantification and incorporating explicit modeling of human diversity and disagreement into the preference modeling process itself. Investigating the interplay between context-aware preference modeling and other alignment techniques (such as Constitutional AI or Debate) would also be valuable.

> This table presents the performance of various models on four different datasets: RPR Criteria, RPR Scenarios, Preference Bench, and Multifaceted Bench.  For each dataset, the model's performance is shown with and without the addition of context. The results demonstrate that adding context generally improves the model's performance. Notably, the authors' model, which was finetuned on the RPR datasets, significantly outperforms the unfinetuned version.  The table highlights the importance of context in accurate preference prediction.
