While physics-informed priors help in energy-conservative systems, real-world systems often deviate. Existing methods rely on domain-specific priors, limiting applicability. This paper addresses these issues.\nThe paper introduces TREAT, a new framework that uses Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) regularization.  TRS loss universally improves accuracy by minimizing higher-order Taylor terms in ODE integration, benefiting various systems regardless of properties.  TREAT demonstrates superior performance on diverse datasets, showcasing broad applicability and effectiveness.", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "iWlqbNE8P7/podcast.wav"}
