### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current visually-grounded language models (VLMs) struggle with basic image classification tasks, despite having large numbers of parameters and often utilizing CLIP as a vision encoder. This paper investigates why this is and explores several hypotheses, including differences in inference algorithms, training objectives, and data processing.  Their analysis shows that the primary reason is the insufficient amount of classification data used during VLM training.  Information necessary for image classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but remains inaccessible without adequate training data. 

This research proposes a simple method to improve VLMs' image classification ability by including datasets focused on classification during the training process.  The researchers demonstrate that enhancing VLMs with classification data substantially boosts their classification performance on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, this improved performance transfers to other more advanced visual reasoning tasks, which suggests that **robust classification is foundational for more complex VLM applications.**  The enhanced VLM achieves an 11.8% improvement on the newly-created ImageWikiQA dataset, showing the positive impact of this approach.

### In-depth insights


#### VLM Classification Gap
The "VLM Classification Gap" highlights the **surprising underperformance** of visually-grounded language models (VLMs) in image classification tasks compared to simpler models like CLIP.  This gap is particularly intriguing given that many VLMs utilize CLIP as their vision encoder and possess significantly more parameters.  The paper investigates several hypotheses to explain this discrepancy, ultimately concluding that **insufficient training data** is the primary culprit.  Information crucial for effective image classification is present within the VLM's latent space, but this information can only be reliably accessed and utilized with ample training examples representative of a wide range of classes.  This finding emphasizes the **critical role of data** in shaping VLM capabilities and suggests that enhanced classification performance through data augmentation can serve as a foundation for improving VLMs' overall capabilities.

#### Data-Centric Analysis
A data-centric analysis of visually-grounded language models (VLMs) for image classification would delve into the relationship between the characteristics of training data and model performance.  This would likely involve investigating the **distribution of classes** within the training data, the **frequency of class instances**, and the **diversity of visual features** associated with each class.  The analysis would examine if any biases in the data (e.g., overrepresentation of certain classes or underrepresentation of others) impact model accuracy. A key aspect would be analyzing whether the **information necessary for effective image classification** is adequately captured in the VLM's latent space and can be reliably extracted during inference, with an exploration of whether insufficient or insufficiently diverse training data leads to limitations in the model's ability to generalize across different images and classes.  Furthermore, the correlation between the frequency of exposure to a class during training and the model's performance on that class would be thoroughly investigated.  The results of such an analysis can guide improvements in data curation and training strategies to enhance VLM's capabilities and reduce biases.

#### VLM Enhancement
The paper explores enhancing visually-grounded language models (VLMs) by integrating classification-focused datasets into their training. This **data-centric approach** addresses the core limitation of VLMs underperforming in image classification tasks.  The authors hypothesize that while VLMs encode necessary classification information, sufficient training data is crucial for effective decoding. Experiments demonstrate a **strong correlation** between class exposure during training and VLM performance.  By incorporating classification data, the enhanced VLMs achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models. Importantly, this improvement **generalizes** beyond image classification, improving performance on complex visual question answering tasks. This signifies that bolstering foundational classification abilities is fundamental to unlocking more advanced capabilities in VLMs, highlighting the importance of robust data in model development and the critical interplay between specialized and generalized training for optimal VLM performance.

#### ImageWikiQA Dataset
The ImageWikiQA dataset, created by leveraging GPT-4 and Wikipedia, presents a novel approach to evaluating visually-grounded language models (VLMs). Unlike existing datasets that focus primarily on either classification or advanced reasoning tasks, **ImageWikiQA bridges this gap by combining both**.  It consists of multiple-choice questions about ImageNet objects, demanding both object recognition and world knowledge for accurate answers. This design makes it particularly effective for assessing the broader capabilities of VLMs, revealing limitations not apparent through simple image classification. The dataset's creation process, using GPT-4 to generate questions based on Wikipedia entries for ImageNet classes, ensures that questions are both challenging and relevant. **The inclusion of diverse question types further enhances the dataset's comprehensiveness**, moving beyond simple classification and into the realm of knowledge-based reasoning. By integrating classification-focused data into its training, the ImageWikiQA dataset demonstrates **the importance of proper data for enhancing VLMs**, showcasing how classification serves as a foundation for more sophisticated capabilities.  Therefore, ImageWikiQA offers a more holistic evaluation that extends beyond zero-shot classification and allows researchers to assess the robustness and reasoning power of VLMs in more realistic scenarios.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on visually-grounded language models (VLMs) could explore several key areas.  **Improving zero-shot classification performance** without extensive fine-tuning is crucial, potentially through more sophisticated data augmentation or architectural modifications.  Investigating **alternative training objectives** beyond the text generation approach is needed to determine if better performance can be achieved with classification-specific losses.  Furthermore, a deeper investigation into **the role of data diversity** in VLM performance is warranted. This includes exploring how the variety and quality of training data impact not only classification accuracy but also generalization to unseen classes and complex reasoning tasks.  Finally, there is a need to develop methods that **mitigate catastrophic forgetting** during fine-tuning.  A better understanding of how to balance enhancing specific capabilities (such as classification) with preserving a VLM's overall general capabilities will be key in making VLMs more versatile and robust.
