", "takeaways": ["A new framework for mechanism-specific amplification by subsampling that outperforms existing mechanism-agnostic bounds.", "A unified approach for privacy accounting that works across approximate DP, R\u00e9nyi DP, and dominating pairs.", "Stronger group privacy amplification guarantees by jointly analyzing group privacy and subsampling."], "tldr": "Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for protecting data, but existing methods for managing privacy loss over multiple operations (privacy accounting) are often loose.  Amplification by subsampling, a technique to enhance privacy by using random subsets of data, also suffers from loose, mechanism-agnostic guarantees. This limits the precision of privacy accounting and reduces the utility of DP in applications such as machine learning. \nThis research introduces a new framework for tighter, mechanism-specific amplification using subsampling and optimal transport theory. **This method leverages additional information about the mechanism to derive tighter privacy bounds than previous mechanism-agnostic approaches.** It unifies privacy accounting across different DP definitions (approximate DP, R\u00e9nyi DP, dominating pairs), leading to more accurate privacy calculations and improved utility.  The framework is applied to analyzing group privacy under subsampling, resulting in considerably tighter bounds than what is possible with traditional methods.", "affiliation": "Technical University of Munich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "mVfRrMfGdY/podcast.wav"}
