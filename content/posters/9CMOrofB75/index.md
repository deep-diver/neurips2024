### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current research on diffusion models often separately analyzes training and sampling accuracy. This approach limits the complete understanding of the generation process and optimal design strategies. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of both training and sampling. 

The study uses a novel method to prove the convergence of gradient descent training dynamics and extends previous sampling error analysis to variance exploding models. By combining these results, the paper offers a unified error analysis to guide the design of training and sampling processes. This includes providing theoretical support for design choices that align with current state-of-the-art models.

> üîº This table compares the performance of polynomial and exponential time and variance schedules.  It shows how the score error (Es), dominated by score function accuracy, and the combined discretization and initialization error (ED + E1), dominated by sampling process, behave differently under each schedule and which schedule is better for each error type and when score function is well or less trained. The choice of optimal schedule is also discussed, based on which type of error dominates.
