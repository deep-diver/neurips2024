It shows how the score error (Es), dominated by score function accuracy, and the combined discretization and initialization error (ED + E1), dominated by sampling process, behave differently under each schedule and which schedule is better for each error type and when score function is well or less trained. The choice of optimal schedule is also discussed, based on which type of error dominates.", "section": "4.2 Choice of time and variance schedules"}, {"figure_path": "9CMOrofB75/tables/tables_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparisons between different schedules.", "description": "This table compares the performance of polynomial and exponential time schedules in diffusion models under two scenarios: when the score error dominates, and when the sampling error dominates. The comparison is based on the order of the score error (Es) and the combined sampling error (ED + E1), along with the choice of time schedule and the resulting iteration complexity (N). The results suggest that a polynomial schedule is preferable when the score error is dominant, while an exponential schedule performs better when the sampling error is dominant.", "section": "4.2 Choice of time and variance schedules"}]
