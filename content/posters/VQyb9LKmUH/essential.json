They often require separate training for each KG, hindering knowledge transfer and limiting their real-world applicability. This paper tackles this issue by focusing on creating a model capable of reasoning universally across various KGs.  The core problem lies in the difficulty of representing unseen entities and relations consistently across different KGs.  Previous methods tried to solve this using relational patterns or query-conditioned structures but faced limitations in transferability.\nThe researchers propose KG-ICL, a **prompt-based KG foundation model** that utilizes in-context learning.  This approach uses a prompt graph centered on a query-related example fact, encoded with a unified tokenizer that handles entities and relations consistently across different KGs.  Two message passing neural networks process these prompt graphs and perform KG reasoning.  Evaluations on 43 diverse KGs demonstrate that KG-ICL significantly outperforms existing methods in both transductive and inductive settings, highlighting its impressive generalization ability and universal reasoning capabilities. The unified tokenizer is also a key contribution of this work.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "VQyb9LKmUH/podcast.wav"}
