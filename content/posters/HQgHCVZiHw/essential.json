Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), a conventional method for estimating parameters, faces computational challenges due to the need for calculating a normalizing constant integral. Score matching (SM) estimators offer an alternative by avoiding this integral, but existing SM methods for point processes have limitations, only suitable for specific problems. \nThis research introduces a weighted score matching (WSM) estimator designed to overcome the limitations of previous approaches.  Theoretically, WSM's consistency is proven, and its convergence rate is established.  Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the WSM accurately estimates model parameters, while existing SM estimators fail to perform effectively, showing the superiority of the proposed WSM estimator.", "affiliation": "Center for Applied Statistics and School of Statistics, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "HQgHCVZiHw/podcast.wav"}
