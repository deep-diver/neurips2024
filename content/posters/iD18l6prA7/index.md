### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Merging multiple neural networks can boost performance, but existing methods struggle with inconsistencies, especially when merging three or more models.  These methods often create an accumulation of errors when combining the models, resulting in inferior performance compared to the original models.  Pairwise model merging approaches fail to guarantee this cycle consistency.



C2M¬≥, the method proposed in this paper, directly addresses these issues. By mapping each network to a common 'universe' space, and enforcing cycle consistency among the mappings, C2M¬≥ effectively merges multiple models.  **This data-free approach leverages the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for efficient optimization and incorporates activation renormalization to further improve the results.** The method was extensively tested on various architectures and datasets, yielding better results than current state-of-the-art methods.  The authors provide a publicly available codebase to foster reproducibility.

> This figure illustrates the difference between existing pairwise model merging methods and the proposed cycle-consistent approach. The left panel shows that existing methods may not satisfy cycle consistency, i.e., the composition of pairwise mappings does not necessarily result in the identity transformation. In contrast, the right panel shows that the proposed approach introduces a universal space U, mapping each model A, B, and C to it. It enforces cycle consistency by design, as the composition of pairwise mappings through U always leads to the identity transformation.

### In-depth insights


#### Cycle-Consistent Merging
Cycle-consistent merging in neural networks addresses the limitations of pairwise merging methods by enforcing consistency across multiple models.  **Existing pairwise methods often struggle with accumulating errors** when merging more than two models, resulting in inconsistencies. This cycle-consistent approach factors each permutation mapping between models through a shared "universe" space, ensuring that the composition of any cyclic permutation sequence equals the identity, effectively eliminating accumulated error. This is achieved using an iterative optimization algorithm (such as Frank-Wolfe) that considers all layers simultaneously, thereby maintaining coherence across the entire network and **avoiding the layer-wise inconsistencies** observed in earlier approaches.  This approach shows significant improvement in merging multiple models, yielding superior results compared to existing methods in various scenarios.

#### Frank-Wolfe Matching
The Frank-Wolfe matching algorithm, as presented in the context of multi-model merging, offers a compelling approach to aligning neural networks by optimizing neuron permutations across all layers.  **Unlike pairwise methods**, which often suffer from cycle inconsistency issues, this technique leverages the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to iteratively refine the global assignment of neurons, resulting in a more coherent and stable mapping between models. By factoring each permutation into mappings through a common "universe" space, **cycle consistency** is inherently enforced.  The iterative nature, coupled with the computation of gradients reflecting inter-layer dependencies, contributes to the algorithm's robustness and its ability to achieve a better global alignment. This is in contrast to layer-wise methods that struggle with accumulating error and variance across layers. **The global optimization** is key to addressing the limitations of the pairwise approach, enhancing the quality and reliability of multi-model merging.

#### Universe Space Merging
The concept of "Universe Space Merging" in the context of the provided research paper appears to be a novel approach to neural network model aggregation.  The core idea revolves around mapping the internal representations (neuron weights) of multiple models into a shared, common space ‚Äì the "universe." **This mapping is done using carefully optimized permutations of the neurons within each model**, ensuring consistency and preventing error accumulation during the merging process.  The key innovation lies in enforcing **cycle consistency**, allowing for the composition of multiple model permutations within the universe space without introducing errors, thus facilitating seamless model merging. This method is distinct from pairwise approaches that lack this global constraint. Finally, the process of merging itself happens in this universe space, producing a final model that incorporates the salient features of the original models more effectively than methods relying solely on averaging or pairwise mappings.

#### Mode Connectivity
Mode connectivity, a core concept in the paper, explores the geometric landscape of neural network loss functions.  It challenges the traditional view of isolated minima (modes) by demonstrating the existence of low-energy paths connecting them.  **This connectivity is crucial because it implies that functionally equivalent networks may exist, differing only in the permutation of neurons.** The paper highlights the importance of considering these symmetries during model merging, arguing that approaches neglecting these symmetries can lead to inconsistent results. The concept of mode connectivity is foundational to the paper's proposed cycle-consistent multi-model merging method, which leverages the understanding of mode connectivity to ensure consistent results regardless of the order in which models are merged.  **This is achieved by mapping all models to a common 'universe' space, thus mitigating errors that accumulate from sequential pairwise merging.** The research empirically investigates the influence of factors like network width and the number of models being merged on the overall performance and mode connectivity.

#### Merging Limitations
The limitations of multi-model merging methods center around several key challenges.  **Cycle consistency**, while theoretically desirable, can be difficult to achieve perfectly in practice, leading to accumulated errors when composing multiple pairwise mappings.  **Data-free methods**, while avoiding the need for extra data, rely heavily on intrinsic model properties for alignment, making their performance sensitive to architectural choices and training dynamics.  **Linear mode connectivity**, a crucial assumption underlying many merging strategies, is not always guaranteed, especially in wider networks, reducing the effectiveness of linear interpolation.  Further, **activation mismatch** between models presents a hurdle, even after successful weight alignment.  **Generalization across diverse model architectures and datasets** remains a significant limitation.  Lastly, the **computational cost** associated with finding optimal permutations across multiple models grows considerably with increased model size and the number of models, a critical constraint for practical application.
