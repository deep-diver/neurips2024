(a) The traditional tokenizer algorithm that directly extracts vocabulary from data. (b) The framework of the LLM-enhanced tokenizer, iteratively refining vocabulary based on model feedback.

Panel (a) shows a traditional tokenizer's workflow, which directly creates a vocabulary from data using a subword algorithm. Panel (b) depicts the LLM-enhanced tokenizer which incorporates model feedback to iteratively refine its vocabulary during training. Panel (c) provides a comprehensive overview of ADAT's process; it shows the stages of initial vocabulary acquisition, LLM training, iterative loss evaluation, and the pruning process for vocabulary optimization based on loss and score functions.", "section": "3 Adaptive Tokenizers"}]
