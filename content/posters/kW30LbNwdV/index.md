### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks, and adversarial training (AT) is used to mitigate this issue. However, the resulting models often exhibit strong robustness for some classes ('easy' classes) and weak robustness for others ('hard' classes), a phenomenon known as robust fairness. Existing works attempted to solve this issue by re-weighting the training samples, ignoring the information embedded in the labels that guide the model training process. This paper introduces an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon.

The paper proposes Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD), a new method that addresses this issue.  ABSLD operates within the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, modifying how the 'teacher' model's soft labels are used to train the 'student' model. ABSLD selectively sharpens soft labels for hard classes and smoothes them for easy classes. This is achieved by assigning different temperatures to the KD process for different classes, effectively controlling the class-wise smoothness of soft labels. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both robustness and fairness.

> üîº This figure compares two approaches to achieving fairness in adversarial training.  The left side (a) shows sample-based fair adversarial training, where the model's bias is addressed by re-weighting training samples based on their contribution to fairness. Samples from hard classes (those the model struggles to classify correctly) are weighted more heavily. The right side (b) illustrates the proposed label-based approach. It focuses on modifying the soft labels (probability distributions over classes) rather than sample weights.  The smoothness of the soft labels is adjusted; harder classes receive sharper (less smooth) labels and easier classes receive smoother labels, influencing the model‚Äôs learning process and mitigating bias.

### In-depth insights


#### Anti-Bias Distillation
Anti-bias distillation, in the context of adversarial robustness, addresses the inherent fairness issue in existing training methods.  Standard adversarial training often results in models robust against attacks for certain classes (easy classes) but vulnerable to others (hard classes), leading to biased security. **Anti-bias distillation aims to mitigate this bias by manipulating the soft labels used during the knowledge distillation process.**  Instead of equally weighting all classes, it adjusts the "smoothness" of soft labels, providing sharper labels for hard classes and smoother ones for easy classes. This targeted approach ensures that the student model learns equally well from all classes, improving overall robustness while preventing the model from being unfairly vulnerable to specific classes. **This technique directly tackles the optimization objective function, impacting the learning process and achieving greater fairness without significantly sacrificing overall robustness.** It differs from sample-re-weighting strategies by focusing on label manipulation, offering a potentially more efficient and effective approach to enhance model fairness in adversarial settings. The key to this approach lies in adaptively adjusting the temperature of the soft labels for different classes, thereby influencing the learning intensity for each class.  **This adaptive temperature adjustment based on the student's error risk is crucial, ensuring that harder classes receive sufficient attention and are not ignored during training.**  The method allows for improved robustness and fairness metrics, especially focusing on the worst-performing classes, making it a valuable technique in the development of robust and fair deep learning models. 

#### Robust Fairness
The concept of "Robust Fairness" in machine learning addresses the critical issue of algorithmic bias, particularly within the context of adversarial attacks.  **Standard adversarial training methods often improve overall model robustness but may exacerbate existing biases**, leading to unfair outcomes for certain demographic groups.  Robust fairness seeks to mitigate this by **developing models that are both robust against adversarial examples and fair across different subgroups**. This necessitates moving beyond simple accuracy metrics and incorporating fairness-aware evaluations during model development and training.  **Key challenges include identifying and quantifying fairness, defining appropriate fairness metrics for specific applications, and developing efficient training strategies** that balance robustness and fairness without compromising accuracy.  Research in this area often explores techniques such as re-weighting samples, adjusting loss functions, or using fairness-aware regularization methods.  The long-term goal is to create models that are not only accurate and resilient to manipulation but also provide equitable outcomes for all users, regardless of their membership in a protected group.

#### Soft Label Impact
The concept of 'Soft Label Impact' in a research paper would likely explore how the use of soft labels, as opposed to hard labels (one-hot encodings), affects various aspects of model training and performance.  A key area would be **robustness**: soft labels, being probabilistic, might make the model more resilient to adversarial attacks or noisy data, leading to better generalization and decreased overfitting. Another crucial area would be **fairness**: the smoothing effect of soft labels might mitigate bias by reducing the emphasis on sharp class boundaries, potentially leading to more equitable treatment of different classes. The impact on **training efficiency** is also an important consideration, as soft labels can influence convergence speed and stability. Finally, the paper would likely explore the **interpretability** of models trained with soft labels, focusing on whether the inherent uncertainty represented by soft labels translates to better human understanding of the model's decision-making process.  The impact of different soft label generation methods and the sensitivity to temperature hyperparameters would also be investigated. **Theoretical analysis** supporting the empirical findings would likely involve information theory concepts and loss function analyses. Overall, a comprehensive study of 'Soft Label Impact' would reveal the multifaceted influence of soft labels on model behavior, providing valuable insights for improving machine learning model development.

#### ABSLD Framework
The ABSLD framework presents a novel approach to enhancing adversarial robustness and fairness in deep neural networks.  **It leverages knowledge distillation**, a technique where a smaller student network learns from a larger, more robust teacher network.  However, unlike traditional knowledge distillation, **ABSLD focuses on manipulating the smoothness of soft labels provided by the teacher**. By adaptively adjusting the temperature parameter in the knowledge distillation process for different classes, ABSLD aims to reduce the disparity in robustness between easy and hard classes.  **This adaptive temperature adjustment is crucial**, as it allows the model to learn more effectively from challenging samples without sacrificing overall performance.  **ABSLD's core innovation lies in its class-wise treatment of soft label smoothness**, addressing the root cause of adversarial robust fairness issues. Unlike other methods that focus on re-weighting samples or penalizing specific characteristics, ABSLD directly tackles the optimization process, leading to a model that is both robust and fair.

#### Future of Fairness
The "Future of Fairness" in AI necessitates a multi-pronged approach.  **Robustness and fairness are intertwined**, meaning improvements in one area should not compromise the other.  Future research must move beyond simple metrics and explore **contextual fairness**, adapting to diverse datasets and user groups.  **Explainability** will play a crucial role, allowing us to understand why AI systems make specific decisions and uncover hidden biases.   **Algorithmic transparency** and **auditable decision-making processes** are crucial for building trust and accountability.  Furthermore, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, ethicists, social scientists, and policymakers is vital to navigate the complex societal implications of fairness in AI.  Finally, **ongoing monitoring and evaluation** are essential to ensure that fairness remains a central consideration throughout the AI lifecycle, adapting to changing societal norms and emerging challenges.

The checkpoint is selected based on the best checkpoint of the highest mean value of all-class average robustness and the worst class robustness following [36].
