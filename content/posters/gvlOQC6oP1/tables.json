The table shows the performance of each method in terms of PCC (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) and RD (Relative Deviation), which are two metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of image copy detection. Higher PCC indicates better performance and lower RD also indicates better performance.  The PDF-Embedding method proposed in the paper is also included in the comparison.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "gvlOQC6oP1/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Our method demonstrates performance superiority over others.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the proposed PDF-Embedding method against several other methods for image copy detection. The methods compared include protocol-driven methods (Enlarging PCC, Reducing RD, Regression), non-PDF methods (One-hot Label, Label Smoothing), and the proposed method with different PDF implementations (Gaussian, Linear, Exponential).  The table shows the performance of each method in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Relative Deviation (RD), training time per iteration, inference time per image, and matching time per pair.  The results demonstrate that PDF-Embedding, particularly with the exponential PDF implementation, significantly outperforms the other methods.", "section": "5.3 The Effectiveness of PDF-Embedding"}, {"figure_path": "gvlOQC6oP1/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The performance of publicly available models and our PDF-Embedding on the D-Rep.

The performance is evaluated using two metrics: Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Relative Deviation (RD). Higher PCC values indicate better correlation between predicted and ground truth replication levels, while lower RD values indicate smaller deviations. The table helps demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDF-Embedding method compared to existing approaches.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
