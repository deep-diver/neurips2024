The comparisons are summarized in Table 2, from which we draw three observations as below: (1) Training on D-Rep with the protocol-driven method achieves good results on their specified protocol but performs bad for the other. While \u201cEnlarging PCC\u201d attains a commendable PCC, its RD of $40.1\\%$ indicates large deviation from the ground truth. \u201cReducing RD\u201d or \u201cReducing Deviation\u201d shows a relatively good RD $(28.1\\%)$ ; however, they exhibit small PCC values that indicate low linear consistency. (2) Our proposed PDF-Embedding surpasses these protocol-driven methods in both PCC and RD. Compared against \u201cEnlarging PCC\u201d, our method improves PCC by $1.6\\%$ and decreases RD by $16.1\\%$ .

The performance of the linear function, which lacks curvature, falls between that of the convex and concave functions. (2) Our method demonstrates robust performance across various distributions, reducing the challenge of selecting an optimal parameter. For example, when using the exponential function, the performance remains high when $A$ ranges from 0.6 to 1.8.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
