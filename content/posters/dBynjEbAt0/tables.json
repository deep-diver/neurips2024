Smallest errors are highlighted in bold.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the fixed-effect estimation accuracy for the proposed Bayesian models and two other state-of-the-art methods (warpMix and BRFC).  The results are based on the posterior mean and are broken down into different model specifications and data simulation scenarios. The model specifications are indicated by a code (Model 1-F, Model 1-B, Model 2-F, Model 2-B), where the number refers to the prior model used for the phase functions (Prior Model 1 or 2) and the letter refers to the type of basis functions used to model the fixed-effect function (Fourier or B-spline). The data simulation scenarios include simulations from the proposed model (PM1-F, PM2-F) and simulations from the warpMix model (warpMix-\u00b51, warpMix-\u00b52, warpMix-\u00b53). The lowest error for each scenario is highlighted in bold. The table helps to demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian models achieve superior or comparable performance in fixed-effect estimation compared to the other models.", "section": "Additional comparison of estimation accuracy"}]
