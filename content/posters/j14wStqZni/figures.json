It projects the private feature vectors onto the subspace spanning W\u2229span(Xpub) to get a lower dimensional representation. Then, it reparametrizes the loss function and applies a private subroutine in the lower dimensional space. Finally, it embeds the output back in Rd.", "section": "4.1 Efficient PA-DP learning of Convex Generalized Linear Models"}]
