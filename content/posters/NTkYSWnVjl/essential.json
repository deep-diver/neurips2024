{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in adversarial machine learning and computer vision.  It **introduces a novel, efficient black-box pixel attack (RFPAR)** that significantly outperforms existing methods in both image classification and object detection.  Its **focus on pixel-level attacks with limited queries** addresses a key challenge in the field, opening avenues for stronger defenses and more realistic attack models.  The **extension to object detection is particularly significant**, pushing the boundaries of current research.", "summary": "RFPAR: A novel reinforcement learning-based attack enhances black-box pixel attacks by minimizing randomness and patch dependency, achieving state-of-the-art results in both image classification and object detection.", "takeaways": ["RFPAR, a novel query-based black-box pixel attack, significantly outperforms existing methods in image classification.", "RFPAR successfully extends pixel-based black-box attacks to object detection, demonstrating comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer queries.", "RFPAR's 'Remember and Forget' mechanism mitigates randomness and patch dependency, improving attack efficiency and effectiveness."], "tldr": "Current query-based black-box attacks often rely on patches or randomness, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency, especially in object detection.  This paper addresses these limitations by proposing RFPAR.  \n\nRFPAR uses a reinforcement learning approach with 'Remember' and 'Forget' processes to strategically perturb a minimal number of pixels. This effectively reduces confidence scores in image classification and avoids object detection.  Experimental results on ImageNet and MS-COCO demonstrate that RFPAR outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates while significantly reducing the number of queries and the size of the perturbation. The extension to the larger Argoverse dataset further validates RFPAR's effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Korea Aerospace University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "NTkYSWnVjl/podcast.wav"}
