### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current query-based black-box attacks often rely on patches or randomness, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency, especially in object detection.  This paper addresses these limitations by proposing RFPAR.  



RFPAR uses a reinforcement learning approach with 'Remember' and 'Forget' processes to strategically perturb a minimal number of pixels. This effectively reduces confidence scores in image classification and avoids object detection.  Experimental results on ImageNet and MS-COCO demonstrate that RFPAR outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates while significantly reducing the number of queries and the size of the perturbation. The extension to the larger Argoverse dataset further validates RFPAR's effectiveness.

The first column represents images from ImageNet (image classification), the second column from MS-COCO (object detection), and the third column from Argoverse (object detection). Each row represents a different condition: the first row shows clean images, the second row shows adversarially perturbed images, and the third row shows the perturbation levels with the ratio of attacked pixels to total pixels. Labels in the images indicate detected objects or classifications, such as 'Cock' in ImageNet, '2 Objects' in MS-COCO, and '5 Objects' in Argoverse. In the adversarial row, labels are altered due to perturbations, resulting in misclassifications or undetected objects, such as 'Coil' instead of 'Cock' in ImageNet and no objects detected in MS-COCO and Argoverse. The perturbation row indicates the percentage of pixels attacked in the image. The percentages were 0.004% for ImageNet, 0.027% for MS-COCO, and 0.114% for Argoverse.

### In-depth insights


#### Amnesia-based Attacks
Amnesia-based attacks represent a significant advancement in adversarial machine learning, focusing on the manipulation of a limited number of pixels within an image to cause misclassification or object detection failure.  **The core principle is to leverage 'forgetting' mechanisms**, where the attack strategically perturbs pixels, forcing the model to disregard previously learned features and thus decreasing the model's accuracy.  This approach contrasts with traditional methods that rely on holistic image modifications, offering a more subtle and effective attack vector. **The amnesia-based strategy enhances query efficiency and reduces the number of queries required for successful attacks.**  Furthermore, its application extends beyond image classification to object detection, demonstrating its versatility and potential impact on diverse applications relying on image-based AI.  However, the robustness of these attacks to various defenses, as well as their real-world implications, requires further investigation.  **The subtle nature of amnesia-based attacks also presents a challenge for detection and mitigation**, necessitating the development of robust countermeasures to safeguard AI systems from malicious exploitation.

#### RFPAR Algorithm
The RFPAR algorithm, a novel query-based black-box pixel attack, is a two-stage process leveraging reinforcement learning. The **Remember** stage uses a one-step RL algorithm to iteratively perturb pixels, maximizing reward (reduction in confidence scores). The **Forget** stage resets the RL agent and memory, restarting the process with the best-performing perturbed image from the Remember stage. This cyclical process mitigates randomness inherent in previous methods and reduces query dependence.  **RFPAR's effectiveness** stems from its ability to efficiently target a limited number of pixels, significantly outperforming existing pixel attacks in image classification while demonstrating comparable results in object detection. **The algorithm's two-stage structure** is key to its efficiency and accuracy, as the iterative refinement process avoids unnecessary queries and improves targeted pixel selection. While further research may explore its limitations on diverse datasets or with varying model architectures, the results highlight RFPAR as a powerful tool for evaluating model robustness against adversarial attacks.

#### Object Detection
The research paper explores query-based black-box pixel attacks, focusing significantly on object detection.  The authors introduce RFPAR, a novel method leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance the effectiveness of such attacks. **RFPAR's core innovation is in its ability to target scattered pixels rather than relying on patches**, which is particularly relevant for object detection where localized perturbations are more likely to evade detection. The paper demonstrates **RFPAR's superior performance against existing state-of-the-art query-based attacks in terms of achieving comparable mAP reduction while requiring fewer queries**. This is particularly important for black-box settings where queries are limited.  **The method's application extends beyond typical ImageNet datasets to larger scale datasets like Argoverse**, further highlighting its potential and robustness. This work contributes to the understanding of vulnerabilities in object detection systems, and suggests promising directions for future research in both attack methods and defensive countermeasures.

#### Query Efficiency
Query efficiency in adversarial attacks focuses on minimizing the number of queries to a target model needed to generate a successful attack.  **Reducing queries is crucial for practical attacks**, as excessive queries can be easily detected or blocked, especially in black-box settings where model information is limited.  This paper's proposed RFPAR method addresses this by intelligently selecting pixels to perturb. **RFPAR uses a reinforcement learning approach to manage the trade-off between attack effectiveness and query count**.  The 'Remember and Forget' mechanism helps RFPAR focus the attack, improving efficiency compared to previous methods that heavily rely on randomness or extensive patch exploration.  **The reduction in queries demonstrates a significant improvement in stealth and practicality**, making it a valuable contribution to the field of adversarial attacks.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the efficiency of the Remember and Forget processes** within RFPAR is crucial. This might involve investigating more advanced RL algorithms or exploring alternative memory management strategies to reduce the number of queries required while maintaining attack effectiveness.  Another critical area is **extending RFPAR to a broader range of object detection models and datasets**.  Evaluating its performance against diverse architectures and in various real-world scenarios is necessary to assess its generalizability and robustness.  Furthermore, research should focus on **developing defenses against RFPAR**. This necessitates exploring novel training methods or architectural modifications that enhance the resilience of deep learning models to pixel-based attacks.  Finally, investigating the potential for **transfer learning in the context of RFPAR** could lead to more efficient attack strategies, reducing the computational cost and number of queries needed to generate effective adversarial examples.

> üîº This figure illustrates the workflow of the RFPAR attack, which consists of two main processes: Remember and Forget. The Remember process uses reinforcement learning to iteratively generate and refine adversarial images by maximizing rewards. The Forget process resets the model and memory, leveraging the best-performing adversarial image from the Remember process to start a new iteration. This cycle repeats until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

> Figure 2: The model architecture of RFPAR: the Remember and Forget process. During the Remember process, the RL model generates perturbed images and corresponding rewards. Memory compares these with previously stored values and retains only the highest reward and its associated image. Once the rewards converge to a certain value, the Forget process starts and resets the RL agent and memory, then reintroduces the perturbed images that gained the highest reward to the Remember process. The process continues until an adversarial image is generated or a predefined number of cycles is reached, at which point it terminates.
