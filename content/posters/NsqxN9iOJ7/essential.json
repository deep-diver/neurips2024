Applying image diffusion distillation techniques directly often results in unsatisfactory results.  There is a need for a method that efficiently distills knowledge from high-quality image data to improve both the speed and the visual quality of video diffusion models.\nThe proposed Motion Consistency Model (MCM) tackles this challenge via a single-stage approach that disentangles motion and appearance learning. This is achieved using two key techniques: disentangled motion distillation, which focuses on motion representation, and mixed trajectory distillation that mitigates training-inference discrepancies by using a mix of low- and high-quality trajectories. **Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video diffusion distillation**, producing high-quality videos with significantly fewer sampling steps. **The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MCM in enhancing both speed and quality of video generation**.", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "NsqxN9iOJ7/podcast.wav"}
