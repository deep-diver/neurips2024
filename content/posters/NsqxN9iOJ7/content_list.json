This affects the performance of both teacher and student video diffusion models. Our study aims to improve video diffusion distillation while improving frame appearance using abundant high-quality image data. We propose motion consistency model (MCM), a single-stage video diffusion distillation method that disentangles motion and appearance learning. Specifically, MCM includes a video consistency model that distills motion from the video teacher model, and an image discriminator that enhances frame appearance to match high-quality image data. This combination presents two challenges: (1) confilcting frame learning objectives, as video distillation learns from low-quality video frames while the image discriminator targets high-quality images; and (2) training-inference discrepancies due to the differing quality of video samples used during training and inference. To address these challenges, we introduce disentangled motion distillation and mixed trajectory distillation. The former applies the distillation objective solely to the motion representation, while the latter mitigates traininginference discrepancies by mixing distillation trajectories from both the low- and high-quality video domains. Extensive experiments show that our MCM achieves the state-of-the-art video diffusion distillation performance.

MCM accelerates and enhances video generation for creative applications. However, as a data-driven approach, our model is sensitive to the distribution and diversity of the training data, which influences model\u2019s ability to generate varied video frames, potentially limiting generalization ability.

Early methods mainly rely on generative adversarial networks (GANs) [58, 6, 67, 53], which struggled with scalability and generalization to out-of-distribution domains. Building on the recent success of image diffusion models [22, 45], several methods leverage diffusion models for video generation [21, 24, 9, 62, 19, 65]. This paper focuses on two popular text-to-video diffusion models: ModelScopeT2V [62] and AnimateDiff [19]. ModelScopeT2V [62] inserts spatio-temporal blocks into 2D backbones and trains the whole backbone end-to-end, ensuring adaptability to varying frame lengths with smooth motions. AnimateDiff [19] introduces a plug-and-play motion module that learns motion priors from real-world videos and can be applied to personalized image diffusion models for video generation. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Diffusion distillation. Training-free methods primarily focus on developing advanced ODE solvers to reduce the number of sampling steps [54, 37, 7, 36, 74]. Another approach employs smaller backbones [39, 15, 32] to improve structural efficiency. To further reduce the inference steps, progressive distillation [46, 41, 34, 35] is first proposed to distill the two or more steps into one. Consistency models [55, 38, 66, 61] generalize progressive distillation by mapping any point on the PF-ODE trajectory to the same origin. A parallel line of work [71, 48, 34, 35, 31] directly applies constraints on the model output by leveraging adversarial losses. However, these methods heavily rely on the quality of the training dataset, and low-quality datasets inevitably degrade the generation quality.

Unlike image generation, which beneftis from high-quality datasets [49], popular public video datasets [57, 70, 5] often exhibit lower frame quality, including issues like motion blur, low resolution, and watermarks. This discrepancy hinders the development of high-quality video generation in a single-stage, end-to-end manner. A straightforward way to improve frame quality is two-stage approach [9, 19, 61], which involves training an image backbone with a high-quality image dataset and then adding temporal layers for fine-tuning on video datasets Alternatively, some methods [29, 68] animate pre-trained image diffusion models with low-shot fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a single-stage, end-to-end method to address this problem, while simultaneously achieving few-step sampling with video diffusion distillation.
