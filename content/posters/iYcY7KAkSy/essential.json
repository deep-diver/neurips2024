Clock-driven synchronous chips demand shorter time steps for energy efficiency, reducing SNN performance, while event-driven asynchronous chips offer lower power but limit supported operations. Many recent SNN projects significantly improved performance but are incompatible with asynchronous hardware.\nThis paper introduces Spiking Token Mixer (STMixer), an architecture using only operations compatible with asynchronous hardware (convolutions, fully connected layers, residual paths). Experiments show STMixer matches Spiking Transformers' performance on synchronous hardware, even with very low time steps. This suggests STMixer can achieve similar performance with significantly reduced power consumption on both synchronous and asynchronous neuromorphic chips.", "affiliation": "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "iYcY7KAkSy/podcast.wav"}
