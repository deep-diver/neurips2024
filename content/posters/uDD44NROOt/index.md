### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline imitation learning (IL) faces the challenge of limited expert demonstrations, hindering effective policy learning.  Existing methods often struggle with overfitting or inadvertently learning from sub-optimal data. This necessitates gathering more expert data which is often difficult, expensive, or simply not feasible. 



The proposed method, SPRINQL, tackles this by incorporating both expert and sub-optimal demonstrations.  It uses inverse soft-Q learning with learned weights to prioritize expert data while still benefiting from the larger sub-optimal dataset.  SPRINQL's formulation as a convex optimization problem improves efficiency and avoids adversarial training. Empirical results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on offline IL benchmarks, demonstrating the value of utilizing readily available sub-optimal data to enhance the learning process.

### In-depth insights


#### Suboptimal IL
Suboptimal imitation learning (IL) tackles the challenge of learning from imperfect or less-than-ideal demonstrations.  **Unlike traditional IL which relies on perfect expert demonstrations,** suboptimal IL leverages data from various skill levels, including those significantly below expert performance. This approach is particularly relevant in real-world scenarios where obtaining many perfect expert demonstrations can be costly, time-consuming, or even impossible.  **The key advantage of suboptimal IL lies in its ability to significantly increase the amount of available training data**, potentially leading to improved generalization and robustness. However, it introduces new difficulties.  **Suboptimal data introduces noise and biases into the learning process,** potentially causing the learned agent to mimic undesirable behaviors. Effective suboptimal IL methods must carefully address these issues, often employing techniques like weighting schemes to prioritize better demonstrations or robust learning algorithms that are less susceptible to noise.  **The development of effective suboptimal IL algorithms is an active area of research** crucial for bridging the gap between idealized IL settings and the complexities of real-world applications.

#### SPRINQL Algo
The SPRINQL algorithm presents a novel approach to offline imitation learning by leveraging both expert and sub-optimal demonstrations.  **Its core innovation lies in formulating a convex optimization problem over the space of Q-functions**, which contrasts with the often non-convex nature of existing methods. This convexity is achieved through a combination of techniques: inverse soft-Q learning, which offers advantages in handling sequential decision-making; learned weights that prioritize alignment with expert demonstrations while incorporating sub-optimal data; and reward regularization to prevent overfitting to limited expert data.  The algorithm's theoretical properties are thoroughly examined, establishing a lower bound on the objective function and guaranteeing the uniqueness of the optimal solution.  Empirical evaluations demonstrate **state-of-the-art performance** on benchmark tasks, showcasing the efficacy of the SPRINQL algorithm in effectively learning optimal policies from diverse and limited demonstration data. The algorithm's ability to handle multiple levels of sub-optimal expertise further enhances its practicality and robustness in real-world scenarios.

#### Convex Offline IL
Offline imitation learning (IL) aims to train agents using pre-collected expert demonstrations without direct environment interaction.  A key challenge is the limited size and coverage of expert data, often leading to suboptimal performance or overfitting.  **Convex Offline IL** addresses this by formulating the IL problem as a convex optimization problem.  This approach offers several advantages:  guaranteed convergence to a unique solution, efficient algorithms, and avoidance of adversarial training often found in non-convex methods. **Convexity simplifies the optimization process, allowing for the effective utilization of sub-optimal demonstrations in addition to expert data.**  The learned policy can be expected to balance mimicking expert trajectories while accounting for the larger, potentially noisy, dataset of sub-optimal behavior.  **This framework provides both a theoretically sound and practically efficient solution to the challenges of offline IL**, paving the way for more robust and scalable imitation learning systems.

#### Reward Regularization
Reward regularization is a crucial technique in offline imitation learning, addressing the challenge of limited expert demonstrations.  By incorporating a regularization term, the algorithm biases the learned reward function towards expert-like behavior. **This prevents overfitting to suboptimal demonstrations**, which are often more abundant but less informative.  The regularization term typically penalizes deviations from a reference reward, often derived from expert demonstrations or a pre-defined reward structure.  **Careful design of the regularization term is essential**, balancing the influence of expert and sub-optimal data to effectively guide the learning process.  **Different approaches exist** for constructing the reference reward, including methods based on occupancy measures or preference rankings of expert and suboptimal trajectories. The choice of regularization technique significantly impacts the performance and generalization capabilities of the learned policy. A well-designed reward regularization scheme can lead to **significant improvements in the quality and efficiency of the imitated behavior**, bridging the gap between scarce expert data and abundant suboptimal demonstrations.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on offline imitation learning with suboptimal demonstrations could involve several key areas.  **Improving robustness to noise and distribution shift** in suboptimal data is crucial, possibly through more sophisticated weighting schemes or adversarial training methods.  Another important area is **developing theoretical guarantees** for the performance of SPRINQL under varying data conditions, specifically concerning the impact of sample sizes and data quality on the learned policies.  **Exploring more complex scenarios** with diverse levels of expertise or noisy demonstrations is essential to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. This includes experimenting with datasets where the ordering of expert levels is not strictly hierarchical or where the transition dynamics between expert levels is highly varied.  Finally, **investigating the efficiency and scalability of SPRINQL** for larger-scale problems and higher-dimensional state-action spaces is vital, perhaps through improved function approximation techniques or more efficient optimization algorithms.  This could involve carefully selecting appropriate neural network architectures or using more efficient convex optimization methods, potentially utilizing techniques from online convex optimization.
