It shows how the model learns to map from different noise levels (represented by the xT, Xt, Xt' variables) to the solution distribution (x0), given a problem instance (G). The model learns a function f\u03b8 that connects these noise levels to the solution.  The model is trained to minimize the difference among samples originating from varying generative trajectories and time steps relative to the optimal solution. This allows for high-quality solution generation with minimal steps, improving efficiency.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "xDrKZOZEOc/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Vannila consistency models are trained to map points on any trajectory to its origin.

Vanilla consistency models map points on any trajectory to its origin, while optimization consistency models ensure that all trajectories, conditioned on the problem instance G, consistently map to the same optimal solution.  This is achieved by minimizing the difference between the model's predictions for different noise levels and the optimal solution. The optimization consistency condition ensures that the model generates consistent solutions even from varying noise levels and trajectories, thus improving solution quality and efficiency.", "section": "4 Training-Stage Optimization Consistency Modeling"}, {"figure_path": "xDrKZOZEOc/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Effect of runtime to optimality drop for Fast T2T and LKH3 on TSP-100.", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between runtime and solution quality (optimality drop) for two algorithms: Fast T2T and LKH3, on the TSP-100 problem.
