Right: Experimental setup of a perceptual decision making task with varying prior and reward distribution (picture from [11]).", "description": "The figure is composed of two parts. The left part shows a graphical model illustrating the framework used to measure the probability of making an optimal decision, which is considered as the decision confidence. The model involves nodes representing states, actions, observations, and the optimality of the decision at each time step. The right part displays the experimental setup of a perceptual decision-making task, which is the empirical validation of the model. The setup includes stimulus presentation, feedback, and a leaderboard. The stimuli have varying prior probabilities and reward distributions to test the model's generalization ability.", "section": "3 Model"}]
