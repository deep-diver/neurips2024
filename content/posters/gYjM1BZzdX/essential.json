However, using gradient descent for optimization is slow due to extremely sparse gradients, affecting only a few coordinates.  This sparsity also hinders applications to large datasets and black-box autoencoders where gradients are unavailable. \nThis paper proposes using **diffeomorphic interpolation** to address this challenge.  The method smoothly interpolates sparse gradients, creating a dense vector field applicable to the entire dataset. This improved efficiency allows for optimization of much larger datasets and facilitates the application of topological priors to black-box autoencoders, enabling faster convergence and better interpretability of latent spaces. This significantly advances the field of topological optimization, making it feasible for much larger datasets and complex machine learning applications.", "affiliation": "DataShape", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "gYjM1BZzdX/podcast.wav"}
