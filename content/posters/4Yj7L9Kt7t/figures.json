(13).", "description": "The figure shows the decomposition of the regret in the adversarial regime before switching to Algorithm 1.  The regret is broken down into three parts: Part A represents the regret incurred before the last round due to pulling suboptimal actions, while Part B is the regret from the last round and is bounded by twice the width of the confidence interval. Part C combines the remaining regret terms related to the best-fixed action in hindsight, also bounded using the width of the confidence interval. The equation is used to derive high-probability regret guarantees before the algorithm switches to handle the adversarial setting.", "section": "Analysis Overview in the Adversarial Regime"}]
