Another line of works [36, 44, 17] directly train novel view generative models without depth-based warping. For example, GeoGPT [36] achieves novel view generation, by feed-forwarding an input view and a camera viewpoint to a transformer-based architecture.

We observe that directly applying the occlusion mask from depth-based warping to the Stable Diffusion Inpainting model leads to the generation of collapsed images. As suggested in the official code of LucidDreamer, increasing the occlusion mask size for occlusions below a certain threshold effectively prevents this collapse. However, this approach involves a trade-off, as it may further ignore pixels from the source view. Additionally, when using challenging camera trajectories (especially when moving the camera forward), artifacts still occur despite this mask filtering. To address this, we set the minimum occlusion size to $8\\times8$ and expand smaller occlusions to this size, considering that a resolution of latents in LDM [35] is 8 times lower than that of the images. We use inverse warping for the existing warping-and-inpainting method, which provides natural interpolation and reduces occlusion. In contrast, our method employs forward warping to facilitate the intervention of the generative prior.
