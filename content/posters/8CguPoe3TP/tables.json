It compares the average and standard deviation of the out-of-sample loss for three methods: unregularized linear regression, L1-regularized linear regression (LASSO), and the distributionally robust method proposed in the paper. The distributionally robust method shows comparable average performance to LASSO with significantly lower standard deviation, indicating greater robustness.", "section": "Real Data Applications"}, {"figure_path": "8CguPoe3TP/tables/tables_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison of average and standard deviation of the out-of-sample performance (out-of-sample expected squared loss) of the three employed methods for linear regression on the Liver Disorders dataset.", "description": "This table presents the results of a linear regression experiment on the Liver Disorders dataset.  It compares the average out-of-sample loss and standard deviation across three methods: unregularized linear regression, L1-regularized linear regression, and the distributionally robust method proposed in the paper.  The results demonstrate that the distributionally robust method offers both lower average error and lower variability in performance compared to the other two methods.", "section": "Real Data Applications"}]
