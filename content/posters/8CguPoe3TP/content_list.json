We established connections with standard regularization techniques, including Ridge and LASSO regression, and theoretical analysis revealed favorable finite-sample and asymptotic guarantees on the performance of the robust procedure. For practical implementation, we presented and examined tractable approximations of the criterion, which are amenable to gradient-based optimization. Finally, we applied our method to a variety of simulated and real datasets, offering insights into its practical robustness properties. Naturally, our work presents some limitations that give rise to interesting directions for future research. In particular, we note the need for a deeper examination of the model workings in terms of (i) its parameter configuration and (ii) its broader application to general learning tasks (e.g., when the loss function is adapted to accommodate deep learning architectures). Moreover, our method, as many others in the distributional robustness literature, is only suited to process homogeneously generated (e.g., iid or exchangeable) data, leaving room to explore extensions to more complex dependence structures.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
