Limiting the classifier-free guidance (CFG) to an interval improves both FID and FDDINOV2 significantly, without altering the model complexity. The sampling cost is a bit lower due to fewer guidance evaluations. This holds for a small (S) and large (XXL) variants of the state-of-the-art EDM2 model [23], as well as diffusion transformers [29]. The model complexity numbers are copied from the EDM2 paper.", "description": "This table presents quantitative results comparing the performance of different diffusion models on the ImageNet-512 dataset.  It shows the FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and FDDINOv2 scores for models using classifier-free guidance (CFG) and models with the proposed limited guidance interval method.  The table demonstrates that limiting guidance to a specific interval improves both metrics while maintaining or even reducing computational cost, and showing this improvement across different model sizes and architectures.", "section": "4 Results"}]
