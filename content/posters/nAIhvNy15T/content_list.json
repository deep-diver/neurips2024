This sampling chain typically contains dozens of steps, and in each step a little bit of the denoised result is blended into the noisy image. The sampling process first gravitates towards the mean of the training data, followed by the determination of image features in an approximate coarse-to-fine manner based on the remaining noise. This iterative process, where the image is formed little by little, offers considerable flexibility in terms of encouraging or discouraging certain kinds of behavior at each step.

For example, \u201cnudity\u201d might be a common negative prompt in text-based image generators. At every sampling step, the denoiser is executed twice: once for the positive and once for the negative prompt, and the positive result is then extrapolated further away from the negative one based on a weight parameter. This works remarkably well in practice. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) [18] builds on this general concept. It uses an unconditional model (no class information or text prompts) as a negative prompt, causing the result image to align more strongly with the conditioning signal. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "In practice, all large-scale image generators rely heavily on CFG. It allows a mathematically justified way of truncating the distribution of generated images [12, 18], basically trading variation for perceptually higher image quality. By convention, the same guidance weight is used in all sampling steps. We observe that this is sub-optimal because CFG behaves very differently on high, middle, and low noise levels. On high noise levels, it drastically reduces the variation in the results, basically leading them towards a handful of \u201ctemplate images\u201d per prompt. On middle levels, it causes the sampling to more decisively choose some set of features, leading to crisper and perceptually more pleasing results. On low levels, it is largely unnecessary. Similar observations have been made in the Stable Diffusion community [1, 2, 21], and Muse [10] and Masked DiT v2 [14] observe that making guidance weight noise level-dependent improves the results. In the context of prompt inversion, Mahajan et al. [27] notice that limiting the inversion to specific noise levels leads to improved result quality. However, these works do not quantify the effect on distribution metrics with the exception of Sadat et al. [36], whose \u201cdynamic CFG\u201d limits a linearly varying guidance weight to an interval of noise levels.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
