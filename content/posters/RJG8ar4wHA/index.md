### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many existing dynamic graph learning models struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, especially due to changes in temporal environments.  These models often fail to accurately infer and utilize environmental information, leading to poor performance on unseen data. This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on both environment inference and utilization. 

The proposed model, Environment-prompted Dynamic Graph Learning (EpoD), uses a novel self-prompted learning mechanism to infer unseen environment factors. Instead of relying on predefined environment scales, it learns environment representations directly from the data.  EpoD also incorporates a structural causal model with dynamic subgraphs, which act as mediating variables. These subgraphs effectively capture the impact of environment shifts on data correlations. Extensive experiments show that EpoD outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling temporal OOD generalization.

> This figure illustrates the architecture of the proposed Environment-prompted Dynamic Graph Learning (EpoD) model. The left panel shows the prediction process, where historical observations are input to a spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) backbone to obtain node embeddings. These embeddings are then processed by a cross-attention mechanism with prompts to generate prompt answers which help infer unseen environment variables. These variables are incorporated into the STGNN backbone along with the original input to predict future evolution. The right panel shows how node-centered dynamic subgraphs are extracted.  The asymmetry between node correlations is quantified using Kullback-Leibler divergence and then used to create dynamic subgraphs. These subgraphs effectively capture distribution shifts due to changes in the environment.

### In-depth insights


#### Env-Prompted DGL
Env-Prompted Dynamic Graph Learning (DGL) represents a novel approach to enhance the generalization capabilities of DGL models, particularly in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The core idea is to **incorporate environmental factors** into the learning process, enabling the model to better adapt to unseen environmental conditions. This is achieved through a two-pronged strategy: 1) **inferring underlying environment factors** using a self-prompted learning mechanism and 2) leveraging a **structural causal model with dynamic subgraphs** as mediating variables to capture the influence of environment shifts on the data distribution. The self-prompted learning mechanism avoids predefining environment scales, allowing for more robust and accurate inference of unseen environments. By incorporating inferred environmental variables into a causal model with dynamic subgraphs, the model gains enhanced adaptability to environmental changes, leading to improved OOD generalization. This approach offers a significant advancement by systematically addressing the issues of environment inference and utilization. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated across various real-world dynamic graph datasets, showcasing superior performance against baseline methods and strong interpretability.

#### Self-Prompted Learning
Self-prompted learning represents a significant advancement in tackling the challenge of unseen environments in dynamic graph learning.  **By sidestepping the limitations of predefined environment scales**, this approach leverages the power of prompt learning to infer environment representations directly from historical data.  This autonomous learning mechanism is particularly valuable when explicit environment labels are absent. The core idea is to guide the model to extract informative environment variables by using learnable prompt tokens, thus eliminating the need for human intervention in defining environment characteristics. **The interaction between prompts and the model's learned embeddings is crucial**,  allowing for a compact and nuanced representation of the environment's impact on the graph's evolution. This approach's strength lies in its ability to adapt to a wide range of environments without restrictive predefined scales, enhancing the model's generalizability and robustness. However,  **the success heavily hinges on designing effective prompt structures and an interactive squeezing mechanism**, which requires a careful consideration of spatio-temporal relationships within the dynamic graph.  Further exploration could investigate optimal prompt design strategies and the sensitivity of performance to different prompt architectures.

#### Dynamic Subgraph
The concept of 'Dynamic Subgraph' in the context of dynamic graph learning is crucial for capturing the evolving relationships between nodes over time.  **Static subgraph methods are insufficient** because they fail to adapt to the changing dependencies induced by shifting environments or other dynamic factors.  A dynamic subgraph approach acknowledges that the relationships between nodes are not static but change over time and these changes are often asymmetric.  **Node-centered subgraphs** are particularly beneficial as they reflect how each node's connectivity evolves uniquely, influenced by its changing interactions within the system.  The key is to **extract subgraphs that meaningfully reflect these changing relationships**, such as using node-centered approaches or other methods that capture asymmetric dependencies.  By incorporating the learned dynamic subgraphs into a causal model, one can better account for the influence of environment factors, improving the model's generalization ability and providing a more interpretable framework for understanding spatio-temporal dynamics. The effective capture of asymmetric correlations between nodes through dynamic subgraphs is key to understanding and modeling the evolution of dynamic graphs, thus addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization challenge.

#### Causal Interpretation
A causal interpretation of a model's behavior is crucial for understanding its decision-making process and ensuring reliable predictions, especially in complex domains.  **By framing the problem through a causal lens, we can disentangle direct and indirect effects of variables, revealing underlying mechanisms.**  This approach not only improves the model's transparency and interpretability but also enhances its robustness to distribution shifts and out-of-distribution generalization, as causal relationships are often more stable than purely statistical correlations.  In the context of dynamic systems, **a causal approach facilitates the identification of mediating variables that convey the influence of environment factors on system evolution**, which improves model's ability to adapt to changing conditions. This is particularly important in dynamic graph learning where environmental changes induce alterations in both node features and relationships. A causal interpretation helps to understand how these changes propagate and affect the overall prediction accuracy.  **By understanding the underlying causal structure, we can design more effective interventions to influence the system's behavior**, making it more controllable and predictable.  Furthermore, a causal perspective allows us to identify and account for confounding factors and spurious correlations, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable models.

#### OOD Generalization
Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a critical aspect of robust machine learning, is profoundly challenged in dynamic graph learning.  **Temporal environmental changes** are a primary source of distribution shifts, impacting model performance on unseen data.  Existing methods often struggle with environment inference and effective utilization, sometimes relying on pre-defined environment representations that may be unrealistic.  A promising direction involves inferring the underlying environment factors from data and leveraging this information to enhance model generalization.  **Prompt learning** emerges as a powerful tool to infer unseen environment representations directly from data, bypassing pre-defined codebooks.  **Causal modeling**, specifically incorporating dynamic subgraphs as mediating variables, offers a more robust and interpretable way to utilize inferred environmental factors, capturing how changes in environments affect spatio-temporal dependencies within the graph.  This approach emphasizes capturing the invariant structure of the graph evolution across various environmental conditions, rather than simply treating environment variables as additional features.  Thus, future research should focus on more sophisticated prompt learning techniques and causal modeling frameworks that address the complex challenges of OOD generalization in dynamic graph learning.
