Current methods often struggle with generalization, failing to perform well on unseen types of forgeries. This limitation arises from the focus on specific forgery artifacts, leaving models vulnerable to new, unseen manipulation techniques.  The lack of universally effective features further hinders the development of robust detection systems.\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces DiffusionFake, a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances the generalization capability of existing deepfake detectors. **DiffusionFake injects features extracted by a detector into a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model**. This process compels the model to reconstruct the source and target images used in creating the deepfake, forcing the detector to learn richer, more disentangled representations.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffusionFake significantly improves cross-domain generalization without requiring additional parameters**, showcasing its potential for creating more robust and generalizable deepfake detection systems.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "FNzpVTpNbN/podcast.wav"}
