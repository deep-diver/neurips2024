[{"figure_path": "opdiIAHfBr/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Affinity eigen-constraints improved brain score (R\u00b2: variance explained).", "description": "This table presents the results of an experiment evaluating the impact of affinity eigen-constraints on the brain score (R-squared), a measure of the variance explained in brain activity prediction.  The experiment used three different values for the eigen constraint (\u03bbeigen): 1.0, 0.1, and 0.  For each constraint value, the table shows the R-squared values obtained for three brain regions of interest (ROIs) - V1, V4, and EBA - along with an overall average across all ROIs.  The results suggest that including the eigen-constraints improves the brain activity prediction performance, with the best performance achieved at \u03bbeigen = 1.0.", "section": "2.3 Affinity Eigen-constraints as Regularization for Channel Align"}]
