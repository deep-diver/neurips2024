Specifically, leveraging importance sampling, we find a variance upper bound for estimators potentially applicable to any relevant counterfactual probability (Cor. 1), and then introduce an optimization objective (Eq. 8) amenable to sampling, transforming the problem into a conditional distribution learning problem. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that this approach can be combined with identifiable proxy SCMs to address practical problems. We also explore injecting Markov boundaries as prior knowledge and empirically validate effectiveness in several scenarios. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations i) The proposed method does not directly estimate counterfactuals through the available distribution but requires a partially specified SCM. This work explores its effectiveness in combination with identifiable proxy SCMs, which are still an active area of research; ii) It is important to emphasize that the \"general case\" mentioned in this paper does not cover all scenarios. For instance, our estimand, an $\\mathcal{L}_{3}$ expression $\\mathcal{Q}$ , requires the assumptions of finite submodels and approximability by a finite number of counterfactual probabilities; iii) Furthermore, the specific structures and tricks demonstrated in this paper (such as the injection of Markov boundaries) may not be applicable to SCMs with general parameter settings, which warrants further investigation.

Let $\\mathbf D_{j}\\,=\\,\\mathbf D\\cap\\mathbf Y_{i[\\mathbf x_{i}]}$ be a subset in some submodel of this Markov blanket. Obviously, since any proper subset of $\\mathbf{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{Y}_{i[\\mathbf{x}_{i}]})$ is not a Markov blanket in $\\mathbf{Y}_{i[\\mathbf{x}_{i}]}$ , $\\mathbf{D}_{j}$ is not a Markov blanket on $\\mathbf{Y}_{i[\\mathbf{x}_{i}]}$ .

By the faithfulness assumption, as $\\mathbf{S}_{j}$ is not independent of $U_{j}$ given $\\mathbf{D}_{j}$ , there still exists an unblocked path from $\\mathbf{S}_{j}$ to $U_{j}$ in the augmented graph of the twin SCM. Continuing with the condition on $\\mathbf{D}\\setminus\\mathbf{D}_{j}$ , we discuss all the paths $\\mathcal{P}$ from $\\mathbf{S}_{j}$ to $U_{j}$ . For an intermediate node of a collider on a path $p\\in\\mathcal{P}$ , since it is unblocked, its descendants must be conditioned, thus continuing to condition on $\\mathbf{D}\\setminus\\mathbf{D}_{j}$ does not affect the colliders.

If a path consists solely of colliders, then, since the intermediate node are given, the path remains unblocked, contradicting the assumption. This implies that on every path, there exists at least one non-collider intermediate node, denoted this set by $\\mathbf{R}$ . Since each path has at least one non-collider intermediate node, given $\\mathbf{R}$ , all paths between $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $U_{j}$ are blocked.

We need to prove that the paths that pass through $\\mathbf{R}^{c}$ are also blocked given $\\mathbf{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{\\bar{Y}_{x}})\\setminus Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ . Taking any $R\\in{\\bf R}^{c}$ , for any path $p$ between $R$ and $U_{j}$ , if $p$ does not pass through $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ , then $p$ is blocked given $\\mathbf{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{x}})\\setminus Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ , which means that any path from $\\mathbf{Y}_{*}$ passing through $R$ and then through $p$ to reach $U_{j}$ is also blocked by $\\mathbf{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{x}})\\setminus Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ .

Therefore, any path involving $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ is blocked by $\\mathbf{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{x}})\\setminus Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ , which means that any path from $U_{j}$ to $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ is also blocked. For colliders on ancestors of $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ , not conditioning on $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ adds blocking to the paths, not removing any existing blocks; for $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ being a non-collider, any path involving $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ is blocked by $\\mathbf{B}_{j}(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{x}})\\setminus Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ , thus remaining blocked even if $Y_{\\mathbf{x}}$ is not conditioned on.

For GMM, $h$ primarily outputs each component\u2019s mean, diagonal matrix, and anti-diagonal matrix. Here, we apply the mask ${\\bf m}_{i}$ only to the mean corresponding to the $i$ -th exogenous variable in each component, ensuring that if the counterfactual variable is not on the Markov boundary, the inference of the mean is independent of it.   \n2. For Autoregressive models (including MAF, NSF, NCSF, UNF, and SOSPF), each layer transformation follows an autoregressive sequence, where all previous layers\u2019 hidden encodings may influence the subsequent layer. Consequently, each $U_{i}$ \u2019s hidden encoding appears in each layer. Therefore, we only need to directly apply the mask to the inference of hidden encodings, ensuring that the inferred next layer hidden encodings are only relevant to the counterfactual variables when they are in the Markov boundary.   \n3. For Coupling models (including NICE), each layer transformation involves only a subset of hidden encodings from the previous layer; hence, each layer\u2019s output only corresponds to some $U_{i}$ . Thus, we create masks only for the $U_{i}$ that serve as the output for each layer transformation, ensuring that the inferred hidden encodings are only relevant to the counterfactual variables in the Markov boundary.   \nOf course, the above initial design will raise some issues in practice:   \n1. There are some inevitable discrepancies between theory and practice, which we have summarized in App. D.3.   \n2. Another issue worth discussing is how to handle the counterfactual Markov boundaries in submodels. In perfect interventions, all connections between intervened variables and their parent variables are cut (All Cut), which is also a way to represent causal graphs in submodels. However, theoretically, directly cutting connections would result in intervened variables never participating in the conditional reasoning of their parent exogenous variables. Hence, we have also devised two relaxed and compromised methods: one is to retain all connections (No Cut), pretending that the submodel has not been intervened upon, thus not reflecting the intervention through the mask of the Markov boundary but instead relying on the intervention information included in the conditional encoding; the second is to only retain connections with parent exogenous variables (Endo. Cut), while relationships between endogenous variables are still cut.   \n3. As discussed in App. C.7, the introduction of the Markov boundary theoretically increases the model\u2019s focus on specific variables. However, this comes at the cost of expressiveness, especially in models with a larger number of parameters. Therefore, in the ablation experiments, we use a hidden layer width of 256 for NICE and SOSPF, while for GMM and MAF, the hidden layer width is set to 64. This does not affect the fairness of the ablation, as the goal is to compare the performance difference with and without the Markov boundary. Under the same hidden layer width, the presence of a Markov boundary actually means fewer neurons are involved in reasoning.   \nFig. 12 and Fig. 13 respectively illustrate the effects of Markov boundary masks on ESP and FR   \nunder different SCMs and density estimation models, where error bars and outliers are computed   \nbased on the quartile algorithm. The first phenomenon that can be observed is that introducing   \nMarkov boundary masks in Markovian SCMs (SIMPSON-NLIN, LARGEBD-NLIN, TRIANGLE  \nNLIN) results in significant performance improvement compared to not introducing them.

For injection of the Markov boundary, we also introduce the faithfulness assumption, which assists us in proving theorems and providing fast algorithms.

Additionally, modifications to autoregressive and coupling models do not fully align with the ideal effect. In fact, due to potential interactions within the hidden encodings of autoregressive and coupling models, even if each layer adheres to the Markov boundary dependencies, the aggregation of multiple layers may violate these dependencies.

Potential sensitivity to the specific forms of SCM in practice. With respect to the parameter form of the SCM, although we impose no theoretical constraints on the form of SCM, experiments indicate that in some settings the form of SCM still significantly influences outcomes. For example, combinatorial experiments and ablation studies reveal unexpected scenarios, particularly with the combinations of long-chain SCMs (CHAIN-LIN-4, CHAIN-LIN-5, LARGEBD-NLIN). As the causal chain lengthens, the performance of these density estimation models gradually weakens, suggesting that long causal chains complicate counterfactual inference. This phenomenon indicates that the form of SCM in practice affects the specific effectiveness of our methods, highlighting the necessity of selecting appropriate density estimation models and making corresponding adjustments.
