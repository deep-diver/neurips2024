Learning to generate neural networks has long been a compelling area of research. Since the introduction of Hypernetworks [10] and the subsequent extensions [3], several studies have explored neural network weight prediction. Hypertransformer [32] utilizes Transformers to generate weights for each layer of convolutional neural networks (CNN) using task samples for supervised and semi-supervised learning. Additionally, previous work [21] employs self-supervised learning to learn hyper representations of neural network weights. In the context of using diffusion models for parameter generation, G.pt [17] trains a diffusion transformer to generate parameters conditioned on learning metrics such as test losses and prediction errors, enabling the optimization of unseen parameters with a single update. Similarly, p-diff [25] propose a diffusion-based method to generate the last two normalization layers without any conditions for classification tasks. In contrast to these prior works, our focus is on policy learning problems. We develop a latent diffusion parameter generator that is more generalizable and scalable, based on agents\u2019 behaviors as prompts. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Learning to Learn for Policy Learning. When discussing learning to learn in policy learning, the concept of meta-learning [7] has been widely explored. The goal of meta-RL [7, 6, 9, 15] is to learn a policy that can adapt to any new task from a given task distribution. During the meta-training or meta-testing process, prior meta-RL methods require rewards as supervision for policy adaptation. Meta-imitation learning [8, 5, 27] addresses a similar problem but assumes the availability of expert demonstrations. Diffusion models have also been used in meta-learning. Metadiff [30] models the gradient descent process for task-specific adaptation as a diffusion process to propose a diffusionbased meta-learning method. Our work departs from these learning-to-learn works. Instead, we shift the focus away from data distributions across tasks and simply leverage behavior embeddings as conditional inputs for policy synthesis in the parameter space.

Targeting the generation of policies in high-dimensional parameter spaces, we employ an autoencoder to encode and reconstruct parameters, incorporating a contrastive loss to learn efficient behavior embeddings. By prompting with these behavior embeddings, our policy generator can effectively produce diverse and well-performing policies. Extensive empirical results across various domains demonstrate the versatility of our approach in multi-task settings, the generalization ability on unseen tasks, and the resilience to environmental randomness.

It would also be interesting to apply our proposed generation framework to generate other structures, further facilitating exploration in policy learning within the parameter space.
