Latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), while effective, suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper investigates the statistical and computational limits of DiTs, assuming data lies in a low-dimensional linear subspace.  It examines the approximation error of using transformers for DiTs and analyzes the sample complexity for distribution recovery. \nThe researchers derive an approximation error bound for the DiTs score network and show its sub-linear dependence on latent dimension. They also provide sample complexity bounds and demonstrate convergence towards the original distribution. Computationally, they characterize the hardness of DiTs inference and training by establishing provably efficient criteria, demonstrating the possibility of almost-linear time algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of latent DiTs to overcome high-dimensionality issues by leveraging their inherent low-rank structure and efficient algorithmic design.", "affiliation": "Northwestern University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "cV2LKBdlz4/podcast.wav"}
