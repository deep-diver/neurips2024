The nodes represent variables, with 'a' representing an exogenous variable for initialization, 'v' representing exogenous variables for model parameters, 'Io' being the initial infection proportion, 'ut' are the exogenous random variables influencing the transition of states at each time step, 'xt' representing the state of the agents at each time step, and '\u03b8t' representing the model parameters at each time step. The arrows indicate the direction of causal influence.  The DAG visualizes the causal structure of the model, which is crucial for understanding interventions and their effects.", "section": "2.2 Complex simulators as structural causal models"}, {"figure_path": "UtTjgMDTFO/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The directed acyclic graph induced by the structural causal model for the spatial SIRS agent-based model for T = 3 time steps.", "description": "This figure shows the directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships between variables in a spatial SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) agent-based model, a common model in epidemiology.  The nodes represent variables, and the edges represent causal influences. Variables include initial infection rate (I<sub>0</sub>), exogenous variables (U<sub>0</sub>, U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>, a, v), and endogenous variables (X<sub>0</sub>, X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>, \u03b8<sub>1</sub>, \u03b8<sub>2</sub>, \u03b8<sub>3</sub>).

A lockdown is imposed at the dashed vertical line. Solid (resp. dot-dash) lines show trajectories under (resp. without) the lockdown. The transmission-inhibiting effect of the lockdown is vastly underestimated in the observationally trained surrogate, while the interventionally trained surrogate accurately predicts a reduction in disease transmission.", "description": "This figure compares the trajectories of the ABM and the LODE-RNN surrogate model under an intervention (lockdown) to illustrate the importance of interventional consistency in training surrogate models.
