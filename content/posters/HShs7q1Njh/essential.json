This often restricts the use of probabilistic models to specialists due to the expertise needed for proper integration.  This paper aims to overcome these limitations.\nThis research introduces LLM Processes, a regression model that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process numerical data and generate probabilistic predictions, guided by user-provided natural language descriptions. The work demonstrates effective prompting techniques for eliciting coherent predictive distributions from LLMs, showcasing enhanced regression performance. Moreover, the study highlights how text significantly boosts predictive accuracy and reflects qualitative aspects quantitatively, paving the way for more advanced, context-aware AI systems.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "HShs7q1Njh/podcast.wav"}
