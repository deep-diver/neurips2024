A black-box root-finding method is used to determine the model function's equilibrium state.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core concept of a Quantum Deep Equilibrium Model (QDEQ).  The input data is fed into a root-finding algorithm (like Newton's method or Broyden's method) that iteratively refines an internal state 'z' until it converges to a fixed point. This fixed point is then used to compute the model's output. The root-finding process implicitly represents an infinitely deep network,  while actually using significantly less computational resources than training an explicit deep network. The core function 'fo' is a quantum model function, computed by a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC), which takes the input 'x' and the internal state 'z' as parameters to create a quantum state. A measurement on this quantum state, guided by a Hermitian operator 'M', yields the output of the quantum model function.", "section": "2.3 A Quantum Deep Equilibrium Model"}, {"figure_path": "CWhwKb0Q4k/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Circuit used for classification with up to 4 classes, following Wang et al.
