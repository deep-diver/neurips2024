It shows an example persona (Alice is a guitarist), two queries (about Alice's job and whether she loves her job), and several responses.  The APC framework categorizes persona statements as either 'active' (relevant to the query) or 'passive' (irrelevant to the query) constraints. Active constraints require the response to be entailed by the statement, while passive constraints only prohibit contradictions. The figure demonstrates how each response is evaluated against the persona statements, showing whether the response satisfies or violates the active and passive constraints, mirroring how a human would assess faithfulness.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "bzPmjmiaz8/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An overview of different PRP methods.", "description": "This figure illustrates four different persona-driven role-playing (PRP) methods: Long-context Memory (LCM), Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), Experience Uploading (EU), and APC Score-based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Each response is evaluated regarding its faithfulness to Alice's persona based on whether it entails relevant statements and avoids contradicting irrelevant statements. This illustrates the core idea behind the APC method: separating persona statements into \"active\" (relevant to the query) and \"passive\" (irrelevant) constraints, ensuring responses are entailed by active constraints and don't contradict passive ones.
