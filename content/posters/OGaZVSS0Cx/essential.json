Existing mini-batch methods for standard k-means don't directly translate due to the complexities introduced by kernel operations in feature space.  This necessitates the development of new algorithms tailored for efficient mini-batch processing within the kernel framework.\nThis research introduces the first mini-batch kernel k-means algorithm.  The proposed algorithm leverages a recursive distance update rule to efficiently compute distances, achieving O(n(b+k)) time complexity per iteration compared to O(n\u00b2) for the full-batch method (n being dataset size, b batch size, k cluster count).  The algorithm includes an early stopping criterion and is theoretically proven to terminate within O(\u03b3\u00b2/\u03b5) iterations (under specific conditions) while maintaining solution quality comparable to the full-batch version.  Experiments confirm the speed improvement without sacrificing accuracy.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "OGaZVSS0Cx/podcast.wav"}
