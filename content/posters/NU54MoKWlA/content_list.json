It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer. We first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object\u2019s geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object\u2019s shapes with pose variations.

For 3D data, the scale has been rapidly increasing, as exemplified by ObjaverseXL [10]. However, it is still far from sufficient to cover all possible 3D shapes, particularly deformable, non-rigid 3D shapes such as humans, animals, and characters. The challenge with deformable 3D shapes is especially pronounced due to the diversity in both the identities and poses of the objects.

For instance, when we have a variety of poses of a bear (Fig. 1 left, first row), our objective is to learn the space of poses without entangling them with the geometric characteristics of the bears. Also, we aim to enable a sample from this space to be applied to a new object, such as a bull, to generate a new shape (Fig. 1 left, second row). We believe that such a technique, effectively separating pose from the object\u2019s identity and enabling the transfer of poses to other identities, can significantly reduce the need for collecting large-scale datasets covering the diversity of both object identities and poses. This approach can even enable creating variations of a new creature without having seen any possible poses of that specific object.

Transferability: The encoded pose information should be applicable to new target objects. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "As a representation that meets the aforementioned criteria, we propose an autoencoding framework and a latent diffusion model with three core components. Firstly, we design a pose extractor and a pose applier to encode an implicit deformation field with a keypoint-based hybrid representation, comprising 100 keypoints in the space, each associated with a latent feature. Learning the deformation field enables disentangling the pose information from the object\u2019s identity, while the keypoint-based representation compactly encodes it and makes it transferable to other objects. However, simply learning the deformation as a new position of the vertex is not sufficient to properly adapt the source object\u2019s pose information to others. Hence, secondly, we propose predicting an intrinsic property of the deformed mesh, Jacobian fields [54, 26, 41, 2], which can successfully apply the pose while preserving the identity of the target shape. To better preserve the target\u2019s identity while applying the pose variation from the source, thirdly, we propose a per-identity refinement step that fine-tunes the decoder in a self-supervised way to adapt to the variations of target shapes, with poses transferred from the source object.

Another line of work utilizes handcrafted skeletons, which facilitate pose transfer via motion retargeting [14]. This approach has been extended by incorporating physical constraints [9, 22, 43, 3] or generalizing the framework to arbitrary objects [50, 33]. Several learning-based methods [11, 45, 20, 25, 46] have also been proposed to predict joint transformations involved in forward kinematics from examples. Recently, Chen et al. [8] proposed a framework that does not require skeletons during test time by predicting keypoints at joints. The method is trained to predict both relative transformations between corresponding keypoints in two distinct kinematic trees and skinning weights. However, the tasks of rigging and skinning are laborintensive, and different characters and creatures often require distinct rigs with varying topologies. Liao et al. [24] notably presented a representation that comprises character-agnostic deformation parts and a semi-supervised network predicting skinning weights that link each vertex to these deformation parts, although its performance hinges on accurate skinning weight prediction.

To bypass the need for correspondence or parameterization supervision, learning-based approaches [12, 53, 47, 57, 7, 2, 24, 48, 36, 37] explore alternative parameterizations learned from exemplars. Yifan et al. [53] propose to predict source and target cages and their offsets simultaneously, although their method still requires manual landmark annotations. Gao et al. [12] introduce a VAE-GAN framework that takes unpaired source and target shape sets, each containing its own set of pose variations. The network is trained without direct pose-wise correspondences between samples from these sets, instead enforcing cycle consistency between latent representations. Although this work relaxes the requirement for correspondence supervision, it still requires pose variations for both the source and target identities and individual training for each new source-target pair. Numerous works [47, 7, 57, 2] lift the requirement for gathering variations of target shapes by disentangling identities from poses, enforcing cycle consistency [57], or adapting conditional normalization layers [47] from image style transfer [30]. Notably, Aigerman et al. [2] train a network that regresses Jacobian fields from SMPL [28] pose parameters. The vertex coordinates are computed by solving Poisson\u2019s equation [54], effectively preserving the shapes\u2019 local details. Wang et al. [48] also train a neural implicit function and retrieve a shape latent from a template mesh of an unseen identity via autodecoding [29]. This method models local deformations through a coordinate-based network that learns continuous deformation fields. However, such methods struggle to generalize to unseen identities due to their reliance on global latent embeddings encoding shapes. We propose a representation that not only disentangles poses from identities but also allows for implicit queries using the surface points, thereby improving generalization to new identities.

In our experiments, we consider animal and human shapes that are widely used in various applications. For the animal shapes, we utilize animation sequences from the DeformingThings4D-Animals dataset [23]. Specifically, we extract 300 meshes from the animation sequences of each of 9 different animal identities, spanning diverse species such as bears, rabbits, dogs, and moose. For humanoids, we use SMPL [28, 31], which facilitates easy generation of synthetic data for both training and testing. We sample 300 random pose parameters from VPoser [31] to generate variations of an unclothed human figure using the default body shape parameters, which are used to train our networks. For testing, we keep the pose parameters constant and sample 40 different body shapes from the parametric space covered by the unit Gaussian. This produces 40 different identities, each in 300 poses. The generated meshes serve as the ground truth for pose transfer. To assess the generalization capability to unusual identities that deviate significantly from the default body shape, we increase the standard deviation to 2.5 when sampling SMPL body parameters for 30 of the 40 identities. Additionally, we collect 9 stylized character meshes from the Mixamo dataset [1] to test the generalizability of different methods. For diffusion model training, the extracted keypoints and their associated features from the given set of source meshes are used as the training data for our cascaded diffusion model, which is trained separately for each identity.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
