The shaded part is one layer of Topology-Invariant Pooling.", "description": "This figure illustrates the proposed Topology-Invariant Pooling (TIP) method.  The process begins with an input graph represented by its adjacency matrix A<sup>(0)</sup> and node features X<sup>(0)</sup>.  Standard graph neural network (GNN) layers process the graph before it is passed to a graph pooling layer. The pooling layer generates a coarsened graph, represented by A<sup>(l-1)</sup> and X<sup>(l-1)</sup>. This coarsened graph undergoes several steps: self-loops are added, a resampling process based on Equation (5) is applied to generate A\u2019<sup>(l)</sup>, and persistent homology is calculated to produce a persistence diagram (PD).  Based on Equation (6), a reweighting process takes place, integrating topological information into A<sup>(l)</sup>, thus obtaining (A<sup>(l)</sup>, X<sup>(l)</sup>).  The topological loss function L<sub>topo</sub> compares the original graph's persistence diagram to the coarsened graph's, guiding the topology-preserving process.
