Further, our method demonstrates more significant improvements by augmenting the three dense pooling methods on the ENZYMES dataset. One possible explanation for the observed phenomenon is that the coarsened graphs generated by our methods bear a striking resemblance to numerous frequent subgraphs present in this dataset [10]. Such substructures may serve as indicators of unique characteristics within the graph, rendering them valuable for subsequent tasks.

The training objective curve and the Wasserstein distance curve are presented in Figure 5, both based on the ENZYMES dataset and a fixed flitration (the same as in Section 5.2).

Additionally, even when the objective value converges, DiffPool-TIP-NL still exhibits changing topology, whereas DiffPool-TIP maintains a stable topology, possibly benefiting from the stability of PH [41]. This also suggests that multiple suboptimal topologies may contribute equally to the objective.

In practice we set $f_{m a x}$ plus a constant as infinity of destruction time. Therefore, $\\tilde{\\mathcal{D}}_{1}$ consists of as many tuples as the number of edges $m$ .
