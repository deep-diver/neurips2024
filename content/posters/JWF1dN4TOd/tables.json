The metrics used for comparison include Nash Gap (NG), Violation of Allocation (VoA), Violation of Price (VoP), and GPU time.  The experiment used a market with 1,048,576 buyers and 10 goods.  The GPU time for MarketFCNet reflects both training and testing time.", "section": "6.2 Experiment Results"}]
