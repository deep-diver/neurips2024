To evaluate the progressive training strategy, we train the NN with the sum of all loss functions at three scales, which resulting in a 3dB loss. This clearly indicates that progressive training is critical for effectively utilizing the multi-scale scheme. The reason is that the loss function at the coarser scale emphasizes lower frequencies since the image at coarser scale retains low but loses high frequencies. Thus, a NN trained on the sum of loss functions across 3 scales focuses more on low frequencies than one trained only at the finest scale, which fits both low and high frequencies. Therefore, a scale-progressive training scheme is more effective than a joint multi-scale loss.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
