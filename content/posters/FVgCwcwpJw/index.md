### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current instruction-following AI agents face challenges in sample efficiency and generalizability due to the high cost and complexity of obtaining expert demonstrations or using LLMs directly for action prediction. This paper addresses these issues by introducing Language Feedback Models (LFMs).  **LFMs improve sample efficiency by learning from LLM feedback on a small number of trajectories, avoiding costly online LLM queries.**



The proposed LFMs method trains a feedback model to identify productive actions based on LLM-provided feedback for each step.   **This model then guides imitation learning, enabling efficient policy improvement by directly imitating the productive actions.**  Experiments on multiple instruction-following benchmarks showcase that LFMs significantly outperform baselines in task completion rates while generalizing well to unseen environments.  **The human-interpretable nature of the LFM feedback further enhances the system's transparency and usability.**

> üîº This figure illustrates the overall process of policy improvement using Language Feedback Models (LFMs). It consists of three parts: (a) Training an LFM using feedback from a Large Language Model (LLM): An initial policy is used to generate rollouts in an environment, these rollouts are then verbalized into language descriptions, and these descriptions are given to the LLM to provide feedback on which actions were productive. This feedback is used to train the LFM. (b) Using the trained LFM to identify desirable behavior: Given an instruction, the base policy generates rollouts and the LFM predicts which actions are productive. These productive actions are used to update the base policy. (c) An example of desirable behavior identified by the LFM: This example shows a kitchen environment where the task is to clean some lettuce and put them in the fridge. The LFM identifies the actions of cleaning the lettuce and putting it in the fridge as productive behavior.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Feedback Distillation
LLM Feedback Distillation is a crucial technique for making large language models (LLMs) more efficient and practical for real-world applications.  The core idea is to **capture the valuable knowledge** embedded within often expensive and slow LLM feedback and compress it into a smaller, faster, and more easily deployable model.  This distilled knowledge can then be used to guide other machine learning models, significantly reducing the computational cost and latency associated with directly querying the LLM.  **Key challenges** in LLM feedback distillation include effectively representing the high-dimensional feedback from LLMs, designing suitable distillation architectures to capture both accuracy and efficiency, and handling the potential noise and inconsistencies inherent in LLM outputs.  **Successful distillation** requires a careful balance between compression, preserving the quality of feedback and the target application's requirements.  The ultimate goal is to retain the decision-making capabilities of the LLM while reducing the overall resource consumption and improving model accessibility.

#### LFMs for Policy Boost
The concept of "LFMs for Policy Boost" presents a compelling approach to enhance the performance of policies in complex, instruction-following tasks.  **Language Feedback Models (LFMs)** offer a sample-efficient and cost-effective method to improve policies by leveraging the knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs).  Instead of relying on expensive, on-line LLM interactions during policy learning, LFMs distill this knowledge into a compact model that can identify desirable behaviors from policy rollouts. **This offline training significantly reduces computational costs.** The subsequent imitation learning based on LFM-identified desirable behaviors leads to substantial performance gains. Furthermore, the ability of LFMs to generalize to unseen environments through one round of adaptation is a key advantage. **The human-interpretable feedback provided by LFMs** is another valuable contribution, fostering increased transparency and allowing for human verification.  However, **challenges remain in handling potentially inaccurate feedback from LLMs and ensuring robust generalization across diverse environments.** Future research could explore more sophisticated ways to integrate LLM feedback and address the issue of LLM hallucination to further improve LFM's effectiveness and reliability.

#### Generalization & Adaption
The capacity of a model to generalize to unseen data and adapt to new environments is critical. **Generalization** assesses a model's ability to perform well on data outside its training set, reflecting its learned knowledge's robustness and breadth.  **Adaptation**, on the other hand, focuses on a model's capacity to quickly adjust and fine-tune its performance for specific, novel environments or tasks.  Effective generalization and adaptation are intertwined. A model that generalizes well might still require adaptation to fully optimize performance in a new context.  Conversely, a highly adaptable model might fail to generalize if its adaptations aren't grounded in robust foundational knowledge.  In research, assessing both aspects is crucial for creating truly versatile and robust AI systems. The interplay between these two concepts is key; **successful generalization reduces the need for extensive adaptation**, while **strong adaptation capabilities enhance a model's robustness despite limitations in initial generalization**.  Therefore, a balanced approach focusing on both aspects is paramount.

#### Interpretable Feedback
The concept of "Interpretable Feedback" in the context of AI instruction following is crucial for building trust and facilitating human oversight.  **Providing not just whether an action is productive, but *why*, greatly enhances the value of the feedback**. This allows humans to verify the AI's reasoning, identify potential biases, and correct errors more effectively.  **Human-interpretable feedback allows for a more collaborative human-AI partnership**, where humans can guide the AI's learning process instead of simply relying on opaque automated feedback.  A key benefit is the ability to identify and correct potentially harmful or undesired behavior.  **By examining the explanations for both positive and negative feedback, developers can improve their models and ensure that they align with human values and expectations.**  This focus on transparency and explainability is essential for responsible AI development, ensuring that AI systems are not only effective but also ethically sound.

#### Limitations & Future
This research makes valuable contributions to policy improvement in instruction following, but several limitations warrant attention.  **The reliance on a robust verbalization procedure** to translate visual observations into language descriptions is crucial; however, this process is inherently complex and prone to errors, especially in richly detailed environments. The accuracy of language models themselves is another factor; their propensity for hallucination or inaccurate feedback could significantly impact the effectiveness of the proposed method.  Furthermore, the computational cost of training and deploying the resulting models, particularly large language models, **presents a scalability challenge**.  Future work could focus on addressing these limitations. This includes exploring more robust verbalization methods, investigating techniques for mitigating errors in LLM feedback, and developing more efficient, lightweight models that maintain performance.  **Improving the generalizability of the approach to new and unseen environments** is crucial for broader real-world applications. The exploration of more diverse benchmarks, the application to more complex tasks, and methods to quantify uncertainty in predictions are all vital research avenues.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of policy improvement using Language Feedback Models (LFMs). It starts with an initial policy that is used to generate rollouts in a given environment.  These rollouts are then verbalized into language descriptions.  An LLM provides feedback on which actions in the trajectories were productive in achieving the task, as indicated by the instructions. This feedback is used to train a Language Feedback Model (LFM).  The LFM is then used to identify productive actions from new rollouts of the base policy. Finally, imitation learning is performed using these productive actions to create an improved policy. The figure shows the overall process with subfigures detailing the training of the LFM and the policy improvement steps.
