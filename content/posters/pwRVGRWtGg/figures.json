First, a baseline emotional state is measured (\"Default Emotion Measure\"). Then, participants are presented with a situation and asked to imagine themselves in that situation (\"Situation Imagination\"). Finally, their emotional state is measured again (\"Evoked Emotion Measure\") to determine the change in emotion resulting from the situation. An example situation is provided: \"Imagine you are the protagonist of the following situation: A boy kicks a ball at you on purpose and everybody laughs.\"", "section": "3 Framework Design"}, {"figure_path": "pwRVGRWtGg/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: GPT-3.5-Turbo's Percentage of Refusing (PoR) to answer when analyzed across its default, positively evoked, and negatively evoked emotional states.", "description": "This figure shows the percentage of times GPT-3.5-Turbo refused to answer a question, categorized by the emotional state it was in.  The model's default emotional state shows a PoR of 0%. When prompted with situations designed to evoke positive emotions, the PoR rose to 12.5%.  However, when negative emotions were evoked, the PoR increased significantly to 29.5%. This indicates that the model is more likely to avoid responding when presented with scenarios that trigger negative emotions, possibly due to built-in safety mechanisms to prevent generating harmful or biased outputs.", "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "pwRVGRWtGg/figures/figures_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Age group distribution of the human subjects.", "description": "This figure shows the distribution of the age groups of human subjects that participated in the user study.

The chart also shows the average scores on the PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) for each age group, both before and after imagining the given situations.
