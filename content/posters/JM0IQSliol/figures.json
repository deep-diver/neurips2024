A general diffeomorphism, which is a transformation that maps a space onto itself in a smooth, invertible way, can map a single time point to multiple spatial points, thus losing the original time series' structure and making it inappropriate for analysis.", "section": "Background on LDDMM"}, {"figure_path": "JM0IQSliol/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: LDDMM and TS-LDDMM are applied to ECG data. We observe that LDDMM, using a general Gaussian kernel, does not learn the time translation of the first spike but changes the space values, i.e., one spike disappears before emerging at a translated position. At the same time, TS-LDDMM handles the time change in the shape. This difference of deformations implies differences in features representations.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of LDDMM and TS-LDDMM on ECG data.  LDDMM, using a general Gaussian kernel, fails to accurately capture the time translation of a key feature (spike), instead altering its spatial representation.
