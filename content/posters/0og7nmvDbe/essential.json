It also **opens new avenues for research**, such as exploring the role of specific neuron types in various tasks and contexts.", "summary": "LLMs regulate uncertainty via specialized 'entropy' and 'token frequency' neurons, impacting prediction confidence without directly altering logits.", "takeaways": ["Large language models use specialized neurons to calibrate prediction confidence.", "Entropy neurons modulate output distribution entropy by subtly influencing LayerNorm, impacting confidence without significantly changing logits.", "Token frequency neurons adjust the model's output distribution's distance from the unigram distribution, influencing confidence based on token frequency."], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes applications, raising concerns about the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes.  Understanding how LLMs manage uncertainty is essential for safe and effective deployment.  Prior research has focused on quantifying and calibrating model confidence, but the internal mechanisms LLMs employ remain largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating two crucial components: entropy neurons and token frequency neurons. \nThis paper identifies and analyzes these two neuron types, showing how they regulate uncertainty in LLMs' next-token predictions. Entropy neurons subtly modulate the output distribution's entropy by influencing the final layer normalization, leading to changes in confidence with minimal direct effect on the prediction itself.  Token frequency neurons adjust each token's logit proportionally to its frequency, shifting the output distribution towards or away from the unigram distribution. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of these neurons in managing confidence across various models, including in the context of induction tasks.  This work provides valuable insights into the internal workings of LLMs and contributes to our understanding of how they handle uncertainty.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "0og7nmvDbe/podcast.wav"}
