Existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods struggle to transfer knowledge effectively across diverse devices because informative logits from capable devices are diluted by those from less capable ones, and using a single integrated target neglects individual device contributions. This paper introduces TAKFL, a novel KD-based framework.\nTAKFL addresses these challenges by treating knowledge transfer as separate tasks. It independently distills knowledge from each device to prevent dilution and uses a self-regularization technique to handle noisy ensembles. To integrate the distilled knowledge, TAKFL employs adaptive task arithmetic, allowing each student model to customize integration for optimal performance.  Theoretical results demonstrate the effectiveness of task arithmetic, and experiments across computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that TAKFL outperforms existing KD-based methods.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "y6JotynERr/podcast.wav"}
