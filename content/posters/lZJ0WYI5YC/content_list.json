Many workflows in medical image analysis require images to be in a standard coordinate system for comparison, analysis, and visualization. In neuroimaging, communicating and comparing data between subjects requires the images to lie in a standard coordinate system [48, 96, 89, 32, 81, 85]. This assumption universally does not apply when brain image data are compared across individuals or for the same individual at different time points. Anatomical correspondences between diseased patients and normative brain templates help identify and localize abnormalities like tumors, lesions, or atrophy. Failed or anomalous correspondences impact diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease progression monitoring. DIR is also used to capture and quantify biomechanics and dynamics of different anatomical structures including myocardial motion tracking [74, 73, 7], improved monitoring of airflow and pulmonary function in lung imaging [66, 27, 97], and tracking of organ motion in radiation therapy [45, 14, 68, 78]. Latest breakthrough advances in imaging techniques like fluorescence and light-sheet microscopy [36, 69, 29, 98], in-situ hybridization, and multiplexing [65, 102] have led to image registration being imperative in advancing life sciences research.

Classical DIR methods are based on solving a variational optimization problem, where a similarity metric is optimized to find the best transformation that aligns the images. Most classical methods are formulated without any particular domain knowledge encoded in the optimization problem, and are therefore general and applicable to a wide range of problems. For instance, the popularly known registration toolkit ANTs [5] has been successfully applied to structural and functional neuroimaging data [48, 104, 43], CT lung imaging [66], cardiac motion modeling [53], developmental mouse brain atlases utilizing MRI and light sheet fluorescence microscopy [50] with virtually no change in the optimization algorithm. However, classical iterative methods have slow convergence, their performance is limited by the fidelity of image intensities, and they cannot incorporate learning to leverage a training set containing weak supervision such as anatomical landmarks, label maps or expert annotations. Deep Learning for Image Registration (DLIR) is an interesting paradigm to overcome these challenges. DLIR methods take a pair of images as input to a neural network and outputs a warp field that aligns the images, and their associated anatomical landmarks. The neural network parameters are trained to minimize the alignment loss over image pairs and landmarks in a training set. During inference, an image pair is provided and the network regresses a warp field. A primary benefti of this method is the ability to incorporate weak supervision like anatomical landmarks or expert annotations during training, which performs better landmark alignment without access to landmarks at inference time. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Motivation However, the beneftis of using DLIR methods over classical DIR methods in terms of accuracy or robustness to domain shift are still topics with no clear consensus. Several DLIR methods claim that architectural choices and loss function design combined with amortized optimization of neural network parameters significantly outperform classical methods [63, 61, 17]. On the contrary, classical iterative methods that leverage implicit or explicit conventional priors have shown to outperform most deep learning methods on other challenging datasets [100, 79]. For example, in the context of lung registration, an implicit neural optimization method surpasses every deep learning baseline on the DIR-lab dataset [100]. In EMPIRE10 challenge without access to labeled data [66], classical methods are highly performant compared to deep learning methods. In the ANHIR histology registration challenge [12], the best performing algorithms were classical methods, and the deep learning method was fast and performed well, but did not have good generalization capabilities. Mok et al. [62] also mention that deep baselines typically fail \u2018spectacularly\u2019 on out of distribution data, and classical methods like Elastix and ANTs come out on top. However, these observations are relatively unstructured and not studied directly. The confounding variable of using labelmap supervision has urged the Learn2Reg 2024 LUMIR challenge [35] to be performed on fully unsupervised data. In our own empirical evaluations, we found that classical methods typically outperform deep methods under certain conditions and assumptions. Image registration is NP-hard being a non-convex optimization problem, and approximating the solution of NP-hard problems with deep learning methods is not guaranteed to be optimal, or even a minima of the registration loss at test-time. Deep learning methods also claim to provide amortized optimization since classical methods are extremely slow to run, however, modern GPU implementations [55, 59, 41] have patched this shortcoming of classical methods while providing state-of-the-art performance.

The conditions needed for either paradigm to perform well over the other are clouded and not explicitly outlined in the existing literature. This has prolonged the tug-of-war between classical and deep learning methods. We perform a more structured problem setup and empirical evaluation to determine consensus on the benefits and limitations of each paradigm. First, we observe a strong correlation between the mutual information between per-pixel intensity and label maps, and the performance of classical registration methods. This strong correlation hints to the fact that the Jacobian projection in DLIR methods is unlikely to affect this correlation, and therefore, the performance of DLIR methods in the unsupervised setting. We empirically verify this hypothesis on a variety of state-of-the-art classical and DLIR methods, and address instrumentation bias in the existing literature. Secondly, since the label map is a deterministic function of the intensity image, DLIR methods can learn to perform better label matching when this constraint is enforced during training, by implicitly discovering the label map within the network features and predicting a warp field that minimizes the alignment error between label maps. This is a key strength of DLIR methods, that classical methods cannot leverage. Third, we show that even though learning methods implicit capture semantic information from the image which is not explicitly captured by classical methods, this additional feature learning does not translate to invariance to domain shift, and DLIR methods are brittle to these changes. These empirical findings allow us to reassess and recalibrate performance expectations from classical and DLIR methods, using a systematic, unbiased and fair evaluation.

Some of the earliest approaches to deformable registration considered models for small deformations using elastic deformation assumptions [51, 23, 8, 31, 30, 20, 21], conceptualizing the moving image volume as an elastic continuum that undergoes deformation to align with the appearance of the fixed image. This was in conjunction with alternate formulations based on fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes [22, 21] and Euler-Lagrange equations [2, 11, 4, 56, 58] and their subsequent optimization strategies. The seminal work of Beg.et al. [11] introduces an explicit Euler-Langrange formulation and a metric distance on the images as measured by the geodesic shortest paths in the space of diffeomorphisms used to transform the moving image to the fixed image. However, storing the explicit velocity fields is expensive in terms of compute and memory. This limitation motivated semi-Langrangian formulations [4, 3] to avoid storing velocity fields explicitly, and only storing the final diffeomorphism. ANTs [5, 1] is a widely used toolkit that employs the Euler-Langrange formulation with a symmetric objective function [2]. Yet another approach is to interpret deformable registration as an optical flow problem [70, 103], leading to the famous Demons algorithm and its diffeomorphic and symmetric variants [106, 93, 92, 95] implemented as part of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) [40, 25]. However, most of these methods are still computationally expensive to run owing to their CPU implementations. Recently, modern implementations leverage the massively parallelizable nature of the registration problem to run on GPUs, leading to orders of magnitude of speedups while retaining the robustness and accuracy of the classical methods [55, 59, 41]. However, as we show in Section 4, the registration performance of classical methods is limited by the fidelity of image intensities.

However, cascade-based methods create a substantial memory overhead due to backpropagation through cascades and storage of intermediate volumes [6].

Similarly, if a given intensity value corresponds to multiple possible labels, then image matching does not tell us which labels are matched via the image matching objective.

We consider four brain datasets - OASIS, LPBA40, MGH10, and IBSR18, which are acquired under different scanners, under different resolutions, and have different preprocessing, labelling and postprocessing protocols [57, 48]. For each dataset, we use ANTs for registering all pairs within the dataset and then evaluate the Dice score as an indicator of label matching performance.

To this end, we evaluate the performance of both the classical and DLIR methods on four brain datasets \u2013 CUMC12, LPBA40, MGH10, and IBSR18.

For DLIR methods, we plot the performance with models trained with and without the label matching loss in the OASIS dataset, shown as blue and green boxplots respectively. Across all datasets, FireANTs, Greedy, ANTs and NiftyReg consistently perform better than DLIR methods. Among the DLIR methods, SynthMorph performs consistently better due to its domain-agnostic training paradigm. Remarkably, even though DLIR methods outperform classical methods on the OASIS dataset with label matching objective, the performance does not transfer to other datasets, even compared to its own unsupervised variant. This is a negative result \u2013 implying that to improve performance on a new dataset, one must collect label maps from that dataset and retrain the model \u2013 existing collections of label maps are not sufficient to improve performance on new datasets.

Preceding experiments show that classical methods provide an unprecedented level of robustness and generalizability across datasets, but are limited by the fidelity of the image matching objective. Supervised DLIR methods provide a promising step towards improving registration performance of anatomical regions by implicitly discovering these structures and predicting appropriate warp fields within the network architecture. However, this anatomical-awareness on the training dataset does not help in generalizing to other datasets, limiting the practical utility of these methods. The usability of anatomical landmarks and labelmaps to obtain domain-invariant registration performance still remains an open research problem. These results also have profound implications for annotated data collection and challenges the notion that large labeled datasets ensure robust generalization.

At the current state, a practitioner should choose predictive DLIR methods only if they have access to a large labeled dataset, and their application is limited to the same dataset distribution. In all other cases, classical optimization-based methods are the more accurate and reliable choice, even if labeled data exists but is not representative of the test data.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
