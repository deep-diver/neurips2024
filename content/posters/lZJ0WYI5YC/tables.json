We highlight a significant difference in evaluation metrics reported by baselines and our evaluation on the OASIS validation dataset. This difference can be attributed to deviation in hyperparameters from the recommended parameters or early stopping to save time. In either case, this misrepresentation leads to incorrect conclusions about the performance of the algorithm. The reported dice scores are anywhere from 2 to 10 Dice points lower than our evaluation, showing a non-trivial instrumentation bias. We report our own evaluation of DLIR algorithms and compare them with reported values to avoid introducing instrumentation bias in our evaluation.", "description": "This table compares the performance of classical and deep learning image registration methods reported in existing literature against the author's own evaluation. It highlights a significant discrepancy, termed as 'instrumentation bias', attributed to differences in hyperparameter choices and early stopping criteria used in prior studies. The authors' re-evaluation shows that classical methods perform significantly better than previously reported and often surpasses Deep Learning based methods.", "section": "2 Related Work"}]
