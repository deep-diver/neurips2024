In homophilic settings (yellow line), the predicted score increases linearly with feature similarity. Conversely, in heterophilic settings (blue line), the predicted score decreases linearly with increasing feature similarity.  The threshold 'M' (0.5 in this example) separates the positive and negative samples in the feature similarity space, influencing the slope of these lines.
