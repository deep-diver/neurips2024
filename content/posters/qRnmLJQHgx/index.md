### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current multimodal models struggle with handling diverse modalities and tasks, often showing reduced performance compared to single-task models.  This is due to challenges like negative transfer and difficulty balancing losses across various tasks.  Existing models typically work with a small set of modalities, limiting their versatility.

This paper introduces 4M-21, a novel any-to-any vision model trained on 21 diverse modalities.  It addresses the limitations of existing models by using a multimodal masked pre-training scheme, employing modality-specific tokenizers, and leveraging co-training on large-scale datasets.  **The model's ability to handle diverse modalities without performance loss is a key contribution**, surpassing the capabilities of existing models.  **Its open-sourced nature further accelerates research and development** in the field.

### In-depth insights


#### Any-to-Any Vision
The concept of "Any-to-Any Vision" signifies a significant advancement in multimodal learning, aiming to build a unified model capable of handling diverse input and output modalities.  This contrasts with traditional approaches that train separate models for specific tasks, resulting in **reduced efficiency and scalability**.  A successful Any-to-Any Vision model would exhibit **high flexibility** allowing for seamless cross-modal interactions, such as generating an image from a text description, or retrieving relevant images based on audio input.  **Tokenization**, the process of converting different modalities into a common representation, is crucial for enabling such a model. However, challenges remain, including handling the wide variance in data types and dimensions across modalities, and mitigating negative transfer during training.  **Addressing these challenges through novel training strategies and improved tokenization techniques is essential** for unlocking the full potential of Any-to-Any Vision. The ultimate aim is to build more efficient, versatile, and powerful AI systems that can seamlessly integrate and interpret information from a vast range of sources.

#### Multimodal Tokenizers
Multimodal tokenizers are crucial for enabling any-to-any vision models to handle diverse input modalities.  The core idea is to translate different data types (images, text, depth maps, etc.) into a unified token representation, allowing a single model to process them seamlessly. **Modality-specific tokenizers** are employed, as different data types require distinct approaches for efficient and meaningful tokenization.  For example, image data might leverage VQ-VAEs for vector quantization, while text data might use wordpiece tokenization.  The choice of tokenizer is critical; it influences the model's ability to capture relevant information and perform various tasks. **Discretization** of continuous data (like images) into tokens is key, facilitating tasks like iterative sampling for generation and enabling effective masked training strategies, which in turn enhance multimodal representation learning. The effectiveness of the tokenization process directly impacts overall model performance and the ability to achieve fine-grained control and cross-modal reasoning.  **A well-designed tokenization scheme** allows for successful any-to-any prediction capabilities and efficient scalability across multiple modalities and tasks. The selection of the right tokenizer for each modality is non-trivial and requires careful consideration of the specific characteristics of the data.

#### Co-training Strategies
Co-training strategies in multimodal learning aim to leverage the strengths of different modalities to improve model performance.  **Simultaneous training on vision and language datasets** is a common approach, where the model learns to predict missing information across modalities.  **This approach facilitates better understanding of relationships between modalities and encourages generalization**, but requires careful consideration of data alignment and loss function weighting.  The success hinges on effectively integrating information from diverse data sources, demanding sophisticated techniques like **multimodal masking and careful selection of datasets** with strong cross-modal correlations.  While computationally expensive, co-training has shown significant promise, resulting in models with superior performance compared to those trained on single modalities.  **Careful design of the training objective, such as a unified loss function across modalities, is crucial** for preventing negative transfer and ensuring efficient learning. Future research should explore advanced techniques like **curriculum learning** or **self-supervised pretraining** to further enhance co-training effectiveness and reduce training complexity.

#### Multimodal Retrieval
The section on "Multimodal Retrieval" presents a significant advance in cross-modal information access.  The core idea is to leverage **global feature embeddings** from models like DINOv2 and ImageBind, enabling retrieval across diverse modalities.  Instead of relying on single-modality queries, the approach allows for combined queries, significantly improving retrieval precision.  **Any modality can serve as input to retrieve any other modality**, demonstrating flexibility and robustness.  This capability is further enhanced by the model's ability to combine multiple input modalities to create a more specific, constrained query. The results highlight that **performance on multimodal retrieval tasks surpasses** existing single-modality retrieval models, showcasing the power of the unified any-to-any model architecture.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this any-to-any vision model could significantly advance the field.  **Extending the model's capabilities to even more diverse modalities**, such as audio, tactile, or physiological signals, would create a truly comprehensive multisensory AI.  **Improving the model's scalability** is crucial; exploring techniques like efficient model architectures or distributed training would enable handling even larger datasets and more complex tasks.  **Developing more robust and nuanced tokenization methods** is key to better handling subtle variations within modalities. **Investigating the model's emergent properties and potential for few-shot or zero-shot learning** on unseen tasks and modalities warrants further investigation. This could unlock unprecedented levels of generalization in AI systems. Finally, a critical area of focus is to **thoroughly investigate the ethical implications** of such powerful multimodal AI, and develop strategies to mitigate potential biases and risks associated with its deployment.

> Table 1: Out-of-the-box (zero-shot) performance. We show the performance for a common subset of tasks: surface normals and depth estimation on DIODE [90], semantic and instance segmentation on COCO [57], k-NN retrieval on ImageNet-1K [79], and 3D human keypoint estimation on 3DPW [91]. We compare to a set of strong baselines and specialist models, including our pseudo labelers. The model learned to solve all the tasks without a loss of performance, is significantly better than the baselines, and is competitive with pseudo labelers, while being a single model for all tasks. Compared to 4M-7, the 4M-21 model preserved its performance while solving 3x more tasks. X denotes that a given model cannot solve the task out-of-the-box. * shows the tokenizer reconstruction quality and provides an estimate on the performance upper bound due to tokenization. See fig. 14 for qualitative comparisons. Best results are bolded, second best underlined.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of the performance of the 4M-21 model against several strong baselines and specialized models on four common computer vision tasks. The tasks evaluated are surface normal and depth estimation, semantic and instance segmentation, k-NN retrieval, and 3D human keypoint estimation.  The results demonstrate that the 4M-21 model performs competitively with or better than specialized models on all tasks, while being a single model capable of handling all of them. This showcases the model's strong out-of-the-box capabilities, especially when compared to its predecessor (4M-7) which could only solve a third of the number of tasks. The table also includes an analysis of the upper bound of performance, considering the limitations of tokenization.
