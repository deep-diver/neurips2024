Existing data augmentation techniques have limitations in generating diverse and realistic images, particularly for complex scenes with multiple objects and occlusions.  This has hampered the development of robust and accurate object detectors.\n\nThe researchers introduce ODGEN, a novel method that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality synthetic images. **ODGEN addresses the limitations of previous methods by fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model on domain-specific data and employing a new object-wise conditioning strategy using both visual (synthesized foreground patches) and textual (object-wise descriptions) prompts.**  The results demonstrate that using synthetic data generated by ODGEN significantly enhances the performance of object detectors, improving mAP by up to 25.3%, showcasing the effectiveness and generalizability of their approach.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "kTtK65vKvD/podcast.wav"}
