The SGD rate of the \u00b5-strongly convex case is achieved more generally under a PL condition with PL-constant \u03bc. While SGD requires the optimal choice of one variable to achieve the optimal rate, AGNES requires three (two in the determinstic case).", "description": "This table compares the time complexity of the AGNES and SGD algorithms for achieving a target error (\u03b5) in convex and \u03bc-strongly convex optimization problems. It highlights that AGNES requires three hyperparameters (compared to one for SGD) to reach the optimal convergence rate.  The table shows the time complexities are dependent on the condition number (L/\u03bc in strongly convex case) and noise intensity (\u03c3).", "section": "Numerical Experiments"}]
