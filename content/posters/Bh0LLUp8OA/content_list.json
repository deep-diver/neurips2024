When the agent\u2019s choice among $n$ actions can lead to the success or failure of a project, the principal\u2019s optimal dynamic contract is surprisingly simple.

Our main result also generalizes to settings with a rich set of outcomes beyond success/failure, as long as the principal changes the contract dynamically by scaling it (\u201csingle-dimensional scaling\u201d). However, we show that without this single-dimensional scaling restriction, there exist principal-agent instances where the optimal dynamic contract does not take this form.

Consider the following motivating examples: a worker joining a new team, a student starting an internship, or a junior professor joining a committee. These agents initially face uncertainty about the required effort and what constitutes good performance. They must decide when to exert more effort and when to reduce it. Peer assessments introduce additional uncertainty and noise. Furthermore, the environment is dynamic, with the value of certain outcomes changing over time. Each agent encounters an implicit and evolving system of incentives that they must adapt to through repeated interactions. This pattern is prevalent in many real-life contractual relationships and is increasingly relevant to AI agents handling complex, open-ended, and computationally intensive tasks. For details to the aforementioned examples, the interested reader can see [41] and references therein. In settings like credit scoring, the evaluation system creates incentives for the agent while remaining opaque to prevent gaming, forcing the agent to act under uncertainty [38].

We first observe that in Lemma B.3, when an agent is indifferent between actions $i$ and $i+1$ then the change in utility for the principal by choosing an action $i+1$ over $i$ is proportional to $(1-\\alpha^{i})$ . This is negative if $\\alpha^{i}>\\dot{1}$ and therefore the principal will prefer to agent to play action $i$ when $\\alpha^{i}>1$ . However if $\\alpha^{i}<1$ , then the principal will prefer that the agent play action $i+1$ . Thus in this modified rewriting lemma, contracts with breakpoints greater than 1, will prefer the lower action and breakpoints lower than 1, will prefer the higher action. By modifying Lemma B.3, we can rewrite any linear contract $\\pi$ using the rewriting rules of Theorem 3.1 into a new linear contract $\\pi^{\\prime}$ with a breakpoints that are at most 1, without any loss in utility. \u53e3 ", "page_idx": 36}, {"type": "text", "text": "NeurIPS Paper Checklist ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 37}, {"type": "text", "text": "1.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
