Existing methods often struggle with capturing fine details and creating hairstyles with nuanced high-frequency features, such as curls and flyaways.  Current techniques often simplify the process by using low-resolution guide hairs, which leads to a loss of detail and sometimes unnatural results. \nThis paper presents a novel approach that leverages a doubly hierarchical representation of hair geometry to address this problem.  The approach involves separating low-frequency structural curves from high-frequency details, utilizing the Discrete Cosine Transform to mitigate Gibbs oscillations, and employing k-medoids clustering for optimal guide strand sampling. The resulting model is able to generate convincing and high-quality guide hair and dense hair strands, even with complex morphologies. This method is efficient and flexible, creating superior results compared to previous approaches.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "h34jVnPo1c/podcast.wav"}
