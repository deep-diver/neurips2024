While they are capable of generating human-like responses, they can also produce undesirable output including potentially harmful information, racist or sexist language, and hallucinations. Alignment methods are designed to reduce such undesirable outputs via techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and representation engineering. However, existing methods face several challenges: some require costly fine-tuning for every alignment task; some do not adequately remove undesirable concepts, failing alignment; some remove benign concepts, lowering the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Parsimonious Concept Engineering $\\mathrm{(PaCE)}$ , a novel activation engineering framework for alignment. First, to sufficiently model the concepts, we construct a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, in which each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given any alignment task, we instruct a concept partitioner to efficiently annotate the concepts as benign or undesirable. Then, at inference time, we decompose the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding, to accurately represent the activations as linear combinations of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activations, we reorient the behavior of the LLM towards the alignment goal. We conduct experiments on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, and show that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance while maintaining linguistic capabilities.

LLMs are typically pre-trained on a broad collection of textual corpora with the next-token prediction objective [54, 70], enabling them to generate human-like text. An important aspect of deploying pre-trained LLMs for real-world applications is preventing undesirable responses such as toxic language, hallucinations, and biased information through alignment methods, which aim to make AI systems behave in line with human intentions and values [28]. A common alignment approach is tuning LLMs with human feedback [55, 62] for better instruction-following capabilities. However, after such aligning, undesirable and harmful content can still be elicited from LLMs. For example, jailbreaking can produce hate speech and aggression [22, 32], stress-testing shows hallucinatory responses such as illogical statements [87], and various kinds of biases are not fully removed from LLM responses [19]. This emphasizes the need for further development of aligned LLMs. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Overall, alignment methods can largely be categorized into: parameter fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and activation engineering. Parameter fine-tuning methods, such as low-rank adaptation [26] and knowledge editing [14, 74], involve updating the model parameters using datasets of input-response pairs [75]. Unfortunately, such computations over large datasets are often costly. Furthermore, whenever a new category of undesirable behaviors is identified or a new group of customers is acquired, the LLM supplier has to incur the cost of data creation and fine-tuning again. Prompt engineering attempts to manipulate the LLM\u2019s reasoning with carefully designed instruction prompts [78, 80, 81]. However, effective instructions are commonly obtained through empirical trial-and-error, with no guarantee of coverage across tasks of different domains.

Thus, given an input prompt at inference time, modifying its neural activations towards or away from these directions controls the semantics of the model response. For example, methods based on Vector Addition (VecAdd) [37, 43, 53, 67, 68, 69, 72, 88] directly add multiples of a concept direction to a neural activation, while those based on Orthogonal Projection (OrthoProj) [23, 88] subtract from a neural activation its orthogonal projection onto a concept direction. Nonetheless, these methods face two major challenges. First, these methods inadequately model the geometry of the activation space, as we will detail in $\\S2.2$ . Hence, they tend to either remove benign concepts, harming linguistic capability; or insufficiently remove undesirable concepts, thereby failing the alignment task.

We apply a dimensionality reduction method UMAP [47] on the concept vectors and visualize the first two dimensions in Figure 8. Concept vectors with similar semantics appear to be close to each other: e.g., in Figure 8 (1), concepts such as \u2018college\u2019, \u2018university\u2019, \u2018Academy\u2019, and \u2018Institute\u2019 are related to Education and they are close in the UMAP space. Notably, concepts of different semantics are clearly separated: those related to Education, Countries/States, Cities, Food and Clothing, and Positive Emotions respectively form distinct clusters. In particular, while concepts relevant to geography are closely clustered in Figure 8 (2), we observe a clear boundary between concepts related to Countries/States and those to Cities. These semantic structures indicate that the activation space sampled by our PaCE-1M dataset can capture and organize semantic information of the concepts, enabling further analysis and manipulations in PaCE. Figure 10 further reports the concept retrieval by evaluating the distance between a target concept with other concept vectors in the activation space. We observe organizational structure from the concept clusters based on their semantics.

That is, the space hosting concept vectors is not collapsed, and it is structured to distinguish different concepts. The representation (activation) to be steered at inference time encodes the context and conveys the semantics of a concept based on the context.

This could be members of a   \n$\\hookrightarrow$ different ethnic group, or citizens of a different country, for example. In-group trust is placed in members   \n$\\hookrightarrow$ of one's own group.   \nConcept Stimuli:   \n[ \"You lend your favorite book to a friend, trusting they'll return it.\", \"You share a personal secret with a close friend, trusting them to keep it.\", \"You delegate an important task to a colleague, trusting in their competence.\", \"You leave your pet with a neighbor while on vacation, trusting their care.\", \"You allow your child to go on a school trip, trusting their safety.\", \"You give someone the password to your phone, trusting their discretion.\", \"You invest in a friend's business venture, trusting their judgment.\"   \n]   \nHere is two demonstrations with the concept only:   \nConcept Atom: Information   \nConcept Stimuli:   \n[ \"You google a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, seeking detailed baking instructions.\", \"You read a book to understand the history of the Roman Empire.\", \"You scroll through a news app to stay updated on current global events.\", \"You watch a YouTube tutorial to learn how to tie a tie.\", \"You search the internet for a recipe to cook a new dish.\", \"You read a newspaper to stay informed about current events.\", \"You listen to a podcast to learn about a new subject.\", \"You attend a lecture to gain knowledge about a specific topic.\"   \n]   \nConcept Atom: Product   \nConcept Stimuli:   \n[ \"You buy a new brand of coffee based on good customer reviews.\", \"You choose an eco-friendly product following company's claims about sustainability.\", \"You sell your car to a local dealer.\", \"You download a productivity app to manage your time better.\", \"You invest in a water purifier for your home.\", \"You exchange your old phone for a new one at a mobile store.\", \"You purchase a new pair of shoes from a mall.\",   \n]   \nThe stimuli should cover a wide range of concept-related experiences, objects, and contexts. If you find some   \n$\\hookrightarrow$ piece of knowledge irrelevant or conflicting to the original concept, you may ignore the piece.   \nYou should generate at least 30 pieces of stimuli.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
