### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning, particularly in mathematics. Existing methods for improving their mathematical abilities often rely on datasets with a bias towards easier problems, limiting performance on challenging queries.  This bias arises from the common rejection-tuning approach of equally sampling from all problems, resulting in insufficient data from hard questions. 



The DART-Math project tackles this issue by introducing Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART). DART prioritizes difficult problems during data synthesis, creating smaller, higher-quality datasets.  Experiments show that models trained on DART-Math datasets significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of focusing on harder problems. This research contributes high-quality, publicly available resources that significantly advance mathematical problem-solving in LLMs.

### In-depth insights


#### Rejection Tuning Bias
Rejection tuning, a method to enhance large language models (LLMs) by filtering out incorrect responses from a strong model, suffers from a significant bias.  **This bias disproportionately favors easy queries**, leading to insufficient training on difficult problems. The consequence is that LLMs trained this way struggle with complex mathematical reasoning and may fail to generalize effectively.  The core issue stems from a **sampling strategy that allocates an equal number of trials to each query regardless of difficulty**. This means challenging queries, which are often crucial for complex reasoning, are under-represented in the training data. Addressing this bias requires **strategies that prioritize more trials for difficult queries**, ensuring more extensive training data on challenging examples.  This could involve dynamically adjusting sampling frequency based on query difficulty or employing methods that ensure sufficient coverage of the difficulty spectrum in training data.  This approach has significant implications for improving LLMs in tasks requiring complex reasoning. 

#### DART Methodology
The core of the DART methodology centers on **addressing the inherent biases** within existing rejection-tuning datasets for mathematical problem-solving.  These biases skew towards easier queries, leaving many challenging problems under-represented in the training data. DART innovatively introduces a **difficulty-aware sampling strategy**, allocating more synthesis trials to harder queries. This ensures a more balanced dataset enriched with solutions to complex problems.  The approach uses a **7B-sized open-weight model**, removing the reliance on expensive proprietary models.  Two strategies, **Uniform and Prop2Diff**, are presented, allowing for control over the dataset's difficulty distribution.  **Prop2Diff**, in particular, prioritizes difficult problems, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable models.  The effectiveness is demonstrated through significant performance improvements across various mathematical benchmarks, showcasing DART's potential as a cost-effective and efficient method for advancing mathematical problem-solving in LLMs.

#### DART Datasets
The DART datasets represent a significant contribution to the field of mathematical problem-solving with LLMs.  **Their key innovation lies in addressing the inherent bias towards easier problems** found in existing datasets created via rejection sampling. By prioritizing the sampling of responses to more difficult queries, **DART datasets achieve better coverage of challenging problems**, leading to models that generalize better.  **The use of an open-weight model for data synthesis**, rather than proprietary models like GPT-4, makes the DART methodology more accessible and cost-effective.  The creation of both Uniform and Prop2Diff versions of the dataset, offering different response distributions, allows for flexibility in training, and the resulting models demonstrate significant improvements over baselines on various benchmarks.  However, the reliance on a single metric (fail rate) for difficulty assessment might limit the dataset's overall representativeness. Future work could explore incorporating multiple metrics and expanding the dataset's scope further.

#### Empirical Evaluation
A robust empirical evaluation section is crucial for validating the claims of a research paper.  It should present a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method's performance, comparing it against relevant baselines and state-of-the-art techniques on a diverse range of datasets and metrics.  **Careful selection of benchmark datasets** is vital, encompassing both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks to establish generalizability.  The evaluation should go beyond simple accuracy scores, exploring other relevant metrics such as efficiency (inference speed and computational cost) and robustness to various forms of noise or adversarial attacks. **Statistical significance testing** is necessary to determine if the observed performance differences are genuine rather than due to chance.  The results should be presented clearly and transparently, potentially using visualizations like graphs and tables to enhance understanding. **Detailed analysis of the results**, including potential error sources and limitations of the method, will strengthen the evaluation's credibility and contribute to future research. A well-executed empirical evaluation ultimately establishes the practical impact of the proposed approach.

#### Future Works
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **more sophisticated difficulty metrics** beyond the fail rate, potentially incorporating human evaluation or leveraging advanced LLMs to assess problem complexity more accurately.  Investigating alternative data synthesis strategies, including techniques that go beyond simple rejection sampling, could also be valuable. This might involve exploring methods like reinforcement learning or generative models specifically designed to create challenging and diverse mathematical problems. Additionally, the research could be extended to other reasoning tasks or domains, exploring the generalizability of the difficulty-aware rejection tuning approach beyond mathematics.  Finally, a significant area for future work would be to **fully analyze the impact of varying the number of training samples** on the effectiveness of the model. This could involve exploring the optimal balance between the cost of data generation and the resulting performance improvements.  By conducting a detailed cost-benefit analysis, researchers could determine the ideal size of the synthetic dataset.

> This figure shows the bias of rejection-based data synthesis towards easy queries. The left panel shows that the proportion of difficult queries (Level 5) decreases significantly in the synthetic dataset MetaMathQA compared to the original MATH dataset. The middle panel shows that the number of responses for difficult queries is also much smaller in MetaMathQA. The right panel shows that a strong model (DeepSeekMath-7B-RL) can generate correct responses for most queries given enough trials, suggesting that the bias in rejection-based data synthesis is not due to the inherent difficulty of the queries but rather to the sampling strategy.

> This figure shows the scaling curves of MATH test performance for three different base models (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and DeepSeekMath-7B) as the number of training samples increases.  The x-axis represents the number of training samples (log scale), and the y-axis represents the accuracy on the MATH test set. Three lines are plotted for each model, representing the performance of vanilla rejection tuning (VRT), DART with uniform sampling, and DART with difficulty-proportional sampling.  The figure demonstrates that DART, particularly the difficulty-proportional version, consistently outperforms VRT across all three models and across a wide range of training data sizes, highlighting the effectiveness of the difficulty-aware rejection tuning technique.
