Existing methods for improving their mathematical abilities often rely on datasets with a bias towards easier problems, limiting performance on challenging queries.  This bias arises from the common rejection-tuning approach of equally sampling from all problems, resulting in insufficient data from hard questions. \n\nThe DART-Math project tackles this issue by introducing Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART). DART prioritizes difficult problems during data synthesis, creating smaller, higher-quality datasets.  Experiments show that models trained on DART-Math datasets significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of focusing on harder problems. This research contributes high-quality, publicly available resources that significantly advance mathematical problem-solving in LLMs.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "zLU21oQjD5/podcast.wav"}
