### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications necessitates efficient methods for deploying multiple models.  Existing approaches like low-rank and low-bit compression often compromise performance, especially for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs. This issue is exacerbated in resource-constrained environments like multi-tenant serving, where multiple LLMs are needed to meet complex demands.  



This paper introduces Delta-CoMe, a **training-free delta compression method that employs mixed-precision quantization**. It assigns higher-bit representation for significant singular vectors in delta weights, improving approximation accuracy. Results show Delta-CoMe surpasses low-rank and low-bit baselines across various LLMs (math, code, chat, and multi-modal), achieving comparable performance to full fine-tuned models with **over 10x savings in GPU memory and disk storage**.  The compatibility with various LLMs like Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral highlights its generalizability and practical significance.

Each subfigure shows the distribution of bits used to quantize singular vectors against their corresponding singular values. BitDelta uses 1 bit for all singular vectors. SVD low rank retains only the top k singular values and vectors, discarding the rest. Delta-CoMe uses a mixed-precision approach, allocating more bits to the singular vectors with larger singular values and fewer bits to those with smaller singular values, reflecting the long-tail distribution observed in delta weights.

### In-depth insights


#### Mixed-Precision Quantization
The concept of 'Mixed-Precision Quantization' in the context of compressing delta weights for large language models is a **significant advancement** in efficient model deployment.  It leverages the observation that singular vectors associated with larger singular values contribute more significantly to the model's performance.  This insight allows for a more nuanced compression strategy, using **higher bit-widths** for these crucial vectors and **lower bit-widths or even omitting** those with negligible impact.  The result is a compression method that balances model size reduction with minimal performance degradation.  **Mixed-precision quantization offers a superior alternative** to uniform low-bit or low-rank approaches, which can severely impact the accuracy of task-specific fine-tuned LLMs.  This approach demonstrates adaptability, proving compatible with diverse backbone models, and opens avenues for exploring the balance between precision levels and compression ratios to optimize resource usage and accuracy tradeoffs.

#### Delta Compression Methods
Delta compression, a crucial technique for efficient large language model (LLM) deployment, focuses on compressing the difference (delta) between a base model and its fine-tuned variants.  **Low-rank methods** approximate the delta weights using a lower-rank representation, reducing storage needs but potentially sacrificing accuracy.  **Low-bit quantization**, conversely, reduces the precision of delta weights, resulting in smaller files but potentially impacting model performance.  The paper explores a novel approach, employing **mixed-precision quantization**, which cleverly allocates higher bit-widths to singular vectors representing larger singular values in the delta weights. This strategic allocation balances compression with accuracy, achieving superior performance compared to pure low-rank or low-bit techniques. The effectiveness is demonstrated across diverse LLMs, including those specializing in math, code, chat, and even vision-language tasks, **highlighting its generalizability** and offering a promising direction for optimizing LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.

#### LLM Compression
Large Language Model (LLM) compression techniques are crucial for deploying and serving these massive models efficiently.  **Reducing the model size** minimizes storage requirements and lowers the computational cost of inference, making LLMs accessible to devices with limited resources.  The paper explores various compression methods, including **low-rank approximation** and **quantization**, both of which aim to reduce the number of parameters in the model without significantly compromising performance.  However, a key challenge is to find a balance between compression and accuracy.  **Mixed-precision quantization**, as suggested in the paper, presents a promising approach, using different precision levels for different components of the model to optimize both the size and the accuracy of the compressed model.  This strategy is particularly effective when applied to the *delta weights* (the difference between a base model and a fine-tuned model), as these tend to have a long-tail distribution of singular values.  The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in achieving high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy comparable to the full model, thus making **multi-model serving** a more feasible and practical deployment strategy.

#### Multi-Model Serving
Multi-model serving presents a significant challenge in deploying large language models (LLMs).  **Serving multiple LLMs simultaneously, each specialized for different tasks or user needs**, increases efficiency and flexibility.  However, this approach faces limitations in storage and computational resources. **Delta-compression techniques** address these issues by decomposing fine-tuned LLMs into a base model and delta weights, allowing for significant compression.  Existing methods, like low-rank and low-bit compression, can hinder performance, especially for task-specific LLMs. **Mixed-precision quantization**, which assigns higher bit-widths to significant singular vectors in delta weights, offers a promising solution. This approach strikes a balance between compression and performance, demonstrated by outperforming previous methods in various LLM types and achieving comparable results to full fine-tuned models. This approach allows for **efficient multi-model serving with reduced storage and computational costs**, opening new avenues for deploying diverse and capable LLMs across diverse applications.

#### Future Work
Future work for Delta-CoMe could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the mixed-precision quantization to other model compression techniques** beyond SVD would broaden its applicability and potentially improve performance further.  **Investigating different quantization methods** and their impact on Delta-CoMe's efficiency and accuracy is crucial.  **A comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between compression ratio and accuracy** across diverse LLMs and tasks is needed to define the optimal balance for specific applications.  Furthermore, **developing more efficient hardware acceleration** of Delta-CoMe's mixed-precision compression would significantly improve inference speed and reduce latency, which is particularly relevant in real-time scenarios. Finally, **evaluating the robustness of Delta-CoMe** against adversarial attacks and noisy inputs is critical for deploying it in production environments where security and reliability are paramount.

> üîº This figure illustrates the Delta-CoMe method. It shows how the method compresses delta weights between an aligned model and a backbone model by using different bit-widths for singular vectors based on their singular values.  Larger singular values are represented with higher bit-widths (e.g., 8-bit), while smaller singular values use lower bit-widths (e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit), and the smallest are omitted (0-bit). This mixed-precision approach aims to achieve a balance between compression and accuracy. The figure visually shows this process for three different aligned models (Code, Math, and Multi-Modal).
