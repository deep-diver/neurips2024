Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous approach but can severely impact model performance. Label DP, a recently developed method that only protects labels, was proposed to mitigate these performance issues. While practical methods exist, the theoretical limits of learning under label DP were not well understood. This research paper investigates those limits, especially the impact of model complexity. \nThe paper derives new lower bounds on testing errors for label DP under both central and local models, adapting to different model complexities.  Results show that local label DP only increases sample complexity, maintaining convergence rate, except for heavy-tailed labels. With central label DP, the performance loss due to privacy is minimal. These findings validate the promise of label DP and provide insights for developing more effective privacy-preserving methods.  The work highlights the importance of choosing appropriate DP mechanisms to balance between privacy and model utility.
