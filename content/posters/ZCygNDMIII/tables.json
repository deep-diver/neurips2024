Two downstream models (DeepSense and Transformer) were used for each application. The methods are categorized into three groups: No Augmentation, Fine-grained Controllable Generative Augmentation (the proposed method), and Traditional Data Augmentation.  The results show the performance improvement obtained by using the proposed method compared to traditional methods and label-only conditional generative models.", "section": "4.2 Overall Performance"}, {"figure_path": "ZCygNDMIII/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation Studies.
