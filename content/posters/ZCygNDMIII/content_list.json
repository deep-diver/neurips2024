We observe that the seizure signals from different patients can be divided into two categories regarding the fundamental frequency patterns. One is with clear fundamental frequency, which might be associated with the repetitive firing patterns of neurons in a specific brain region. We call it Clear Seizure. The other category has chaotic, noisy signals and blury fundamental frequency, which might be related to different brain regions contribute varying frequencies and patterns simultaneously. We call it Chaotic Seizure. In this case study, we manually select 10 patients of clear seizure as the traing set, and select 10 patients of chaotic seizure as the validation set. To augment the training data, we set the varying range of contrast, entropy, and fundamental frequency amplitude at $[10\\%,\\,25\\%]$ , $[10\\%$ , $40\\%]$ , and $[-25\\%$ , $-10\\%]$ respectively, while keeping the other metrics unchanged.

This means our choices are based on observation and experience on the limited IoT sensing datasets, which might introduce bias or overlook potential correlations within certain metrics and the data. Also, when new sensing applications are involved or sensing modalities are introduced, the functionality of these metrics need to be empirically validated again, which is inefficient. We envision the development of an improved method for assessing metric importance to mitigate this issue. For instance, we could identify a broader set of potential metrics and analyze their correlations with the discriminative features identified by the downstream model.
