(a) Increasing contrast enhances the distinction between peak and valley values, while decreasing contrast reduces the differences, making high and low energy areas less pronounced. (b) Higher flatness results in a uniform and consistent energy distribution across the spectrum; lower flatness leads to pronounced interleaving between peaks and valleys, exhibiting stronger harmonic patterns. (c) Higher entropy creates a more random or chaotic energy distribution, whereas lower entropy results in a simpler and more predictable spectrogram appearance.
