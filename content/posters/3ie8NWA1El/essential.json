Current linear aggregation methods struggle to handle this, limiting performance.  \nThis paper introduces HyperPrism, a novel non-linear aggregation framework that tackles these limitations.  **HyperPrism employs Kolmogorov Means for distributed mirror descent, leveraging adaptive mapping functions (via hypernetworks) to optimize model aggregation.** This adaptive approach handles model discrepancies and data heterogeneity effectively.", "affiliation": "Shanghai University of Electric Power", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3ie8NWA1El/podcast.wav"}
