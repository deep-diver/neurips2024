For classification, \u03c3(\u03b1) denotes the softmax of logit h(x). \u2020 denotes exact eigenvalues rather than upper bounds.", "description": "This table presents upper bounds for the maximum eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and its higher-order moments (specifically the fourth-order moment) for two common exponential family distributions used in machine learning: the Gaussian distribution (for regression) and the categorical distribution (for classification).  The upper bounds are given in terms of sufficient statistics of these distributions and highlight the tradeoffs involved in choosing estimators of the FIM based on their respective variances.", "section": "4 Practical Variance Estimation"}]
