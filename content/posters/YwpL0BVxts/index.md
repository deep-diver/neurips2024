### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used but their intellectual property (IP) is vulnerable to theft.  Existing fingerprinting methods are often ineffective, especially against techniques designed to remove these fingerprints. These single-point methods fail because they are highly susceptible to changes in a model's decision boundary.  Such changes, introduced by attackers, can render these existing fingerprints invalid and cause a large number of false positives, mistakenly identifying innocent models as stolen. 

ADV-TRA, a novel fingerprinting scheme, uses adversarial trajectories instead of single points to characterize the model. These trajectories, built from a series of progressively adversarial samples, are much more robust to boundary changes.  The method also incorporates dynamically adjusted step sizes and generates a ‚Äòsurface trajectory‚Äô encompassing multiple classes, enhancing uniqueness and reducing querying costs. ADV-TRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in distinguishing between infringing and innocent models on multiple datasets and against various attack types, offering a robust and efficient IP protection solution.

> This figure compares single-point fingerprinting with the proposed trajectory fingerprinting method.  When the decision boundary of a model changes (e.g., due to a removal attack), single-point samples near the boundary become invalid and lose their effectiveness for model verification. However, the trajectory-based approach is more robust; even with boundary alterations, the majority of the trajectory samples remain effective because they represent a range of adversarial examples across the boundary rather than single points.

> This table presents the main experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  It compares the performance of ADV-TRA against four existing model fingerprinting techniques (IPGuard, CAE, UAP, Ours) under various removal attacks (model pruning with different pruning rates, adversarial training with different budgets, and fine-tuning with different layers and training methods). The table shows the accuracy, mutation rate (rmut), and fingerprint detection rate for both positive (infringing) and negative (innocent) models, highlighting the superior performance of the proposed ADV-TRA in accurately distinguishing between them.





### In-depth insights


#### Adv-TRA: Robustness
The robustness of Adv-TRA, a novel fingerprinting scheme for deep neural networks, is a critical aspect of its design.  **Its strength lies in leveraging adversarial trajectories**, which unlike single-point methods, offer resilience against decision boundary alterations caused by removal attacks (fine-tuning, pruning, adversarial training, and model extraction).  These trajectories, formed from a series of progressively adversarial samples, capture richer boundary information, enabling more accurate and robust model identification.  **The incorporation of dynamically adjusted step sizes** further enhances robustness by focusing on subtle details near the boundary while efficiently navigating toward it. This adaptive approach effectively reduces the querying cost and allows ADV-TRA to better tolerate greater degrees of alteration in the decision boundary. **The use of a surface trajectory**, comprised of multiple fixed-length trajectories across multiple classes, significantly mitigates the risk of false positives by generating a more holistic representation of the model's decision surface, enhancing its uniqueness and overall robustness. Through this multifaceted design, Adv-TRA demonstrably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in distinguishing between infringing and innocent models under various removal attacks.

#### Trajectory Design
Effective trajectory design is crucial for robust model fingerprinting.  The core idea revolves around generating adversarial trajectories, **not isolated single-point samples**, to characterize model decision boundaries. This approach enhances robustness against removal attacks that alter the decision boundary.  A key innovation is the use of **dynamically adjusted step sizes** during trajectory generation, ensuring that trajectories efficiently reach the decision boundary without excessive queries.  The design incorporates **fixed-length trajectories** for controllability and cost efficiency and aims to capture the global fingerprint of the model by using multiple trajectories that traverse across multiple classes, creating a **surface trajectory** for comprehensive model representation, thus greatly reducing false positives.

#### Removal Attacks
Removal attacks, aimed at circumventing model fingerprinting, pose a significant challenge to intellectual property protection of deep neural networks.  These attacks strategically modify the model's parameters or structure to invalidate previously generated fingerprints, thus rendering verification methods ineffective. **Common removal attack strategies** include fine-tuning, pruning, adversarial training, and model extraction.  Fine-tuning and retraining adjust model parameters, while pruning reduces model size, and adversarial training enhances model robustness against adversarial examples that are often used to create fingerprints. Model extraction, on the other hand, involves creating a new model that mimics the original's functionality without directly copying its parameters.  The effectiveness of each attack varies, depending on the model's architecture, training data, and the specific fingerprinting technique employed.  **Robust fingerprinting methods** must therefore incorporate strategies to mitigate the impact of these attacks, such as creating fingerprints that are less sensitive to model modifications or using multiple diverse fingerprints to increase resilience against individual attack strategies.  **Developing effective defenses** against removal attacks remains a critical area of research for securing deep learning models.

#### Global Fingerprint
The concept of a "Global Fingerprint" in the context of deep neural network (DNN) security is intriguing.  It suggests moving beyond the limitations of localized fingerprinting techniques, which are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks and model alterations. A global fingerprint would ideally capture a more holistic representation of the DNN's architecture and learned features, enabling more robust model verification. This could involve analyzing higher-level representations within the network, or employing techniques that are less sensitive to specific decision boundaries. The challenge, however, lies in designing a global fingerprint that is both unique to the model and computationally efficient. **Successfully creating a global fingerprint would represent a significant advance in DNN IP protection, offering improved resilience against sophisticated attacks and unauthorized model replication.**  However, **such a system needs careful consideration of computational costs** and the potential for false positives.  A balance must be struck between the robustness of the fingerprint and the feasibility of its implementation in real-world scenarios.  Further research into feature extraction methods, dimensionality reduction, and robust comparison techniques is crucial to realizing this vision.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on deep neural network fingerprinting could explore several avenues.  **Improving the efficiency of trajectory generation** is crucial, potentially through more sophisticated optimization algorithms or exploration of alternative sampling strategies to reduce the number of queries needed. **Investigating the robustness of ADV-TRA against more sophisticated removal attacks** is paramount.  The current study used four types of attacks; expanding this to include more advanced combinations and techniques, such as those leveraging generative models, would strengthen the analysis.  **Generalizing ADV-TRA to diverse DNN architectures and model types** beyond the image classification models investigated is another priority.  This would involve exploring how the trajectory approach adapts to different model structures and tasks, such as those commonly found in natural language processing or time series analysis.  Finally, **developing a more formal theoretical framework** to provide guarantees for the uniqueness and robustness of the generated fingerprints is needed, complementing the experimental evaluations with solid theoretical grounding.

> This figure illustrates the process of model stealing and verification. The model owner trains a source model and deploys it as a cloud service or client-sided software. The attacker attempts to steal the source model in either black-box or white-box ways. Then, the attacker can leverage removal attacks to modify the model to evade the IP infringement detection. The model owner verifies the ownership of a suspect model by querying it with a set of fingerprinting samples. Based on the output results, the owner selects a testing metric and computes it to make the final judgment.

> This figure illustrates the workflow of the proposed ADV-TRA model for fingerprinting DNNs.  It shows the process of generating adversarial trajectories, which starts with a base sample from one class and progressively moves toward another class, probing the decision boundary and creating fixed-length trajectories with dynamically adjusted step sizes. This results in a surface trajectory, a series of fixed-length trajectories spanning across multiple classes to capture global features. In the verification phase, this surface trajectory is used to determine if a suspect model is stolen from the source model by calculating the mutation rate.

The results are shown for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets.  A trajectory spanning only two classes is equivalent to a bilateral trajectory.  Increasing the number of classes generally improves performance, though the effect is less pronounced on ImageNet, likely due to the greater complexity of the decision boundary in datasets with more classes.
