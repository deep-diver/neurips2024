Accurate detection of nearby vehicles is a crucial safety requirement of self-driving cars. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in crafting adversarial camouflage to attack vehicle detection systems. Most current research uses a 3D simulation environment [3] to generate 2D rendered vehicle images with various transformations to develop robust adversarial camouflage. Early works of adversarial camouflage against vehicle detection are mostly black-box because the rendering process of the traditional rendering method is non-differentiable. The first work of vehicle adversarial camouflage [25] CAMOU trains a neural network to mimic the behavior of both the rendering and detection of the camouflage vehicles.

The optimization space for adversarial attacks decreases when increasing naturalness of the attack. Therefore, increasing naturalness will typically decrease attack performance.

To illustrate this trade-off, we generated adversarial UV texture images with the same text prompt but different norm threshold settings for the adversarial features. In addition, we conduct a subjective survey to rank the naturalness of the images and their relevance regarding the text prompt. Table 6 shows the average rank of each image, its corresponding $\\operatorname{AP}@0.5$ , and the norm threshold settings.
