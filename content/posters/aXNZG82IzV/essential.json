This paper introduces Customizable and Natural Camouflage Attack (CNCA), which utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more realistic and customizable adversarial camouflage.  Existing methods struggle to produce visually convincing camouflage while maintaining effectiveness against detectors.  The pixel-level optimization process results in attention-grabbing patterns. \n\nCNCA addresses this by leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model and incorporating user-specified text prompts for customization.  An adversarial feature is combined with text prompts to guide the diffusion model, while a clipping strategy balances naturalness and attack effectiveness. Experiments demonstrate CNCA produces significantly more natural-looking camouflage than existing methods, achieving competitive attack performance in both digital and physical settings.  The ability to generate custom styles, validated through user studies, showcases CNCA\u2019s significant advance in this field.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "aXNZG82IzV/podcast.wav"}
