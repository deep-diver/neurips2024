We then present a series of experiments showing   \n8 settings in which this and other unsupervised methods result in classifiers that   \n9 do not predict knowledge, but instead predict a different prominent feature.

As a shorthand for the real-world   \n18 information encoded in the weights of an LLM we could say that the LLM encodes knowledge.   \n19 Accessing that knowledge is hard, because the factual statements an LLM outputs do not reliably   \n20 describe it [23, 2, 32]. For example, LLMs might repeat common misconceptions [26] or strategically   \n21 deceive users [36]. If we could elicit the latent knowledge of an LLM [11] it would allow us to detect   \n22 and mitigate \u201cdishonesty\u201d [17]. It would also help when supervising outputs that are difficult to   \n23 understand as well as improving scientific understanding of the inner workings of LLMs. Importantly,   \n24 this must be done without supervision because we lack a ground truth for what the model \u201cknows\u201d,   \n25 as opposed to what we know.   \n26 Contrast-consistent search (CCS) [9] is a prominent method proposed to address this problem by   \n27 assuming that \u201cknowledge\u201d satisfies a consistency structure that few other features in an LLM are   \n28 likely to satisfy. They use this consistency to construct a classifier which they claim detects a model\u2019s   \n29 latent knowledge, a claim which is widely repeated in the literature (see Appendix B). We refute   \n30 these claims by identifying classes of LLM features that also satisfy this consistency structure but are   \n31 not knowledge. We prove two theorems: 1) a class of arbitrary binary classifiers are optimal under   \n32 the CCS loss; 2) any classifier can be transformed to an arbitrary classifier with the same CCS loss.   \n33 The upshot is that the CCS consistency structure is more than just slightly imprecise in identifying   \n34 knowledge\u2014it is compatible with arbitrary patterns.   \n35 We then show that other unsupervised methods in addition to CCS empirically do not discover   \n36 knowledge, regardless of any inductive biases that might hypothetically be present. Two didactic   \n37 experiments show that these methods can latch onto artificial distracting features instead of knowledge.   \n38 Our third experiment moves towards realism by showing that these knowledge-discovery methods   \n39 can latch onto implicit opinions. The fourth is almost fully natural: we show that the method\u2019s results   \n40 are highly sensitive to reasonable prompt variants which have been used in the literature.   \n41 We conclude that existing unsupervised knowledge-discovery methods are insufficient in practice, and   \n42 we propose principles for evaluating knowledge elicitation methods to prevent future \u201cfalse-positives\u201d   \n43 in the literature. We hypothesise that our conclusions will generalise to more sophisticated methods,   \n44 though perhaps not the exact experimental results: using different consistency structures of knowledge   \n45 will likely suffer from similar issues to what we show here. Our key contributions are as follows:   \n46 \u2022 We prove that arbitrary features satisfy the CCS loss equally well.   \n47 \u2022 We show that unsupervised methods detect prominent features that are not knowledge.   \n48 \u2022 We show that the features discovered by unsupervised methods are sensitive to prompts and   \n49 that we lack principled reasons to pick any particular prompt.

We focus on methods that train probes [1] using LLM activation   \n52 data. This data is constructed using contrast pairs [9]. A contrast pair is a pair of strings with opposite   \n53 \u2018claim\u2019 for some characteristic of interest which can be used to study the contrast in how an LLM   \n54 represents that characteristic. For example, a contrast pair might be \u201cAre cats mammals? Yes.\u201d and   \n55 \u201cAre cats mammals? No.\u201d Potentially, pairs like this could then be used to study how LLMs represent   \n56 correctly/incorrectly answered questions.   \n57 Burns et al. [9] show how to generate such contrast pairs from a dataset of binary questions, $Q=$   \n58 $\\{q_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ , such as \u201cAre cats mammals?\u201d by, for example, appending \u201cYes.\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d for a positive   \n59 and negative member of a contrast pair $(x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})$ . The LLM\u2019s representations of each member of   \n60 the pair can then be computed by looking at the activations from an intermediate layer after the   \n61 sequence of tokens, $\\phi(x_{i}^{+})$ and $\\phi(x_{i}^{-})$ . If one just looked at these activations, their differences might   \n62 be dominated just by the presence of the tokens \u201cYes.\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d Burns et al. [9] therefore propose a   \n63 normalisation step which strips away the average effect of those tokens across the dataset: setting   \n64 $\\tilde{\\phi}(x_{i}^{+/-}):=\\big(\\phi(x_{i}^{+/-})-\\mu^{+/-}\\big)/\\sigma^{+/-}$ where $\\mu^{+/-}$ , $\\sigma^{+/-}$ are $\\{\\phi(x_{i}^{+/-})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ \u2019s mean and standard   \n65 deviation.

Our key insight is that   \n98 the CCS loss is low just because of this XOR, not the sentiment, and so the same construction can   \n99 work for arbitrary features of the question: given some feature $h$ , the probe $p(x_{i}^{\\pm})=h(q_{i})\\oplus c(x_{i}^{\\pm})$   \n100 gets low CCS loss and has an induced probe $h$ .   \n101 Theorem 1. Let feature $h:Q\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ , be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let   \n102 $(x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})$ be the contrast pair corresponding to question $q_{i}$ and let $c(x_{i}^{+})=1,c(x_{i}^{+})=0$ .

The proof comes directly from   \n107 inserting our constructive probes into the loss definition\u2014equal terms cancel to zero (see Appendix A).   \n108 In Thm. 1, the probe $p$ is binary since $h$ is binary, but in practice probe outputs are produced by a   \n109 sigmoid and so are in $(0,1)$ . Can we say anything about this setting? We show that it is possible to   \n110 transform a soft probe for one feature into a soft probe for any other arbitrary feature. In the binary   \n111 case, the desired probe for feature $h_{1}$ is $p_{1}=h_{1}\\oplus c_{!}$ , and the desired probe for $h_{2}$ is $h_{2}\\oplus c$ .

After   \n115 this, the transformation between probes works as desired, proving that there is an arbitrary classifier   \n116 encoded by a probe with identical CCS loss to the original:   \n117 Theorem 2. Let $g\\;:\\;Q\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\{0,1\\}$ , be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let   \n118 $(x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})$ be the contrast pair corresponding to question $q_{i}$ .

These theorems prove that optimal arbitrary probes   \n124 exist, but not necessarily that they are actually learned or that they are expressible in the probe\u2019s   \n125 function space. But for inductive biases, no robust argument ensures the desired behaviour. The   \n126 feature that is most prominent\u2014favoured by inductive biases\u2014could turn out to be knowledge,   \n127 but it could equally turn out to be the contrast-pair mapping itself (which is partly removed by   \n128 normalisation) or anything else.

Unless otherwise noted, experiments follow details below.   \n136 Datasets. We investigate three datasets used by Burns et al. [9].3 The IMDb dataset of movie reviews   \n137 classifies positive/negative sentiment [28], BoolQ [13] answers yes/no questions about a passage,   \n138 DBpedia [3] is text topic-classification. Prompt templates for each dataset are in Appendix C.1.4   \n139 Language Models. We use three different language models. To directly compare to Burns et al.   \n140 [9] we use T5-11B, [34] with 11 billion parameters. We further use an instruction fine-tuned version   \n141 of T5-11B called T5-FLAN-XXL, [12] to understand the effect of instruction fine-tuning. Both   \n142 are encoder-decoder architectures, and we use the encoder output for our activations. We also use   \n143 Chinchilla-70B [21], with 70 billion parameters, which is larger scale, and a decoder-only architecture.   \n144 We take activations from layer 30 (of 80) of this model, though see Appendix D.2.3 for results on   \n145 other layers, often giving similar results. Notably, K-means and PCA have good performance at layer   \n146 30 with less seed-variance than CCS, suggesting contrast pairs and standard unsupervised learning,   \n147 rather than the CCS consistency structure, are key (see Footnote 2).   \n148 Experiment Setup.

We then generate contrastive activations and train probes using the methods   \n151 in Section 2: CCS, PCA, k-means, random and logistic regression. Training details can be found   \n152 in Appendix C.3. For each method we use 50 random seeds. Our figures in general come in two   \n153 types: violin plots which compare the accuracy of different methods; and three-dimensional PCA   \n154 projections of the activations to visualise how they are grouped.

Default prompts are   \n200 blue and modified prompts (containing Alice\u2019s opinion) are red.

While this is   \n214 more realistic than Banana/Shed, it is still rather artificial in the sense we do not expect real datasets   \n215 to have such a clear syntactical textual binary feature. In the next experiment for the modified prompt   \n216 we instead explain Alice\u2019s position in general, and keep that the same in all instances, making it more   \n217 of an implicit, semantic rather than syntactic feature.   \n218 We use the DBpedia topic classification dataset [3] to construct a binary classification task to classify   \n219 the topic of a text from two choices. There are fourteen categories such as company, animal, flim. In   \n220 the default case contrast pairs are constructed using a simple few-shot prompt setting up the task of   \n221 identifying the topic of a sentence with the character \u201cAlice\u201d answering the questions correctly.   \n222 In the modified setting5, Alice answers the few-shot examples correctly, except when topic is company   \n223 \u2013 and in that case gives explanations like \u201c[...] Alice always says the wrong answer when the topic of   \n224 the text is company, because she doesn\u2019t like capitalism [...]\u201d. What we are looking for is what the   \n225 unsupervised methods predict on the final example when Alice has not yet stated an opinion: will it   \n226 predict the correct answer, ignoring how Alice previously answered incorrectly about company; or   \n227 will it predict Alice\u2019s opinion, answering incorrectly about company?   \n228 To highlight the effect, we use a subset dataset where $50\\%$ of sentences are about \u201ccompany\u201d,   \n229 and $50\\%$ have one of the remaining thirteen categories (non-company) as a topic. We apply truth  \n230 disambiguation only to the subset with non-company topics, so that we can see the possible effect of   \n231 predicting incorrectly on company data (otherwise the assignment might be flipped).   \n232 Our results are shown in Figure 4. We look at default prompts (blue) and modified prompts (red)   \n233 and split the data into whether the topic is company (dark) or non-company (light) and look at the   \n234 standard ground-truth accuracy metric. The default setting (blue) produces high accuracy classifiers   \n235 both when the topic is company (dark blue) and other categories (light blue). In the modified setting   \n236 (red) CCS gives a bimodal distribution when the topic is company (dark red), with almost half of the   \n237 probes (differing only in random initialisation) predicting Alice\u2019s opinion, rather than the actual topic.   \n238 In contrast, it performs well over all other categories (light red) and so is not just an ordinary failure.   \n239 Other unsupervised methods are less sensitive to the modified setting, scoring high accuracy when   \n240 the topic is company.   \n241 However, when we visualise the first three PCA dimensions of the contrast pair activations (Figure 4b)   \n242 we see four distinct clusters in the modified prompt case (right) showing how a detector might cluster   \n243 either the actual topic choice (orange vs blue) or based on the data subset: non-company vs company   \n244 (light vs dark).

An important part of this is to elicit latent knowledge from a model [11]. There has   \n272 been some debate as to whether LLMs \u201cknow/believe\u201d anything [6, 37, 24] but, for us, the important   \n273 thing is that something in an LLM\u2019s weights causes it to make consistently successful predictions,   \n274 and we would like to access that. Zou et al. [40] train unsupervised probes for a range of concepts   \n275 including honesty, using pairs which need not take opposite truth values (as in Burns et al. [9]).   \n276 Belrose et al. [5] use unsupervised probes on intermediate LLM layers to elicit latent predictions.   \n277 Others (see [19] and references therein) aim to detect when a model has knowledge/beliefs about the   \n278 world, to improve truthfulness.   \n279 Contrast-consistent search (CCS) [9] attempts to elicit latent knowledge using unsupervised learning   \n280 on contrastive LLM activations (see Section 2), claiming that knowledge has special structure that   \n281 can be used as an objective function which, when optimised, will discover latent knowledge. We   \n282 have refuted this claim, theoretically and empirically, showing that CCS performs similarly to other   \n283 unsupervised methods which do not use special structure of knowledge. Emmons [16] also observe   \n284 this from the empirical data provided in [9]. Huben [22] hypothesises there could be many truth-like   \n285 features, due to LLMs ability to role-play [38], which a method like CCS might find. Roger [35]   \n286 discover multiple knowledge-like classifiers. Levinstein and Herrmann [24] finds that CCS sometimes   \n287 learns features uncorrelated with truth, arguing that consistency alone cannot guarantee truth. Fry   \n288 et al. [18] modify CCS to improve accuracy despite probes clustering around 0.5, casting doubt on   \n289 the probabilistic interpretation of CCS probes. In contrast to all these works, we prove theoretically   \n290 that CCS does not optimise for knowledge, and show empirically what non-knowledge features CCS   \n291 instead finds.   \n292 Our focus in this paper has been on unsupervised learning, though several other methods to train   \n293 probes to discover latent knowledge use supervised learning [4, 25, 29, 39, 14]. Following Burns et al.   \n294 [9] we also reported results using a supervised logistic regression baseline, which we have found   \n295 to work well on all our experiments, and which is simpler than in those cited works. Our result is   \n296 analogous to the finding that disentangled representations seemingly cannot be identified without   \n297 supervision [27]. There are also attempts to detect dishonesty by supervised learning on LLM outputs   \n298 under conditions that produce honest or dishonest generations [31]. We do not compare directly to   \n299 this, focusing instead on methods that search for features in activation-space.

Perhaps future unsupervised methods could leverage additional structure beyond negation  \n311 consistency, and so truly identify the model\u2019s knowledge? While we expect that such methods could   \n312 avoid the most trivial distractors, we speculate that they will nonetheless be vulnerable to similar   \n313 critiques. The main reason is that we expect powerful models to be able to simulate the beliefs   \n314 of other agents [38]. Since features that represent agent beliefs will naturally satisfy consistency   \n315 properties of knowledge, methods that add new consistency properties could still learn to detect such   \n316 features rather than the model\u2019s own knowledge. Indeed, in Figures 3 and 4, we show that existing   \n317 methods produce probes that report the opinion of a simulated character.7   \n318 Another response could be to acknowledge that there will be some such features, but they will be   \n319 few in number, and so you can enumerate them and identify the one that represents the model\u2019s   \n320 knowledge [8]. Conceptually, we disagree: language models can represent many features [15], and it   \n321 seems likely that features representing the beliefs of other agents would be quite useful to language   \n322 models. For example, for predicting text on the Internet, it is useful to have features that represent the   \n323 beliefs of different political groups, different superstitions, different cultures, various famous people,   \n324 and more.   \n325 Conclusion. Existing unsupervised methods are insufficient for discovering latent knowledge,   \n326 though constructing contrastive activations may still serve as a useful interpretability tool. We   \n327 contribute sanity checks for evaluating methods using modified prompts and metrics for features   \n328 which are not knowledge. Unsupervised approaches have to overcome the identification issues we   \n329 outline, while supervised approaches have the problem of requiring accurate human labels even in   \n330 the case of models that know things human overseers do not. The relative difficulty of each remains   \n331 unclear. Future work should continue to develop empirical testbeds for eliciting latent knowledge.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

Broader Impacts   \n643 Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative   \n644 societal impacts of the work performed?   \n645 Answer: [No]   \n646 Justification: We do not foresee a negative social impact to understanding the limitations of   \n647 existing methods in use.   \n648 Guidelines:   \n649 \u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n650 \u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal   \n651 impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.   \n652 \u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses   \n653 (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations   \n654 (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific   \n655 groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.   \n656 \u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied   \n657 to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to   \n658 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n659 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n660 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n661 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n662 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n663 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n664 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n665 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n666 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n667 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n668 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n669 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n670 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n671 11. Safeguards   \n672 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible   \n673 release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,   \n674 image generators, or scraped datasets)?   \n675 Answer: [NA]   \n676 Justification: There are no such risks of misuse.   \n677 Guidelines:   \n678 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.   \n679 \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with   \n680 necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring   \n681 that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing   \n682 safety filters.   \n683 \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors   \n684 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n685 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n686 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n687 faith effort.   \n688 12. Licenses for existing assets   \n689 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in   \n690 the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and   \n691 properly respected?   \n692 Answer: [Yes]   \n693 Justification: The original owners are properly credited where used.   \n694 Guidelines:   \n695 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.   \n696 \u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.   \n697 \u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a   \n698 URL.   \n699 \u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.   \n700 \u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of   \n701 service of that source should be provided.   \n702 \u2022 If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the   \n703 package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets   \n704 has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the   \n705 license of a dataset.   \n706 \u2022 For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of   \n707 the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.   \n708 \u2022 If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to   \n709 the asset\u2019s creators.   \n710 13. New Assets   \n711 Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation   \n712 provided alongside the assets?   \n713 Answer: [NA]   \n714 Justification: This paper does not release new assets.   \n715 Guidelines:   \n716 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.   \n717 \u2022 Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their   \n718 submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,   \n719 limitations, etc.   \n720 \u2022 The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose   \n721 asset is used.   \n722 \u2022 At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either   \n723 create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.   \n724 14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects   \n725 Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper   \n726 include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as   \n727 well as details about compensation (if any)?   \n728 Answer: [NA]   \n729 Justification: No human subjects were used.   \n730 Guidelines:   \n731 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with   \n732 human subjects.   \n733 \u2022 Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu  \n734 tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be   \n735 included in the main paper.   \n736 \u2022 According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,   \n737 or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data   \n738 collector.   \n739 15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human   \n740 Subjects   \n741 Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether   \n742 such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)   \n743 approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or   \n744 institution) were obtained?   \n745 Answer: [NA]   \n746 Justification: No human subjects were used.   \n747 Guidelines:   \n748 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with   \n749 human subjects.   \n750 \u2022 Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)   \n751 may be required for any human subjects research.
