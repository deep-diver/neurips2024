In the context of linear bandits, existing approaches often assume that these tasks are sufficiently diverse, which is often unrealistic. This assumption simplifies the problem, enabling the development of algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. However, it limits the applicability of these algorithms to real-world scenarios where such an assumption doesn't hold. This paper addresses this limitation by studying sequential multi-task linear bandits without the task diversity assumption.\nThe paper introduces a novel algorithm called BOSS (Bandit Online Subspace Selection) that tackles the challenges of sequential learning.  BOSS utilizes a clever bi-level approach to address the problem.  The algorithm learns a low-rank representation that captures the shared structure across tasks without assuming diversity. The paper also provides theoretical guarantees, establishing that the meta-regret of BOSS is significantly lower than previous methods under more general assumptions.  The result is demonstrated empirically on synthetic data.", "affiliation": "University of Arizona", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2kZMtdjzSV/podcast.wav"}
