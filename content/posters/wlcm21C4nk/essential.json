BPTT requires significant memory and computational resources, particularly when dealing with long temporal dependencies inherent in SNNs. This limits the scalability and applicability of SNNs, especially in resource-constrained environments.\nThis paper introduces rate-based backpropagation, a novel training method designed to overcome these limitations.  By focusing on average firing rates (rate coding) rather than precise spike timings, the new approach streamlines the computational graph and reduces memory and time demands.  The researchers demonstrate through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that rate-based backpropagation achieves comparable performance to BPTT while substantially improving training efficiency.  Their findings pave the way for training larger and more complex SNNs, expanding the potential applications of this biologically inspired computing paradigm.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wlcm21C4nk/podcast.wav"}
