In each plot, the X-axis are time steps in [1, 104] and the Y-axis is cumulative regret. AL stands for AdaLinUCB and SL stands for SparseLinUCB.", "description": "This figure shows the experimental results comparing the performance of AdaLinUCB and SparseLinUCB with OFUL under different sparsity levels (S = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16).  Each plot displays cumulative regret against the time steps.  The shaded area represents the one standard deviation bound across 20 repetitions for each algorithm. AdaLinUCB consistently outperforms OFUL and SparseLinUCB across all sparsity levels.", "section": "Model selection experiments"}]
