As described in Section 3.1, the process begins by training a flow matching model, denoted as \u03b8ref, using an arbitrary pre-defined Gaussian path. Next, as outlined in Section 3.2, we construct a preference dataset, Dpair, by evaluating the distances between generated samples xij and the ground structure xi under a given context condition Ci\u2014such as an antibody sequence or crystal composition. These samples are derived from the reference training set Dref. This dataset is then used to fine-tune the model \u03b8opt through the DPO training objective LDPO, detailed in Section 3.3.", "description": "This figure illustrates the FlowDPO pipeline, showing three stages: (a) training flow models with different Gaussian paths (VE, VP, OT), (b) constructing a preference dataset by comparing generated structures with ground truth, and (c) direct preference optimization to refine the model.  The model uses context (Ci) and pre-trained flow models (\u03b8ref) to generate multiple candidates (xij) for each ground truth structure (xi).  The distance between generated and ground truth structures determines the preference dataset (Dpair), used to fine-tune the model (\u03b8opt) via direct preference optimization (LDPO).", "section": "3 FlowDPO"}, {"figure_path": "EpusiLXfNd/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Graphical depiction of antibody variable domains, which consist of a heavy chain and a light chain.

Each chain contains four framework regions (FRs) and three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are involved in antigen binding.

Crystals are characterized by the periodic repetition of a unit cell in three-dimensional space. The unit cell is the smallest repeating structural unit that contains the complete pattern of the crystal structure.  The figure visually shows a unit cell with different colored atoms, representing different elements, arranged in a specific pattern. The dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the unit cells, which extend infinitely in all three dimensions.
