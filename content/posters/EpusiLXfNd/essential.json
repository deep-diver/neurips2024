Existing generative models often suffer from insufficient exploration of probability paths and persistent hallucinations during sampling, hindering their accuracy. \n\nFlowDPO tackles these challenges by introducing a novel framework that uses flow matching models to explore multiple probability paths. It then employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine the model, generating structures that closely align with the ground truth.  **Theoretical analysis demonstrates the compatibility of DPO with arbitrary Gaussian paths, thereby enhancing the model's universality**. Extensive experiments on antibodies and crystals validate FlowDPO's superior performance over existing methods, showcasing its potential to advance the field of 3D structure prediction.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "EpusiLXfNd/podcast.wav"}
