It shows a communication network of 5 agents (nodes), each holding potentially different datasets. Agent dynamics are visualized, showing how agent j samples data independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), while agent i samples data according to a Markovian trajectory.  Different communication patterns (represented by the matrix Wn) are also depicted. The figure highlights the heterogeneous nature of sampling strategies across agents, and how they affect the convergence of the UD-SGD algorithm.", "section": "Versatile Communication Patterns {Wn}:"}, {"figure_path": "j6Zsoj544N/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Binary classification problem.
