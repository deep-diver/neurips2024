Samples from the target density for the 4-mode Gaussian mixture example.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of four different sampling methods on a 4-mode Gaussian mixture.  MFM (Markovian Flow Matching), FAB (Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap), DDS (Denoising Diffusion Sampler), and NF-MCMC (Adaptive Monte Carlo with Normalizing Flows) are compared. The plot shows samples generated by each method overlaid on the true density contours, visualizing how well each method captures the multimodality of the target distribution.  The figure highlights MFM's ability to effectively sample from all four modes, while others show limitations in capturing all the modes.", "section": "5.1 4-mode Gaussian mixture"}, {"figure_path": "amJyuVqSaf/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison between MFM, FAB, DDS, and NF-MCMC.
