Existing methods like MCMC often struggle with slow mixing times and getting stuck in local modes. Variational inference (VI) methods using normalizing flows offer an alternative but typically involve expensive training procedures. This work addresses these limitations.\nThe proposed Markovian Flow Matching (MFM) method cleverly integrates continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.  **MFM uses a simulation-free training objective** for the CNF, significantly improving efficiency.  **An adaptive tempering mechanism** is incorporated to effectively explore multimodal distributions. The authors establish convergence of the method to a local optimum under certain assumptions, showcasing its robustness.  **Experiments demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods**, often at a substantially lower computational cost.", "affiliation": "Lancaster University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "amJyuVqSaf/podcast.wav"}
