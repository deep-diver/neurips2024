Existing deep generative models, such as Autoregressive (AR) and Diffusion Models (DMs), each have limitations: AR models struggle with global properties while DMs can have base-pair level inaccuracies.  This paper addresses this by proposing a novel post-training sampling method called Absorb & Escape (A&E). A&E starts with samples from a Diffusion Model and then iteratively refines them using an Autoregressive Model, alternating between 'absorb' (refinement) and 'escape' (updating) steps. This combined approach leverages the strengths of both model types. \nThe A&E method showed significant improvements over existing models across multiple species, demonstrated through better motif distributions, diversity, and successful integration into genome contexts.  The experiments on 15 species clearly show that A&E generates superior quality, more diverse, and functionally realistic genomic sequences, compared to state-of-the-art AR and DM models.  The efficiency of the method makes it a practical solution for generating large numbers of high-quality genomic sequences", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XHTl2k1LYk/podcast.wav"}
