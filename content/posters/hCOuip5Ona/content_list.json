The goal in this setting is to learn a predictor that is superior to a predictor that is trained using the labeled examples alone. This framework is motivated by the high cost of obtaining annotated data on practical problems. For problems where very few labels are available, the geometry of the unlabeled data can be used to significantly improve the performance of classic machine learning models. A seminal work in graph-based semi-supervised learning is Laplace learning [38], which seeks a harmonic function that extends provided labels over the unlabeled vertices (a harmonic extension of the labeled vertices). Laplace learning and its variants have been widely applied in semi-supervised and graph-structured learning [37, 36, 2, 20].

Furthermore, in the context of classification, the labels often correspond to elements from a discrete set. In this setting, typically a thresholding operation is applied post hoc to the harmonic extension to map from continuous predictions to the discrete set of labels. This thresholding can further exacerbate the aforementioned degeneracy. Furthermore, when class sizes are imbalanced, approximate heuristics are often employed to ensure satisfaction of the volume (class-cardinality) prior [10, 19]. In particular, [19] apply efficient auction algorithms [5] to volume-constrained semisupervised learning. They do this by iteratively solving linearizations of a quadratic problem under volume and box constraints to reach a local solution. The authors claim convergence to a local solution due to monotonic decrease of the objective, although local solutions may be poor and convergence can be slow.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
