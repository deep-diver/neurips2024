These limitations arise from the degeneracy of solutions near decision boundaries, exacerbated by post-hoc thresholding to obtain discrete predictions from continuous outputs. Existing solutions like mean-shift heuristics only partially mitigate these issues and may not provide exact integer solutions. \nCutSSL is proposed as a novel framework that formulates SSL as a continuous nonconvex quadratic program.  Unlike previous methods, CutSSL is guaranteed to produce integer solutions, eliminating the need for heuristic thresholding and addressing the degeneracy problem.  It connects to Laplace learning and mean-shift heuristics, providing new insights into their performance.  CutSSL demonstrates superior performance on various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-label and imbalanced scenarios.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hCOuip5Ona/podcast.wav"}
