Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have shown promise as effective priors due to their ability to model complex data distributions.  However, using DDMs as priors leads to intricate posterior distributions that are difficult to sample from, hindering their practical application. Existing methods either involve retraining model-specific components, resulting in cumbersome procedures, or introduce approximations leading to uncontrolled errors affecting the accuracy of the samples.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework called Divide-and-Conquer Posterior Sampling (DCPS) to address this limitation.  DCPS leverages the inherent structure of DDMs to construct a sequence of simpler, intermediate posterior distributions, guiding the sampling process towards the target posterior. This approach effectively reduces approximation errors without the need for retraining. Experiments show that DCPS outperforms existing methods in various Bayesian inverse problems, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across tasks such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and JPEG dequantization.", "affiliation": "CMAP, Ecole polytechnique", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "BOrut7M2X7/podcast.wav"}
