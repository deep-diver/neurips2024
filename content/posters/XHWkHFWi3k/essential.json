Current methods either reduce steps, sacrificing quality, or use parallel-in-time methods with memory limitations. This creates a need for faster and more efficient sampling techniques.\nThis paper introduces Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS), a novel method inspired by the Parareal algorithm that leverages parallelization to speed up sample generation. **SRDS generates a quick, rough sample estimate, then iteratively refines it in parallel**, maintaining high-quality outputs. The technique is approximation-free, broadly compatible with solvers, and showcases significant speed improvements, reaching up to 4.3x faster generation on certain benchmarks. This opens avenues for real-time applications previously hindered by computational costs.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XHWkHFWi3k/podcast.wav"}
