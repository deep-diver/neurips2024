A common technique used in these works is to model the competition among creators who strive to establish their brand and comparative advantages by selecting topics that maximize the traffic or rewards from the platform. While these competition models offer valuable insights into how platforms\u2019 interventions could lead to suboptimal outcomes in terms of content diversity and issues related to popularity bias, they ignore the dimension of content creation volume \u2014 an equally critical aspect of such competition dynamics. In fact, there are evidence suggesting that traffic received directly influences creator productivity [31, 56]. A recent study on a leading video recommendation platform found that creators whose content received boosted exposure significantly increased their video production without compromising quality [31]. And a recent field experiment on a large-scale video sharing social network showed that while popularity-based recommendation strategies boost content consumption, they can reduce content production [56]. The similar effect has also been documented on Instagram. For instance, when the recommender system allocates more traffic to targeted groups of creators, their production frequency increases, as indicated by metrics such as the number of daily active creators and the daily average creation volume per group. However, disproportionately boosting traffic to certain creator groups can negatively impact others; for instance, directing more traffic to popular, or \u201chead\u201d, creators often diminishes engagement from less prominent, or \u201ctail\u201d, creators.
