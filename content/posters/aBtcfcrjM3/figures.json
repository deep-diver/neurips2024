The x-axis represents the compression rate (%), and the y-axis represents the mean test accuracy (%). Each data point represents the average accuracy across 20 different random weight initializations. The figure demonstrates that TDLRT consistently achieves higher accuracy at higher compression rates compared to the baselines and exhibits lower variance across different initializations.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "aBtcfcrjM3/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of compression performance for different models against the full baseline for the Cifar10 (a-c) and Tiny-Imagenet (d) benchmark.
