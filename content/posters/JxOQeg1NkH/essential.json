These models often lack sufficient reasoning abilities to tackle complex scenarios and require extensive resources for fine-tuning and inference, limiting their applicability in real-world robotic systems.  This necessitates developing more efficient robotic VLA models for improved performance and wider adoption. \nRoboMamba is proposed as a solution, integrating the efficient Mamba LLM to balance reasoning and action.  The authors integrate a vision encoder with Mamba, enabling visual common sense and robotic reasoning. A novel fine-tuning strategy is introduced, requiring only minimal parameter updates to achieve pose prediction abilities. Experiments show RoboMamba outperforms existing models in reasoning and manipulation tasks, with significantly faster inference speeds, making it a promising model for real-world robotic applications.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "JxOQeg1NkH/podcast.wav"}
