Implicit function-based approaches often result in misaligned meshes or unnecessary density.  Directly optimizing mesh connectivity is computationally expensive and challenging. \nDMesh overcomes these limitations by introducing a novel probabilistic approach based on weighted Delaunay triangulation.  This allows for differentiable mesh representation with arbitrary topology.  Efficient algorithms are developed for mesh reconstruction from various inputs, like point clouds and multi-view images, showing improved accuracy and computational efficiency over existing methods.
