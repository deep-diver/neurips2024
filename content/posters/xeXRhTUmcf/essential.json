This paper tackles this critical issue by focusing on improving uncertainty quantification. Existing methods rely on strong assumptions about the data distribution, limiting their applicability and accuracy.\n\nThis work introduces a novel, non-parametric method that addresses the limitations of current approaches. By combining Lens Depth and Fermat distance, it provides a more accurate uncertainty score directly in the feature space without requiring distributional assumptions or model retraining.  The method demonstrates superior performance on multiple datasets, offering a significant advancement in OOD detection and reliable prediction for safety-critical systems.", "affiliation": "Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xeXRhTUmcf/podcast.wav"}
