However, beside performance, in critical applications, one needs to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data for safety reasons. Indeed, at the inference stage, the model should only predict for data coming from the ID and reject OOD samples. For this purpose, one needs to associate a confidence (or uncertainty) score $S$ with these data so that one can reject uncertain predictions. This is referred as Out-of-domain uncertainty [5]. At the inference stage, $x$ is considered as $\\mathrm{ID}$ if $S(x)\\geqslant\\varepsilon$ (with some threshold $\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb R$ ) and OOD otherwise.

The high-level idea is to measure directly \u201chow central\u201d a point is with respect to (w.r.t.) clusters taking into account density and geometry of each cluster in the feature space. This provides an uncertainty score. For this objective, standard methods consist in assuming some prior distribution such as GDA (Gaussian Discriminant Analysis) based on Gaussian fitting [13].

Let us take the example of a simple frame in the plane with 2 clusters corresponding to 2 classes in form of two-moons (Fig. 1.1a). In this example, GDA fails totally to capture the distribution of clusters. This motivates us to develop a non-parametric method that can measure explicitly how \u201ccentral\u201d a point is w.r.t. a cluster without the need of additional training and prior assumption. Furthermore, the method should accurately capture distribution with complex support and shape, in order to be adapted to a variety of cases. To measure how central a point is w.r.t. a distribution, we use the so-called notion of statistical Lens Depth $(L D)$ [15], that will be presented in Section 3.1. Furthermore, for $L D$ to correctly capture the shape of the distribution, an appropriate distance must be adopted that adaptively takes into account its geometry and density. Fermat distance is a good candidate for this purpose. However, it is not directly tractable as it stands on integrals along rectifiable paths. A recent paper [6] proposes the use of an explicit sampled Fermat distance and shows its consistency property (see also [2]). In our work, we make use of their results to compute the $L D$ .

Hence, in between clusters, we need \u201cvery small density\u201d but not \u201czero density\u201d. However, from a practical viewpoint, in such cases, one could argue that 2 clusters of the same class should not be too distinct.

But in general, the cluster of each class should be sufficiently connected to yield an ideal result.
