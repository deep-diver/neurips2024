Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches.

For example, electricity prices are highly dependent on the supply and demand of the market, and it is intrinsically impossible to predict future prices solely based on historical data.

Regarding exogenous variables equally with endogenous ones will not only cause significant time and memory complexity but also involve unnecessary interactions from endogenous series to external information. Second, external factors may have a causal effect on endogenous series, so models are expected to reason about the systematic time lags among different variables.

A common practice to import them is adding or concatenating exogenous features to the endogenous ones. However, given the crucial role of exogenous variables in forecasting, it is imperative to incorporate them precisely and properly. Recent Transformers [32] have exhibited remarkable performance in time series forecasting due to their capability of capturing both temporal dependencies and multivariate correlations. Based on the working dimensions of the attention mechanism, existing Transformerbased works can be roughly divided into patch-oriented models and variate-oriented models. Patching is a basic module to preserve the semantic information underlying temporal variations. Therefore, the attention mechanism is applied over patches to unearth the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the channel independence assumption, PatchTST and follow-ups [28] are capable of capturing temporal dependencies but weak at capturing multivariate correlations. In contrast, variate-oriented models represented by iTransformer [23] successfully reason about interrelationships between variables by considering each variate of time series as a single token and applying attention over multiple variate tokens. Unfortunately, they lack the ability to capture internal temporal variations since the whole series is embedded into a coarse variate token by a temporal linear projection.

Based on the above observations, we believe that modeling the temporal-wise and variate-wise dependencies within time series data requires hierarchical representations at different levels. In this paper, we unleash the potential of the canonical Transformer without modifying any component, and propose a Time Series Transformer with eXogenous variables (TimeXer). Technologically, we leverage representations and perform attention mechanisms at both patch and variate levels. First, the endogenous patch-level tokens are applied to capture temporal dependencies. Second, to tackle the arbitrarily irregular exogenous variables, TimeXer adopts their variate-level representations to seamlessly ingest the impact of external factors on endogenous ones. Third, inspired by Vision Transformers [10], we introduce learnable global tokens for each endogenous series to reflect the macroscopic information of the series, which interact simultaneously with patch-level endogenous tokens and variate-level exogenous tokens. Throughout this information pathway, the external information can be propagated effectively and selectively to corresponding endogenous patches.

Due to the serial nature of time series, most previous works use a point-wise representation of time series data and apply attention mechanisms to capture the correlations among different time points. Therefore, many efficient Transformers [22, 37, 44, 45, 9] were proposed to reduce the complexity caused by point-wise modeling. Informer [44] designs a ProbSparse self-attention to reduce the quadratic complexity in time and memory. Autoformer [37] replaces canonical self-attention with Auto-correlation to discover the sub-series similarity within time series data.

Beyond capturing the patch-level temporal dependencies within one single series, recent approaches have endeavored to capture interdependencies among patches from different variables over time. Crossformer [43] introduces a Two-Stage Attention layer to efficiently capture the cross-time and cross-variate dependencies of each patch. Further expanding the receptive field, iTransformer [23] utilizes the global representation of the whole series and applies attention to these series-wise representations to capture multivariate correlations.

It is notable that previous models concatenate exogenous features with endogenous features at each time point and then map them to a latent space, necessitating the alignment of the endogenous and exogenous series in time. However, time series in real-world applications often suffer from problems such as missing value and uneven sampling, which leads to significant challenges in modeling the effects of exogenous variables on endogenous variables.

Moreover, we keep the existing embedding design and replace the cross-attention by adding the variate token of exogenous variables to the variate token of endogenous variables or concatenating all the variate tokens and temporal tokens. As listed in Table 4, TimeXer exhibits superior performance compared to various architectural designs across all datasets.

However, the attention will be distracted when the look-back length becomes excessively long. In TimeXer, we use the variate-level representation of exogenous variables which allows for the misalignment between endogenous and exogenous variables. This is particularly valuable in real-world scenarios where the time series data may be collected from a newly introduced sensor that has limited historical data. Therefore, we conducted three different experimental settings to assess the generality of TimeXer by increasing the length of either the endogenous or exogenous series, which include \u201cFix Endogenous and increase Exogenous\u201d, \u201cIncrease Endogenous and Fix exogenous\u201d, and \u201cIncrease Endogenous and Exogenous\u201d. Results shown in Figure 3 reveal that TimeXer can be adapted to situations where the look-back of endogenous and exogenous are mismatched. Moreover, extending the look-back length indeed yields improvements in forecasting performance. Compared to enlarging the historical exogenous series, increasing the look-back length of the endogenous series brings greater beneftis to the model, and the performance is further improved with both increases.

Specifically, for both exogenous and endogenous series, we adopt two strategies to evaluate TimeXer\u2019s adaptability to series with missing historical information: (1) Zeros: filling the whole series with the scalar value 0. (2) Random: substituting the whole series with random values from a uniform distribution on the interval $[0,1)$ . As shown in Table 5, the forecasting results deteriorate when exogenous variables are replaced with meaningless noise, indicating that the model\u2019s performance beneftis from the inclusion of informative exogenous variables. Interestingly, neither using zero-fliled exogenous series nor employing exogenous series with random numbers results in a significant decline in model performance. This robustness can be attributed to TimeXer\u2019s design, which uses two attention layers to model endogenous temporal dependencies and the multivariate correlations between endogenous and exogenous variables respectively. This architecture allows endogenous temporal representations to dominate the predictions, ensuring consistent performance even in the presence of uninformative exogenous data. Consequently, it can be observed that when the endogenous series is replaced with meaningless zeros or random values, rendering the time series unpredictable, there is a significant decline in model performance. This underscores that TimeXer\u2019s performance is closely tied to the quality of endogenous series, deteriorating markedly when the historical information is severely limited.

Further, we utilize meteorological indicators of corresponding adjacent areas from ERA5 [11] as exogenous variables, which is with a sampling interval of 3 hours. The adjacent area is defined as the 3x3 grid centered on the endogenous weather station, with four meteorological variables per grid cell, totaling 36 exogenous variables. We set the historical horizon of endogenous and exogenous to be 7 days to predict the endogenous variable for the next 3 days. Noteworthily, this is a complex forecasting scenario as we aforementioned where the frequencies of endogenous and exogenous are different. We choose existing state-of-the-art multivariate forecasters as baselines and use identical hidden dimensions and batch sizes for a fair comparison.

As illustrated in Figure 5 (Left), the case study on the Weather dataset reveals a notable distinction in the attention maps of endogenous variables with different exogenous variables. This demonstrates that TimeXer has the ability to distinguish between exogenous variables, allocating greater attention to those that are most informative for prediction, thereby resulting in a more focused and interpretable attention map. Additionally, it is observed that exogenous series exhibiting similar shapes to the endogenous series tend to receive more attention. This phenomenon may arise because time series with analogous shapes often share temporal features, leading to higher similarity scores. Consequently, the exogenous series most prominently highlighted by the attention mechanism may intuitively resemble the endogenous variable. Furthermore, physical interpretations for the visualized are provided.

It is notable that when faced with numerous variables TimeXer exhibits its advantage by outperforming iTransformer in terms of memory footprint. Notably, iTransformer embeds each variate series into one token and applies a self-attention mechanism among all variate tokens, whether endogenous or exogenous. Although this design can keep refining the learned variate token in multiple layers, it does cause more complexity. As for TimeXer, exogenous variables will be embedded to variate tokens at the beginning, which will be shared in all layers and interact with the endogenous global token by cross-attention. Thus, TimeXer omits the interaction among learned exogenous variate tokens, resulting in favorable efficiency. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the model efficiency in Appendix E.

For the endogenous variable, we apply patch-level temporal token and a learnable global token to capture both temporal dependencies and cross-attention between different variables. And for exogenous variables, we utilize variate-level representation directly embedded from the whole series. To verify the rationality of our proposed architecture, we modify the embedding design and inclusion of exogenous variables. In this section, we provide ablation results on long-term forecasting datasets. As shown in Table 8, among various architectural designs, TimeXer generally exhibits optimal performance. Notably, when replacing variate embedding of exogenous variables with patch embedding, prediction accuracy declines. This observation suggests that a series-wise representation of the exogenous variables is more advantageous for predicting the endogenous variable. However, it is important to note that applying patch-wise representations for all exogenous variables would significantly increase computational complexity. In contrast, TimeXer offers a more efficient and effective design. Nevertheless, we notice that on the Traffic dataset when concatenating the variate-level exogenous tokens with those endogenous tokens and performing a Self-Attention over them outperforms our proposed design.

These ablation results indicate that the interaction within exogenous variables can also be viewed as external factors that may facilitate the prediction.

As we presented in Figure 5 in the main text, our proposed TimeXer has a clear advantage when the number of exogenous variables $C$ is large and achieves a favorable balance between modeling fineness and efficiency.

Technologically, we calculate the CKA between the output features of the first and the last block obtained from TimeXer as well as other baselines. In particular, since iTransformer [23] is a multivariate forecaster that treats all variables equally, we provide the similarity corresponding to the endogenous variate in addition to the global-view CKA. As shown in Figure 9, the representations from the first and the last layers of TimeXer enjoy great similarities, verifying that TimeXer can learn the appropriate representations for the prediction. It is notable that iTransformer does not distinguish between endogenous and exogenous variables and the output of the model contains representations of all variables. However, the result of the CKA analysis shows that despite the high similarity of the series representations of all variables, the representation of the endogenous variables was not well learned.

Noteworthily, the mean absolute error (MAE) result of TimeXer is close to iTransformer, which is the state-of-the-art model on the Traffic dataset, but there is still a large margin in mean squared error (MSE). This unexpected result prompted us to further investigate. As a result, we provide a visualization of the forecasting results from TimeXer and iTransformer in Figure 10. Upon analysis, we observed that while TimeXer effectively predicted the overall trends of the future horizon, it struggled to accurately forecast the numerical value of future spikes. Subsequently, the squared calculation in MSE will amplify this error, resulting in a drastic difference compared to MAE. To further explore this performance, we also visualize the forecasting results given by PatchTST. As illustrated in Figure 10, we discover that PatchTST performs quite similarly to TimeXer. The commonality of these two models is that they both utilize patch-level representation to model the temporal dependencies, which we think might be the answer to the performance decrease. The utilization of patch-level representation in TimeXer and PatchTST contributes to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and contributes to the accurate prediction of the trends. Conversely, iTransformer focuses on the variate-wise correlation while the temporal correlation is only obtained through a linear projection. In our proposed TimeXer, we employ a linear projection over all the endogenous tokens, including multiple patch-level temporal and only one global variate-level token. Therefore it can be inferred that the excessive number of patches may make the prediction pay more attention to the overall trend change and fail to predict the precise value of changing points. Based on the above analysis, we believe that to alleviate this problem, we need to address the imbalance problem of multiple temporal tokens and only one global token, which can be solved by increasing the patch length or learnable tokens.
