### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) primarily utilize successful reasoning paths for training, neglecting valuable information from failures.  This limitation hinders optimal model performance and generalization. The existing methods also exhibit limitations in efficiency and exploration of the tool-usage space. 

This paper introduces TP-LLaMA, a novel framework that addresses these shortcomings. It leverages a step-wise preference learning approach, utilizing both successful and failed paths from decision trees to train the LLM.  This approach not only enhances data utilization but also broadens the learning space, resulting in a model that significantly outperforms baselines across various scenarios. TP-LLaMA showcases improved generalization to unseen APIs and demonstrates superior reasoning efficiency, making it more suitable for complex tool-usage tasks. **The key contribution is the introduction of a new preference dataset, ToolPreference, and the application of direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve LLM's tool usage ability.**

> This figure illustrates the workflow of the proposed inference trajectory optimization framework. It starts with user queries interacting with a real-world environment via RapidAPI Hub APIs.  A depth-first search-based decision tree explores multiple reasoning paths, some leading to success (green checkmark) and others to failure (red X).  Successful trajectories are collected and used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a pre-trained LLM.  The framework then introduces a novel method for generating preference data from both successful and failed steps of the decision tree, resulting in a ToolPreference dataset. This dataset is used with direct preference optimization (DPO) to further refine the LLM, leading to the final ToolPrefer-LLaMA (TP-LLaMA) model.

> This table presents the main experimental results comparing the performance of TP-LLaMA against several baseline models (ChatGPT, Davinci, ToolLLaMA, and LLaMA with SFT) across six different test scenarios.  The scenarios vary in the complexity of the tasks, involving single tools, intra-category multi-tools, and inter-category multi-tools.  Performance is measured using two metrics: pass rate (the probability of the model successfully providing an answer within a limited number of steps) and win rate (the likelihood that an evaluator would prefer the model's response over a reference solution).  The 'Avg' column shows the average performance across all six scenarios, providing a summary of the overall performance of each model.





### In-depth insights


#### Tool-LLM Augmentation
Tool-LLM augmentation represents a significant advancement in large language model (LLM) capabilities, aiming to bridge the gap between LLMs and the real world. By integrating external tools, often in the form of APIs, LLMs can perform complex tasks that require real-time information or interactions beyond their inherent knowledge. **This augmentation transforms LLMs from passive text processors into active agents capable of interacting with their environment.**  The depth-first search-based decision tree mechanism, as seen in ToolLLaMA, is a key enabler, facilitating multi-step reasoning through a systematic exploration of tool usage paths. However, a crucial limitation of prior approaches lies in their reliance solely on successful paths, neglecting the valuable learning opportunities embedded in failed attempts.  **The proposed inference trajectory optimization framework addresses this by incorporating insights from these errors, enhancing data utilization and model generalization.** Utilizing preference learning, the framework leverages a novel method to generate a step-wise preference dataset, which is then employed to optimize the LLM‚Äôs policy via direct preference optimization.  This leads to superior performance compared to baselines, demonstrating improved efficiency and enhanced reasoning capabilities, particularly for complex, unseen tasks.

#### Inference Tree Analysis
Inference tree analysis offers a powerful lens for understanding the decision-making processes within complex systems, especially in the context of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs). By examining the paths taken during inference, both successful and failed, **valuable insights into model strengths and weaknesses can be gleaned**.  Analyzing successful paths reveals effective reasoning strategies and highlights areas where the model excels. Conversely, studying failed paths can pinpoint **critical areas for improvement**, such as inadequate tool selection or flawed reasoning steps.  The ability to use this analysis to create a feedback mechanism for model refinement is key.  **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), for example, shows potential to effectively leverage information from both successful and unsuccessful trajectories**.  Furthermore, the process reveals opportunities to optimize both the model's policy and its efficiency by identifying unnecessary steps or redundant explorations. This approach moves beyond simple accuracy metrics, offering **a deeper, more nuanced understanding of model behavior and paving the way for more robust and efficient LLMs.**

#### Preference Learning
Preference learning, a subfield of machine learning, offers a powerful paradigm for training models by leveraging human preferences rather than explicit numerical rewards.  This is particularly valuable when reward signals are difficult or expensive to engineer, as often happens with complex tasks involving human judgment or subjective assessments. **The core idea is to learn a model that aligns with human preferences, even if the underlying reward function remains unknown.**  Instead of directly optimizing for a reward, preference learning focuses on learning a ranking or ordering that reflects human choices between different options.  Several approaches exist, such as pairwise comparisons, listwise ranking, or learning to rank.  The choice of method depends on the nature of the preference data and computational constraints.  **A key advantage is the ability to incorporate human feedback in a more natural and intuitive way**, which can lead to better generalization and robustness in real-world applications.  While simpler than traditional reinforcement learning, **preference learning can still capture complex behaviors** by modeling the relative preferences between actions. Its application to tool-augmented LLMs enhances their reasoning by learning directly from human judgments of the efficacy of different tool usage sequences.

#### TP-LLaMA Efficiency
TP-LLaMA's efficiency improvements stem from its novel inference trajectory optimization framework.  Unlike prior methods solely relying on successful trajectories, **TP-LLaMA leverages both successful and failed paths from decision trees**, generating a step-wise preference dataset. This broadened learning space, combined with direct preference optimization (DPO), allows TP-LLaMA to avoid unnecessary exploration of suboptimal branches in the decision tree.  **Experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in the average number of steps required for reasoning**, showcasing superior efficiency compared to baselines, including ToolLLaMA and models trained using only successful trajectories.  This enhanced efficiency, achieved through the effective utilization of data from inference tree errors, makes TP-LLaMA better suited for complex tool-usage reasoning tasks, enabling faster and more resource-efficient problem-solving.

#### Future Work
The paper's conclusion regarding future work highlights several promising avenues for advancement.  **Extending the research to encompass multimodal scenarios** is a key focus, aiming to leverage the combined power of different modalities for enhanced tool-augmented reasoning.  This would involve exploring more complex scenarios and tasks where multiple sensory inputs are involved, leading to a more robust and human-like interaction with tools. The researchers also plan to **incorporate more sophisticated preference learning techniques**, moving beyond current methods to refine the model's ability to choose the best actions in response to feedback.  This might involve investigating alternative algorithms or approaches to preference learning, or exploring ways to more effectively incorporate human feedback into the training process. Finally, they recognize the need for more **complex reasoning mechanisms**, particularly in addressing more intricate or nuanced challenges in the field. This could involve incorporating advanced planning algorithms, improving the representation and interpretation of knowledge, or exploring novel ways to integrate external tools with the LLM.
