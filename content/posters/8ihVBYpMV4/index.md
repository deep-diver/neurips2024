### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Autoformalization, translating natural language descriptions into formal language, is challenging. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising results but have a considerable gap between the top-1 and top-k accuracy. This means LLMs often require multiple tries before producing a correct formalization. This is inefficient and hinders real-world applications.

This research introduces a new self-consistent framework to address this issue. It ranks multiple LLM-generated formalizations by employing 'symbolic equivalence' (checking logical consistency) and 'semantic consistency' (measuring the similarity between the original and re-translated text). Extensive experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements across multiple LLMs and datasets.

> üîº The figure shows an example of how GPT-4 translates a natural language mathematical statement into a formal Isabelle language version.  The prompt is to formalize the statement 'Find the product of 0.666... and 6. The answer is 4.'  GPT-4 generates four different Isabelle code versions as possible translations. Only two of these correctly represent the mathematical statement, showing the inherent challenge of accurately translating natural language into formal mathematical language, highlighting the unreliability of the grounding step (converting recurring decimals to their fractional equivalents).

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Autoformalization
LLM autoformalization represents a significant advancement in automated reasoning, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) to translate natural language mathematical expressions into formal, machine-verifiable representations.  This process is crucial for bridging the gap between human-readable mathematical descriptions and the formal systems required for automated theorem proving and verification.  **A key challenge highlighted is the discrepancy between the accuracy of top-1 (pass@1) and top-k (pass@k) LLM generated formalizations.**  This suggests inherent limitations in the ability of LLMs to consistently produce correct formalizations in a single attempt.  To address this, the paper proposes a novel framework that incorporates methods for evaluating the self-consistency of LLM outputs through **symbolic equivalence (using automated theorem provers) and semantic consistency (measuring the similarity between the original and re-informalized text embeddings).** This dual approach aims to identify and select the most reliable formalization from multiple LLM candidates, significantly improving overall accuracy.

#### Dual Consistency
The concept of "Dual Consistency" in a research paper likely refers to a methodology that leverages two complementary approaches to improve the robustness and accuracy of a system.  **This dual approach often involves combining a more symbolic, rule-based method with a semantic, meaning-based method.** For instance, in natural language processing, one might combine a syntactic parser (symbolic) with a semantic role labeler (semantic).  The dual consistency strategy would then evaluate the results from both methods, potentially using a weighted score or some other type of reconciliation to produce a final output.  **This dual approach offers resilience against errors inherent in either individual method** and can significantly improve overall performance by combining their respective strengths. The effectiveness of this approach depends heavily on the specific problem being addressed and the choice of complementary methods.  **A well-designed dual consistency model would ideally highlight situations where the two methods disagree**, prompting further investigation or refinement of the results.  **Careful consideration of the weighting and the interaction between the two methods are crucial for achieving the desired level of consistency and accuracy.**

#### MATH & miniF2F
The datasets MATH and miniF2F are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of autoformalization techniques.  **MATH**, a more general dataset, contains diverse high school level math problems, testing the robustness of models across various problem types. In contrast, **miniF2F** focuses on more challenging problems from Olympiads. Using both datasets allows for a thorough assessment of model capabilities, identifying strengths and weaknesses: a model might perform well on MATH but falter on the more complex miniF2F, highlighting potential limitations in handling advanced mathematical reasoning or specific problem structures. **The combination provides a more comprehensive benchmark**, allowing researchers to evaluate the generalizability and scalability of their approaches to varying problem difficulty and mathematical concepts.  The results across these two datasets reveal critical information about the performance gap between simple and complex problem solving in autoformalization.

#### Synergy & Efficiency
The study investigates the synergistic relationship between two novel self-consistency methods: **symbolic equivalence** and **semantic consistency**, for enhancing the accuracy of mathematical statement autoformalization.  The results reveal a significant improvement when combining both methods compared to using either individually.  This synergy highlights that verifying logical equivalence (symbolic equivalence) and preserving original meaning (semantic consistency) are complementary approaches, effectively addressing inconsistencies across different autoformalization candidates. Furthermore, the combined approach demonstrates notable efficiency gains by minimizing the need for manual intervention in correcting and validating formalization outputs, thus reducing the overall effort in the autoformalization process. The study's focus on both synergy and efficiency underscores its practicality and potential for wider application in automated reasoning tasks.

#### Future Directions
The research paper's 'Future Directions' section would ideally delve into expanding the framework's capabilities.  **Extending support for additional theorem provers** like Lean 4 would enhance verification breadth. **Integrating more advanced or fine-tuned LLMs** such as those specializing in mathematical reasoning could significantly improve accuracy and efficiency.  A key area for advancement is **generating higher-quality, aligned datasets of informal and formal mathematical statements**. This would involve methods for automatically creating such pairs or leveraging existing resources more effectively.  Finally, exploring the **integration of external knowledge bases** to resolve ambiguities and fill knowledge gaps within the LLMs would be beneficial.  Addressing these areas will move the field closer to a robust and practical autoformalization system.
