Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising results but have a considerable gap between the top-1 and top-k accuracy. This means LLMs often require multiple tries before producing a correct formalization. This is inefficient and hinders real-world applications.\nThis research introduces a new self-consistent framework to address this issue. It ranks multiple LLM-generated formalizations by employing 'symbolic equivalence' (checking logical consistency) and 'semantic consistency' (measuring the similarity between the original and re-translated text). Extensive experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements across multiple LLMs and datasets.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "8ihVBYpMV4/podcast.wav"}
