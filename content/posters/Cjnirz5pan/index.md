### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Continual learning (CL) aims to enable models to learn new concepts without forgetting previously learned ones.  However, existing CL methods often struggle when using pre-trained models (PTMs) as the starting point.  They either lose the general knowledge inherent in PTMs or lack the plasticity to effectively learn new concepts. This is due to the direct application of parameter-efficient tuning (PET) in the first session and parameter freezing in subsequent sessions. This paper focuses on solving the issues of applying parameter-efficient tuning directly to downstream data, and freezing parameters in incremental sessions.

The proposed Slow and Fast parameter-Efficient tuning (SAFE) framework addresses this by introducing a slow learner that inherits general knowledge from PTMs and a fast learner that incorporates novel concepts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.  **SAFE employs a knowledge transfer loss to ensure the slow learner retains general knowledge, and a feature alignment loss to help the fast learner learn without forgetting.**  Experiments across seven benchmark datasets show SAFE significantly outperforms existing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### PTM Knowledge Transfer
The concept of "PTM Knowledge Transfer" in continual learning focuses on effectively leveraging the vast knowledge embedded within pre-trained models (PTMs).  Instead of treating PTMs merely as initialization, the core idea is to explicitly transfer their inherent knowledge to the continual learning model. This avoids catastrophic forgetting and enhances generalization by ensuring that the model retains and benefits from the previously learned generalizable features.  **Effective knowledge transfer strategies often involve mechanisms that align the feature representations or internal representations of the PTM and the downstream continual learning model.** This alignment can be achieved through various techniques, such as minimizing the distance between feature embeddings or maximizing correlation between activations.  A key challenge lies in striking a balance between preserving the PTM's general knowledge and adapting to new tasks, which requires careful design of loss functions and training strategies.  **Successful PTM knowledge transfer leads to significantly improved performance on downstream tasks**, particularly in class-incremental settings where new classes are continually introduced.  This approach can lead to substantial improvements over methods that simply fine-tune PTMs directly or those that rely on freezing PTM parameters altogether.**The effectiveness of PTM knowledge transfer hinges on choosing appropriate alignment mechanisms, managing the trade-off between stability and plasticity, and handling the distribution shifts between the pre-training and downstream datasets.**

#### Slow-Fast Tuning
The concept of 'Slow-Fast Tuning' in continual learning aims to address the inherent trade-off between **stability** and **plasticity**.  The 'slow' component focuses on preserving knowledge acquired from pre-trained models or earlier learning stages, emphasizing generalization and preventing catastrophic forgetting. This is often achieved by using parameter-efficient tuning methods with limited updates to key model parameters, effectively acting as a knowledge distillation process. The 'fast' component, on the other hand, is designed to adapt quickly to new information and concepts, offering the necessary plasticity. This often involves updating more parameters, but with careful regularization to maintain stability. The integration of these two components allows the model to gracefully learn new tasks without sacrificing past knowledge, providing a more robust and efficient approach to continual learning than relying solely on either slow or fast learning techniques.

#### Catastrophic Forgetting
Catastrophic forgetting, a significant challenge in continual learning, describes the phenomenon where a neural network trained on a new task largely forgets previously learned tasks.  This is especially problematic when dealing with sequential learning scenarios.  **The core issue stems from the nature of backpropagation and gradient descent**, where learning new information often overwrites existing knowledge, leading to performance degradation on older tasks.  **Strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting often involve techniques like regularization, rehearsal (replaying old data), or architectural changes**. Regularization methods, for example, constrain the network's weights to prevent drastic updates, allowing for a balance between learning new and retaining old information.  Rehearsal techniques directly address the problem by periodically reintroducing data from past tasks during training. Architecturally, techniques such as expanding the network capacity or using separate modules for different tasks can help reduce interference between knowledge representations. **The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific task, network architecture, and data characteristics.** While significant progress has been made, completely eliminating catastrophic forgetting remains an active area of research in continual learning.

#### SAFE Framework
The proposed SAFE framework offers a novel approach to continual learning, effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods.  **Its core innovation lies in the dual-learner architecture**, combining a slow learner to preserve general knowledge from pre-trained models and a fast learner to incorporate new concepts. **The slow learner, guided by a transfer loss function**, ensures that generalizable knowledge is retained.  The fast learner, in turn, employs cross-classification and feature alignment losses to avoid catastrophic forgetting while remaining plastic for novel concepts.  This synergy, further enhanced by an entropy-based aggregation strategy during inference, allows SAFE to achieve a robust balance between stability and plasticity. The framework exhibits significant improvements across various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and establishing it as a noteworthy advancement in parameter-efficient continual learning.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this continual learning work could involve exploring more sophisticated knowledge transfer mechanisms between the slow and fast learners.  **Improving the efficiency of the feature alignment loss** is crucial, potentially through the development of more advanced similarity measures beyond cosine similarity.  **Investigating different aggregation strategies** beyond the entropy-based approach, perhaps incorporating uncertainty estimates from each learner, could also yield improvements.  The framework's robustness to various pre-trained models and PET methods should be further evaluated across a broader range of tasks and datasets.  **Extending the framework to handle more complex continual learning scenarios**, such as those with class imbalance or concept drift, remains a key challenge. Finally, a thorough theoretical analysis of SAFE's properties, including its convergence guarantees and generalization performance, would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
