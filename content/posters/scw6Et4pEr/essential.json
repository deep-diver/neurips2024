These methods often face challenges in computational efficiency and model interpretability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. \nDeepLag addresses these issues by introducing a novel Eulerian-Lagrangian paradigm. It leverages the strengths of both perspectives, tracking key particles (Lagrangian) to capture intricate fluid movement and integrating this information into the overall Eulerian prediction model. This approach results in a more transparent, efficient, and accurate fluid prediction model.  DeepLag surpasses the performance of existing deep learning models in various benchmark tests across 2D and 3D datasets.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "scw6Et4pEr/podcast.wav"}
