The x-axis represents the number of features selected, and the y-axis represents the classification accuracy.  The graph demonstrates how the accuracy improves as more features are included in the model, up to a point where adding more features provides diminishing returns.  This visualization is crucial in the feature selection process, enabling researchers to find the optimal number of features needed to achieve the best performance for classifying patients.
