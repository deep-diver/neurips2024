{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory.  It addresses the critical issue of **adaptive adversaries**, which are commonly found in real-world scenarios but largely ignored in theoretical MARL research. By introducing the concept of **consistent adversaries**, and providing algorithms with provable guarantees, this work paves the way for more robust and efficient MARL algorithms in complex settings.", "summary": "Learning against adaptive adversaries in Markov games is hard, but this paper shows how to achieve low policy regret with efficient algorithms by introducing a new notion of consistent adaptive adversaries.", "takeaways": ["Achieving low policy regret in Markov games against adaptive adversaries is statistically hard, especially when the adversary has unbounded memory or is non-stationary.", "The introduction of consistent adversaries and the proposed algorithms enable efficient learning with provable performance guarantees, providing more realistic and robust MARL algorithms.", "The paper provides fundamental barriers to learning, and these results are crucial for guiding the design and analysis of future MARL methods."], "tldr": "Most existing work on Markov games focuses on external regret, which is insufficient when adversaries adapt to the learner's strategies. This paper shifts focus to policy regret, a more suitable metric for adaptive environments. However, the paper shows that achieving sample efficient learning with policy regret is generally hard if the opponent has unbounded memory or is non-stationary. Even for memory-bounded and stationary opponents, learning is statistically hard if the number of strategies available to the learner is exponentially large.  To make the learning problem tractable, the authors introduce a new condition called \"consistent adversaries\", wherein the adversary's response to similar strategies is similar. This allows for developing efficient algorithms.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Mqx2gquLk0/podcast.wav"}
