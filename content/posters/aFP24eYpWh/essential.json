However, most existing approaches either require prior knowledge of these symmetries or focus on discriminative settings.  This limits their applicability and potential for data-efficient learning. This paper addresses these limitations. \nThis paper introduces a novel Symmetry-aware Generative Model (SGM) that learns data symmetries directly from the dataset in a generative setting. The model cleverly separates the latent representation into invariant and equivariant components, allowing it to disentangle symmetries from other latent factors.  The proposed two-stage learning algorithm first learns the invariant component using a self-supervised method and then estimates the equivariant component.  Experiments demonstrate that the SGM successfully captures symmetries under affine and color transformations, leading to better test-log-likelihoods and significantly improved data efficiency compared to standard generative models like VAEs.  **The SGM provides a robust and interpretable method for data augmentation**.  The approach offers **significant advantages in terms of efficiency and performance**, making it a valuable tool for various applications where data augmentation is critical.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Generative Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aFP24eYpWh/podcast.wav"}
