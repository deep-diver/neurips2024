However, these methods necessitate meticulous tuning of distillation parameters to achieve a balance between model complexity and performance [11]. FedProto [36] introduces prototype learning by aggregating class prototypes from clients to improve generalization across heterogeneous datasets. However, while FedProto improves local validation accuracy, it shows minimal improvement in global performance. As an extension of FedProto, FedHKD [4] integrates knowledge distillation by introducing the concept of \u201chyper-knowledge\u201d, which involves sending the mean representations of both feature and soft predictions from clients to the server for global aggregation. While FedHKD significantly enhances client-side personalized model performance without relying on public datasets [4], it focuses mainly on improving the client models. It does not introduce substantial advancements in hyper-knowledge extraction techniques, nor does it achieve dual improvement for both client and server performance in theory, as knowledge distillation predominantly benefits the client-side models. Building upon FedHKD, our research addresses these limitations by not only improving the knowledge distillation process by prototype feature and soft predictions extraction but also benefiting the server-side models by using DAT.

Each client, $i$ , first fine-tunes its local model consisting of a feature extractor $F_{\\theta_{i}}(\\cdot)$ and a classifier $C_{\\psi_{i}}(\\cdot)$ . The CKF computation for class $j$ occurs in three major steps: the feature extractor processes raw input data to generate latent data representations for each class (e.g., bird, airplane, horse). These data representations capture the essential features of the input data at the client level. Using the generated data representations, GMM clustering is applied to compute the prototype features for each class. Concurrently, the classifier generates soft predictions for these data representations, which are also clustered using GMM to derive prototype soft predictions for each class. After obtaining the prototype features and soft predictions for each class, they are aggregated to form the CKF. The CKF encapsulates the most representative features and soft predictions for each class, thereby summarizing the local client knowledge in a form that is robust and suitable for global aggregation at the server. In this way, CKF computation reduces the redundancy inherent in the client data while maintaining critical data characteristics, ensuring that local model updates are aligned with class-specific feature distributions. The CKF values are then transmitted to the server, where the DAT is employed to merge the CKF across clients, resulting in a robust global CKF that reflects the diverse data distributions across the FL network.

", "page_idx": 13}, {"type": "text", "text": "As shown in Figure 2, the computation of DAT begins by calculating an initial weight for each client\u2019s CKF. Each client\u2019s initial weight $w_{i,j}^{\\operatorname*{init}}$ for class $j$ is derived based on the proportion of samples for that class relative to the total samples across all clients, reflecting each client\u2019s contribution in terms of data volume. This initial aggregation step combines CKF from all clients to generate preliminary aggregated soft predictions. Following this, the server evaluates the alignment between each client\u2019s local data distribution and the preliminary global soft predictions by calculating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $d_{i}^{j}$ for each client $i$ and class $j$ . This discrepancy measure serves to quantify the quality of each client\u2019s CKF, indicating how closely each client\u2019s data aligns with the global distribution. Based on the calculated discrepancies, the server adjusts the initial weights, producing the final aggregation weights $w_{i}^{\\prime}$ for each client. These final weights balance the data volume and data quality, allowing clients with more aligned distributions to have a greater influence in the aggregation process. Finally, the server aggregates the CKFs from all clients using the discrepancy-aware weights $w_{i}^{\\prime}$ , resulting in a robust global CKF for each class. This global CKF incorporates the essential knowledge from all clients while accounting for variations in data quality, effectively addressing the challenges posed by Non-IID data distributions in FL.
