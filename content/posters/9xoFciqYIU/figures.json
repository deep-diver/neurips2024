The first three columns show the true parameter values and the estimations produced by AIR, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately recover the true values. The subsequent columns show estimations obtained using other regression techniques. By comparing the results, one can assess the relative performance and accuracy of the different methods in recovering the true parameter values.", "section": "Simulation"}, {"figure_path": "9xoFciqYIU/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Results on ADNI dataset.

Incorporating homogeneous part and heterogeneous part makes the AIR more robust, especially better than the one with only heterogeneous part.", "description": "This figure presents the results of ablation studies comparing three variations of the Attention boosted Individualized Regression (AIR) model: AIR (with both homogeneous and heterogeneous components), Hetero (only the heterogeneous part), and Homo (only the homogeneous part). The experiment was conducted under two conditions (Case 1 and Case 2, differing in how internal relations among image patches were generated), varying the degree of individuation (DI).  The plot shows that including both homogeneous and heterogeneous parts leads to the best performance across the range of DI values. In contrast, Homo performs better than Hetero when the data has little to no heterogeneity, while Hetero performs better than Homo when the data has substantial heterogeneity.", "section": "B Experimental extras"}, {"figure_path": "9xoFciqYIU/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Simulation results under Case 2 with DI = 1.0. There does not exist an explicit true W while the internal relation matrix Ai is computed directly by patchwise Pearson correlation coefficients. Because such Ai is close to a diagonal matrix, it is rational that W from AIR is close to a diagonal matrix.", "description": "This figure presents simulation results obtained under Case 2 (without specific W) with DI (degree of individuation) equal to 1.0.  It displays the true and estimated coefficient matrices C and D, and the learned weight matrix W from the AIR model, alongside results from other methods (LRMR, TRLasso, DKN, OLS). The key finding is that, even without an explicitly defined W, the AIR model effectively learns a W that approximates a diagonal matrix structure, given the diagonal-like nature of the correlation matrices used in this case.", "section": "Simulation"}]
