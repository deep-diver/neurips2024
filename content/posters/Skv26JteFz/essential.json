Existing algorithms either lacked computational efficiency or failed to achieve optimal accuracy.  This research tackles the critical trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, presenting a significant challenge in the field. \nThis paper introduces two novel algorithms. The first algorithm achieves optimal accuracy (a=3) with almost linear time complexity. The second offers improved efficiency concerning the accuracy parameter (e), trading off slightly with a higher accuracy parameter (a=4). Both algorithms showcase improved sample and time complexities over previous approaches.  These results represent a breakthrough in hypothesis selection research, offering practical benefits for various applications.
