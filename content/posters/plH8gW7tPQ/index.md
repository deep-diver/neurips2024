### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research investigates the source of algorithmic capabilities in transformer models, questioning whether these arise solely from training or also exist in the model's initial state.  Existing work has shown that transformers can perform complex tasks, but it is unclear whether these capabilities are learned during training or are inherent to the model's architecture and initialization.  This study also highlights the limitations of existing interpretability techniques, which often focus on analyzing the model's parameters rather than its input/output behavior.

The study uses a novel approach by training only the embedding and unembedding layers of randomly initialized transformers on various tasks.  The results demonstrate that even before training, these models can achieve impressive performance on tasks involving modular arithmetic, associative recall, and sequence generation.  These findings suggest that some algorithmic capabilities are already present in the model and that training merely selects or enhances these pre-existing capabilities.  This work challenges prevailing assumptions about the learning process in transformer models and opens new avenues for research into model interpretability and efficient training methods.

> üîº This figure provides a high-level overview of the experimental setup and the tasks used to evaluate the capabilities of randomly initialized transformers. Part A illustrates the modeling approach, where a randomly initialized transformer is fine-tuned by only training the embedding and unembedding layers while leaving the internal layers frozen. Part B outlines the seven tasks used to assess the performance of these models. These tasks encompass various domains, including arithmetic (modular arithmetic, decimal addition), memory-based tasks (needle-in-a-haystack, memorization), and sequence processing (parenthesis balancing, circuit imitation, language modeling).

### In-depth insights


#### Random Transformer Power
The concept of "Random Transformer Power" invites exploration into the surprising capabilities of transformer models initialized with random weights.  **Research suggests that these models, even before training, possess an inherent capacity for various algorithmic tasks.** This challenges the common assumption that transformers' power stems solely from learned parameters, revealing a significant inductive bias within the architecture itself.  **Embedding-only training, a technique where only the input/output embeddings are optimized, demonstrates this pre-existing potential.** It shows that some tasks can be solved by simply finding appropriate encodings to leverage the already-present functionality in the random initialization. This indicates that the effective dimensionality of the model's computations is significantly lower than the model's full parameter space; the model operates within a lower-dimensional subspace. While fully trained models outperform random transformers, the latter still display remarkable capabilities, especially in specific domains. **The success of embedding-only training highlights the crucial role of input representation in unlocking algorithmic power in randomly initialized transformers.**  Further investigation into this phenomenon could lead to more efficient training methods and a deeper understanding of the fundamental strengths of transformer architectures.

#### Embedding-Only Training
Embedding-only training, a novel approach in the study, involves training only the input and output embedding layers of a randomly initialized transformer model while keeping the internal layers frozen. This technique allows the researchers to investigate the extent to which a transformer's algorithmic capabilities are inherent in its architecture and initial parameters, independent of the learning process.  The results reveal that **random transformers with embedding-only training can surprisingly perform a variety of algorithmic tasks**, including modular arithmetic and associative recall. This finding suggests that **some algorithmic abilities might be intrinsically present in the model's architecture even before training**, challenging the prevailing assumption that all functionality is solely learned during training. This method is particularly significant because it helps to disentangle the contributions of the architecture itself from the effects of learned weights, offering valuable insights into the fundamental nature of transformer models and their capacity for computation.

#### Algorithmic Capabilities
The study explores the **algorithmic capabilities present in randomly initialized transformer models**.  It challenges the assumption that these capabilities solely emerge from training data by demonstrating that a wide array of algorithmic tasks, including **arithmetic, associative recall, and even aspects of natural language processing**, can be performed by models where only embedding layers are optimized. This suggests that transformers possess inherent architectural biases or properties conducive to algorithmic computation, even before any training. **Subspace selection**, a phenomenon where the model operates within low-dimensional subspaces of its high-dimensional parameter space, is proposed as a potential mechanism explaining this behavior.  The findings highlight the **importance of studying the intrinsic properties of neural network architectures** and suggest that interpretability efforts should not solely focus on trained models, but should also consider the capabilities of randomly initialized models.

#### Subspace Selection
The concept of "Subspace Selection" in the context of randomly initialized transformers is a crucial finding.  It suggests that the successful training of these models, even with only embedding layers optimized, is due to the inherent presence of algorithmic capabilities within low-dimensional subspaces of the model's parameter space. **This implies that the initial random parameterization already contains solutions to specific tasks,** and training effectively guides the model towards these pre-existing solutions by selecting the appropriate subspace. This contrasts with the idea that all algorithmic functionality is purely learned during training.  The low-dimensionality of these effective subspaces also provides insights into the efficiency of random transformers, suggesting that significant computational complexity isn't needed.  **The authors' observation that this phenomenon is more pronounced in language modeling suggests a potential connection between the model's ability to learn and the dimensionality of its internal representations.** The study of this subspace selection mechanism opens avenues for more efficient model design and provides a new perspective on the role of initialization in deep learning models. This phenomenon is further validated by a controlled experiment on circuit imitation, where the random models struggle to effectively imitate high-dimensional circuits, suggesting a direct relationship between model capacity and subspace dimensionality.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on random transformers are multifaceted.  **Investigating the generalizability of embedding-only training across diverse architectures** beyond the transformer model is crucial.  Understanding how the observed low-dimensional subspaces relate to the inherent capabilities of various architectures, and whether similar algorithmic capacity emerges in other models, would be insightful.  **Further exploration into the relationship between model size, training data, and the dimensionality of these functional subspaces** is needed. This includes examining the limitations encountered when attempting to utilize this approach for increasingly complex problems, and how increased model capacity might mitigate those limitations.  **Analyzing how different initialization strategies impact the emergence and characteristics of these low-dimensional subspaces** is a critical next step. This could unlock methods for strategically leveraging these emergent capabilities from initialization and potentially accelerating convergence during training. Finally, **the practical implications of embedding-only training for resource-constrained settings and efficient model deployment** must be explored. Combining this approach with model compression techniques might yield highly compact yet effective models for resource-limited environments.
