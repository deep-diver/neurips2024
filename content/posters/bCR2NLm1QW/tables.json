To ensure a representative distribution similar to BalanceCC, we randomly select 50 videos from BalanceCC and calculate warping and interpolation errors, which are the metrics for temporal consistency. Our method outperforms these baseline methods in terms of temporal consistency.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed NaRCan method against three other state-of-the-art video editing methods: Hashing-nvd, CoDeF, and MeDM. The comparison is based on the BalanceCC dataset, which contains 100 videos.  To ensure a fair comparison, 50 videos were randomly selected. The metrics used for comparison are short-term and long-term warping errors and interpolation error, all of which relate to temporal consistency. The results show that NaRCan achieves superior performance in terms of temporal consistency compared to the other methods.", "section": "4. Experiments"}]
