The spatial shift operator moves each channel of the input tensor in a distinct direction, causing information loss and conflicting with image restoration requirements.

The discrete Fourier transform of a signal exhibits period-extended and cycling properties. Specifically, in the Fourier domain, the two pixels in sequence beginning and end may not appear adjacent, but due to the period property, they are actually considered adjacent, as indicated by the upper right corner. This inherent period-extended and cycling behavior of the Fourier transform enables us to model the shifting mechanism in a manner that is information-lossless, making it well-suited for image restoration tasks. Consider the Fourier transform of a discrete time-domain signal, represented as (343). It may appear that the values 3 and 5 are not adjacent within the main period. However, owing to the property of period extension, the 3 from the previous period and the 5 from the current period are theoretically considered adjacent. It is reasonable to move the removed area from the end to the front, meeting the cycling mechanism. (b) Our deep Fourier shifting operator. Our operator borrows the principle of the spatial shifting mechanism and models the shifting mechanism in information-lossless Fourier cycling rules. The cycling is coded as 2D queue rolling.", "description": "This figure illustrates the information-lossless cycling mechanism used in Deep Fourier Shifting.
