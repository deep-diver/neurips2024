They often rely on training multiple, separate models, which is computationally expensive and lacks flexibility in handling dynamic domains. This is particularly challenging when dealing with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization (DG), which involve adapting models to unseen data distributions. \nThis paper introduces Terra, a novel framework that utilizes a time-varying low-rank adapter to fine-tune diffusion models effectively across domains.  **Terra constructs a continuous parameter manifold, allowing for seamless transitions between domains and generation of intermediate domains.** The paper provides theoretical analysis proving Terra's ability to effectively manage multiple domains simultaneously, outperforming existing techniques in experiments on various benchmark datasets for both image interpolation and domain adaptation/generalization tasks.", "affiliation": "Southern University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "SgODU2mx9T/podcast.wav"}
