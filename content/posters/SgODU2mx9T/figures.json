The UDA framework (a) involves first training Terra to generate images in both the source and target domains. Then, it uses the trained Terra to transform source domain images into the style of the target domain, creating an 'adapted' source domain with a smaller domain gap to the target domain. This expanded source domain is then used with an existing UDA method. The DG framework (b) trains a 't predictor' network to assign a time variable to each image based on its style. This variable is then used by Terra to generate intermediate domains by interpolating between existing source domains. These new generated samples are combined with the original source domains to train a more generalized model.", "section": "3.4 Generation-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Terra\n3.5 Generation-based Domain Generalization via Terra"}, {"figure_path": "SgODU2mx9T/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Qualitative evaluation.
