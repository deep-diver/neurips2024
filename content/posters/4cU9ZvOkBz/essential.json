This leads to inaccurate predictions of which quantum programs a given quantum computer can reliably execute, hindering progress in the field.  Existing neural network models, while useful, often struggle to capture the nuances of these errors, especially coherent errors, limiting their predictive power. \nThis research introduces a novel, quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture. By incorporating fundamental physical principles governing the types and propagation of quantum errors, this model significantly improves the accuracy of capability predictions. The approach utilizes efficient approximations to handle the exponential complexity of error combinations, making it scalable to larger quantum systems (100+ qubits).  The model outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 50% reduction in error, and demonstrates accuracy even on out-of-distribution data.", "affiliation": "Sandia National Laboratories", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4cU9ZvOkBz/podcast.wav"}
