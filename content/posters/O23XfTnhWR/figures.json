The dataset is filtered along two scale parameters, resulting in a bifiltration (a stack of nested simplicial complexes). For each fixed parameter value, we compute a one-parameter persistent homology, yielding persistence diagrams.  These diagrams are then connected through maps induced by homology maps between the nested simplicial complexes, forming bipartite graphs between consecutive pairs. The union of these bipartite graphs forms the graphcode, a multi-scale summary of the dataset's topology.", "section": "Contribution"}, {"figure_path": "O23XfTnhWR/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Left: A simplicial complex with 11 0-simplices, 19 1-simplices and 7 2-simplices. A 2-chain consisting of three 2-simplices is marked with darker color, and its boundary, a collection of 7 1-simplices is displayed in thick. Right: The 1-cycle marked in thick on the left is also a 1-boundary, since it is the image of the boundary operator under the 4 marked 2-simplices. On the right, the 1-cycle a going along the path ABCDE is not a 1-boundary; therefore it is a generator of an homology class [a] of H\u2081(K). Likewise, the 1-cycle a' going along ABCFGH is not a 1-boundary neither. Furthermore, [a'] = [a] since the sum a + a' is the 1-cycle given by the path AEDCFGH, which is a 1-boundary because of the 5 marked 2-simplices. Hence, a and a' represent the same homology class which is characterized by looping aroung the same hole in K.", "description": "The figure shows two illustrations related to simplicial complexes and homology.
