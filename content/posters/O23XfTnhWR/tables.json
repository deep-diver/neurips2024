The \"Accuracy\" column shows the average classification accuracy achieved by each method across 20 independent runs, with the training and test sets randomly split 80/20 each time.  The \"Time\" column indicates the computation time in seconds for each descriptor. The table highlights the superior accuracy and efficiency of Graphcodes (GC) compared to other state-of-the-art methods, although GRIL's performance may be underestimated due to low resolution constraints.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "O23XfTnhWR/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Average test set prediction accuracy in % over 20 train/test runs with random 80/20 train/test split on the point-process dataset.", "description": "This table presents the average test set prediction accuracy for different topological descriptors on the point-process dataset.

The table shows that using randomly shuffled bases, especially with the modified training, improves accuracy compared to standard bases.", "section": "Experiments"}]
