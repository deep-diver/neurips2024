Our approach leverages unsupervised learning to predict contact fields in 3D space, eliminating the need for labeled training data, which is often difficult and costly to obtain. This is particularly advantageous in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions. The effectiveness of our method is significantly influenced by the resolution of the 3D data. Highresolution data provide detailed and dense information, enabling precise contact prediction. In contrast, low-resolution data can lead to less accurate results due to the sparse representation of the interactions, as illustrated in Figure 5. A key advantage of our approach is the use of an implicit contact field, which allows for flexible changes in resolution. This flexibility enables our method to adapt to various data resolutions without compromising the integrity of the contact prediction. Thus, our method excels in flexibility and reduces dependency on extensively labeled datasets.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
