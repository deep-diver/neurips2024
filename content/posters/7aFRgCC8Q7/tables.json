The key change is in how the noise is generated; instead of using a uniform distribution, it samples from a geometric distribution with parameter \u221aK/T. This modification improves the algorithm's performance in terms of pseudo U-calibration error, reducing it from O(K\u221aT) to O(\u221aKT). The algorithm iteratively predicts a distribution over K classes and then observes the true outcome to update its prediction for the next round.", "section": "3.1 Algorithm"}]
