Existing methods often focus on individual features (like pixels in an image), not their meaning to a human.  This makes it difficult to provide trustworthy explanations, especially in high-stakes settings where transparency is crucial.\nThis paper tackles this issue by formalizing the concept of 'semantic importance'\u2014the importance of high-level concepts (like \"cat\" or \"dog\") rather than raw input features\u2014in a statistically rigorous way. They introduce novel testing methods to assess semantic importance, both globally (across all predictions) and locally (for individual cases).  These methods rely on conditional independence testing and incorporate sequential testing to rank the importance of concepts effectively.  Experiments show that their framework offers improved accuracy, better rank agreement, and higher transferability compared to traditional methods.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "A0HSmrwtLH/podcast.wav"}
