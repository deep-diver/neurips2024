This paper identifies the lack of data complexity and model regularization as key issues hindering SAT's effectiveness.  Existing works are also limited by focusing on specific Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks, like contrastive learning, lacking generalizability.\nThe researchers propose a novel method, DAQ-SDP (Diverse Augmented Queries Self-Supervised Double Perturbation), to overcome these limitations. DAQ-SDP introduces diverse augmented queries to guide adversarial training and incorporates self-supervised double perturbation to enhance robustness.  **Key to the approach is a novel Aug-Adv Pairwise-BatchNorm adversarial training method that leverages the strength of diverse augmentations without sacrificing robustness.**  Experiments demonstrate that DAQ-SDP improves both robust and natural accuracies across various SSL frameworks and datasets, significantly reducing the generalization gap and bridging the gap between SAT and supervised adversarial training.", "affiliation": "Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "CIHdlhfrOo/podcast.wav"}
