### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Self-Supervised Adversarial Training (SAT) aims to learn robust features without labels, but existing methods suffer from a large robust generalization gap and accuracy degradation.  This paper identifies the lack of data complexity and model regularization as key issues hindering SAT's effectiveness.  Existing works are also limited by focusing on specific Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks, like contrastive learning, lacking generalizability.

The researchers propose a novel method, DAQ-SDP (Diverse Augmented Queries Self-Supervised Double Perturbation), to overcome these limitations. DAQ-SDP introduces diverse augmented queries to guide adversarial training and incorporates self-supervised double perturbation to enhance robustness.  **Key to the approach is a novel Aug-Adv Pairwise-BatchNorm adversarial training method that leverages the strength of diverse augmentations without sacrificing robustness.**  Experiments demonstrate that DAQ-SDP improves both robust and natural accuracies across various SSL frameworks and datasets, significantly reducing the generalization gap and bridging the gap between SAT and supervised adversarial training.

### In-depth insights


#### SAT's Robustness Gap
The paper investigates the robustness gap in self-supervised adversarial training (SAT).  **A core observation is that SAT, while showing promise, still underperforms supervised AT in terms of robustness.** This gap is attributed to a lack of data complexity and insufficient model regularization during SAT. The authors hypothesize that current approaches fail to effectively leverage the inherent generalization capabilities of self-supervised learning models. This leads to a significant discrepancy between performance on clean and adversarial examples.  **The proposed DAQ-SDP method aims to directly address these limitations** by using diverse augmented queries to guide adversarial training, thereby improving robustness without sacrificing accuracy on natural samples.  The incorporation of self-supervised double perturbation further enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model.  **The analysis of this robustness gap provides valuable insights into the key challenges of robust feature learning in a self-supervised setting.**  The findings suggest that enhancing data complexity and model regularization through techniques like augmentations and double perturbation are vital steps towards bridging the performance gap between SAT and supervised AT.

#### DAQ-SDP Approach
The DAQ-SDP approach tackles the challenge of robust generalization in self-supervised adversarial training (SAT) by addressing two key limitations: insufficient data complexity and lack of model regularization.  **Diverse Augmented Queries (DAQ)** challenges the conventional wisdom that complex augmentations hinder robustness in SAT.  Instead, DAQ leverages diverse augmentations to generate multiple sample views, using them as queries to guide adversarial training. This expands data complexity and improves generalization.  **Self-Supervised Double Perturbation (SDP)** introduces model perturbation into the self-supervised learning phase, improving robustness transferable to downstream classification.  Unlike previous methods that solely focus on sample-level perturbations, SDP enhances the robustness of the learned features themselves.  By combining DAQ and SDP, the approach seamlessly integrates into various self-supervised learning frameworks without modifying learning objectives, bridging the gap between SAT and supervised adversarial training. The innovative strategy of using diverse augmentations and model perturbation demonstrates a more holistic and effective approach to achieving robust and accurate models in the SAT paradigm.

#### Aug-Adv Pairwise-BN
The proposed Aug-Adv Pairwise-BN technique represents a novel approach to enhancing the robustness of self-supervised adversarial training (SAT).  It directly addresses the limitations of previous methods by integrating diverse augmentations and a pairwise Batch Normalization (BN) strategy. **The core idea is to leverage the inherent generalization capabilities of self-supervised learning (SSL) models trained on naturally augmented data, even under the challenging conditions of adversarial training.**  Instead of viewing complex augmentations as detrimental to SAT robustness, as some prior work suggests, this method uses them constructively.  By creating multiple input streams with varied augmentations (strong and weak) and adversarial perturbations, it allows the model to learn richer, more robust representations.  **The pairwise BN further refines this process by enabling each input stream's features to adapt to the diverse augmentations and adversarial examples while preserving features from the clean, naturally trained model.** This approach fosters a stronger balance between generalization and specialization, bridging the gap often observed between self-supervised and supervised adversarial training. The innovative Aug-Adv Pairwise-BN technique, therefore, contributes significantly to the improvement of SAT by intelligently using diverse data augmentation and tailored model regularization strategies.

#### Self-Perturbed Weights
The concept of "Self-Perturbed Weights" introduces a novel approach to enhance the robustness of self-supervised adversarial training (SAT).  Instead of solely focusing on perturbing input data, this method proposes to directly perturb the model's weights during the self-supervised learning phase.  This **internal perturbation** acts as a form of regularization, improving the model's generalization and resistance to adversarial attacks. By optimizing the model's weights against these self-induced perturbations, the model learns to be less sensitive to changes in its internal representation, leading to more robust features.  **The key benefit** lies in its compatibility with existing self-supervised learning frameworks, seamlessly integrating into the training process without requiring significant architectural modifications.  This method effectively bridges the gap between self-supervised and fully supervised adversarial training paradigms, offering a potentially more efficient and generalized approach for building robust models.

#### Unified SAT view
A unified SAT (Self-Supervised Adversarial Training) view would ideally bridge the gap between supervised and self-supervised adversarial training methods.  It would **highlight shared principles and transferable techniques**, enabling a more efficient and effective approach to building robust models.  Such a perspective might focus on the core mechanism of adversarial training ‚Äì creating robust features through the generation and handling of adversarial examples ‚Äì rather than dwelling on the specific data augmentation or loss functions employed in either paradigm.  A unified view could also **explore how the inherent properties of self-supervised learning (SSL), such as learning from unlabeled data and the use of pretext tasks, can be leveraged to enhance adversarial robustness**. This could involve investigating the transferability of robustness learned during the SSL phase to downstream classification tasks.  Finally, a unified view would likely propose **generalizable frameworks and methods** that can easily incorporate various SSL pretext tasks and architectures, moving beyond the constraints of specific contrastive learning setups.  This could lead to more efficient algorithms and better performance across different SSL methods.
