Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) are widely used to reduce model size and computation, but pruning DSC models effectively remains challenging due to the already compact nature of DSC. Existing pruning techniques often struggle to maintain accuracy while achieving significant speedups on GPUs. \n\nDEPrune tackles these challenges by introducing a novel pruning method tailored for DSC on GPUs. It uses a fine-grained pruning approach coupled with techniques like balanced workload tuning (BWT) and hardware-aware sparsity recalibration (HSR) to maximize GPU parallelism and maintain accuracy.  Experimental results show that DEPrune achieves substantial speedups (up to 3.74x) on various models like EfficientNet-B0 without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating its potential for efficient AI deployment on resource-constrained devices.", "affiliation": "Samsung Electronics", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "MYI443zCvv/podcast.wav"}
