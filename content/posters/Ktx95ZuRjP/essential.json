Current neural approaches rely on feasibility masking, but this approach struggles with complex constraints where checking feasibility itself is computationally expensive. This paper addresses this limitation.\nThe paper introduces a new framework, called Proactive Infeasibility Prevention (PIP), which uses the Lagrangian multiplier method and a novel preventative infeasibility masking technique to guide the search towards feasible solutions more effectively.  It also introduces an enhanced version called PIP-D, which uses an auxiliary decoder and adaptive strategies to further improve efficiency.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIP and PIP-D significantly improve solution quality and reduce infeasibility rates across various VRP benchmarks and neural models.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Ktx95ZuRjP/podcast.wav"}
