One such framework is the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory (see, e.g., Jacot et al. [2018], Allen-Zhu et al. [2019]), which has emerged as a pivotal tool for understanding the dynamics of neural network training in the infinite-width limit. The NTK theory posits that the training dynamics of wide neural networks can be closely approximated by a kernel gradient descent method with the corresponding NTK, elucidating their convergence behaviors during gradient descent and shedding light on their generalization capabilities. Parallel to this, an extensive literature on kernel regression (see, e.g., Bauer et al. [2007], Yao et al. [2007]) has studied its generalization properties, showing its minimax optimality under certain conditions and providing insights into the bias-variance trade-off. Thus, one can almost fully understand the generalization properties of neural networks in the NTK regime by analyzing the kernel regression method.

The NTK analysis, by its reliance on the fixed kernel approximation, can not entirely account for the adaptability and flexibility exhibited by neural networks, particularly those of finite width that deviate from the theoretical infinite-width limit [Woodworth et al., 2020]. Moreover, empirical evidence [Wenger et al., 2023, Seleznova and Kutyniok, 2022] also suggests that the assumption of a constant kernel during training, a cornerstone of NTK analysis, may not hold in practical scenarios where the network architecture or initialization conditions foster a dynamic evolution of the kernel. Also, Gatmiry et al. [2021] showed the benefits brought by the adaptivity of the kernel on a three-layer neural network. These results underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of neural network training dynamics, one that considers the intricate interplay between network architecture, initialization, and the optimization process beyond the simplifications of NTK theory.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
