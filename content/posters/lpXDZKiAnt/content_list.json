Supervised fine-tuning on these data may break the alignment with a small amount of harmful data that is mixed into the benign fine-tuning data (Qi et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Yi et al., 2024a; Lermen et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to either manually use a fliter to detect and remove all the harmful data during fine-tuning, or heal the model simply by restraining the model update in fine-tuning stage into a subspace (Wei et al., 2024). This vulnerability poses a serious threat to the service provider, who is liable for the potentially harmful output of the customized model after fine-tuning on the user data. Figure 1 shows the attack surface during fine-tuning with users\u2019 data. To mitigate such a security risk in the fine-tuning stage, one approach is to apply two categories of general solutions originally proposed to counter \"catastrophic forgetting\" in the field of continual learning (Wang et al., 2023). The first category is represented by (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Serra et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 2020; Li & Hoiem, 2017; Zhao et al., 2023; Zong et al., 2024), and can be applied in fine-tuning stage to better preserve the alignment knowledge. However, considerable extra computation is needed for each fine-tuning request, which is impractical for fine-tuning as a service scenarios. The second category is meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017; Javed & White, 2019) and Ripple (Kurita et al., 2020), which only modifies the alignment stage to counter the perturbation of user fine-tuning. As alignment only need to be done once for all user fine-tuning requests, it only incurs small extra overhead. However, these solutions require the service provider to have the user data used for fine-tuning in the alignment stage, which is unrealistic because user data are unavailable before a fine-tuning request arrives.

We call this phenomenon the Harmful Embedding Drift, and our experiment further shows that the drift will be aggravated when fine-tuning data contains more harmful data. To counter the embedding drift, we develop Vaccine, a perturbation-aware alignment method that only modifies the alignment stage. Vaccine finds the optimal bounded perturbation on embedding that maximizes the alignment loss with the first forward/backward pass of the model, and then we add the perturbation in the second forward/backward pass to produce gradient that optimizes the model such that it can be robust to the perturbation. Through invariant hidden embeddings, Vaccine enables the embeddings to withstand harmful perturbation from raw user data used in fine-tuning. Experiments show that Vaccine can significantly reduce the harmful score (by up-to $9.8\\%$ ) compared to standard alignment technique, while maintaining good performance with negligible loss (up to $1.8\\%$ ) for downstream tasks when the user data used in fine-tuning contain harmful instructions.

To reduce this overhead, extra optimization, e.g., pruning/factorization needs to be done. Another limitations might be the fine-tuning datasets we use are not the main-stream tasks that LLMs are used for. Future study might consider more diversified downstream tasks, e.g., conversational AI (Wu et al., 2023a), or LLM agents on different scenarios, e.g., (Hu et al., 2023a, 2024b, 2023b, 2024a).

Our intuition is that Vaccine has strengthened the activation of the alignment data in the alignment stage (such that it is harder to be perturbed). Therefore the statistic of the harmful data should be different from the benign fine-tuning data to overwhelm the protection.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
