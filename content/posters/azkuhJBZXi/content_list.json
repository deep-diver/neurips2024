As for causal hallucinations, i.e.,   \n4 the inconsistency between reasoning and corresponding state transition, this paper   \n5 introduces the Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) mechanism combining   \n6 cause-effect interventions and the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) to guarantee the   \n7 solid causal rightness between each step of reasoning and state transition. As for   \n8 the long causal range and huge search space limiting the performances of existing   \n9 models featuring single-direction search, a Dual-End Searching (DES) approach   \n10 is proposed to seek solutions by simultaneously starting from both the initial and   \n11 goal states on the causal probability tree. By integrating CRE and DES (CreDes),   \n12 our model has realized simultaneous multi-step reasoning, circumventing the inef  \n13 ficiencies from cascading multiple one-step reasoning like the Chain-of-Thought   \n14 (CoT).

However, their performances   \n22 and efficiency are limited when dealing with complex combinatorial optimization problems that   \n23 require multi-step long-range reasoning[16].   \n24 The first challenge is causal hallucinations, i.e., causality between one-step reasoning (OSR) and state   \n25 transition in LLMs is not always guaranteed. Similar to pre-trained LLMs that are prone to produce   \n26 hallucinations when processing certain factual information, causal hallucinations reflect the fact that   \n27 LLMs lack rigor due to inherent randomness in accomplishing complex mathematical[17, 18, 19],   \n28 logical[20, 21], or common-sense reasoning[22, 23, 24], which is somehow entrenched in statistical   \n29 inevitability and independent of the Transformer architecture or data quality[25]. For example, CoT  \n30 based finite-step reasoning methods[26, 27] suffer from causal hallucinations, which cannot effectively   \n31 ensure the causality between OSR and state transition in LLMs, resulting in unreliable reasoning   \n32 and relatively low success rates (especially for long-range reasoning problems with significant error   \n33 accumulation effects). The reasonableness between OSR and state transition can be summarized as   \n34 follows: There is a causal relationship between reasonable OSR and state transition. At the same time,   \n35 there is only a correlation or no relationship between unreasonable OSR and state transition, which   \n36 suggests that training with cross-entropy loss alone does not enable the model to have sufficient causal   \n37 rigor. Inspired by this, we designed the CRE mechanism to make each step of reasoning correct   \n38 and causally sound by including the causality measure between OSR and state transition as part of   \n39 the training objective, thus more closely modeling the rigor, adaptability, and comprehensiveness of   \n40 human reasoning[28].   \n41 The second challenge is that long-range reasoning problems have a huge search space. Although   \n42 complex architectures such as CoT, Tree of Thought (ToT)[29], and Program of Thought (PoT)[30]   \n43 can effectively improve the reasoning accuracy of LLMs through external guidance, they are limited   \n44 when handling long-range reasoning processes and task decomposition. A crucial reason is that   \n45 long-range reasoning has a huge state space, i.e., each branch in the state transition process expands   \n46 the search space approximately exponentially. Most of the existing LLM-based methods, e.g., Monte   \n47 Carlo search[31], are based on unidirectional reasoning, making them time-inefficient and easy to   \n48 fall into local optima when dealing with reasoning problems with large search spaces. In this paper,   \n49 a bi-directional Dual-End Searching method is developed, which first decomposes a long-range   \n50 reasoning problem into a combination of short-range reasoning problems and then searches for the   \n51 intersection of two causal probability trees starting from the initial and goal states, respectively.   \n52 A structured and generalized reasoning framework, CreDes, is developed for long-range reasoning ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "53 with LLMs in this paper, and the contributions can be summarized as follows: ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "54 First, the CRE mechanism is introduced to improve the rigor of LLM-based long-range   \n55 reasoning methods: Structural Causal Modeling (SCM) is exploited to enhance the causality   \n56 between OSR and state transitions, involving performing causal interventions and optimizing the   \n57 absolute value of ATE during training, which has effectively alleviated causal hallucinations in   \n58 long-range reasoning of LLMs.   \n59 Second, the DES method is developed to improve the search efficiency for long-range reasoning:   \n60 After constructing causal probability trees starting from the initial states and ending at the goal states,   \n61 long-range reasoning (e.g., 12 steps) is transformed into more manageable combinations of smaller   \n62 segments (e.g., 2 or 4 steps) by minimizing the distances between leaves of the tree and employing   \n63 end-matching techniques. By avoiding long-range sequential search from scratch, the DES method   \n64 has greatly lowered the complexity when solving long-range reasoning problems.   \n65 Third, simultaneous multi-step reasoning is realized to improve the time-efficiency of long-range   \n66 reasoning: By integrating CRE and DES, CreDes can perform simultaneous multi-step reasoning   \n67 within the model, i.e., avoiding the inefficiency of cascading single-step reasoning in frameworks   \n68 such as CoT. While ensuring the accuracy of the reasoning process, CreDes can significantly reduce   \n69 the time required for multi-step reasoning in LLMs.   \n70 Fourth, adequate and rigorous testing of CreDes: CreDes has been extensively tested in the   \n71 Blocksworld, GSM8K, and Hanoi Tower scenarios, respectively, and the experimental results show   \n72 that CreDes outperforms existing SOTA regarding reasoning accuracy and time efficiency.

Recent   \n78 advancements, such as the Chain-of-Thought model[26, 36, 37], have significantly bolstered the   \n79 LLMs\u2019 capability to perform detailed reasoning[38, 39, 40]. This model breaks down intricate   \n80 queries into a series of manageable steps, thereby enhancing the LLMs\u2019 decision-making ability.   \n81 Subsequent initiatives like ReACT[41] have modified this approach to improve reasoning ability in   \n82 decision contexts using a CoT-based framework. Additionally, Reflexion[42] provides a corrective   \n83 mechanism that enables LLMs to recognize their errors during the decision-making process, reflect   \n84 on these mistakes, and make accurate decisions in subsequent attempts. Further developments have   \n85 led to the creation of tree-based decision-making frameworks that tailor LLM capabilities to specific   \n86 scenarios. The Tree-of-Thought[29] utilizes Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search   \n87 (DFS) algorithms to facilitate decision-making in activities such as the Game of 24, Creative Writing,   \n88 and Mini Crosswords. Meanwhile, Reasoning via Planning (RAP)[43] employs the Monte Carlo   \n89 Tree Search technique to optimize solutions across tasks like Blocksworld[44], Math Reasoning[45].   \n90 DFSDT[46] proposed an efficient version of DFS for LLMs to make decisions, but it lacks the   \n91 judgment ability to evaluate different decisions. JUDEC[47] utilizes an Elo rating system to enable   \n92 LLMs to develop self-assessment capabilities, thereby enabling them to generate optimal solutions   \n93 for a wide range of real-world tasks, independent of any task-specific expertise. Lastly, Graph  \n94 of-Thought[48] represents the thoughts as nodes in a graph, combining thoughts non-sequentially.   \n95 Encouraged by the studies above, we leveraged LLMs to solve long-range reasoning problems.   \n96 Integrating Causal Analysis in LLMs for Multi-step Decision-Making: The causal analysis aims   \n97 to discern and elucidate the causal relationships between actions, circumstances, or decisions. This   \n98 method entails investigating the origins or causes leading to an event and the potential consequences   \n99 that follow[49, 50, 51]. Although various causal models may produce identical observational distri  \n100 butions, they can yield distinct distributions when interventions are applied[52]. Therefore, using   \n101 interventions allows for the distinction of possible causal frameworks that align with the observed   \n102 data[53, 54]. Previous work suggests that, while CoT has been lauded for its potential to improve   \n103 task performance, its application does not always lead to enhanced outcomes[36, 55]. Also, research   \n104 has shown that the statistical pretraining of LLMs encourages models to achieve high empirical   \n105 performance but not necessarily to reason[56, 57, 58, 59]. Inspired by this, we designed the CRE   \n106 mechanism to control the causal hallucinations of LLMs to solve long-range reasoning problems.   \n107 Solving Multi-step Problems with LLMs: Recent studies have shown that with substantial de  \n108 sign, LLMs are capable of performing not only basic arithmetic tasks but also complex multi-step   \n109 reasoning[60, 61]. For instance, increasing computational resources significantly enhances the ac  \n110 curacy of datasets like GSM8K[62]. Concurrently, Research[63] demonstrated that a 2B parameter   \n111 LLM could achieve $89.9\\%$ accuracy in $5\\mathrm{x}5$ multiplication tasks using curriculum learning with   \n112 50 million training instances. This evidence suggests that adequately scaled LLMs can process   \n113 multiple reasoning steps effectively internally. While trees are frequently used to represent games   \n114 (especially extensive-form games[64, 65]) and sequential reasoning problems[66], it was Shafer\u2019s   \n115 groundbreaking work[67] that initially established a framework for understanding causality through   \n116 the use of probability trees. Inspired by Shafer\u2019s approach, we recognized that LLMs tend to struggle   \n117 with long-range reasoning problems involving multiple steps but excel in short-range reasoning tasks.   \n118 By integrating causal probability trees, we can enhance search efficiency. This insight led to the   \n119 development of DES.

Within the Incorrect   \n139 category, three scenarios exist, i.e., a correct OSR leading to an incorrect state transition, an incorrect   \n140 OSR leading to an incorrect state transition, and an incorrect OSR resulting in a correct state transition.   \n141 Given this, it is evident that we need to strengthen the causal connection between the OSR and the   \n142 transition, and reduce the occurrence of samples where the OSR and the transition are non-causal. In   \n143 CRE, we first use the ATE to estimate the causality between OSR and state transition quantitatively,   \n144 and then embed the $|\\mathrm{ATE}|$ into the loss function in the training process (the remaining is cross  \n145 entropy), enhancing the causality of state transitions. As is shown in Fig. 2, we leave the reasoning   \n146 path selection to be controlled by the cross-entropy loss, while the suppression of hallucinations is   \n147 handled by the $|\\mathrm{ATE}|$ loss. Perplexity (PPL) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a LLM,   \n148 indicating how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence, and lower values signify better   \n149 predictive accuracy. The estimation of ATE is detailed as the follows:   \n150 Given binary variables $X$ and $Y$ indicating the correctness of OSR and next state (state transition),   \n151 respectively, i.e., $X,Y\\sim B(0,1)$ , and $X=1$ (or $Y=1$ ) means correctness.

We used all   \n246 basemodels to carry out CoT in the experiment.   \n247 RoT: A framework[80] to enhance the performance of tree-search-based prompting methods used   \n248 in LLMs. This innovative approach leverages guidelines derived from past tree search experiences,   \n249 allowing LLMs to avoid repeating errors and significantly improving their reasoning and planning   \n250 capabilities across various tasks. We not only used the same basemodel as the original RoT, but also   \n251 introduced other 7B models as a comparison.

Our methodology,   \n254 detailed in Section 3, particularly focuses on scenarios with more than 6 steps. As is shown in Table 1   \n255 and Table 5, for tasks up to 6 steps, results with our 7B models closely matched those with the   \n256 benchmark\u2019s 70B models, suggesting robust inference capabilities even with reduced model size. For   \n257 more complex tasks of 8 steps or more, DES improved its success rates by breaking down tasks into   \n258 simpler segments, though it slightly lagged behind in performance compared to shorter tasks. This   \n259 approach underlines the potential of our modified strategies in handling varying task complexities.   \n260 By comparison, our CRE method not only outperforms benchmarks in terms of success rates on the   \n261 7B scale, but also achieves a higher success rate than the $70\\mathrm{B}{+}\\mathrm{RAP}$ method using the 7B model. For   \n262 the arithmetic cases that use the full CreDes architecture, CreDes helps to improve the performance   \n263 of the LLMs for long-range reasoning tasks.   \n264 GSM8K: We further independently verified the capabilities of CRE based on the GSM8K dataset   \n265 without introducing DES, to confirm that it helps to enhance the inference capabilities of large   \n266 models. We found that our CRE is superior to the baseline methods RAP, RoT, and CoT, further   \n267 demonstrating that completing multi-step reasoning in one go has more advantages than completing   \n268 multiple single-step reasoning. See Table 2. This example shows that CRE can not only help LLM   \n269 solve highly structured problems, such as Blocksworld, but also has the ability to assist in solving   \n270 some abstract mathematical problems.   \n271 Hanoi Tower: Unlike the Blocksworld case, the longest reasoning steps for the Hanoi Tower have a   \n272 fixed quantitative relationship with the number of rods and disks. Therefore, when training the model,   \n273 we used combinations within 7 steps, i.e., 3 rods and 3 disks. For evaluation, we used problems   \n274 within 15 steps, i.e., combinations of 3 rods and 4 disks, to test the reasoning ability. From this   \n275 perspective, our reasoning process is based on a zero-shot setting. Due to the time complexity of   \n276 the search-based method for long-range reasoning, we did not conduct experiments for too many   \n277 reasoning steps, and its success rate can be recorded as \u2019-.\u2019 As Table 3 shows, CreDes performed best   \n278 among all the models. By comparing the Hanoi Tower scenario with the Blocksworld scenario, we   \n279 find that the success rate under Hanoi Tower is lower than that of Blocksworld, and that the reasoning   \n280 ability of the $7\\mathbf{B}\\mathrm{+}\\mathrm{CRE}$ group is slightly lower than that of the $70\\mathrm{B}{+}\\mathrm{RAP}$ group. We believe that   \n281 this phenomenon occurs because Hanoi Tower has a stricter stacking order qualification relative to   \n282 Blocksworld, and some of the intermediate steps may not hold at all, see Fig. 2. From the results, the   \n283 complexity of the Hanoi Tower problem is higher than that of Blocksworld.   \n284 Time Efficiency: Using the CRE and DES architecture has significantly shortened the time to   \n285 complete long-range reasoning tasks compared to benchmarks, as is shown in Fig.3. This is because   \n286 CreDes can perform simultaneous multi-step reasoning, which is more efficient than other methods   \n287 that generate answers multiple times and then cascade them together, which is more evident in   \n288 longer-range reasoning.

A No or   \n542 NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.   \n543 \u2022 The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how   \n544 much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.   \n545 \u2022 It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals   \n546 are not attained by the paper.   \n547 2.

The authors   \n558 should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the   \n559 implications would be.   \n560 \u2022 The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was   \n561 only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often   \n562 depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n563 \u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.   \n564 For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution   \n565 is low or images are taken in low lighting.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

However, if there is a direct path to   \n744 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n745 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n746 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n747 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n748 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n749 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n750 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n751 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n752 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n753 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n754 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n755 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n756 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n757 11.

The authors   \n770 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n771 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n772 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n773 faith effort.   \n774 12.
