The top part shows the CRE mechanism, which enhances the causality between each reasoning step and state transition using ATE (Average Treatment Effect) and cause-effect interventions.  The bottom part depicts the DES approach, which simultaneously searches for solutions from both the initial and goal states, creating two causal probability trees.  These trees are explored to find overlapping pathways, resulting in a more efficient multi-step reasoning process compared to traditional single-step approaches.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "azkuhJBZXi/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Integrating Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) and Dual-End Searching (DES).", "description": "This figure illustrates the CreDes framework, which combines two main components: Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) and Dual-End Searching (DES). CRE enhances the causality between one-step reasoning (OSR) and state transitions by incorporating cause-effect interventions and the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). DES improves search efficiency by simultaneously searching from both initial and goal states on the causal probability tree, enabling multi-step reasoning without cascading single-step reasoning. The figure shows how CRE and DES work together to produce the complete pathway between the initial and goal states by creating two causal probability trees from both the initial and the goal states and finding their intersection.

The x-axis represents the number of steps in the reasoning task, while the y-axis represents the average time in seconds. The chart visually demonstrates that CreDes significantly outperforms other methods in terms of time efficiency for long-range reasoning problems, highlighting its ability to handle multiple steps simultaneously.", "section": "4.4 Results"}]
