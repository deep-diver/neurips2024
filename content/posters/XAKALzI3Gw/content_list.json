We argue that these conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them.

The second category correspond to the intra-modality modeling methods [54, 33, 23, 39, 66]. This include approaches that consider the interactions between different modalities that occur only through the label (see Figure 1c). These approaches do not capture the relationship between the modalities for prediction, which contradicts the objective of multi-modal learning.

For cases with a small number of modalities, such as three or four, we can directly apply our modeling paradigm and iterate through all possible combinations of these modalities to construct our product of experts model. This method is straightforward due to the manageable number of combinations. For scenarios involving a larger number of modalities, we propose the following approach for future investigation. We envision employing a single network that receives all modalities as input. If any modality is absent for a specific example, this network receives a null token instead.
