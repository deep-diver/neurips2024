### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Multi-modal learning, which aims to analyze data from multiple sources (modalities), has faced challenges due to conventional approaches focusing solely on either inter-modality or intra-modality dependencies.  These approaches may not be optimal because they ignore the interaction between modalities and their relationship to the target label.  This limitation is especially problematic when the strengths of these relationships vary across datasets.

The paper proposes a new framework, I2M2, that tackles this limitation by jointly modeling both inter- and intra-modality dependencies. I2M2 shows substantial improvements over traditional methods in various applications including healthcare and vision-and-language tasks. **Its flexibility and adaptability make it a promising solution for future research in multi-modal learning**.

> This figure shows three different graphical models representing the data generation process in supervised multi-modal learning with two modalities (x, x') and an output label (y).  Model (a) is the proposed model showing that the label influences both modalities individually (intra-modality dependencies) and their interaction (inter-modality dependencies) through a selection variable (v=1).  Model (b) represents conventional approaches focusing only on inter-modality dependencies, where the label only affects the modalities indirectly via the selection variable.  Model (c) shows another conventional approach that focuses only on intra-modality dependencies by assuming the modalities are independent given the label.

> This table presents a comparison of the accuracy achieved by different multi-modal learning methods on the AV-MNIST dataset.  The methods compared include using only the image modality, only the audio modality, intra-modality modeling (considering each modality separately), and inter-modality modeling using two different techniques (late fusion (LF) and low-rank multimodal fusion (LRTF)). The results also include the performance of the proposed I2M2 (Inter- & Intra-Modality Modeling) framework using both LF and LRTF. The table highlights the best-performing methods in bold, demonstrating the superiority of I2M2.





### In-depth insights


#### Multimodal Modeling
Multimodal modeling tackles the challenge of integrating information from diverse sources to achieve a unified understanding.  It acknowledges that different modalities, such as text, images, and audio, offer complementary perspectives, and thus their combined analysis leads to richer insights than analyzing them in isolation. **Effective multimodal modeling requires careful consideration of how to represent and combine these heterogeneous data types.**  This often involves designing intricate architectures that can handle the varying structures and dimensionality of different modalities, as well as strategies to align and fuse the information they provide.  The choice between early fusion (combining modalities at the outset) and late fusion (combining them after individual processing) significantly impacts the model's performance.  **Successful multimodal modeling hinges on resolving inherent challenges such as modality bias (where one modality dominates the analysis), missing modalities, and the computational cost of managing large datasets.**  Research in this field explores innovative techniques, such as attention mechanisms and advanced fusion architectures to alleviate these issues, and seeks to develop robust and efficient methods for extracting valuable insights from diverse data sources.

#### I2M2 Framework
The I2M2 framework presents a novel approach to supervised multi-modal learning by **jointly modeling both inter- and intra-modality dependencies**.  Unlike traditional methods that focus solely on one type of dependency, I2M2 integrates both, leading to more robust and accurate predictions.  The framework's strength lies in its ability to **adaptively handle varying strengths of inter- and intra-modality relationships** across different datasets. It achieves this by incorporating individual modality classifiers, which capture intra-modality dependencies, and an additional classifier that integrates interactions between modalities. This integrated approach avoids the limitations of methods relying only on either inter- or intra-modality information, offering improved performance and flexibility.  **The generative model underpinning I2M2 provides a principled framework** that helps explain discrepancies observed in multi-modal learning across various applications.   Empirical evaluations demonstrate I2M2's superior performance compared to traditional methods, establishing its potential as a powerful tool for enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning systems.

#### Experimental Results
The experimental results section should thoroughly detail the methodology and findings, comparing the proposed I2M2 framework against existing inter- and intra-modality methods across various datasets.  **Key aspects to highlight** include the datasets' characteristics (size, modality types, and complexities), the specific metrics employed (accuracy, AUROC, etc.), and a clear visualization of the results (tables, graphs).  A crucial part is demonstrating the **superior performance of I2M2**, explaining the reasons for improvement, and showing how the approach handles different dependency strengths across tasks.  **Statistical significance** should be rigorously addressed, and the robustness of the model in handling distributional shifts needs to be discussed.  **Addressing any limitations** and potential failure cases is also essential for providing a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the proposed approach's performance.

#### Limitations of I2M2
The I2M2 framework, while demonstrating strong performance across diverse multi-modal tasks, presents some limitations.  **Computational cost scales linearly with the number of modalities**, making it potentially inefficient for high-modality scenarios.  The proposed solution of using a single network with null tokens for missing modalities is promising but requires further investigation.  **Model initialization presents a challenge**, with separate pre-training of individual modality models proving more effective than joint training from scratch, highlighting potential optimization difficulties in the joint training process.  **The reliance on a linear relationship between model complexity and the number of modalities might limit its scalability** to extremely high-dimensional multi-modal data. While I2M2 addresses the shortcomings of previous approaches that focus solely on inter- or intra-modality dependencies, these limitations should be considered when applying it to new, large-scale multi-modal datasets.

#### Future Research
The paper's discussion on future research directions is crucial for advancing multi-modal learning.  **Addressing the linear scaling of model size with added modalities** is vital; the proposed solution of using a single network with null tokens for missing modalities warrants further investigation. **Improving initialization strategies** is also key; the findings regarding separate pre-training of individual modalities before joint fine-tuning should be explored to develop more efficient end-to-end training methods. **Investigating the impact of spurious correlations in data** on model performance is essential.  Addressing these challenges could improve the efficiency and reliability of multi-modal models, leading to better generalization and robustness.  Further research into understanding and mitigating the negative societal impacts of improved multi-modal technology is crucial for responsible innovation.

> This figure compares the performance of different multi-modal learning methods on the fastMRI dataset for four knee pathologies (ACL, Meniscus, Cartilage, and Others).  The methods compared are: root-sum-of-squares (RSS) unimodal, magnitude unimodal, phase unimodal, intra-modality modeling, inter-modality modeling, and the proposed I2M2 method.  The results show that I2M2 achieves performance comparable to intra-modality modeling, indicating that the inter-modality dependencies contribute less to the prediction task in this specific case than the intra-modality dependencies.

> This figure visualizes examples from the VQA-VS OOD (out-of-distribution) test sets to illustrate how I2M2 handles spurious dependencies.  It shows examples where the question, image, or both contain elements that are spuriously correlated with certain answers in the training data (e.g., the word 'kite' in the image is correlated with the answer 'kite'). The figure demonstrates that I2M2, by using a product of experts, correctly predicts the target label even when these spurious correlations are absent, unlike individual models.
