Existing sub-quadratic solutions often underperform Transformers. This inefficiency hinders the development of LLMs capable of handling real-world applications requiring long sequences, such as long document comprehension or multi-turn conversations. \n\nThis paper introduces MEGALODON, a new architecture that addresses these issues. By incorporating several innovative components, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA) and a timestep normalization layer, MEGALODON achieves superior efficiency and stability compared to existing models, especially for long sequences. The results demonstrate significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, showcasing MEGALODON's potential for building more powerful and efficient LLMs.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "XlAbMZu4Bo/podcast.wav"}
