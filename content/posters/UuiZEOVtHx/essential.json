Existing methods often require unrealistic full data coverage, limiting their practical applicability.  Furthermore, many methods struggle with the complexities introduced by constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs).  This paper focuses on the offline setting for convex CMDPs, a general framework that includes many practical scenarios.\nThe paper presents a novel primal-dual algorithm based on linear programming, incorporating 'uncertainty' parameters to enhance data efficiency.  **The algorithm is proven to achieve a sample complexity of O(1/(1-\u03b3)\u221an), improving the current state-of-the-art by a factor of 1/(1-\u03b3).** This improvement is significant because it directly addresses the limitations of existing algorithms, leading to better performance in practical scenarios.  The paper's theoretical results are supported by strong empirical evidence showing improvements in both safety and learning efficiency.", "affiliation": "ShanghaiTech University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "UuiZEOVtHx/podcast.wav"}
