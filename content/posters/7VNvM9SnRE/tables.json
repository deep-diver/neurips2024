The comparison highlights the improvement in regret bounds obtained by the proposed algorithm, especially in scenarios where the assumption of \u03b8\u2080 = \u03b8\u2098\u2090\u2093 = 1 does not hold.  The table also shows the different assumptions made by each algorithm and their corresponding regret guarantees.", "section": "3. Improvement with Adaptive Pivots"}]
