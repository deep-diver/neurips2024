Existing methods often require unrealistic assumptions, such as a 'strong reference' item always present in choice sets, hindering their practical application. This limits their use in real-world scenarios like ad placement and recommender systems, where such assumptions often don't hold true.\nThis paper introduces novel, practical algorithms that address these limitations. By using a novel concentration guarantee based on 'Pairwise Rank-Breaking' to estimate model parameters, the proposed algorithms achieve provable optimality and efficiency.  They are free from the limitations of previous methods and demonstrate superior performance in empirical evaluations.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "7VNvM9SnRE/podcast.wav"}
