In this work, we use the theory of mind, i.e., the human user\u2019s beliefs about the AI agent, as a basis to develop a formal explanatory framework, called Expectation Alignment $(E A L)$ , to understand the objective misspecification and its causes. Our $E A L$ framework not only acts as an explanatory framework for existing works but also provides us with concrete insights into the limitations of existing methods to handle reward misspecification and novel solution strategies. We use these insights to propose a new interactive algorithm that uses the specified reward to infer potential user expectations about the system behavior.

Consider a problem where an agent can only perform two possible actions. These correspond to pressing two different switches. Each switch takes the agent to one of the two possible end states where the agent can no longer act. One corresponds to a safe end state, while the other corresponds to an unsafe one.

While several promising mathematical formalisms could be adopted to represent a human\u2019s behavioral expectations, we will focus on using the notion of occupancy frequency. There are multiple reasons for this choice. For one, this is a natural generalization of the notions of reachability. Psychological evidence supports that people use the notion of goals in decision-making [Simon, 1977]. While goals relate to the idea of reaching desirable end states, the notion of occupancy frequency allows us to extend it to intermediate ones. It even allows us to express probabilistic notions of reachability. Secondly, occupancy frequencies present a very general notion of problems that can be expressed as MDPs. As discussed in Section 2, the value of any given policy can be represented in terms of their occupancy frequency [Poupart, 2005].

In the simplest settings, humans might convert such expectations to rewards by setting low or even negative rewards to the states that need to be avoided and high rewards to the states they want the robot to visit. One question that is worth considering is why humans don\u2019t just communicate this expectation set. Unfortunately, communicating the entire set may be relatively inefficient compared to coming up with a reward function (for example, one might be able to compactly represent the reward function as a piece of code, while this set may not). This could also be the case if the number of states is very high or even infinite, but even in these settings, the reward function could still be specified in terms of features. Secondly, even if they choose to specify desirable or undesirable states, the expectation set may contain states that the human incorrectly thinks are impossible (for example, the robot jumping onto the table) and may choose to ignore them.

One could, in theory, also capture non-Markovian expectations using such formalisms. For example, there may be cases where the user might want the robot to visit a set of states in a specific sequence. We can capture such cases by creating augmented states that can track whether or not the robot visited the states in sequence.

In many cases, the expectations might be limited to the occupancy frequencies being forced to be zero (avoid certain states) or taking a non-zero value (should try to visit certain states).

To achieve the expected behavior in the human model, they have to choose a reward function that will result in an optimal policy where the button they believe will lead to the goal state has to be pressed. However, if the functionality of the switches is reversed in the robot model, none of those rewards will result in a robot policy that will lead to the state that the human wanted to visit.

Most work in this area tends to be motivated by the need to ensure safety. This is fueled by the recognition that people tend to be bad at correctly specifying their objectives [Booth et al., 2023, Milli et al., 2017], and optimizing for incorrectly specified objectives could have disastrous results [Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016]. One could roughly categorize the work done to develop more general methods to address this problem into two broad categories. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the first, the reward function is mostly taken to be true, but they assume there is a set of hard constraints, usually partially specified, on what state features could be changed [Weld and Etzioni, 1994], which are usually referred to as side-effects. As such, these works are usually framed in terms of avoiding negative side effects. Many works in this direction focus on the problem of how to identify potential side-effect features (cf. [Zhang et al., 2018, Saisubramanian et al., 2022, Mahmud et al., 2023b]), mostly by querying the users. Recent work has also looked at extending these methods to non-markovian side-effects [Srivastava et al., 2023] and even to possible epistemic side effects [Klassen et al., 2023]. In addition to querying, there are also works that look at minimizing potential side effects when coming up with behavior [Klassen et al., 2022b]. Previous work includes work in the context of factored planning problems (cf. [Klassen et al., 2022a, Mechergui and Sreedharan, 2023]) and reinforcement learning [Vamplew et al., 2021]. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second category treats the reward function provided by the user as merely constituting a partial specification or an observation of the true reward function held by the user. A canonical example is inverse reward design [Hadfield-Menell et al., 2017], which uses the specified reward function as a proxy to infer the true objective. For a good balance between conservatism and informativeness, Krasheninnikov et al. [2021] proposes an algorithm to infer the reward function from two confilcting reward function sources. Mahmud et al. [2023a] use explanations within their framework to verify and improve reward alignment. Pan et al. [2022] proposes anomaly detection to tackle reward hacking due to misspecification. This is also related to the CIRL framework [Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016], which eschews an agent from having its own reward function, but tries to maximize the human reward function. However, the agent estimate of this reward function may also be incorrect or incomplete. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our expectation-alignment framework allows us to capture the requirements of both of these sets of works. We can set negative side effects or safety constraints by setting the frequency of relevant states to zero. Our framework explicitly captures the fact that the specified reward should not be directly optimized in the true model. In scenarios where the reward function induces the same occupancy frequency in both human and robot models, recovering the human reward function suffices to generate expectation-aligned policies. But, as discussed this is not a general solution strategy. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another stream of work that is relevant to the current problem is that of imitation learning [Torabi et al., 2019] or learning from demonstration [Argall et al., 2009].

Apprenticeship learning [Abbeel and $\\mathrm{Ng}$ , 2004], and other methods that use inverse reinforcement learning (cf. [Arora and Doshi, 2021]) treat the reward function as an unknown entity and use the demonstration and any knowledge about the demonstrator to identify the true reward function. The objective then becomes to identify a policy that maximizes this learned reward function. In some sense, our work inverts this paradigm and starts from a specified reward function and tries to recreate what expectations may have led to this reward function. In addition to all the work on partially specified rewards, our work is also connected to preference/model elicitation (cf. [Boutilier, 2002] and [Chen and Pu, 2004]). Our proposed method can be thought of as a form of preference elicitation, except we focus on learning some specific kinds of preferences. It is also worth noting that there have been some efforts within the inverse-reinforcement learning community to formalize misspecification (cf. [Skalse and Abate, 2023]).

The human models were generated by modifying the original task slightly. The walkway involves a simple grid world where the robot can use a movable walkway to reach certain states easily, but the human is unaware of it. Obstacles involve the robot navigating to a goal while avoiding obstacles (the human model includes incorrect information about the obstacles). Four rooms [Sutton et al., 1999] involves the robot navigating through connected rooms, but in the human model, the use of certain doors may not be allowed.

This paper also focuses on settings where the models and planning functions are known upfront. We believe our method sets up a solid formal framework that can be used as a basis to develop future RL methods that could relax these assumptions. The paper also only instantiates a specific form of expectation set. More work needs to be done to identify when different forms of expectation may be appropriate.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
