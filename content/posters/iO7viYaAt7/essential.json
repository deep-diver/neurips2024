Existing methods implicitly define misspecification, lacking a clear understanding of its causes and solutions.  This issue leads to AI systems failing to achieve intended goals, highlighting the need for robust solutions. \nThis paper introduces **Expectation Alignment (EAL)**, a framework using theory of mind to formally define and explain misspecified objectives. EAL offers insights into existing methods' limitations and proposes a new interactive algorithm.  This algorithm infers potential user expectations from the reward function, mapping this inference to efficient linear programs for implementation.  Evaluated on standard benchmarks, the method demonstrates improvements in handling reward uncertainty, showcasing its potential for advancing AI safety research.", "affiliation": "Colorado State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Safety"}, "podcast_path": "iO7viYaAt7/podcast.wav"}
