The user's beliefs about the task and the agent's capabilities, along with their expectations about the agent's behavior, combine to inform their choice of reward function.  The reward function is then used by the AI agent (represented by a model) to determine its behavior, resulting in a policy. A mismatch between the user's expected policy and the actual policy generated by the agent indicates a misspecified reward function.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
