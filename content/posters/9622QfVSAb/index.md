### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on multimodal tasks even without specific multimodal training. However,  **a clear understanding of why this occurs is still lacking**, prompting researchers to explore the mechanisms underlying this capability and to develop more effective and efficient large multimodal models (LMMs). Previous hypotheses suggest that perceptual information is translated into textual tokens or that LLMs utilize modality-specific subnetworks. 

This research investigates the internal representations of frozen LLMs when processing various multimodal inputs (image, video, audio, and text).  The study reveals a novel "implicit multimodal alignment" effect.  **The findings indicate that while perceptual and textual tokens reside in distinct representation spaces, they activate similar LLM weights and become implicitly aligned during both training and inference.** This alignment, linked to the LLM's architecture, is shown to correlate with task performance and is inversely related to hallucinations.  These discoveries lead to practical improvements in LMM efficiency and model evaluation.

### In-depth insights


#### Frozen LLM Power
The concept of "Frozen LLM Power" highlights the surprising effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) when their weights are frozen and only a small, trainable adapter module is used to interface them with other modalities. This approach demonstrates **significant efficiency gains**, requiring far fewer parameters and training data than full fine-tuning.  The success suggests that **LLMs possess a strong inherent inductive bias**, capable of generalizing to multimodal tasks despite never having been explicitly trained on them.  Further research into the internal mechanisms of this generalization, specifically how different modalities interact and are implicitly aligned within the LLM's architecture, could reveal valuable insights into LLM design, ultimately leading to **more efficient and effective multimodal models**.  Understanding the "Frozen LLM Power" phenomenon could revolutionize LMM development, particularly for resource-constrained applications.

#### Multimodal Alignment
The concept of "Multimodal Alignment" in the context of large language models (LLMs) and their generalization to multimodal inputs is a crucial area of research.  The paper investigates how LLMs, primarily designed for text, manage to handle image, audio, and video data effectively.  A key finding is the existence of **implicit multimodal alignment (IMA)**, where despite perceptual tokens residing in distinct representational spaces compared to textual tokens, they activate similar LLM weights.  This suggests that the LLM's architecture, potentially through residual streams and steering blocks, plays a significant role in enabling generalization.  **IMA's strength correlates positively with task performance**, acting as a potential proxy metric for model evaluation. Furthermore, the study demonstrates a **negative correlation between IMA and the occurrence of hallucinations**, implying misalignment as a leading cause of these errors.  This multifaceted analysis reveals the complex interplay between unimodal and multimodal representations within LLMs, paving the way for more efficient inference methods and model compression techniques.

#### IMA as Proxy Metric
The concept of using the Implicit Multimodal Alignment (IMA) score as a proxy metric offers a compelling approach to evaluating and potentially streamlining multimodal models.  The core insight is that a higher IMA score, reflecting stronger alignment between internal representations of textual and perceptual data within a language model, correlates with improved task performance.  This suggests **IMA could serve as a more efficient and insightful evaluation metric** than relying solely on downstream task accuracy.  Furthermore, the connection between IMA and performance suggests **potential applications in model selection and design**, allowing researchers to prioritize models or architectural choices that promote stronger internal alignment. The findings might also contribute to understanding and mitigating issues like hallucinations, where misalignment between modalities is prominent. By focusing on this internal alignment, researchers can move beyond simply evaluating the outcome and gain a deeper understanding of the model's internal workings, leading to better models and improved efficiency.

#### LLM Compression
LLM compression, in the context of large multimodal models (LMMs), is a crucial area of research focusing on reducing the computational cost and memory footprint of these models.  The core idea is to maintain the impressive performance of LLMs on multimodal tasks while significantly reducing the model size.  **One primary approach involves identifying and leveraging redundancy in the LLM's weights.**  The paper's findings suggest that similar weights are often activated by both textual and perceptual (e.g. visual, audio) inputs. This redundancy allows for compression, where only a subset of the weights (a single 'a-SubNet') is needed to perform well across a broad spectrum of multimodal tasks, leading to significant efficiency gains. **The success of such compression methods hinges on the implicit multimodal alignment effect (IMA).**  This suggests that the underlying architectural design of LLMs plays a critical role in facilitating their generalization to multimodal data, which is also leveraged during the compression process.  Therefore, **architectural choices are key to the success of both LLM generalization to multimodal data and LLM compression**.  Further research is needed to investigate the scalability of such compression techniques to even larger models and more complex multimodal tasks, while also considering potential trade-offs between model size, computational cost and performance.

#### Future of LLMs
The future of LLMs is bright, but multifaceted.  **Multimodality** will be key, with models seamlessly integrating diverse data types (images, video, audio, text) to surpass current limitations.  **Efficiency gains** are crucial; current computational costs prohibit widespread access, necessitating advancements in model compression and more efficient training methods. **Safety and alignment** concerns demand significant attention, requiring robust techniques to minimize bias, prevent harmful outputs, and ensure human-aligned behavior.  **Explainability** is another pivotal aspect, transitioning from opaque black boxes to more transparent models that provide insights into their decision-making processes.  Finally, **applications** will continue to expand beyond current realms, impacting various fields and necessitating responsible development and deployment strategies.  While challenges remain, the potential of LLMs to revolutionize various industries is immense, particularly if these key areas see substantial progress.

It shows that perceptual tokens from different modalities (image, video, audio) tend to cluster separately, forming distinct 'narrow cones' in the embedding space. The textual tokens also form their own cluster. The cross-modal similarity (perceptual vs. textual) is noticeably lower than the within-modality similarities, indicating that the representations of perceptual and textual tokens are distinct within the LLM.

Overall, this figure provides a multi-faceted view of the internal workings of the model, revealing how textual and multimodal information interact and evolve across layers, revealing differences between different model configurations (with/without pretraining, use of MLP or Transformer).

It demonstrates that the similarity increases during both training (across different training epochs) and inference (across different LLM layers), suggesting an implicit alignment between the two modalities. This implicit alignment is a key finding of the paper, indicating that the LLM's architecture facilitates generalization to multimodal inputs.

It visually represents the workflow, starting with the analysis of multimodal tokens in LLMs.  The analysis reveals that these tokens reside in distinct representational spaces (multimodal cones) but exhibit implicit alignment (IMA). This IMA effect allows LLMs to be viewed as residual streams with steering blocks, explaining their ability to generalize across modalities.  The figure then illustrates how this understanding leads to practical implications in model performance, safety, and computational efficiency by highlighting potential improvements to these aspects.

> üîº This figure summarizes the key findings and implications of the research paper.  The analysis begins by examining how multimodal tokens (image, video, audio, and text) are represented within Large Language Models (LLMs). The study reveals that these tokens reside in distinct representational spaces, forming what are described as 'multimodal cones'.  Despite their differences, these tokens show an 'implicit multimodal alignment' (IMA).  This IMA effect suggests that the architecture of LLMs facilitates their ability to generalize to multimodal inputs.  The figure highlights three main implications stemming from these findings: 1. The IMA score serves as a potential proxy metric for assessing model performance and identifying instances of hallucinations; 2. Hallucinations appear to be primarily caused by misalignments between the internal representations of perceptual and textual inputs; and 3. The architectural design allows for computational efficiency improvements through skipping computations and LLM compression techniques.

> üîº This figure compares the implicit multimodal alignment score across different layers for various encoders in LLMs (Large Language Models).  The comparison highlights that CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models show the highest alignment between perceptual (image) and textual tokens across all layers of the LLM. In contrast, self-supervised models like MAE (Masked Autoencoder) exhibit the lowest alignment, indicating a greater distinction between the representations of the two modalities.  Despite the differences, the relatively low cosine similarity scores suggest that a substantial modality gap persists in LLMs, even in cases where the encoder is designed to align features with text.

> Figure 34: Comparison of implicit multimodal alignment score across layers for different encoders. CLIP models produce features that are most aligned to textual tokens across LLM layers. On the other hand, self-supervised encoders (e.g. MAE) produce the least text-aligned features. However, the relatively low cosine similarity score (closer to 0), reveals that the modality gap (e.g. Narrow cones) still exists in LLMs, even for text-aligned encoders.
