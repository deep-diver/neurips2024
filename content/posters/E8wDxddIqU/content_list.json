The pursuit of a performative optimum (PO)\u2014minimizing performative risk\u2014is generally reliant on modeling of the distribution map, which characterizes how a deployed ML model alters the data distribution. Unfortunately, inevitable misspecification of the distribution map can lead to a poor approximation of the true PO. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework of distributionally robust performative prediction and study a new solution concept termed as distributionally robust performative optimum (DRPO). We show provable guarantees for DRPO as a robust approximation to the true PO when the nominal distribution map is different from the actual one. Moreover, distributionally robust performative prediction can be reformulated as an augmented performative prediction problem, enabling efficient optimization.

The majority of research focuses on performative stability [29, 25, 5, 30, 21, 8, 7], albeit with a few exceptions aiming at performative optimality. [26] propose a two-stage plug-in method for finding the PO. [14] propose to find the PO by a parametric model of the distribution map. This method is extended by [15] to stateful performative prediction. [18] solves the PO when the problem is outcome performative only. [24] argue that the PO with a misspecified nominal distribution map can still reasonably approximate the true PO, as long as the misspecification level is not significant. This claim is also supported by our theory and experimental findings. Unlike them, we demonstrate that the DRPO is comparable to the PO if the misspecification is small, whereas the DRPO can offer substantial advantages over the PO if the misspecification is moderate to large. Moreover, the DRPO ensures reasonable performance for all distribution maps in an uncertainty collection surrounding the nominal distribution map, rather than just a single distribution map.

Our algorithms can be modified to compute Wasserstein DRPO. For example, one can establish the strong duality of Wasserstein DRPO and develop an alternating minimization algorithm similar to Algorithm 1. However, the new algorithm involves an additional step of transport cost-regularized loss maximization due to the more complex dual form of Wasserstein DRO.

The main text covers the discussion of the conservativeness of $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ in two ways. Firstly, we show the trade-off in selecting $\\rho$ . For values of $\\rho$ ranging from small to moderate, DRPO outperforms PO in terms of performative risk (and similarly for worst-case performative risk). Conversely, for large values of $\\rho$ , PO is better than DRPO. There exists an \"sweet spot\" of $\\rho$ where DRPO yields maximal benefits over PO. This trade-off between DRPO and PO is demonstrated in any \"vertical slices\" of the left plot of Figure 1 (and similarly in the lines of the middle plot of Figure 1 for worst-case performance). Secondly, we show the performance of the calibrated radius $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ in the middle plot of Figure 1, where the vertical bands indicate the calibrated radius $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ . Although $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ doesn\u2019t achieve the best possible worst-case improvement (which is an impossible oracle), it achieves a comparable performance, especially when $\\bar{\\eta}\\in\\{0.8,1.0\\}$ .

An analogous explanation applies to the difference between DRPO and simple DRO. TERM (or implicitly equivalently simple DRO) is ineffective in the context of this work\u2019s problem setup because it fails to account for performativity. Note that our methods are not doing DRO because the uncertainty set here depends on the model parameter $\\theta$ .

Here we clarify the calibration set method and briefly discuss a possible solution when there is no calibration set. In the experiment of Section 5.3, we only need a small set of calibration data, which aligns with the regime of \"weak group information\". It is generally difficult to calibrate radius for uncertainty set and most distributional robustness related work only concerns the effect of increasing $\\alpha$ and $\\rho$ . We do more to demonstrate that there are some practical calibration methods that work. In the absence of any calibration data, one can specify the radius by some prior belief. For example, consider $\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{pop}}(\\theta)=}&{{}}\\end{array}$ $\\gamma\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{major}}(\\theta)+(1-\\gamma)\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{minor}}^{\\overline{{\\mathbf{\\alpha}}}}(\\overline{{\\theta}})$ as in Example 2.3.
