Leveraging effective contextual information, a label consistency learning framework Con4m is proposed to progressively harmonize inconsistent labels during training. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance achieved by Con4m and highlight the effectiveness of the proposed consistent label training framework. Our work still has some limitations. We have solely focused on analyzing and designing end-to-end supervised models. Further exploration of large-scale models would be challenging yet intriguing. Con4m is a combination of segmentation and classification, both of which are fully supervised. Exploring its application in unsupervised segmentation tasks is worthwhile. When faced with more diverse label behaviors, the function fitting module needs to engage in more selection and design of basis functions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
