Motivated by the success of collaborative modeling in various domains, such as recommender systems, we aim to investigate how collaborative signals among learners contribute to the diagnosis of human cognitive states (i.e., knowledge proficiency) in the context of intelligent education. The primary challenges lie in identifying implicit collaborative connections and disentangling the entangled cognitive factors of learners for improved explainability and controllability in learner Cognitive Diagnosis (CD). However, there has been no work on CD capable of simultaneously modeling collaborative and disentangled cognitive states. To address this gap, we present Coral, a Collaborative cognitive diagnosis model with disentangled representation learning. Specifically, Coral first introduces a disentangled state encoder to achieve the initial disentanglement of learners\u2019 states. Subsequently, a meticulously designed collaborative representation learning procedure captures collaborative signals. It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by iteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using the constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node representation learning. Finally, a decoding process aligns the initial cognitive states and collaborative states, achieving co-disentanglement with practice performance reconstructions.

To gain a deeper understanding of the human learning process, it is crucial to explicitly diagnose unobservable cognitive states. Existing Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) methods seek to enhance diagnostic accuracy by fully utilizing the inner-learner information (i.e., individual attributions [41] and explicit practice records) and question-side features (e.g., difficulty [16], textual content [26], and educational relations [12, 14]).

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u2022 First, acquiring explicit collaborative connections among learners proves to be a formidable challenge. On the one hand, unlike many well-defined social scenarios (e.g., Twitter.com), where user preference similarities are manifested through explicit social actions such as following and liking, the directly available social behaviors among learners in learning environments (e.g., LeetCode.com) cannot be used for diagnosis modeling since these social attributes cannot reflect true cognitive-oriented connections. On the other hand, some related studies [28, 13] attempt to design different similarity functions based on practice data to compute cognitive similarities among learners. However, these approaches pose a significant challenge of manually selecting appropriate metrics and corresponding thresholds, introducing additional inductive biases. Although various methods for constructing user relationships have been proposed in other domains [22, 9], these approaches do not consider the domain-specific attributes of students in learning scenarios and cannot be directly applied in educational contexts.   \n\u2022 Second, an ideal collaborative diagnosis procedure requires disentangling and uncovering the mixed explanatory latent factors hidden in the observed learning behaviors. The basic motivation is that learners demonstrate complex and diverse patterns driven by entangled states across both innerand inter-learner perspectives. For instance, from an inner perspective, Nancy may not master Cone since she does not practice Cone-related questions. However, based on inter-learner data, one can infer a high probability that she has mastered Cone. Most prior attempts can not fulflil this requirement since they learn representations in an entangled way. Although recent models [8, 50] achieve a dimension-level disentanglement of cognitive states, they lack consideration of modeling the influence of collaborative connections, ignoring the complex relations between inner- and inter-learner connections of different individuals. Thereby, it needs to find a suitable way to achieve the co-disentanglement from both the inner- and inter-learner views for cognitive representations with higher interpretability and controllability.

To address this challenge, we present a context-aware collaborative graph learning mechanism that automatically explores all $K$ -optimal neighbors for each learner given their basic cognitive states to facilitate the explicit modeling of collaborative connections among learners.

It aims to profile the implicit cognitive states (i.e., the proficiency of specific knowledge concepts) of learners by exploiting observed practice records (e.g., correct or wrong). Existing research on CD assumes that learners\u2019 knowledge proficiency is proportional to their practice performance and thus can be diagnosed through predicting their practice performance [12]. Since the diagnostic results can be applied to many intelligent applications, such as exercise recommendation [18] and learning path suggestions [55], many CD models have been proposed in recent years. The early works from psychology like IRT [16] and MIRT [1] focus on modeling learners\u2019 answering process by predicting the probability of a learner answering a question correctly, which utilizes latent factors as the learner\u2019s ability. These methods lack interpretability, i.e., they are inability to output explicit multidimensional diagnostic results on each knowledge concept. To achieve better interpretability, later diagnostic models focus on incorporating knowledge concepts of questions to diagnose learners\u2019 proficiency on all knowledge concepts [38, 45, 46, 32]. Representative NCDM [40] adopts neural networks to model non-linear interactions instead of handcrafted interaction functions in previous works (e.g., IRT, and MIRT). In summary, existing CD studies enhance diagnostic accuracy by fully utilizing the inner-learner information (i.e., individual attributions and explicit practice records) [41, 50]and question-side features (e.g., difficulty [16, 38], textual content [26], and educational relations [12, 14, 8]).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
