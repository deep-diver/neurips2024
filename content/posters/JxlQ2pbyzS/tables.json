The performance is measured using four metrics: Accuracy (ACC), Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), F1-score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  Higher values for ACC, AUC, and F1-score indicate better performance, while a lower RMSE value indicates better performance.

The metrics used are Accuracy (ACC), Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), F1-score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Each row represents a variation of the Coral model: one without the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) term; one without the collaborative aggregation during decoding (collar); one using the K-Nearest Neighbors (knn) algorithm instead of the proposed collaborative graph learning method; and finally, the full Coral model. The results show the contribution of each component and the overall effectiveness of the proposed model.", "section": "4.2 Experimental Results"}]
