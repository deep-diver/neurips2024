Data-driven methods are fast but generalize poorly, while overfitting-based methods are slow. The problem is exacerbated in challenging scenarios like highly noisy point clouds. \nThis paper introduces LocalN2NM, a method that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and overfitting-based approaches. It uses a novel statistical reasoning algorithm to finetune data-driven priors without needing clean data or point normals.  **This leads to faster convergence and better generalization compared to existing methods.** LocalN2NM demonstrates superior performance in surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising across multiple benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "Hgqs1b4ECy/podcast.wav"}
