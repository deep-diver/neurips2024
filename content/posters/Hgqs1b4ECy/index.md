### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Estimating accurate signed distance functions (SDFs) from point clouds is crucial in various applications, but existing methods struggle with noisy data or slow convergence.  Data-driven methods are fast but generalize poorly, while overfitting-based methods are slow. The problem is exacerbated in challenging scenarios like highly noisy point clouds. 

This paper introduces LocalN2NM, a method that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and overfitting-based approaches. It uses a novel statistical reasoning algorithm to finetune data-driven priors without needing clean data or point normals.  **This leads to faster convergence and better generalization compared to existing methods.** LocalN2NM demonstrates superior performance in surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising across multiple benchmark datasets.

> This figure illustrates the proposed method's two-stage process: (1) training a data-driven prior using a clean dataset to learn a neural implicit function, and (2) inference on a noisy point cloud, where the learned prior is fine-tuned using a novel statistical reasoning algorithm to infer a neural SDF without needing signed distance supervision, clean points, or point normals.

> This table presents a numerical comparison of the proposed method with several state-of-the-art methods on the ShapeNet dataset.  The comparison uses three metrics: CDL1 (Chamfer Distance L1) which measures the distance between the reconstructed surface and the ground truth, NC (Normal Consistency) which measures the accuracy of the normals, and F-Score which is a combined metric reflecting surface reconstruction quality. Lower values of CDL1 and higher values of NC and F-Score indicate better performance.





### In-depth insights


#### Prior-Finetuning
Prior-finetuning, in the context of neural signed distance function (SDF) inference, presents a powerful strategy to leverage the strengths of both data-driven and overfitting-based approaches.  **Data-driven priors provide a strong initialization**, accelerating convergence and improving generalization compared to purely overfitting methods that start from scratch. **Finetuning adapts this prior to a specific, noisy point cloud**, allowing the model to capture fine details and overcome the limitations of limited training data, thus addressing the poor generalization often associated with purely data-driven methods. This approach cleverly combines the benefits of rapid inference inherent in using pretrained models with the ability to refine the reconstruction for a single, noisy input, achieving superior accuracy.  A key challenge lies in the design of the finetuning loss function: it must be robust to noise, require minimal supervision, and effectively guide the network toward an accurate SDF representation. The success of prior-finetuning hinges on carefully selecting a suitable prior model and loss function to achieve this balance. The overall effect is a significant improvement in both the speed and accuracy of neural SDF inference, leading to improved 3D surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising.

#### Noise-Robust SDF
The concept of a 'Noise-Robust SDF' is crucial for real-world applications of Signed Distance Functions (SDFs).  Real-world point cloud data is inherently noisy, stemming from various sources like sensor limitations and environmental factors.  A noise-robust SDF method must effectively handle this noise, **avoiding overfitting to spurious data points** and ensuring the generated implicit surface accurately represents the underlying shape.  This robustness can be achieved through several strategies, including **statistical reasoning in local regions**, **data-driven priors** (pre-trained models that capture general shape characteristics), and **regularization techniques** that prevent the model from becoming overly complex.  The success of a noise-robust SDF approach hinges on the balance between accurately capturing details from clean data points while mitigating the impact of noise.  **Algorithms that incorporate robust loss functions** and **local filtering mechanisms** are likely to prove more effective in this challenge. The ultimate goal is to produce a smooth, accurate SDF representation even from extremely noisy input data, making SDFs practical for applications such as 3D reconstruction and point cloud denoising.

#### Local Statistical Reasoning
The proposed "Local Statistical Reasoning" method presents a novel approach to inferring neural signed distance functions (NDSFs) from noisy point clouds. Unlike global methods that consider the entire point cloud simultaneously, this technique focuses on smaller, localized regions. **This localized approach is crucial for handling noise effectively**, as it prevents noise in one area from significantly affecting the estimation of distances in other regions.  The method leverages statistical reasoning within these local neighborhoods to estimate a mean zero-level set representing the underlying surface.  This is achieved by minimizing the distance between sampled query points projected onto the zero-level set and the noisy points within the local region.  The core innovation lies in its ability to **finetune a pre-trained data-driven prior**, achieving faster convergence and better generalization compared to purely overfitting-based methods.  This hybrid approach combines the strengths of both data-driven priors (fast inference) and overfitting (good generalization) to produce NDSFs with higher accuracy and improved efficiency, particularly in challenging scenarios like highly noisy point clouds. The effectiveness is demonstrated by superior results on surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising benchmarks. **Key advantages include the lack of reliance on clean data, point normals or signed distance supervision during inference**, making it robust and widely applicable.

#### Efficiency Improvements
In the realm of neural signed distance function (SDF) inference, efficiency is paramount.  The presented method leverages **data-driven priors** finetuned through an overfitting strategy on noisy point clouds. This approach elegantly balances the strengths of both data-driven and overfitting methods. Data-driven priors provide a strong initialization, accelerating convergence and improving generalization on unseen data.  The novel statistical reasoning algorithm used for finetuning **significantly reduces inference time** compared to purely overfitting-based methods.  The **local nature of this statistical reasoning** further enhances computational efficiency by focusing on smaller regions of the point cloud instead of performing global operations.  This combination of well-initialized priors and localized processing contributes to the overall efficiency improvements. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through superior results on various benchmarks, showcasing a significant speed-up in both surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising tasks while retaining or surpassing the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art techniques.

#### Limitations & Future Work
This research demonstrates a novel method for inferring neural signed distance functions (NDFs) from single, noisy point clouds.  **A key limitation** is the method's sensitivity to extremely noisy data; while it outperforms existing methods on moderately noisy data, severely corrupted point clouds still pose challenges.  **Future work** could focus on improving robustness to extreme noise levels, perhaps by incorporating more sophisticated noise filtering techniques or developing more robust loss functions.  Another area for improvement is **scalability**. Although the method is faster than some overfitting-based approaches, further optimizations could make it more suitable for large-scale datasets.  Exploring different architectural choices for the neural network or investigating more efficient training strategies might yield significant improvements. Finally, **generalization to unseen point cloud distributions** warrants further investigation; additional experiments across diverse datasets could validate the method's broader applicability and reveal any limitations in generalization capability.
