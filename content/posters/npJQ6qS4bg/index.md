### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large transformer models often suffer from outlier features (OFs) ‚Äì neurons with unusually high activation magnitudes. These OFs hinder model quantization, a crucial technique for making models smaller and faster.  Prior work provided limited understanding of why OFs appear and how to minimize them effectively.



This paper introduces a novel transformer block, the "Outlier Protected" (OP) block, that removes normalization layers to mitigate OFs.  Furthermore, it highlights the benefit of using non-diagonal preconditioning optimizers, such as SOAP. The results show that combining the OP block and SOAP leads to significant OF reduction and improved int8 quantization performance even at larger scales (7B parameters), showcasing efficient and effective solutions to a major challenge in transformer training.

The evaluation metric used is perplexity (PPL) on the Languini Books dataset.  The results show that the OP block achieves comparable perplexity to the Pre-LN block across all model sizes, indicating that the OP block can effectively minimize outlier features without compromising performance.

### In-depth insights


#### Outlier Feature Effects
Outlier features (OFs), neurons with activation magnitudes significantly exceeding the average, pose substantial challenges in transformer training.  **OFs hinder quantization**, leading to increased errors in low-precision models and impacting efficiency. This paper investigates OF emergence, exploring various architectural and optimization choices to minimize their effects.  **Normalization layers, while beneficial for training, are implicated in OFE**.  The study introduces a novel unnormalized transformer block and highlights a previously unknown benefit of non-diagonal preconditioners. These methods significantly reduce OFs without sacrificing convergence speed, demonstrating considerable improvements in quantization. The research also explores the link between OFs and signal propagation, **suggesting that poor signal propagation leads to increased OFs**.  Furthermore, the impact of optimization choices, specifically learning rates and adaptive preconditioning, on OFE is analyzed, revealing strategies to mitigate OFs while maintaining efficient training.

#### OP Block Design
The Outlier Protected (OP) block is a novel transformer block design that directly addresses the issue of outlier features (OFs) in transformer models.  **Its core innovation is the removal of normalization layers**, which previous research has implicated in the emergence of OFs.  To compensate for the loss of normalization's benefits (such as improved signal propagation and training stability), the OP block incorporates several key mechanisms: **downweighted residual branches** to maintain signal propagation; an **entropy regulation mechanism** (such as QK-Norm) to prevent entropy collapse, a common training instability in transformers; and **optional input scaling** to ensure that the nonlinearities receive inputs of the order of 1, improving the model's numerical stability. This multi-pronged approach allows the OP block to effectively minimize OFs without compromising convergence speed or training stability, ultimately leading to models that are more amenable to quantization and efficient low-precision training.

#### Signal Propagation
The concept of signal propagation in the context of neural networks, specifically transformers, is explored. The authors investigate its link to outlier features (OFs), neurons with unusually high activation magnitudes.  **Signal propagation studies how information flows through network layers, analyzing the input-wise Gram matrix (XXT).**  Poor signal propagation, nearing rank collapse where all inputs appear similar to deeper layers, is associated with OFs.  The authors suggest that **architectural choices impacting signal propagation directly influence the occurrence of OFs.** Removing normalization layers, a key contributor to poor signal propagation,  is proposed as a method to minimize OFs.  Further, they identify that interventions to enhance signal propagation also effectively reduce OFEs.  **A key finding is the connection between poor signal propagation and increased activation kurtosis, a measure of OFs.**  The authors use this insight to develop the 'Outlier Protected' block, mitigating OFs without compromising training stability or convergence speed.

#### Optimizer Effects
The research explores how optimizer choices significantly impact the emergence of outlier features (OFs) during transformer training.  **AdamW and AdaFactor**, being adaptive diagonal preconditioners, exhibit a strong correlation between large adaptive learning rates and OF occurrence; smaller learning rates mitigate this.  Conversely, **non-diagonal preconditioners like Shampoo and SOAP**, by rotating the parameter space before applying a diagonal optimization method, significantly minimize OFs, even with OF-prone architectures like Pre-Norm, **demonstrating the importance of non-diagonal preconditioning**. The study underscores the intricate interplay between optimizer characteristics and the occurrence of OFs, highlighting the potential benefits of sophisticated optimization techniques in improving the efficiency and robustness of large language model training.

#### Quantization Gains
The research paper explores quantization, a technique to reduce the numerical precision of model parameters and activations.  **Significant quantization gains** are reported, achieving a 14.87 int8 weight-and-activation perplexity (from 14.71 in standard precision) when combining an Outlier Protected (OP) block and a non-diagonal preconditioner (SOAP). This represents a substantial improvement over the 63.4 int8 perplexity (from 16.00) obtained with a default, outlier-prone combination of a Pre-Norm model and Adam. **These gains are attributed to the mitigation of outlier features (OFs),** which hinder quantization.  The study highlights that architectural and optimization choices influence OFs, emphasizing that removing normalization layers and employing non-diagonal preconditioners significantly reduces OFs and leads to improved quantization performance.  **The Outlier Protected block, a novel unnormalized transformer block,** plays a crucial role in achieving these benefits. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates that a thoughtful approach to minimizing outlier features is vital for successful low-precision model training and deployment.  **Further research is needed to fully understand and predict the emergence of outlier features** in transformer training to enable further quantization improvement.

The y-axis represents the kurtosis of neuron activation RMS, and the x-axis represents the training steps.  Each plot shows how the kurtosis changes over training steps for different layers in the model.  The outlier features are significant in these models and increase during training, especially in early layers.

> This figure shows the architecture of the Outlier Protected (OP) Transformer block, a novel unnormalised transformer block proposed in the paper.  The OP block replaces the standard Pre-Norm block by removing the normalisation layers. Key improvements include downweighting residual branches to recover training benefits, adding an entropy regulation mechanism (like QK-Norm) to prevent entropy collapse and optionally scaling inputs before the MLP nonlinearity. The authors argue that this design minimizes outlier features.

This reduction in kurtosis is significant because it indicates that the OP block effectively mitigates the Outlier Features (OFs) phenomenon, which is known to hinder model quantization. The figure supports the paper's claim that the OP block improves model performance by mitigating OFE without compromising convergence speed.

It demonstrates that the OP block consistently reduces activation kurtosis (a measure of outlier features) across all layers, especially in early layers, compared to the Pre-LN block. The results highlight that the OP block effectively mitigates outlier features without sacrificing training speed or stability.

> This figure shows the architecture of the proposed Outlier Protected (OP) Transformer block.  The key differences from standard Pre-Norm blocks are the removal of normalization layers before both the attention and MLP sub-blocks and the addition of three components:  1) downscaling of residual branches using a trainable scalar Œ≤; 2) an entropy regulation mechanism to prevent entropy collapse (like QK-Norm); and 3) (optionally) scaling of MLP inputs before the nonlinearity using a trainable scalar Œ±. The figure illustrates how these modifications combine to mitigate the formation of outlier features.

> This figure compares the activation kurtosis of residual streams across different layers for both the OP block and the standard Pre-LN block.  The results show that the OP block consistently exhibits lower kurtosis, particularly in earlier layers, indicating a significant reduction in outlier features (OFs).  The differences are several orders of magnitude across training steps.  It also highlights that the default Pre-LN models always exhibit a higher peak kurtosis during training.

> The figure shows the cumulative sums of different order terms that contribute to the changes in the second and fourth moments of neuron activations during training.  These changes are directly related to the kurtosis, a measure of the 'tailedness' of the distribution. The plot compares different model configurations (OP, Pre-LN, and variations of Pre-LN with different hyperparameter settings), highlighting how the quadratic term in the fourth-moment update is often the dominant factor driving the increase in kurtosis, particularly in the Pre-LN models. Reducing the learning rate, increasing the Adam epsilon, or using a non-diagonal preconditioner (SOAP) all reduce the magnitude of this dominant quadratic term.

> The figure compares the activation kurtosis in different layers of a transformer model with and without the proposed Outlier Protected (OP) block. The results show that the OP block significantly reduces the activation kurtosis across all layers, especially in the early layers, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating outlier features.

> The figure shows the cumulative values of different terms that contribute to the kurtosis updates during training.  It compares these values for various model configurations, including an Outlier Protected (OP) model and standard Pre-LN models with and without modifications (small learning rate, increased epsilon in Adam, and using SOAP). The results indicate that the quadratic term (u4,2) is the primary driver of the increase in kurtosis in the standard Pre-LN model, while modifications that reduce OFs also reduce this quadratic term.

> This table shows the results of quantization experiments on the OPT-125m model.  Different model architectures (Pre-LN, Gated Attention, OP) and optimizer hyperparameters are compared. The table reports the average kurtosis across layers, standard precision perplexity (FP16/32), and quantized int8 perplexity (W8A8).  The key finding is that the combination of the OP architecture and the SOAP optimizer achieves the lowest quantized perplexity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods for minimizing outlier features and improving quantization.

> This table presents the results of an experiment on quantizing OPT-125m models.  It shows the average kurtosis across layers, standard precision perplexity (FP16/32), and quantized int8 perplexity (W8A8) for various model architectures and optimization choices. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between kurtosis and int8 error. The best performing int8 setup uses the proposed Outlier Protected (OP) block and SOAP optimizer.

> This table presents the results of experiments evaluating different model architectures and optimization strategies on the task of quantizing OPT-125m language models. The table compares standard precision perplexity (FP16/32) and int8 quantized perplexity (W8A8), along with the average kurtosis across layers.  The results show a strong correlation between kurtosis (a measure of outlier features) and int8 quantization error.  The combination of the Outlier Protected (OP) block and the SOAP optimizer yields the lowest kurtosis and the smallest increase in perplexity after quantization.
