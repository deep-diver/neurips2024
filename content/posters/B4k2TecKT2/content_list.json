However, the incorporation of additional architectures often compromises the model\u2019s interpretability, rendering it unsuitable for high-impact educational environments. For instance, in high-stakes exams like the GRE, only IRT [29], a classical CD model, has been applied due to their statistical superiority [30].

Specifically, it posits that a student\u2019s proficiency exhibits a monotonic relationship with the probability of providing a correct response to an exercise. Using Figure 1 as an example, Sue, who correctly responds to exercise $e_{1}$ , is considered to possess a higher proficiency level in the related concept C (i.e., Absolute Value) compared to Bob, who provides an incorrect response. This ensures the interpretability of CD, contributing to its widespread acceptance and application.

Later, Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) [35] was introduced to extend the single-trait features in IRT to multidimensions. While these models were effective and provided interpretable diagnostic results based on psychometric theories, they heavily relied on handcrafted interaction functions and could only leverage users\u2019 numerical response records, which were often affected by data sparsity [25]. With the advancements in machine learning, researchers began developing CD models from a machine-learning perspective. One notable model in this regard is NCDM [39], which employed neural networks to learn the interactions between students and exercises, yielding satisfactory results. However, the majority of existing works have primarily focused on designing more complex architectures to alleviate data sparsity.

We attribute this to the fact that models dependent on neural network backbones, such as NCDM, exhibit superior data fitting capabilities, thereby alleviating issues related to data sparsity. Consequently, the gains achieved by CMCD on NCDM are less conspicuous. In contrast, traditional IRT models are more susceptible to the impact of data sparsity, making CMCD\u2019s influence more substantial in such cases.

In CMCD, two hyperparameters control the effectiveness. Specifically, $c$ controls the strength of the constraints, and $|C_{i}|$ regulates the number of generated students. In this section, we investigate the impact of adjusting these two hyperparameters on CMCD using the Math dataset. The specific results are presented in Figure 8 and Figure 9. In Figure 8, a consistent trend is observed across different backbones. Initially, with the strengthening of $c$ , both fairness and utility show improvement, indicating the efficacy of our monotonicity enhancement. However, as $c$ reaches a certain intensity, both fairness and utility experience a decline. We attribute this to the possibility that an excessively large $c$ might interfere with the model\u2019s normal training, leading to a decrease in effectiveness. Moving to Figure 9, diverse trends are identified across different backbones. Specifically, in the case of IRT, as the number of contrasts increases, both fairness and utility consistently improve. Conversely, for NCDM, as the quantity of contrasts grows, there is a continuous decline in utility. We attribute these observations to inherent differences in the nature of the models. IRT is more affected by data sparsity, so enhancing $C_{i}$ effectively mitigates data sparsity, yielding improved results. On the other hand, NCDM, benefiting from its neural network\u2019s fitting capacity, partially alleviates data sparsity issues.
