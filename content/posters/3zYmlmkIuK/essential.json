Existing MARL algorithms often rely on synchronous communication or linear function approximations, hindering efficiency and practicality.  Asynchronous communication is more realistic but challenging to design efficient algorithms for, especially when considering general nonlinear function approximation, as it increases complexity. This paper tackles this challenge. \nThe paper introduces two novel algorithms: Async-NLin-UCB for multi-agent contextual bandits and Async-NLSVI-UCB for multi-agent reinforcement learning.  Both algorithms are designed for asynchronous communication and general function approximation, theoretically guaranteeing low regret and communication complexity.  **Key features include a novel communication criterion to effectively control communication overhead while ensuring low regret and a design to protect agent data privacy.** The algorithms' efficiency is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, showing their scalability and applicability to complex, real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3zYmlmkIuK/podcast.wav"}
