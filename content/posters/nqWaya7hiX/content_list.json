However, during the continued training, the MLLM catastrophically forgets the text-only instructions that the initial LLM masters. In this paper, we present WINGS, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only and multimodal instructions. By examining attention across layers of MLLM, we find that text-only forgetting is related to the attention shifts from pre-image to post-image text. From that, we construct an additional Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) block that acts as the \u201cmodality learner\u201d to expand the learnable space and compensate for the attention shift. The complementary learners, like \u201cwings\u201d on either side, are connected in parallel to each layer\u2019s attention block. The LoRRA mirrors the structure of attention but utilizes low-rank connections to ensure efficiency. Initially, image and text inputs are aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention, balancing focus on visual elements. Later, textual learners are integrated with token-wise routing, blending the outputs of both modality learners collaboratively. Our experimental results demonstrate that WINGS outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual question-answering tasks.

Common MLLMs build upon powerful pre-trained LLMs that take mixed textual and visual tokens as inputs. The visual ones are acquired using an image encoder and a projector. We describe instructions processed by the LLM without images as text-only instructions. In comparison, multimodal instructions incorporate visual feature tokens into text-only sequences. Modality fusing at the token level provides a flexible and effective pipeline for training MLLMs to comprehend visual information [76, 79, 80]. However, training on multimodal instructions seems to impair the pre-existing profound knowledge, especially making MLLM forget how to respond to text-only instructions like the initial LLM [85, 89]. MLLM experiences a drastic performance decline on text-only evaluation. We term it as the text-only forgetting of MLLM.

As demonstrated in Figure 1, users often start with text-only inquiries and then, if not fully satisfied with the response, proceed to supplement questions with visual content. For multimodal instructions, MLLMs still rely on text to capture critical elements, as images may offer redundant information [15, 17, 84]. The first existing approaches replay extensive text-only or interleaved [60, 145] training data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs [71, 85, 89]. However, increasing training data incurs additional computational overhead and data collection challenges. Secondly, some applications [40] switch between LLM and MLLM based on whether images are included. This intuitive solution inevitably demands more deployment memory [1, 2] and is less cache-friendly in long vision-andlanguage interleaved conversations [42, 75, 100]. Therefore, it is crucial to train MLLM while preserving the text-only performance efficiently.

Considering that MLLM\u2019s attention weights reflect the focus on tokens and influence the decisionmaking process, we first analyze the attention weights across each layer of the MLLM. Specifically, for each layer, we compute the attention weight proportion on all text tokens before and after the inserted image, termed as Layer-level Attention Weights (LAWS) of the before and after image text. From this, we examine the dynamic of attention across all layers as MLLM-Laws. Through training and sampling over 100 diverse MLLMs, we find that a well-trained model with superior text-only performance shows a positive correlation of MLLM-LAWS between the text segments before and after the image. This suggests that in a well-structured feature space, the main branch attention on text exhibits similar trends across layers, which is statistically linked to the semantic similarity of the text around the visual part.

In the first stage, visual features align with textual feature tokens, with all visual learners operating parallel to the main branch attention. The visual learners allocate some attention to visual tokens, mitigating the attention shift in the main branch. Subsequently, textual learners are integrated in parallel.

Even though existing Transformer-based [117] models [20, 82, 99, 131] like BERT [57] and OPT [139] have demonstrated profound language understanding capabilities, there has been a recent surge in powerful Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) [10] under the auto-regressive language modeling paradigm. Both public [53, 54, 112, 113] and private [3, 92, 94, 110] solutions show remarkable progress in language comprehension and generation [90, 123]. These LLMs generally exceed a billion parameters, including pre-training [22, 32, 49, 55], supervised fine-tuning with instructions [26, 103, 108, 122], and reinforcement learning from human feedback [23, 95, 106, 146] on massive training data. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Integrating visual inputs into foundational LLMs to create MLLMs is becoming increasingly popular [18, 19, 62, 71, 133]. Unlike vision-centric multimodal frameworks [68, 134] such as CLIP series [98], MLLMs aim to align new modality features as the input of LLM with an additional encoder and perform multimodal questionanswering [74, 79, 80, 125, 138, 144]. As illustrated in Figure 2 (a), it enables the combined training of mixed multimodal tokens, facilitating rapid deployment across various applications [24, 25, 44, 81, 119]. One example of this pipeline is the LLaVA [79] series, which integrates a CLIP vision encoder with a linear projection to LLM Vicuna [21] and innovatively introduces instruction-following training data. Following this, some methods consider the richness of the vision-related training context [14, 45, 61], the scaled visual backbone [51, 72, 78], or the enhanced connectors [11, 121] to boost the visual effectiveness of MLLMs. Additionally, some works introduce monolithic multimodal solutions [30, 87, 109, 120]. Recently, some work has focused on the general capabilities of MLLM, specifically their performance on new modalities without suffering catastrophic forgetting of the text-only question-answering skills initially mastered by LLM [38, 73, 89]. For example, DeepSeek-VL [85] suggests that supplementing additional text-only training data can mitigate this forgetting. Others [77, 89] try to incorporate interleaved visual-textual data into training to retain language knowledge. However, these methods are limited by training resources and data collection costs. We aim to preserve or even boost performance with text-related training data as little as possible. Some studies [65, 76, 105, 111, 132, 140] also consider expanding the scalability of LLM, such as using Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) with numerous parallel FFNs in the Transformer block alongside a sparse gating network for efficient selection. There are some methods to configure effective information and feedback examples to enhance in-context learning abilities [128, 129]. These methods, however, require a massive increase in training parameters or inference costs. In WINGS, the newly designed parallel learners of Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) are similar to MoE on attention block, but with at least three orders of magnitude less in resource consumption. Compared to some LoRA-related methods [46], WINGS focuses on parallel processing within the attention block rather than in certain in-block linear mappings [88, 118], particularly addressing the issue of capability forgetting in existing architectures.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
