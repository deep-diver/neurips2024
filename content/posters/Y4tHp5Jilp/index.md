### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current depth completion methods struggle with generalizing across various depth sensors and diverse scenes due to reliance on extensive labeled data.  This paper introduces a new problem definition, Universal Depth Completion (UniDC), highlighting the need for models robust to sensor and environment variations while using limited labeled data. Existing approaches often fail to generalize well to unseen sensor types and environments because they depend heavily on training with data from specific sensors and scenes.

The proposed UniDC framework tackles this by utilizing a foundation model for monocular depth estimation. This model provides a comprehensive understanding of 3D scene structures.  To adapt to various sensors, a pixel-wise affinity map is generated using this foundation model, enabling the adjustment of depth information from arbitrary sensors. Finally, to improve both adaptability and generality, the method embeds learned features into hyperbolic space, building implicit hierarchical structures of 3D data. Experiments show superior generalization capabilities compared to state-of-the-art depth completion methods.

> This figure compares three different approaches to depth completion: (a) Conventional SPNs which use an encoder-decoder to produce dense depth maps from sparse depth input and RGB image, (b) DepthPrompting (CVPR24), which leverages a pre-trained foundation model to generate a relative-scale initial depth map and then use Euclidean affinity and a refinement process to obtain the final dense depth map. (c) The proposed method, which utilizes a foundation model to extract depth-aware features and then performs a hyperbolic sparse-to-dense conversion to generate the initial depth, before using a hyperbolic refinement process to obtain the final depth map.  The key difference is the use of hyperbolic geometry in the proposed method to capture the hierarchical structure of 3D data, leading to improved adaptability and generalization.

### In-depth insights


#### UniDC Problem Defined
The UniDC (Universal Depth Completion) problem, as defined in the research paper, centers on the challenge of achieving consistent and accurate depth estimation across diverse scenes and sensor types.  This is a significant departure from existing methods that often rely on extensive, pixel-wise labeled data and struggle with sensor-specific biases. **UniDC highlights the need for a generalizable approach** that can handle a wide variety of scenarios and sensors with minimal labeled data. The core challenge lies in creating **generalizable knowledge** about 3D scene structure that is applicable across different sensor modalities and scene configurations.  This demands a **robust adaptation mechanism** capable of handling varied sensor specifications and quickly adjusting to new unseen environments.  The paper acknowledges the high annotation costs associated with traditional depth estimation approaches which further motivates the pursuit of a solution that leverages minimal labeled data and exploits transferable knowledge from foundational models to achieve superior generalization.

#### Foundation Model Use
The effective utilization of foundation models is a crucial aspect of the research.  The authors highlight the **advantages of leveraging pre-trained knowledge from a monocular depth estimation model**, arguing that it provides a comprehensive understanding of 3D structures, reducing the need for extensive training on new data. This approach not only improves efficiency and reduces the cost of data acquisition but also enhances the generalization capabilities of the model to unseen sensor configurations and environments.   However, a direct integration of a foundation model is not without challenges.  The paper acknowledges the potential issues related to scale variance across different depth sensors and the difficulties in achieving generalizability with minimal labeled data. **Addressing these challenges forms a key contribution of the study.**  The use of hyperbolic embedding emerges as a compelling solution, improving model adaptability and robustness by capturing the implicit hierarchical structure of 3D data. This innovative strategy enables the model to handle a wider variety of sensors and scenarios more effectively. Therefore, the thoughtful integration of a foundation model, coupled with advanced techniques like hyperbolic embedding, constitutes a critical advancement in the field of depth completion.

#### Hyperbolic Geometry
The application of hyperbolic geometry in this research is intriguing.  **Hyperbolic space's inherent hierarchical structure** is leveraged to improve the representation of 3D data, particularly in handling the complexities of depth estimation from sparse sensor inputs. This approach offers a compelling alternative to traditional Euclidean methods, **mitigating challenges associated with bleeding errors and scale variance across different depth sensors**.  By embedding features into hyperbolic space, the model implicitly captures hierarchical relationships within the data, **enhancing adaptability and generalization capabilities**. The use of multi-curvature hyperbolic spaces further augments the model's flexibility, allowing for dynamic adaptation to diverse scenes and sensor configurations.  The results suggest that **hyperbolic geometry provides a significant improvement** in the accuracy and robustness of depth completion, particularly in low-data scenarios. This is a promising area of research with potential implications for various computer vision tasks.

#### Multi-sensor Adaptability
Multi-sensor adaptability in depth completion focuses on **developing methods that generalize well across diverse sensor modalities**.  This is crucial because real-world deployments often involve various sensors with differing characteristics (e.g., LiDAR, RGB-D cameras), each producing depth data with unique properties such as resolution, density, and noise levels.  A truly adaptable system should handle these differences without requiring extensive retraining for each sensor type.  This necessitates techniques that **disentangle sensor-specific information from the underlying scene structure**.  Approaches might involve using a foundation model pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset to establish a general understanding of 3D scenes and then using sensor-specific modules for fine-tuning or adaptation.  Another key element is the development of **sensor-agnostic representations**, capable of encoding depth information from any sensor type in a consistent manner.  Finally, success hinges on rigorous evaluation across a variety of datasets and sensors to demonstrate genuine generalization capabilities.  **Few-shot learning techniques** could be particularly effective here, allowing adaptation to new sensors with minimal labeled data.

#### Future Work: Radar
Extending depth completion methods to radar data presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities.  **Radar's inherent sparsity and noisiness**, unlike LiDAR or cameras, require novel approaches to data preprocessing and feature extraction.  Direct application of existing techniques may prove ineffective due to the different physical principles involved.  **Developing robust methods for handling missing data and uncertainty** in radar measurements is crucial.  A promising avenue is to explore the fusion of radar data with other sensor modalities (e.g., cameras or LiDAR) to leverage complementary information for improved accuracy and density.  **This multimodal approach requires careful consideration of sensor registration and data fusion strategies**, such as employing deep learning architectures specifically designed for sensor fusion.  Furthermore, **investigating the unique characteristics of radar signals (e.g., different frequencies, polarizations)** can unlock specific advantages for depth estimation.  Finally, evaluating and comparing these methods on diverse real-world datasets will be essential for proving the reliability and robustness of radar-based depth completion.
