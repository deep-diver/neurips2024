Our approach uses hyperbolic-based depth completion in three stages: generating an initial depth, constructing a pixel-wise affinity, and refining the depth based on the affinity.", "description": "This figure compares three different approaches to depth completion: (a) Conventional SPNs which use an encoder-decoder to produce dense depth maps from sparse depth input and RGB image, (b) DepthPrompting (CVPR24), which leverages a pre-trained foundation model to generate a relative-scale initial depth map and then use Euclidean affinity and a refinement process to obtain the final dense depth map. (c) The proposed method, which utilizes a foundation model to extract depth-aware features and then performs a hyperbolic sparse-to-dense conversion to generate the initial depth, before using a hyperbolic refinement process to obtain the final depth map.  The key difference is the use of hyperbolic geometry in the proposed method to capture the hierarchical structure of 3D data, leading to improved adaptability and generalization.", "section": "3 Baseline Architecture"}, {"figure_path": "Y4tHp5Jilp/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Depth propagation results according to fixed and multi-curvature values.", "description": "This figure compares depth propagation results using a fixed curvature value (\u03ba = 0.1) versus a multi-curvature approach where the curvature is dynamically adjusted based on the scene. The results demonstrate that the multi-curvature approach yields a more accurate depth map with improved detail and fewer artifacts, especially in regions with complex geometry or varying depth.", "section": "3 Baseline Architecture"}]
