Figure 3 shows that the Tree-Ring approach significantly alters the generated image\u2019s semantics, sometimes even failing to fulflil the text prompt\u2019s intent. This occurs because it disrupts the essential Gaussian characteristics of the initial noise, hindering the generation process. In contrast, ROBIN excels at preserving the overall image content and semantic structure, providing a better lower bound for faithfulness by preserving the original semantics. Table 4 provides the quantitative results. ROBIN demonstrates significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, MSSSIM, and CLIP score, while a slight increase in FID is observed.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
