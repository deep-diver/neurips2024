However, they suffer from scalability issues when dealing with long sequences, often requiring the splitting of sequences into smaller segments, which reduces efficiency and introduces theoretical problems.  Prior work has attempted to address these limitations with varying degrees of success, but a truly effective and general solution has been lacking. This research highlights the shortcomings of existing segment-based approaches, paving the way for a novel solution.\nThe core contribution of this paper is the introduction of memoroids, a novel mathematical framework based on monoids.  The authors show how many existing efficient memory models can be formulated as memoroids.  This framework is leveraged to develop Tape-Based Batching (TBB), a new batching method that eliminates the need for segmenting long sequences. TBB significantly improves sample efficiency and return while simplifying the implementation of loss functions.  Experiments demonstrate the superiority of TBB over traditional segment-based approaches across various tasks and memory models.", "affiliation": "University of Macau", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "nA4Q983a1v/podcast.wav"}
