### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers are commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) to handle partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). However, they suffer from scalability issues when dealing with long sequences, often requiring the splitting of sequences into smaller segments, which reduces efficiency and introduces theoretical problems.  Prior work has attempted to address these limitations with varying degrees of success, but a truly effective and general solution has been lacking. This research highlights the shortcomings of existing segment-based approaches, paving the way for a novel solution.

The core contribution of this paper is the introduction of memoroids, a novel mathematical framework based on monoids.  The authors show how many existing efficient memory models can be formulated as memoroids.  This framework is leveraged to develop Tape-Based Batching (TBB), a new batching method that eliminates the need for segmenting long sequences. TBB significantly improves sample efficiency and return while simplifying the implementation of loss functions.  Experiments demonstrate the superiority of TBB over traditional segment-based approaches across various tasks and memory models.

> This figure illustrates the Segment-Based Batching (SBB) method commonly used in reinforcement learning.  A worker collects multiple episodes of data, each represented by a different color.  Because recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers have difficulty handling variable-length sequences, the episodes are split into fixed-length segments (length L).  Shorter episodes are padded with zeros to match the length L. This padding introduces inefficiencies (wasted computation, biased normalization), and theoretical problems (inability to backpropagate through the entire episode due to the padding).

The key finding is that TBB significantly improves sample efficiency compared to SBB.





### In-depth insights


#### Memoroid Framework
The core idea behind the "Memoroid Framework" is to **reframe existing efficient sequence models** (like Linear Transformers and Linear Recurrent Units) within a unifying mathematical structure.  This structure, the memoroid, is essentially an extension of the monoid concept from category theory.  **Memoroids leverage the associative property of monoid operations to allow for parallel computation**, significantly enhancing efficiency when processing long sequences. The key advantage is the elimination of the need for segment-based batching, a common but inefficient approach in recurrent reinforcement learning.  This approach introduces theoretical issues, reduces efficiency, and increases complexity. By using memoroids and a novel batching technique (Tape-Based Batching), the authors aim to **improve sample efficiency, increase return, and simplify implementation** in recurrent RL scenarios.  The framework offers a clean, mathematically grounded method for dealing with sequences of varying lengths, thereby overcoming limitations of traditional recurrent models in handling long, variable-length sequences.

#### TBB Batching
The proposed Tape-Based Batching (TBB) method offers a significant advancement in handling variable-length sequences in recurrent reinforcement learning.  **It elegantly removes the need for segment-based batching**, a common practice that introduces inefficiencies and theoretical issues like zero-padding and truncated backpropagation. TBB leverages the inherent efficiency of memoroids, a novel framework for representing memory models, to process multiple episodes concurrently. **By concatenating episodes into a single, continuous tape and using a resettable monoid transformation, TBB eliminates the need for segmentation, improving sample efficiency and simplifying loss function implementation.** This approach allows for parallelization across the entire sequence and avoids information leakage between episodes, which is a limitation of other methods.  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in sample efficiency and return, particularly in tasks with long-range temporal dependencies, making TBB a superior alternative to existing methods. **The key contribution lies in the combination of memoroids and a novel reset mechanism that enables seamless and efficient processing of variable-length sequences without the drawbacks of traditional approaches.**

#### SBB Shortcomings
The segment-based batching (SBB) approach, while prevalent in recurrent reinforcement learning, suffers from several critical shortcomings.  **Zero-padding**, used to standardize segment lengths, wastes computational resources and hinders normalization techniques like batch normalization.  This padding also **truncates backpropagation through time (BPTT)**, limiting the model's capacity to learn long-range dependencies crucial for many tasks.  The resulting **approximation of the true gradient with the truncated BPTT gradient** reduces the accuracy and effectiveness of training.  Finally, SBB adds significant **implementation complexity**, requiring careful management of segments and masks, thus reducing overall efficiency.  These limitations highlight the need for alternative batching strategies that can overcome the inherent limitations of SBB.

#### Recurrent Value
In recurrent reinforcement learning, the concept of "Recurrent Value" signifies the value estimations produced by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or similar models to estimate the expected cumulative reward.  **Unlike traditional value functions in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which consider only the current state, recurrent value functions leverage past observations and actions, represented by a hidden state, to produce more informed value estimates.** This is crucial for handling partial observability, where the true state is hidden and only noisy or ambiguous observations are available.  However, the efficiency and accuracy of recurrent value functions are significantly affected by the chosen memory model and the training method.  **The paper highlights the inefficiencies of segment-based batching, a standard technique in recurrent RL, which truncates long sequences of observations impacting backpropagation and limiting the ability to learn long-range dependencies.** It introduces the concept of 'memoroids', emphasizing the use of mathematical monoids to create computationally efficient memory models that overcome these limitations.  **Memoroids allow for efficient handling of variable-length sequences without the need for segmentation, thus potentially leading to improved sample efficiency and more accurate recurrent value estimates.** The significance of this work lies in its contribution to more robust and efficient learning in partially observable environments, improving the accuracy and scalability of recurrent value functions through a novel architectural and training methodology.

#### Future Work
The paper's lack of a dedicated 'Future Work' section is notable.  However, we can infer potential avenues for future research based on the paper's limitations and open questions.  **Extending the memoroid framework to encompass a wider range of memory models** is crucial, and investigating its applicability to more complex tasks beyond those in POPGym would enhance its significance.  **Addressing the efficiency trade-off observed between TBB's logarithmic scaling with batch size and SBB's logarithmic scaling with segment length** is paramount. Thoroughly exploring the impact of very long sequences on TBB's performance is also vital, as the current study's sequences were relatively short.  Finally, **deepening the understanding of the relationship between RML and VML** is essential to assess the effectiveness of TBB in fully capturing temporal dependencies for various tasks.  This will involve rigorous experimentation to determine whether efficient models can consistently achieve VML = RML, signifying that they learn only necessary temporal information.  In essence, future work should focus on broadening the applicability and improving the efficiency and understanding of the proposed memoroid and TBB methods.

Episode boundaries are marked in a separate index array (I).  The method randomly selects B episode segments to form a training batch, concatenating consecutive transitions from the selected episodes. This avoids zero-padding and allows for efficient handling of variable-length episodes.

> This figure compares the effects of Segment-Based Batching (SBB) and Tape-Based Batching (TBB) on learning in a recurrent Q-learning setting using the Repeat Previous task.  The y-axis shows the cumulative partial derivative of the Q-value with respect to past observations (Value Memory Length or VML), while the x-axis represents the age of the observation. The red dashed line indicates the Reward Memory Length (RML), which represents the length of the past observations necessary to predict the reward. The left panel shows the results for SBB and the right for TBB.  The figure demonstrates that with SBB, much of the Q-value is not learned due to truncated backpropagation through time, while with TBB, the VML extends beyond the RML, indicating the need for a more complete backpropagation approach.

> This figure compares the impact of Segment-Based Batching (SBB) and Tape-Based Batching (TBB) on the ability of recurrent models to learn long-term dependencies in a reinforcement learning task. It plots the cumulative partial derivative of the Q-value with respect to past observations, showing that SBB severely limits the model's ability to learn from observations beyond a certain range (L=10), while TBB allows the model to learn longer-term dependencies. This demonstrates that the truncated backpropagation through time inherent in SBB degrades the accuracy and effectiveness of recurrent value estimation.
