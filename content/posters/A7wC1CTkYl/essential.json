Repeated testing of numerous models across vast datasets leads to substantial computational costs, hindering the progress of research.  This paper addresses this critical issue by focusing on the high cost of evaluating a growing number of models against ever-expanding test samples. \nThe proposed solution, called Sort & Search, uses dynamic programming algorithms to strategically select test samples for evaluating new models.  This intelligent selection process significantly reduces computation time, achieving up to a 1000x reduction while maintaining accuracy. It also provides valuable insights into the limitations of current accuracy prediction metrics, suggesting a need to move towards sample-level evaluation for improved results and enhanced understanding.  The framework introduced is highly scalable, and further analysis of the method's errors reveals valuable implications for future research in model evaluation and benchmark design.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "A7wC1CTkYl/podcast.wav"}
