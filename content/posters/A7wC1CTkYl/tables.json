We list the constituent source datasets (deduplicated) and their statistics for constructing our lifelong benchmarks here. Our benchmarks encompass a wide-range of natural and synthetic domains, sources and distribution shifts, making for a comprehensive lifelong testbed.", "description": "This table presents a detailed breakdown of the datasets used to create the Lifelong-CIFAR10 and Lifelong-ImageNet benchmarks.  It lists each constituent dataset, the number of test samples, the number of domains represented, the number of unique sources, whether the data is synthetic or natural, if it has been corrupted, the license associated with the dataset and the benchmark it contributes to. This information helps to understand the composition and characteristics of the two benchmarks used in the paper.", "section": "Lifelong-ImageNet and Lifelong-CIFAR10: Details"}]
