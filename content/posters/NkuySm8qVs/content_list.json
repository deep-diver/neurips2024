The original No Free Lunch (NFL) theorems highlight the limitations of traditional black-box optimisation and learning algorithms, serving as a theoretical foundation for traditional optimisation. No Free Lunch Analysis in adversarial (also called maximin) optimisation is a long-standing problem [45, 46]. This paper first rigorously proves a (NFL) Theorem for general black-box adversarial optimisation when considering Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) as the solution concept. We emphasise the solution concept (i.e. define the optimality in adversarial optimisation) as the key in our NFL theorem. In particular, if Nash Equilibrium is considered as the solution concept and the cost of the algorithm is measured in terms of the number of columns and rows queried in the payoff matrix, then the average performance of all black-box adversarial optimisation algorithms is the same. Moreover, we first introduce black-box complexity to analyse the black-box adversarial optimisation algorithm. We employ Yao\u2019s Principle and our new NFL Theorem to provide general lower bounds for the query complexity of finding a Nash Equilibrium in adversarial optimisation. Finally, we illustrate the practical ramifications of our results on simple two-player zero-sum games. More specifically, no black-box optimisation algorithm for finding the unique Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games can exceed logarithmic complexity relative to search space size. Meanwhile, no black-box algorithm can solve any bimatrix game with unique NE with fewer than a linear number of queries in the size of the payoff matrix.

First, we highlight the challenges and our technical details in the derivation process compared to previous NFL work. The classical No Free Lunch theorem applies proof by induction with respect to the size of the function domain. A natural idea is to extend the previous proof-by-induction method in our NFL proof. However, one of the most challenging aspects of deriving NFL for Nash Equilibrium (NE) is that the adversarial setting significantly increases the difficulty since the problem depends on the performances of both the player and the opponents. To address this, we introduce two technical lemmas from game theory (i.e. Lemma 3 and Lemma 4) and help to construct the isomorphism between two different problem classes (i.e. Corollary 1 and Lemma 2), which is an essential step in the proof of the original NFL theorem for traditional optimisation (see Section B for more details). Another significant challenge is that we start with a very weak assumption: we only allow access to the payoff function and make no assumptions about its properties, such as convexity, continuity, or differentiability. In fact, no gradients, continuity, or differentiability make the NFL and black box results easier to prove (i.e., the function class lacks a specific structure). On the other hand, it makes it more difficult for the algorithm. Consequently, we have limited analytical tools to proceed. To analyse the black-box complexity of adversarial optimisation, we introduce Yao\u2019s minimax principle and apply our new NFL result. Please consult the proof of Theorem 4.2 for more details.
