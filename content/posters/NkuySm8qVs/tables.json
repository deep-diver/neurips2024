[{"figure_path": "NkuySm8qVs/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison between traditional black-box optimisation and maximin black-box optimisation. Instead of querying at x in traditional optimisation, maximin optimisation queries at (x, y) include both strategy x and the best response y from the opponent, i.e., maxx\u2208X miny\u2208Y g(x, y). Their interaction is converted to the payoff g(x, y) in the given black-box model.", "description": "This table visually compares traditional black-box optimization and maximin (or adversarial) black-box optimization.  It highlights the key difference: in traditional optimization, a single point x is queried to evaluate the objective function f(x). In contrast, maximin optimization queries a pair (x, y), where y represents the best response from an opponent to strategy x in a game-theoretic setting.  The payoff g(x,y) then reflects the outcome of this interaction. This illustrates the shift from single-objective optimization to a game-theoretic setting.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
