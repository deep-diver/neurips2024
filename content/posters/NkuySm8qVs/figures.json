Instead of querying at x in traditional optimisation, maximin optimisation queries at (x, y) include both strategy x and the best response y from the opponent, i.e. maxxex miny\u2208y g(x, y). Their interaction is converted to the payoff g(x, y) in the given black-box model.", "description": "This figure compares traditional black-box optimization and maximin black-box optimization.  The traditional approach involves querying a black box with an input 'x' to get an output 'f(x)'.  In contrast, maximin optimization queries the black box with both a strategy 'x' and an opponent's best response 'y', yielding an output 'g(x,y)'.  This illustrates the key difference: maximin considers the interaction between strategies.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
