Existing approaches, such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), aim to improve generalization but often come at a high computational cost.  This limits their practical applicability, especially in resource-constrained settings.\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FGSAM).  FGSAM leverages the strengths of both GNNs and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to find a balance between performance and efficiency. It reuses gradients from a perturbation step to incorporate graph topology information into the minimization process without adding significant computational cost, leading to substantial efficiency gains.  Further enhancements are made in FGSAM+, executing exact perturbations periodically to further optimize training.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "AF32GbuupC/podcast.wav"}
