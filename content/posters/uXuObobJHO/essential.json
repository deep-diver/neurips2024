A common approach involves writing the model in a probabilistic programming language and sampling via HMC; however, model transformations can significantly affect the efficiency of this process. Marginalizing random effects is one such transformation that often proves beneficial but is difficult to implement.\nThis paper introduces a new algorithm that efficiently marginalizes random effects in LMMs. The key is to use a vectorized approach and fast linear algebra techniques to avoid expensive computations.  The researchers demonstrate improvements in both speed and efficiency across a variety of models, particularly those with many variables and group-level effects, highlighting the broad applicability of this method.  The findings suggest that marginalizing group-level effects should be a standard practice for Bayesian hierarchical modeling.
