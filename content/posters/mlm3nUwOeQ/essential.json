This often leads to algorithms performing poorly on real problems. The paper focuses on solving the challenging  **bandit non-stochastic control problem**, which involves adversarial perturbations, non-quadratic cost functions and bandit feedback mechanisms (i.e. limited information about the system's response to actions).  Existing solutions often suffer from suboptimal regret bounds. \nThis paper introduces a novel algorithm that significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art. By cleverly **reducing the problem to a no-memory bandit convex optimization (BCO)** and employing a novel Newton-based update, the authors achieve an optimal \u00d5(\u221aT) regret bound for strongly convex and smooth cost functions. This algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of high-dimensional gradient estimation and the complexity introduced by memory.  The **result is a significant contribution** to the field, providing a more practical and efficient approach to solving general control problems.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "mlm3nUwOeQ/podcast.wav"}
