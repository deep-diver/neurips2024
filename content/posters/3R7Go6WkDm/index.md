### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning models use post-hoc transformations like ensembling or SWA to boost performance.  However, these are usually applied after initial model selection, ignoring potential performance shifts.  This paper identifies an issue: these transformations can sometimes reverse the performance trends of the base models, particularly in noisy datasets.  This challenges the standard model selection practice. 

To address this, the authors propose 'post-hoc selection'. Instead of selecting models based on initial performance, they select based on the performance after post-hoc transforms are applied. This method showed improvement across various datasets and model types. The core idea is that post-hoc transforms might suppress the influence of noisy data, allowing better models to be selected based on more robust metrics.

> This figure illustrates the concept of post-hoc reversal using the FMoW dataset.  It shows that while the base model's performance is worse at a later epoch (t2), the performance after applying post-hoc transforms (SWA, ensembling, and temperature scaling) is better at the later epoch. This highlights the limitations of naive selection (choosing models based on initial performance) and advocates for post-hoc selection (choosing models based on performance after transforms).  The figure compares the performance curves before and after applying the post-hoc transforms.





![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/3R7Go6WkDm/tables_7_1.jpg)

> This table compares the performance of naive model selection versus post-hoc model selection using two different post-hoc transformations (SWA+TS and SWA+Ens+TS).  Naive selection chooses the best performing model based on its initial performance without any post-hoc transformations.  Post-hoc selection instead selects the model based on its performance after applying the chosen post-hoc transformations.  Better values (lower test loss and test error) are bolded. The table demonstrates that post-hoc selection consistently outperforms naive selection, often leading to more than double the improvement over not using any transformations.  Standard deviations for the results are available in Appendix E.





### In-depth insights


#### Post-hoc Reversal
The concept of "Post-hoc Reversal" introduces a phenomenon where performance trends observed in base machine learning models are inverted after applying post-hoc transforms like temperature scaling, ensembling, or stochastic weight averaging. This reversal is particularly pronounced in high-noise scenarios, challenging the conventional practice of selecting models based solely on pre-transform metrics.  **Post-hoc reversal highlights the limitations of naive model selection** and suggests that post-hoc metrics should significantly influence model development decisions, including hyperparameter choices and early stopping.  This phenomenon offers a potential method to mitigate issues like catastrophic overfitting and loss-error mismatches commonly associated with noisy datasets.  **The core intuition behind post-hoc reversal is the differential learning dynamics between clean and mislabeled examples**. Post-hoc transforms are effective in suppressing the influence of mislabeled examples while retaining generalizable patterns from clean data, leading to a performance reversal. Therefore, **post-hoc selection, a strategy where post-hoc metrics are used to guide model selection, presents a more robust and effective methodology** compared to the traditional approach.  This technique has demonstrated considerable performance improvement across various domains and model architectures, demonstrating its widespread applicability.

#### Epoch-wise trends
Analyzing epoch-wise trends in the context of post-hoc transforms reveals crucial insights into model training dynamics.  **Early epochs often show poor performance due to noise or overfitting**, but post-hoc methods like stochastic weight averaging (SWA) and ensembling can reverse this trend, improving performance in later epochs.  This phenomenon, termed post-hoc reversal, highlights the limitations of selecting models based solely on early performance metrics.  **Post-hoc reversal is particularly pronounced in high-noise settings,** where early overfitting is significant. This observation suggests that post-hoc transforms may be more effective at filtering out noisy data, allowing the model to learn generalizable patterns from clean examples. Therefore, **evaluating models based on post-hoc performance metrics (rather than early-epoch metrics) is crucial**. This approach, termed post-hoc selection, can lead to more robust models with improved generalization abilities.  Investigating the learning dynamics and the influence of mislabeled samples across different epochs provides a comprehensive understanding of model behavior, shaping better model development strategies.

#### Post-hoc Selection
The proposed "Post-hoc Selection" method offers a compelling alternative to traditional model selection in machine learning. **Instead of selecting models based solely on their initial performance metrics**, post-hoc selection leverages the performance improvements achieved after applying post-hoc transforms like temperature scaling, ensembling, and stochastic weight averaging.  This approach directly addresses the phenomenon of "post-hoc reversal," where initial performance trends are reversed after these transformations, particularly noticeable in high-noise settings. By prioritizing post-transform performance, post-hoc selection can lead to **significant performance gains**, even surpassing models that initially appeared superior. This innovative approach improves model development by better accounting for how post-hoc transforms alter the characteristics of the trained models. Its simplicity‚Äîintegrating directly into the validation phase‚Äîand demonstrated effectiveness on various datasets make it a **practical and impactful contribution** to the field.

#### Noisy Data Impact
The impact of noisy data is a central theme, explored through the lens of post-hoc transforms like temperature scaling, ensembling, and stochastic weight averaging. The paper reveals a phenomenon called **post-hoc reversal**, where performance trends are reversed after applying these transforms, particularly in high-noise scenarios.  This implies that selecting models solely based on pre-transform performance (naive selection) can be suboptimal.  **Noise affects model generalizability**; it can exacerbate overfitting, double descent, and mismatches between loss and error.  However, the paper's key insight is that **post-hoc transforms can mitigate the negative effects of noise**, by selectively suppressing the influence of mislabeled examples while retaining the generalizable patterns learned from clean data.  This leads to a recommendation for **post-hoc selection**, which chooses models based on their post-transform performance, ultimately improving model accuracy and robustness.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize developing a **deeper theoretical understanding** of post-hoc reversal, moving beyond empirical observations to explain its underlying mechanisms.  This includes exploring the relationship between post-hoc reversal and model complexity, as well as investigating how different types of noise influence the phenomenon.  **Developing more sophisticated checkpoint selection strategies** is crucial, potentially incorporating ensemble methods or Bayesian approaches to overcome limitations of naive selection.  **Extending the research to additional domains and modalities** will demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of post-hoc reversal.   A crucial area of investigation is determining how best to integrate post-hoc transforms into model development workflows, perhaps through automated early stopping methods. Finally, a key future direction involves developing techniques for **robustly handling high-noise settings**, such as those found in real-world datasets, to maximize the practical benefits of post-hoc selection.

It illustrates the phenomenon of post-hoc reversal, where performance trends differ between models before and after applying post-hoc transformations (temperature scaling, ensembling, and stochastic weight averaging). The pre-TS (before temperature scaling) loss is consistently higher than the post-TS loss for all learning rate schedules.

> This figure visualizes the decision boundaries learned by two individual models and their ensemble on a synthetic 2D spiral dataset at epochs 440 and 1000. The goal is to illustrate the phenomenon of post-hoc reversal. At epoch 440, the individual models show complex and spiky decision boundaries, especially around noisy data points. The ensemble, however, displays a smoother decision boundary. At epoch 1000, while the individual models' decision boundaries become even more erratic, the ensemble's boundary remains relatively consistent.  This demonstrates how post-hoc transforms like ensembling can mitigate the impact of noisy data by suppressing the influence of mislabeled examples, which leads to the reversal of performance trends observed between the base models and the ensemble.
