### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many learning rate tuners aim for immediate loss reduction but struggle in the long run.  This paper investigates why, focusing on the interplay between learning rates and the 'sharpness' of the loss landscape (related to curvature).  It finds that these tuners often destabilize the training process, leading to worse results than a simple constant learning rate. 

The researchers introduce a new method, called Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT), which changes the learning rate to maintain a balance in the sharpness dynamics.  CDAT significantly improves long-term performance, demonstrating behavior similar to carefully designed warm-up schedules. The findings highlight the importance of considering the joint dynamics of learning rates and curvature for better adaptive learning rate tuners. The effects of stochasticity are also discussed, explaining why some methods are better at specific batch sizes.

> This figure compares the performance of simple learning rate tuners (linesearch and quadratically greedy) against constant learning rate methods (Gradient Descent and RMSProp) across various datasets and network architectures.  The results show that while the tuners may initially achieve better one-step loss reduction, they ultimately underperform constant learning rates in the long term, particularly in the full batch setting.  The linesearch method sometimes shows an initial advantage but fails to maintain progress over time.







### In-depth insights


#### LR Tuner Failure
The paper investigates the failure modes of classical learning rate tuners (LRTs) in deep learning.  A key finding is that **while LRTs might show initially better one-step loss reduction compared to constant learning rates, they ultimately underperform in the long run**. This underperformance is attributed to a disruption of the natural stabilization of loss curvature during training.  Classical LRTs often **undershoot the edge of stability (EOS)**, leading to a snowball effect where sharpness increases and learning rates decrease, resulting in slow training progress.  **The closed-loop interaction between LRTs and curvature dynamics is critical.**  The authors introduce Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT) which aims to stabilize curvature near the EOS, effectively emulating a warm-up schedule.  CDAT demonstrates superior long-term performance in the full-batch setting, suggesting that **curvature stabilization is more important than short-term greedy loss minimization for effective deep learning**.  Stochasticity in the mini-batch setting introduces additional challenges, as demonstrated by empirical observations, which warrants further study to improve the design of adaptive LRTs.

#### Curvature Dynamics
The concept of 'Curvature Dynamics' in the context of deep learning refers to the **evolution of the loss function's curvature** during the training process.  It's not static; instead, it changes significantly, often transitioning from a phase of increasing sharpness (largest eigenvalue of the Hessian) to a state of relative stabilization.  This dynamic interplay between curvature and learning rate is crucial.  **Classical learning rate tuners**, aiming for immediate loss reduction, often disrupt this stabilization, leading to long-term underperformance compared to constant learning rates.  **Understanding these dynamics** is key to designing effective adaptive learning rate tuners, moving beyond a purely greedy minimization approach and towards strategies that prioritize long-term curvature stabilization.  The **edge of stability (EOS)**, a critical point where sharpness stabilizes, is a key element of this analysis.  The paper suggests that **maintaining proximity to the EOS** is beneficial for training stability,  a concept further explored by introducing the Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT) method.

#### CDAT Method
The CDAT (Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning) method is a novel learning rate tuner that prioritizes **long-term curvature stabilization** over immediate loss reduction. Unlike traditional tuners that focus on short-term greedy minimization, CDAT dynamically adjusts the learning rate to maintain the optimizer near the edge of stability (EOS).  This approach is crucial because classical methods often undershoot the EOS, leading to a snowball effect of decreasing learning rates and increasing sharpness. By focusing on stability, CDAT empirically outperforms tuned constant learning rates in the full-batch setting, exhibiting behavior similar to prefixed warm-up schedules.  However, the effectiveness of CDAT in the mini-batch setting is less consistent due to the increased stochasticity, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between learning rate and curvature dynamics for effective adaptive learning rate tuning.

#### Stochastic Effects
Stochasticity, inherent in mini-batch training, significantly impacts the dynamics observed in full-batch settings.  **The success of classical learning rate tuners in mini-batch regimes is not solely attributable to their inherent design but also influenced by the reduced and attenuated sharpness dynamics** present in stochastic optimization.  The analysis suggests that the stochastic nature of mini-batch gradient descent introduces confounding effects, masking the true behavior of learning rate tuners and the sharpness. Consequently, **simply translating full-batch observations to mini-batch training can be misleading**.  Furthermore, the optimal scaling factor for techniques like Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT) is heavily dependent on batch size, further highlighting the need to consider stochastic effects when designing and analyzing learning rate tuners.   Understanding and modeling these effects is critical for developing robust and effective adaptive learning rate methods applicable across various batch sizes.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several key areas.  **Extending the theoretical model** to more accurately capture the complexities of stochastic optimization and higher-order effects is crucial. This might involve incorporating techniques from control theory to design learning rate tuners that ensure greater stability and efficiency, particularly in mini-batch settings.  **Investigating alternative metrics for sharpness** beyond the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, such as the trace of the Hessian, might reveal more robust ways to gauge curvature dynamics.  Further work could focus on developing methods to estimate these metrics efficiently and reliably, especially in stochastic regimes.  **A detailed empirical investigation** into how different optimizers interact with CDAT and how CDAT‚Äôs performance changes in relation to architectural choices is needed. It would be beneficial to explore the application of CDAT to more complex architectures and larger-scale models. Finally, it's important to **develop more comprehensive models** that capture the joint dynamics of the learning rate and curvature in stochastic settings, to better understand the success of various learning rate tuners at different batch sizes.

> This figure shows that classical learning rate tuners (linesearch and quadratically greedy) do not perform as well as a constant learning rate in the long run.  The learning rate decreases significantly, while the sharpness (largest eigenvalue of the Hessian) increases. Their product remains relatively constant, but below the edge of stability. This contrasts with a constant learning rate where both sharpness and learning rate stabilize. The gradient norm also indicates slower training for the learning rate tuners.

The results demonstrate that tuning the learning rate to be near the 'edge of stability' (œÉ‚âà2) yields significantly better results than using a constant learning rate or a greedy approach (œÉ=1.0) across various architectures and datasets. This supports the paper's claim that focusing on curvature stabilization is key for successful adaptive learning rate tuning.

The results for œÉ = 2 demonstrate that CDAT stabilizes y near the EOS (y=0), leading to a stable Œªmax. However, when œÉ is slightly less than 2, the model predicts that Œªmax will slowly increase while y stabilizes to a small negative value, indicating a less stable regime.
