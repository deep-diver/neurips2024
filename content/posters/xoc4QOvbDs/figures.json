SCE framework can be applied to most mainstream DMVC methods. After obtaining the cluster distribution from the selected method, SCE iteratively using the following two modules: View Contribution Evaluation Module and View Cooperation Enhancing Module. View Contribution Evaluation Module computes the marginal contribution of views in each combination(Shapley value), in which the optimal transport distance between the view cluster distribution and the strengthened cluster distribution after fusion serves as the utility function of Shapley formula. View Cooperation Enhancing Module controls the convergence speed ratio of different views through the calculated view contribution.", "description": "This figure illustrates the proposed Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing Multi-view Clustering (SCE-MVC) framework. It shows how SCE-MVC integrates with existing DMVC methods, using two key modules: a View Contribution Evaluation Module and a View Cooperation Enhancing Module. The former computes Shapley values to quantify the contribution of each view, using optimal transport distance as a utility function.  The latter dynamically adjusts the convergence rate of each view based on its Shapley value, promoting balanced cooperation and improved clustering performance. The figure uses both diagrammatic and graphical representations to depict data distributions before and after SCE-MVC processing and illustrates the impact on view contributions.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "xoc4QOvbDs/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performance evaluation of view cooperation contribution and fusion ACC on (a) Caltech101-7 (b) UCI-digit.
