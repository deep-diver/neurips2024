Notations include sets (e.g., vertices, edges), matrices (e.g., incidence, Laplacian), vectors (e.g., preference, error), and other mathematical symbols. The table aids in understanding the mathematical expressions and algorithms presented throughout the paper.", "section": "5.1 Notation and technical assumptions"}]
