IDA outperforms the pilot and copilot.", "description": "This figure presents the results of experiments conducted in the Reacher environment, a 2D simulation of a robotic arm. It shows a comparison of three different control methods: pilot-only, copilot, and IDA (Interventional Diffusion Assistance).  Panel (a) illustrates the Reacher environment itself. Panels (b) and (c) display the performance of the three methods with a varying number of possible goal locations for both laggy and noisy pilots.  The results show that IDA consistently outperforms the other methods, particularly in scenarios with noisy or laggy pilots, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in improving performance.", "section": "4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "nJvkQSu9Z5/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Analysis of copilot advantages during intervened states.
