To improve the performance of SSMs in vision tasks, a multi-scan strategy is widely adopted, which leads to significant redundancy of SSMs. For a better trade-off between efficiency and performance, we analyze the underlying reasons behind the success of the multi-scan strategy, where long-range dependency plays an important role. Based on the analysis, we introduce Multi-Scale Vision Mamba (MSVMamba) to preserve the superiority of SSMs in vision tasks with limited parameters. It employs a multi-scale 2D scanning technique on both original and downsampled feature maps, which not only benefits long-range dependency learning but also reduces computational costs.

Traditionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [25, 40, 18, 21, 33] have been the backbone of feature extraction methodologies, prized for their linear scaling complexity and proficiency in capturing local patterns. However, CNNs often fall short in encapsulating global context, a limitation that becomes increasingly apparent in tasks requiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire visual field. In contrast, Vision Transformers (ViTs) [6, 32, 50, 43] have emerged as a compelling alternative, boasting an inherent global receptive field that allows for the direct capture of long-range dependencies within an image. Despite their advantages, ViTs are hampered by their quadratic scaling complexity concerning the input size, which significantly constrains their applicability to downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation, where efficiency is paramount. Recently, State Space Model (SSM)-based approaches [11, 41, 8] have garnered attention for their ability to combine the best of both worlds: a global receptive field and linear scaling complexity. Notably, Mamba [9] introduces a hardware-aware and input-dependent algorithm that significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of SSMs. Inspired by Mamba\u2019s success, a burgeoning body of work has sought to leverage its advantages for vision tasks, pioneering efforts such as ViM [60] and VMamba [30].

To accommodate the non-causal nature of image data, the multi-scan strategy is widely adopted for vision tasks, such as ViM [60] which enhances the sequence by summing it in both forward and reverse directions, and VMamba [30] which integrates horizontal and vertical scans. However, unlike NLP models, which can have up to billions of parameters, current vision backbones always take computational costs into consideration, i.e., the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. This constraint on model size inherently limits the long-range modeling capabilities of SSMs in vision tasks. Taking ViM-Tiny [60] as an example, placing the cls token in the middle of the sequence yields markedly better results than positioning it at the ends. This suggests that central placement compensates for the model\u2019s limited ability to integrate distant information, highlighting the difficulties of handling long-range dependencies in parameter-constrained vision models. We refer to this as the long-range forgetting problem. In this work, we analyze how the multi-scan strategy in [60, 30] helps to alleviate this problem. Compared to the single-scan strategy, the multi-scan one allows long-range decay to manifest in various directions within 2D images. However, the increased scanning routes bring multiples of computations, significantly increasing redundancy and limiting efficiency.

Through the visualization of different scans, we show that the decay rates could vary for different scanning routes, which motivates us to develop a hierarchical design of multi-scan. In this work, we propose a Multi-Scale 2D (MS2D) scanning strategy to alleviate the long-range forgetting problem with limited computational costs. Specifically, we divide the scanning directions of SS2D [30] into two groups: one retains the original resolution and is processed by the S6 block, while the others are downsampled, processed by the S6 block, and then upsampled, which not only shortens the sequence length for long-range dependencies learning but also alleviates redundancy. Building on the VMamba with its hierarchical architecture, we incorporate another hierarchical design within the block, creating a hierarchy within a hierarchy.

These designs have significantly improved performance on a wide range of vision tasks by enhancing the network\u2019s ability to capture complex patterns and features from visual data. The Vision Transformer [6], drawing inspiration from the success of transformers [47] in natural language processing, has emerged as a formidable contender to conventional CNNs for vision-related tasks. ViT reimagines image processing by segmenting an image into patches and employing self-attention mechanisms to process these segments. This innovative approach enables the model to discern global dependencies across the entire image, a significant leap forward in understanding complex visual data. However, the ViT architecture demands considerable computational resources and extensive datasets for effective training. Moreover, its performance is intricately tied to the input sequence length, exhibiting a quadratic complexity that can escalate processing costs. In response, subsequent research has focused on developing more efficient training strategies [43, 45, 24], hierarchical network structures [32, 31, 5, 50, 51, 15], refined spatial attention mechanisms [57, 59, 52, 46, 16, 5] and convolution-based design [2, 29, 14, 36] to address these issues.

Mamba [9] then introduced the S6 block, incorporating data-dependent parameters to amend the Linear Time Invariant(LTI) characteristics of previous SSM models, demonstrating superior performance over transformers on large-scale datasets. In the realm of vision tasks, S4ND [35] pioneered the application of SSM models in vision tasks by treating visual data as 1D, 2D, and 3D signals.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
