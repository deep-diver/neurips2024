State Space Models (SSMs) offer linear complexity but struggle with long-range dependencies, often requiring redundant multi-scan strategies.  This necessitates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.  Current approaches, like multi-scan ViTs, alleviate this but at the cost of increased redundancy and computation.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces MSVMamba. This model uses a multi-scale 2D scanning technique across original and downsampled feature maps.  **This approach effectively learns long-range dependencies while reducing computational costs.**  Furthermore, MSVMamba integrates a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) to enhance channel mixing.  The results demonstrate MSVMamba's competitiveness, achieving high accuracy across ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K benchmarks, showing its practical value and superior efficiency compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "r70jUOpDCM/podcast.wav"}
