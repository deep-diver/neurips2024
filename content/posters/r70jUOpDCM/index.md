### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in capturing global context but suffer from quadratic complexity. State Space Models (SSMs) offer linear complexity but struggle with long-range dependencies, often requiring redundant multi-scan strategies.  This necessitates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.  Current approaches, like multi-scan ViTs, alleviate this but at the cost of increased redundancy and computation.



To address this, the paper introduces MSVMamba. This model uses a multi-scale 2D scanning technique across original and downsampled feature maps.  **This approach effectively learns long-range dependencies while reducing computational costs.**  Furthermore, MSVMamba integrates a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) to enhance channel mixing.  The results demonstrate MSVMamba's competitiveness, achieving high accuracy across ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K benchmarks, showing its practical value and superior efficiency compared to existing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-Scale SSMs
Multi-scale state space models (SSMs) represent a powerful paradigm shift in processing sequential data, offering a compelling alternative to traditional recurrent neural networks and transformers.  The core idea revolves around representing the data as a sequence of states evolving over time, governed by a linear dynamical system.  **The multi-scale aspect introduces significant advantages**, allowing the SSM to capture both fine-grained details (at smaller scales) and broader contextual information (at larger scales). This is achieved through techniques such as applying the SSM to feature maps at multiple resolutions or through hierarchical state space structures. This approach addresses the limitations of single-scale SSMs, enhancing their performance in complex tasks involving long-range dependencies and diverse levels of detail, such as those found in computer vision and natural language processing.  **A key benefit is the ability to leverage long-range dependencies efficiently**,  a significant challenge for many sequential models. By incorporating information from multiple scales, the SSM avoids the limitations of local receptive fields found in some approaches. Further, multi-scale SSMs offer a pathway to **improving computational efficiency** by operating on lower resolution data for coarser scale processing while maintaining detailed information at finer scales. This is crucial for deploying complex models on resource-constrained devices.  **The development of effective multi-scale SSM architectures requires careful consideration of data representation, scanning strategies, and the interplay between different scales**. However, the potential of this approach remains vast.

#### MS2D Scanning
The proposed Multi-Scale 2D (MS2D) scanning strategy offers a **significant improvement** over existing multi-scan approaches by addressing the computational redundancy and long-range dependency limitations of State Space Models (SSMs) in vision tasks.  Instead of applying multiple scans to the full-resolution feature map, which is computationally expensive, MS2D cleverly divides the scanning directions into two groups. One group processes the original resolution map, focusing on fine-grained features. The other processes a downsampled map, reducing the computational cost while still capturing long-range dependencies. This hierarchical approach provides a **superior balance** between accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by the experimental results.  The **key insight** of MS2D lies in its ability to maintain high accuracy with drastically reduced computational load. This is achieved by strategically combining high-resolution scans that preserve crucial details with lower-resolution scans for capturing the broad context.  This allows MS2D to **effectively resolve** the long-range forgetting problem inherent in SSMs while avoiding the inefficiencies of redundant computation found in existing multi-scan methods.

#### ConvFFN Impact
The integration of the Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) within the Multi-Scale Vision Mamba (MSVMamba) architecture demonstrates a notable impact on performance.  **ConvFFN acts as a channel mixer**, effectively addressing the inherent limitation of State Space Models (SSMs) in vision tasks, which often struggle with channel mixing. By incorporating ConvFFN, MSVMamba significantly improves its ability to exchange information across channels. This leads to a **substantial enhancement in feature representation and a boost in overall model accuracy**.  The experimental results highlight that the ConvFFN contributes significantly to performance gains across various datasets and tasks. Although the specific improvement varies with the model size and the task, the consistent positive impact across all test settings strongly suggests the importance of ConvFFN as a key component of the MSVMamba architecture. Therefore, incorporating ConvFFN is vital to the model's success and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving the performance of SSMs in computer vision applications.

#### Efficiency Gains
Analyzing efficiency gains in the context of a research paper requires a multifaceted approach.  **Computational complexity** is a primary concern; algorithms with lower complexity (e.g., linear vs. quadratic) directly translate to faster processing.  **Parameter reduction** is another key aspect; smaller models require less memory and computation, leading to quicker training and inference.  **Hardware acceleration** plays a crucial role; designs optimized for specific hardware architectures (like GPUs) significantly boost performance.  **Algorithmic optimizations**, such as improved scanning strategies or novel network architectures, can lead to substantial speedups without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, a thorough evaluation needs to consider **real-world scenarios**, benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate tangible performance advantages.

#### Future of SSMs
The future of State Space Models (SSMs) in computer vision is exceptionally promising.  **Their linear complexity** offers a significant advantage over Vision Transformers (ViTs) for handling high-resolution images and long sequences, crucial for real-world applications.  Further research should focus on **addressing the limitations of long-range dependency modeling**, potentially through more sophisticated scanning strategies or architectural improvements.  **Combining SSMs' strengths with the localized feature extraction capabilities of CNNs** is another key area for exploration.  Ultimately, the effectiveness of SSMs will hinge on their ability to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy and generalizability, especially for large-scale datasets and complex tasks.  **Hardware-aware designs** will also be crucial for widespread adoption, enabling faster training and inference.

> This figure visualizes the decay rate of influence along horizontal and vertical scanning routes in the VMamba model. The decay rate represents how quickly the influence of a token diminishes as the distance from the central token increases. The horizontal and vertical scan plots show this decay along each scan direction. The decay ratio plot shows the ratio between the decay rates of the horizontal and vertical scans, and the binary decay ratio plot displays a binarized version of this ratio. These plots illustrate the long-range forgetting problem faced by the VMamba model and motivate the use of the multi-scan strategy to alleviate this issue.

> This figure illustrates the multi-scale 2D selective scan.  The input image is processed via two depthwise convolutions (DW Conv) with different kernel sizes (K) and strides (S). The first DW Conv (K=3, S=1) maintains the original resolution, while the second (K=7, S=2) downsamples the input. Each resulting feature map is then processed by an S6 block. The outputs of these S6 blocks are subsequently interpolated to enhance the feature representation.

> The MS3 block is a core component of the proposed MSVMamba model. It integrates a Multi-Scale Vision Space State (MSVSS) block and a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) block to enhance feature extraction and information flow. The MSVSS block utilizes a multi-scale 2D scanning technique to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained features from multi-scale feature maps.  The ConvFFN block then facilitates information exchange across different channels, improving the model's capacity to capture richer feature representations.  This hierarchical design improves accuracy and efficiency compared to previous approaches like VMamba.
