First, to reduce interference information from the other domain, DoFIT finely aggregates overlapping weights across domains on the inter-domain server side. Second, to retain more domain information, DoFIT initializes intra-domain weights by incorporating inter-domain information into a less-conflicted parameter space.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
