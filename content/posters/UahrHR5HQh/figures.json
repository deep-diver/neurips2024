Given an interpolant  xt = tx1 + (1 \u2212 t)x0, CatFlow predicts a categorical distribution qf (x1 | xt) parameterized by a vector \u03bct(xt). The resulting construction for the vector field vf (xt) = (\u03bct(xt) \u2212 xt)/(1 \u2212 t) ensures that trajectories converge to a point on the simplex at t = 1.", "description": "This figure illustrates how CatFlow parameterizes the vector field.  Starting from an interpolant point xt between x0 and x1, CatFlow predicts a categorical distribution over possible end points x1. This distribution is parameterized by a vector \u03bct(xt), representing the expected value of x1 given xt. The vector field vf(xt) is then constructed to ensure the trajectory converges to a point on the probability simplex at time t=1. This approach ensures that generated samples remain within the valid probability space.

The performance is measured by the \"score\", which represents the percentage of generated molecules that are both valid and unique.  The study varies the number of layers in the model and the percentage of the training data used.  The results demonstrate CatFlow's superior performance and robustness compared to standard flow matching, especially when fewer layers or less data are available.", "section": "6.3 CatFlow Ablations"}]
