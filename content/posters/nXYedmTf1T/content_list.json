Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches are resource-intensive and may not effectively reflect the target LVLM\u2019s preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to selfimprove by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR significantly enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by $7.62\\%$ . Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm.

For instance, the description generated by LVLMs may include visual elements that are not depicted in the image. This issue can also occur when the LLM is highly factual and the visual backbone is capable of producing sufficiently high-quality representations. As indicated in Cui et al. [6], Guan et al.

Recently, the rapid development of visual-language alignment methods [19, 44\u201349] and LLMs [50\u201354] has significantly accelerated the progress of LVLMs, which extend LLMs with visual modalities and demonstrate impressive visual understanding by unifying the encoding of visual and text tokens [34, 55\u201357]. However, LVLMs still face the problem of hallucination [58, 59], where generated text descriptions contradict the visual modality information. Various approaches have been proposed to address hallucination in LVLMs, including enhancing dataset quality for fine-tuning [60, 8, 61, 9], manipulating the decoding process [37, 62\u201366], and leveraging external closed-source models to facilitate post-hoc mitigation of hallucination [58, 67\u201370].

In LVLMs, alignment manifests as modality misalignment, where the generated textual responses are supposed to follow the input visual information. Recently, preference optimization has been used to address the modality misalignment problem. These optimizations involve preference data curated by human annotators [8, 60, 30] and additional models (e.g., GPT-4) [9, 10]. While these methods improve the ability of LVLMs to align modalities, their reliance on human annotation or additional models is resource-intensive and may introduce additional biases. Furthermore, these models cannot fully capture the inherent preferences of LVLMs, making the curated preference data less effective. Instead, CSR leverages a calibrated self-rewarding strategy, aiming to stimulate the LVLMs\u2019 self-correction and enhancement capabilities, thereby further improving modality alignment.

Similarly, Chen et al. [12] utilizes self-play to enhance the model\u2019s performance by distinguishing its self-generated responses from those in human-annotated training data.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
