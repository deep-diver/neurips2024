### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers manipulate the training data to make the model misbehave when it sees specific trigger patterns.  Existing defenses often struggle to completely remove backdoor effects without impacting the accuracy on clean data. This paper focuses on a new approach to solving this issue.

The researchers propose a two-stage defense method. First, **they use clean unlearning data to identify and reinitialize the backdoor-related neurons**. This stage leverages observations about the relationship between weight changes during clean and poisoned unlearning and the different activity levels of neurons in clean versus backdoored models.  The second stage involves **a fine-tuning process with gradient norm regulation to further prevent backdoor reactivation**.  The experimental results demonstrate that this new approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

> üîº This figure illustrates two key observations about backdoored models. Observation 1 shows a positive correlation between neuron weight changes during clean and poison unlearning, suggesting that neurons significantly impacted by clean unlearning are also strongly associated with backdoor mechanisms. Observation 2 highlights that neurons in backdoored models are more active (exhibiting larger changes in gradient norm) than those in clean models during clean unlearning. These observations provide the basis for the proposed two-stage backdoor defense method.

Figures for Observation 2 compare the average gradient norm for each neuron on the backdoored model and clean model, which are calculated with one-epoch clean unlearning. More active means a larger change in the gradient norm. Experiments are conducted on PreAct-ResNet18 [12] on CIFAR-10 [13] for the clean model and additional attacks with 10% poisoning ratio for the backdoored model. The last convolutional layers are chosen for illustration.

### In-depth insights


#### Backdoor Unlearning
Backdoor unlearning, a crucial aspect of backdoor defense in neural networks, focuses on mitigating the malicious behavior injected during the training phase.  **The core idea is to selectively remove or neutralize the backdoor's influence without significantly harming the model's performance on legitimate data.**  This is challenging because backdoors often subtly alter the network's weight parameters, making them difficult to identify and remove.  Effective backdoor unlearning techniques often involve analyzing the network's weights, activations, and gradients to isolate the backdoor-related components. This may involve identifying neurons or pathways that are disproportionately activated by the trigger input. **Methods like neuron weight change analysis and gradient norm regularization are used to refine and retrain the model, suppressing the backdoor's activation while preserving its overall accuracy.** However, the success of backdoor unlearning heavily depends on the sophistication of the attack and the quality of the available clean data. **The process is particularly complex when there is limited or no poisoned data available for analysis.**

#### Neuron Weight Changes
Analyzing neuron weight changes in the context of backdoor attacks unveils crucial insights into model vulnerabilities.  **Clean unlearning**, a process of removing clean data's influence, reveals a positive correlation with weight changes observed during poison-based unlearning. This correlation highlights the possibility of identifying backdoor-related neurons without access to poisoned data. The concept of **neuron activeness**, measured by gradient norm changes, demonstrates that backdoored neurons exhibit higher activity. This observation points to the need for methods to suppress backdoored neuron activation during fine-tuning, preventing the backdoor effect's reemergence. These findings are instrumental in developing effective defense mechanisms, enabling the targeted mitigation of backdoor vulnerabilities by combining weight re-initialization and activeness-aware fine-tuning.

#### Activeness-Aware Tuning
Activeness-Aware Fine-tuning is a crucial stage in the proposed Two-Stage Backdoor Defense (TSBD) method. It directly addresses the observation that backdoored models exhibit higher neuron **activeness** during the learning process than clean models.  This heightened activeness, measured by the average gradient norm, indicates a greater susceptibility to backdoor reactivation during standard fine-tuning.  **Activeness-Aware Fine-tuning** mitigates this by incorporating gradient-norm regulation into the loss function, effectively suppressing the activity of these susceptible neurons. This approach prevents the unintentional reinstatement of the backdoor effect while recovering clean accuracy. The method's superior performance highlights the importance of considering neuron activeness in backdoor defense strategies. The use of gradient-norm regulation is a key innovation, offering a more effective alternative to standard fine-tuning.

#### Two-Stage Defense
A two-stage defense mechanism is proposed to effectively mitigate backdoor vulnerabilities in deep neural networks. **Stage 1 focuses on backdoor re-initialization**, leveraging the correlation between weight changes during clean and poisoned unlearning to identify and neutralize backdoor-related neurons without needing poisoned data. This is achieved by efficiently reinitializing a calculated subset of the most significantly altered neuron weights to zero. **Stage 2 involves activeness-aware fine-tuning**, addressing the issue of backdoor reactivation during the standard fine-tuning process.  By regulating gradient norms during fine-tuning, the method effectively suppresses excessive neuron activations associated with the backdoor, enhancing clean accuracy recovery. This two-pronged approach, combining targeted backdoor neuron elimination with controlled fine-tuning, is shown to significantly improve backdoor defense performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets and attack types.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this backdoor defense work could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the efficiency of the two-stage defense** is crucial, potentially through more efficient neuron selection methods or alternative reinitialization strategies.  **Investigating the generalizability** of the proposed approach across diverse model architectures and datasets beyond the benchmarks tested is essential to validate its robustness.  A deeper exploration into the **interaction between backdoor attacks and various defense mechanisms** is needed. This includes understanding the limitations of the defense, particularly against advanced, adaptive attack techniques. Finally, exploring **data-free or minimal-data backdoor defenses** is a critical future direction, to address scenarios with limited or no access to clean data for training.
