Recently, Vision-Language (VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers.

It aims to locate an object in each frame of a video given an initial object box. Recently, VisionLanguage (VL) trackers leverage additional natural language descriptions to boost their efficacy. For instance, the shape of a target may change during tracking. However, the semantic information of the target, such as its category or material, remains the same. This makes language text more potential and stable to describe such an appearance-changing object than an image template solely. Despite these advantages, current VL trackers [12, 37, 10] are still inferior to SoTA Visual Trackers [27, 6] on mainstream benchmarks [7, 21]. We identify the following reasons for this: 1) VL trackers heavily rely on manual annotations, which often contain ambiguous language descriptions. 2) Manual textual annotations primarily focus on the tracking target and neglect the semantic information embedded in the text, such as the presence of various background objects and their relations to the target. However, most VL trackers mainly focus on better aligning the vision-language modal features [17, 37, 12], overlooking how inaccurate textual annotations in the dataset can adversely affect VL trackers performance. In the last few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) [1] and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [25, 38, 31] have progressed rapidly. The wealth of world knowledge encoded in the pre-trained LLMs and MLLMs, along with their capabilities in processing and understanding VL information, has attracted immediate attention from the research communities. Inspired by these advancements, we contemplate whether they can be utilized to achieve better language descriptions for visual tracking. However, we find that directly using the language descriptions generated by MLLMs hardly improves tracking performance as shown in Fig. 1. Two primary causes are identified: 1) The VL tracker is unable to comprehend the language descriptions directly from the MLLM, resulting in the VL trackers identifying incorrect targets. This is because the MLLM and VL trackers are trained on different datasets, leading to a mismatch between the text generated by the MLLM and the visual content in the VL tracker\u2019s latent space. 2) The inherent limitations of MLLMs in understanding alternate modalities exacerbate the phenomenon of \u201challucination\u201d in multi-modal contexts [5], leading to outputs that are inaccurate or even erroneous.

This feedback mechanism drives the iterative refinement of the MLLM\u2019s output, making it more aligned with the image content and more understandable for the VL tracker, thus effectively addressing the above mentioned issues. In addition, a novel semantic tracking module is proposed to effectively utilize the semantic information obtained from the MLLM and yield the final tracking results.

These approaches can be categorized based on their text sources: those using manually annotated texts and those generating descriptions from a predefined dictionary. In the first category, manually annotated texts have been prevalently employed in target tracking tasks. Datasets like LaSoT [7], TNL2K [26] and MGIT [11] datasets provide manual annotated language descriptions for each sequence. Trackers like the SNLT tracker [8] utilize both visual and language descriptions to predict the target state, then dynamically combine these predictions to produce the final results. JointNLT [37] combines visual grounding and tracking guided by natural language, efficiently addressing the distinct requirements of both processes. The second category leverages a predefined dictionary to generate language descriptions. CiteTracker [12] meticulously develops a category vocabulary that includes attributes like color, texture, and material of the target. During tracking, it uses CLIP [23] to compare the similarity between images and text, selecting the text that closely matches the image as the target\u2019s description. In contrast to these approaches, our work exclusively employs MLLM to acquire precise text descriptions of targets.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
