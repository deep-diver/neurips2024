### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used, yet their safety remains a critical concern. Recent studies demonstrate that even aligned LLMs can be easily compromised through adversarial fine-tuning. This necessitates the development of robust safety mechanisms to ensure safe and reliable LLM applications.

This paper introduces the concept of the "safety landscape" to measure and visualize the safety risks in LLM finetuning.  The authors discover a universal phenomenon called a "safety basin", where minor model parameter changes preserve safety, while larger changes lead to immediate safety compromise. They propose a new safety metric, VISAGE, to quantify this risk and highlight the importance of system prompts in safeguarding LLMs.

> üîº Figure 1 shows two key findings from the paper.  Panel A demonstrates that a 'safety basin' universally exists in the parameter space of several popular open-source large language models (LLMs). This basin is a region where random perturbations to the model's weights do not significantly affect its safety. However, outside this basin, the model's safety dramatically decreases. This discovery led to the creation of a new safety metric called VISAGE. Panel B illustrates how finetuning affects the model's position within the safety landscape. Finetuning with only harmful data pushes the model out of the safety basin, compromising its safety. Conversely, finetuning with a mixture of harmful and safe data allows the model to remain within the safety basin and maintain its safety.

The VISAGE score, a new metric introduced in the paper, measures the robustness of the models' safety.  Lower ASR (Attack Success Rate) indicates better safety. The table shows that finetuning with harmful data significantly reduces the models' safety, while incorporating safe data helps mitigate this effect. LLaMA2 consistently shows a higher VISAGE score and lower ASR than Vicuna, indicating greater safety and robustness.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Safety Basins
The concept of "LLM Safety Basins" proposes that within the vast parameter space of large language models (LLMs), **localized regions exist where random perturbations to model weights do not significantly compromise safety**.  This contrasts with the sharp drop in safety observed outside these basins.  The existence of these basins suggests that **fine-tuning an aligned LLM can easily disrupt safety by moving the model out of its safety basin**, highlighting the fragility of alignment.  **Visualizing this safety landscape can offer valuable insights into the robustness of an LLM's alignment**, providing a new perspective for evaluating safety risks during fine-tuning and the crucial role of system prompts in preserving safety within the basin.

#### VISAGE Safety Metric
The VISAGE safety metric, as proposed in the paper, offers a novel approach to quantifying the risk in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).  It leverages the concept of a **safety basin** in the LLM parameter space, a region where random perturbations to model weights maintain the model's safety.  VISAGE measures the size and depth of this basin. **A larger, deeper basin suggests greater robustness to adversarial fine-tuning attacks**, as the model remains safe even with parameter variations. This contrasts with the capability landscape, where performance degrades with perturbations.  By visualizing the safety landscape, VISAGE helps understand how fine-tuning compromises safety by moving the model away from this basin, offering a **task-agnostic measure of risk**. The metric's effectiveness is demonstrated across multiple LLMs and safety benchmarks, showcasing its potential as a valuable tool for LLM safety research and development.

#### Finetuning Risks
Finetuning large language models (LLMs) presents significant risks, as highlighted in the research.  **A key finding is the existence of a 'safety basin' in the model's parameter space.**  Within this basin, random perturbations maintain the model's safety, but outside this region, safety dramatically degrades. This emphasizes the fragility of aligned models and the potential for catastrophic failure with even minor adjustments.  **The research introduces the VISAGE metric to quantify this risk, enabling the measurement of safety resilience during finetuning.**  Furthermore, the system prompt plays a crucial role; removing it or using simple prompts significantly compromises safety.  **Visualizing the safety landscape reveals how finetuning, even with benign datasets, can shift the model away from the safety basin, increasing the risk of harmful outputs.**  However, finetuning with a mixture of safe and harmful data helps retain safety by keeping the model within the basin.  **This underscores the importance of careful finetuning strategies and robust safety mechanisms to mitigate these risks.**

#### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is crucial for effectively interacting with large language models (LLMs).  Well-crafted prompts can significantly impact the quality and safety of LLM outputs.  **Poorly designed prompts can lead to unsafe or biased responses**, highlighting the need for careful consideration of prompt construction.  The paper explores the interplay between prompts and LLM safety, showing how **subtle changes in prompt design can dramatically shift the model's behavior**.  This underscores the importance of **systematic prompt engineering methodologies**, enabling the creation of robust and reliable prompts that ensure safe and aligned LLM behavior. The research emphasizes the need for further investigation into prompt design techniques to enhance LLM safety and minimize unwanted outcomes.  **Prompt engineering is not just about eliciting desired information; it's about safeguarding against potential harms and biases** inherent in LLM technology.

#### Jailbreak Sensitivity
Jailbreak sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) explores how susceptible these models are to adversarial attacks designed to circumvent their safety mechanisms.  **A key aspect is the sensitivity of the model's output to small perturbations in its internal parameters or input prompts.** This sensitivity can be exploited by attackers to trigger unsafe behaviors, such as generating harmful or biased content.  Analyzing jailbreak sensitivity reveals crucial insights into the robustness and vulnerabilities of LLMs.  **Understanding how slight modifications can lead to significant changes in model behavior is crucial for developing more robust and secure LLMs.** The research into jailbreak sensitivity could inform the development of new defense mechanisms against these attacks, potentially incorporating techniques like parameter regularization or input sanitization.  Furthermore, **investigating the relationship between jailbreak sensitivity and model architecture or training data could reveal critical vulnerabilities in current LLM development processes.** Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of jailbreak sensitivity is vital for improving the safety and reliability of LLMs and mitigating their potential risks.

When given two models varied by fine-tuning, we utilize linear interpolation to visualize the changes between them. While interpolating the model weights between the base and the chat model, we need to ensure the chat format remains consistent. Thus, we ablate on both chat formats: text completion (no template) and LLaMA2 chat template. The chat model exhibits higher safety than the base model as expected. The base model also shows an increase in safety while using the LLaMA2 chat template. (b) 1D-random LLaMA2-7B safety landscape sampled over different random directions.
