The upper bounds are given for two cases: \u03b2 \u2265 1 and 0 < \u03b2 < 1, representing the parameter of the initial mean reward distribution.  The lower bounds are provided for \u03b2 > 0.  The regret is a measure of the algorithm's performance, with lower regret indicating better performance.", "section": "Summary of our Contributions"}, {"figure_path": "1cXdndzkxU/tables/tables_26_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of our regret bounds.", "description": "This table summarizes the upper and lower bounds on the regret achieved by the proposed algorithm for both slow and abrupt rotting scenarios, considering different values of the parameter beta (\u03b2).  The upper bounds show the algorithm's performance in terms of the total amount of rotting (V_T) and the total number of rotting instances (S_T).  The lower bounds demonstrate the theoretical limits of performance, which provide context for assessing how close to optimal the algorithm is. The table helps to assess the tightness of the theoretical bounds and the algorithm's effectiveness.", "section": "Summary of our Contributions"}]
