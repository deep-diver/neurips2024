The core challenge lies in balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Bandit problems have significant implications across diverse real-world applications, such as recommendation systems [17] and clinical trials [23]. In a recommendation system, each arm could represent an item, and the objective is to maximize the click-through rate by making effective recommendations.

For instance, in content recommendation systems, the click rates for each item (arm) may diminish due to user boredom with repeated exposure to the same content. Another example is evident in clinical trials, where the efficacy of a medication can decline over time due to drug tolerance induced by repeated administration. The decline in mean rewards resulting from playing arms, referred to as (rested) rotting bandits, has been studied by Levine et al. [16], Seznec et al. [20, 21]. The pr\u221aevious work focuses on finite $K$ arms, in which Seznec et al. [20] proposed algorithms achieving $\\bar{O}(\\sqrt{K T})$ regret.

The consideration of infinitely many arms for rested rotting bandits fundamentally distinguishes these problems from those with a finite number of arms, as we will explain later. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The study of multi-armed bandit problems with an infinite number of arms has been extensively conducted in the context of stationary rewards [6, 24, 8, 10, 5], where the agent has no chance to play all the arms at least once until horizon time $T$ . Initially, the distribution of the mean rewards for the arms was assumed to be uniform over the interval [0, 1] [6, 8]. This assumption was expanded to include a much wider range of distributions satisfying $\\mathbb{P}(\\mu(a)\\,>\\,\\mu^{*}\\,-\\,x)\\,=\\,\\Theta(x^{\\beta})$ , for a parameter $\\beta>0$ , where $\\mu(a)$ represents the mean reward of arm $a$ and $\\mu^{*}$ is the mean reward of the best-performing arm [24, 10, 5]. Additionally, feature information for each arm is not required for multi-armed bandit problems with infinitely many arms, which differs from linear bandits [1] or continuum-armed bandits [3, 14], where feature information for each arm, either for the Lipschitz or linear structure, is involved. While Kim et al. [13], as the closest work, explores the concept of diminishing rewards in the context of bandits with infinitely many arms, their focus is restricted to the case of the maximum rotting rate constraint, where the amount of rotting at each time step is bounded by $\\rho$ $\\:\\left(=o(1)\\right)\\:$ ).

This allows us to capture characteristics of entire rotting rates over the time horizon. Similar constraints of $V_{T}$ or $S_{T}$ regarding nonstationarity have been explored in the context of nonstationary finite $K$ -armed bandit problems [7, 4, 19], where the reward distribution changes over time independently of the agent.

In the case of finite arms, rested rotting is known to be no harder than stationary case [20, 21]. This result arises from the confinement of mean rewards of optimal arms and played arms within confidence bounds, even under rested rotting (as demonstrated in Lemma 1 of Seznec et al. [20, 21]). However, in the case of infinite arms under distribution for initial mean reward that allows for an infinite number of near-optimal arms, there always exist near-optimal arms outside of explored arms. Therefore, the mean reward gap may not be confined within confidence bounds. This fundamental difference from finite-armed rotting bandits introduces additional challenges. In our setting of infinite arms, there exists an additional cost for exploring new (unexplored) arms to find near-optimal arms while eliminating explored suboptimal arms. If the total rotting effect on explored arms is significant, then the frequency at which new near-optimal arms must be sought increases substantially, resulting in a large regret. This is why the rested rotting significantly affects the exploration cost regarding $V_{T}$ or $S_{T}$ in our setting, which differs from the case of finite arms.

Here, we discuss the discrepancies between lower and upper bounds when $0<\\beta<1$ . From (1), we can observe that as $\\beta$ decreases below 1, the probability to sample good arms may increase, which appears to be beneficial with respect to regret. However, the regret upper bounds for $0<\\beta<1$ in Theorems 3.1 and 3.3 remain the same as the case when $\\beta=1$ while the regret lower bounds in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 decrease as $\\beta$ decreases, resulting in a gap between the regret upper and lower bounds. The phenomenon that the regret upper bound remains the same when $\\beta$ decreases has also been observed in previous literature on infinitely many-armed bandits [5, 24, 10]. As mentioned in Carpentier and Valko [10], although there are likely to be many good arms when $\\beta$ is small, it is not possible to avoid a certain amount of regret from estimating mean rewards to distinguish arms under sub-Gaussian reward noise. Therefore, we believe that our regret upper bounds are near-optimal across the entire range of $\\beta$ , and achieving tighter regret lower bounds when $\\beta<1$ is left for future research. Notably, the optimality proven only for $\\beta\\,\\geq\\,1$ has also been observed for stationary infinitely many-armed bandits [5, 24].

Regarding the utilization of the regret analysis of Corollary 3.2 (EXP3) in Auer et al. [2], we note that the reward for each base can be defined independently of the actual master\u2019s action. One might wonder whether the regret analysis for EXP3 can be utilized, considering the fact that the reward from a selected base may depend on the master\u2019s action due to the adaptive rotting rates. However, we highlight that the critical aspect of applying EXP3 analysis is whether the rewards from each base are defined independently of the actual action of the master, rather than whether the received (observed) reward from the selected base depends on the master\u2019s action. We can construct rewards for each base $\\delta\\in{\\cal B}$ at time $t$ when a block starts, denoted as $x_{t}(\\delta)$ , as the reward obtained when the master selects base $\\delta$ (even though base $\\delta$ is not actually selected from the algorithm). Then, we can define $x_{t}(\\delta)$ for each $\\delta$ regardless of the master\u2019s actual action. In other words, irrespective of the actually selected base, we define $x_{t}(\\delta)$ for all $\\delta\\in{\\cal B}$ as the reward that the master can obtain by selecting $\\delta$ . In such a case, whatever the selected base by the master is at time $t_{\\cdot}$ , $x_{t}(\\delta)$ \u2019s remain the same, respectively. This construction is feasible because it\u2019s solely for analytical purposes and not necessary for the algorithm\u2019s functioning.
