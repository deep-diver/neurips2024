Linear Probing (LP) uses simple averaging or max-pooling of features. GeM pooling is a generalization of LP. NetVLAD uses more sophisticated aggregation that requires initialization of centroids.  The authors' proposed Centroid-Free Probing (CFP) simplifies NetVLAD while improving performance and interpretability by removing the centroid initialization step.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "V6w7keoTqn/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overall pipeline of the proposed EMVP, including recalibration and CFP stages. Feature matrices from the two branches (i.e., Fc and FP) are multiplied to obtain fine-grained features for the improved VPR performance.

It consists of two main stages: recalibration and centroid-free probing (CFP). The recalibration stage utilizes a dynamic power normalization (DPN) module to enhance task-specific information preservation in the backbone network. The CFP stage employs a novel centroid-free probing method that leverages second-order features for improved representation.  Both stages use DPN for adaptive control of task-specific information.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "V6w7keoTqn/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The DPN module can be placed in both CFP and recalibration stages, which is indicated by DPNC and DPNR, respectively.

The DPN module is a key component of the EMVP pipeline, designed to adaptively control the preservation of task-specific information.  The three variations illustrate its implementation in different stages of the pipeline: (a) DPNC in the Centroid-Free Probing (CFP) stage, (b) DPNR in the recalibration stage implemented sequentially, and (c) DPNR in recalibration implemented in parallel.
