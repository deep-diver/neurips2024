Comparison values, datasets and evaluation measures as in [39], based on code provided on GitHub by the authors. id-TF: identity teacher forcing, GTF: generalized teacher forcing, Dstsp: state space divergence, DH: Hellinger distance across power spectra. Reported values are median \u00b1 median absolute deviation.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNN) model to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) across several datasets.  The metrics used for comparison are the state-space divergence (Dstsp), the Hellinger distance (DH), and the number of time steps (\n0).  The table highlights AL-RNN's competitive performance and its ability to achieve comparable or better results with fewer parameters.  The abbreviations id-TF and GTF represent identity teacher forcing and generalized teacher forcing, respectively.", "section": "5 Experimental Results"}]
