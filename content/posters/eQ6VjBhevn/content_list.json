Narrowing down to VLMs, notable examples of prompt learning approaches include CoOp [56], CoCoOp [55], and MaPLe [15]. Episodic TTA has also been explored with traditional unimodal networks, such as ResNets [10], where MEM is still a core component [53]. In this context, MEM has recently been enriched with sharpness- [27] or shape-aware flitering [19]. Due to its nature, Episodic TTA is completely agnostic to the temporal dimension and is powerful when no reliable assumptions on the test data can be taken. Some other works relax these constraints and integrate additional assumptions such as batches of test data being available instead of single test points [45]. When test data are assumed to belong to the same domain, one can rely on various forms of knowledge retention as a powerful mechanism to gradually incorporate domain knowledge [21, 22] or avoid forgetting [26].
