Raw OOD scores are initially assigned to nodes.  Then, these scores are propagated to neighboring nodes, influencing their scores. The propagation is shown to occur iteratively, resulting in a refined OOD score for each node after multiple propagation steps.  The process aims to leverage the graph structure for enhanced OOD detection accuracy.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "jb5qN3212b/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Two illustrative examples when scoring propagation is harmful/helpful. We consider ID nodes in green and OOD nodes in red. Inter-edges are defined to be ID-to-OOD edges and Intra-edges are ID-to-ID or OOD-to-OOD edges. The value represents the respective OOD scores. Consequently, the propagated scores in these cases will be the mean of the scores of adjacent nodes as shown in Figure 1.", "description": "This figure illustrates two scenarios where OOD score propagation either helps or harms the performance of graph OOD detection. In (a), a graph with mostly inter-edges (connections between ID and OOD nodes) is shown, where propagation leads to misclassification. In (b), a graph with mostly intra-edges (connections between ID nodes or between OOD nodes) is shown, where propagation improves classification accuracy, demonstrating that the ratio of intra-edges to inter-edges is a critical factor influencing score propagation's effectiveness.", "section": "3 Will propagation always help Graph OOD Detection?"}, {"figure_path": "jb5qN3212b/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The augmentation procedure.", "description": "The figure illustrates the process of augmenting a graph's adjacency matrix (A) by adding edges to a subset of nodes (G).  The leftmost matrix represents the original adjacency matrix A. The grayed-out portion in the center of the rightmost matrix represents the subset of nodes (G = {v1, v2}).  Edges are added between nodes within this subset, and the resulting augmented adjacency matrix (A + E) is shown on the right. This augmentation is designed to increase the ratio of intra-edges (connections within ID or OOD nodes) to inter-edges (connections between ID and OOD nodes), thereby improving the effectiveness of score propagation for OOD detection.", "section": "4 An Augmented Score Propagation Strategy"}, {"figure_path": "jb5qN3212b/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Illustration of the rationale in selecting  Sid and Sood.

The MSP scores are shown to follow a distribution, with the ID nodes concentrated towards higher MSP scores and OOD nodes concentrated towards lower MSP scores.  Two thresholds, \u03bba and \u03bb1\u2212a, are used to select the nodes with high confidence as ID (Sid) and nodes with low confidence as OOD (Sood).  The rationale is that by selecting nodes in the extreme regions of the distribution, there is less overlap between ID and OOD nodes, which reduces the error rate in identifying each group.", "section": "4.2 Graph-Augmented Score Propagation (GRASP)"}, {"figure_path": "jb5qN3212b/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Illustration of the number of edges from each training node i to Sid and Sood on Chameleon dataset.
