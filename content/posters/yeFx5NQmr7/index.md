### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Garment animation is crucial for virtual worlds, but existing methods often require extensive garment datasets and struggle to generalize.  This research tackles these issues by proposing a new approach that separates the learning process into two parts: learning constitutive relations from the simple observed cloth and dynamically animating different garments based on the learned relations.  This method reduces the need for large-scale training data and can handle a variety of garment types. 

The core of this method is the Energy Unit Network (EUNet), which directly models the constitutive behaviors of materials using an energy-based representation.  This allows the system to capture the physical properties of the material independent of the garment's shape or topology.  The learned constitutive laws are used in an energy optimization framework to generate realistic garment animations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of accuracy, stability, and generalization ability, achieving more physically plausible results using far less training data.

### In-depth insights


#### Disentangled Learning
Disentangled learning tackles the challenge of separating intertwined factors within complex data, a crucial aspect in various machine learning applications.  The core idea revolves around **learning representations where individual factors are independent of one another**, improving model interpretability and generalization. In the context of garment animation, disentangling the constitutive laws (material properties) from the dynamic motions (external forces) is particularly insightful.  This approach allows for **learning material behavior from a simpler source**, like a single piece of cloth, and then applying those learned properties to animate diverse garments. This strategy offers significant advantages, as **it reduces the need for large, garment-specific datasets** typically required for traditional supervised learning methods.  Furthermore, it **enables generalization to unseen garment types and conditions**, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of garment animation models.  The effectiveness of this method depends on the success of disentanglement and the capacity of the learned representations to accurately capture the essential physics. Successfully disentangling these factors promises to yield more robust, efficient, and physically plausible results compared to traditional, monolithic approaches.

#### EUNet: Energy Unit Net
The proposed EUNet (Energy Unit Network) offers a novel approach to learning constitutive laws for garment animation.  Instead of relying on traditional physics models or large-scale garment datasets, **EUNet directly learns constitutive behavior from the observed trajectories of a single piece of cloth**. This disentangled approach significantly reduces data requirements and enhances generalization.  The network models the constitutive relations in the form of energy, effectively capturing the energy changes due to deformations like stretching and bending.  **EUNet‚Äôs edge-wise energy unit design is topology-agnostic**, making it applicable to diverse garment types.  Furthermore, the incorporation of vertex-wise contrastive loss enhances the accuracy of energy gradient predictions. By constraining energy optimization with the learned energy, the model achieves stable and physically plausible garment animations, even with long-term predictions.  This innovative approach makes **garment animation more efficient, robust, and generalizable** by decoupling material properties from garment topology.

#### Constitutive Behavior
The concept of 'Constitutive Behavior' in a material science context refers to the relationship between stress and strain within a material.  This relationship dictates how a material responds to external forces, defining its mechanical properties.  In the context of garment animation, accurately modeling constitutive behavior is crucial for realistic simulations.  **Traditional approaches often rely on analytical physics models**, requiring the estimation of material parameters that are often difficult to measure or obtain.  **Data-driven methods offer an alternative**, learning constitutive behavior directly from observed garment movements. However, these methods can be data-hungry, and overfitting to specific garments might limit generalization.  **A promising direction is to disentangle the learning process**, separating the learning of constitutive laws from the task of garment animation. By learning constitutive laws from simple cloth dynamics, models can achieve greater generalization and reduce data requirements. **This disentanglement enables the use of simpler training data** (e.g., a single piece of cloth) and **allows for the animation of diverse garments** sharing the same material properties.  Energy Unit Networks, for example, are capable of learning the energy associated with deformations and thus provide gradients necessary for physics-based animation, achieving physically plausible results.

#### Garment Animation
Garment animation, a crucial aspect of virtual reality, gaming, and film, has traditionally relied on physics-based simulation methods that are computationally expensive and struggle to generalize across different garments and materials.  **Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative**, capable of learning complex garment dynamics from data and generating realistic animations with greater efficiency. However, existing data-driven methods often require massive datasets, which are costly to obtain.  This paper tackles this limitation by proposing a disentangled approach that **separates the learning of material properties (constitutive relations) from the animation process itself.** By learning constitutive behaviors from observations of a simple piece of cloth, the method generalizes effectively to unseen garment types, thereby reducing the need for large-scale, garment-specific datasets.  This approach leverages **energy optimization constrained by a novel Energy Unit Network (EUNet)** to effectively animate various garments. EUNet directly captures constitutive behaviors in the form of energy, avoiding reliance on pre-defined physics models, thereby showcasing a more robust and flexible technique.  **The resulting disentangled framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing garment-wise supervised learning methods**, delivering stable and physically plausible animations, particularly in long-term predictions.

#### Data Efficiency
The core concept of data efficiency in this research centers on **reducing the reliance on extensive, garment-specific datasets** for training garment animation models.  Traditional methods necessitate vast amounts of data, representing diverse garments, poses, and materials, significantly increasing time and cost.  This paper introduces a **disentangled learning approach**, separating the learning process into two stages.  First, a constitutive model is learned using data from a single piece of cloth, capturing inherent material properties. Second, this learned model is applied to various garment animations, significantly reducing the need for garment-specific training data. This strategy showcases **high efficiency by leveraging the shared constitutive properties across different garment types**.  The benefit lies in **generalizability to unseen garment topologies and materials**, allowing for more flexible and cost-effective training of accurate garment animation models.  The effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental comparisons, highlighting the superior performance of this data-efficient approach compared to traditional garment-wise supervised learning.
