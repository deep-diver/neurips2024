Successor Features (SFs) offer a solution by disentangling reward and dynamics, but learning them from raw pixels often leads to representation collapse, where the model fails to capture meaningful variations. Existing SF learning methods can avoid this problem, but they involve complex losses and multiple training phases, reducing efficiency.\n\nThis paper introduces a simple method to learn SFs directly from pixels by using a combination of Temporal-Difference (TD) and reward prediction loss functions.  This approach matches or outperforms existing SF learning methods in various 2D and 3D maze, as well as Mujoco environments.  Importantly, it avoids representation collapse and is computationally efficient.  This offers a new, streamlined technique for learning SFs from pixels, which is highly relevant to modern artificial intelligence and continual learning research.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "rI7oZj1WMc/podcast.wav"}
