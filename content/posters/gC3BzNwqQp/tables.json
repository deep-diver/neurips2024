Left: E[ds] = 500, \u03bc = 100; Middle E[ds] = 100, \u03bc = 100; Right: E[ds] = 100, \u03bc = 500. Results are averaged over 100 independent runs.", "description": "This figure presents the simulation results of the DEMBA algorithm and compares its performance against benchmark algorithms under different delay settings.  The top row shows results with geometrically distributed delays, while the bottom row displays results using uniformly distributed delays. Each column represents a different scenario with varying expected delay (E[ds]) and threshold (\u03bc) for considering feedback. The results are averaged across 100 independent simulation runs, providing a robust comparison of the algorithms' performance.", "section": "7 Experiments"}]
