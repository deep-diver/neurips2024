However, these models often face challenges: unknown parameters and delayed feedback (customers take time to make decisions).  This makes the problem of learning optimal choices very difficult.\nThis paper tackles these issues by introducing two novel algorithms: DEMBA and PA-DEMBA.  These algorithms use confidence bounds and optimism to balance exploration and exploitation, accounting for delays and censored feedback. The authors prove theoretical guarantees for the regret (performance loss) of these algorithms and show experimentally that they work well in various settings.", "affiliation": "University of Waterloo", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "gC3BzNwqQp/podcast.wav"}
