Such parameters play a crucial role in these algorithms, as they are used in the construction of variable initializations, exploration bonuses, confidence sets, etc. However, in most real-world problems, these parameters are not known a priori, resulting in the need for the system designer to perform hyper-parameter tuning in a black-box fashion, which is known to be extremely costly in RL compared to their supervised learning counterparts [Pacchiano et al., 2020]. In supervised learning algorithms, selecting among $M$ hyper-parameters only degrad\u221aes the sample complexity by a factor of ${\\cal O}(\\log(M))$ .

In particular, we will show that there exist state-free RL algorithms which do not require the state space $S$ as an input parameter to the algorithm, nor do their regret scale with the innate state space size $|S|$ . In particular, we design a black-box reduction framework called State-Free Reinforcement Learning (SFRL). Given any existing RL algorithm for stochastic or adversarial MDPs, this framework can transform it into a state-free RL algorithm through a black-box reduction. We also show that the same framework can be adapted to induce action-free and horizon-free algorithms, the three of which now makes a tabular MDP algorithm completely parameter-free, i.e. it requires no input parameters whatsoever, and their regret bound automatically adapt to the intrinsic complexity of the problem.

Parameter-free algorithms refer to algorithms that do not require the learner to specify certain hyperparameters in advance. These algorithms are appealing in both theory and practice, considering that tuning algorithmic parameters is a challenging task [Bottou, 2012, Schaul et al., 2013]. The types of hyperparameters to \u201cset free\u201d varies depending on the specific problem. For example, for online learning and bandit problems, the hyperparameters are considered as the scale bound of the losses [De Rooij et al., 2014, Orabona and P\u00e1l, 2018, Duchi et al., 2011, Chen and Zhang, 2023], or the range of the decision set [Orabona and P\u00e1l, 2016, Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018, Zhang et al., 2022, van der Hoeven et al., 2020]; for neural network optimization, the hyperparameters can be the learning rate of the optimizer [Defazio and Mishchenko, 2023, Carmon and Hinder, 2022, Ivgi et al., 2023, Cutkosky et al., 2024, Khaled and Jin, 2024]; for model selection, the hyperparameters are the choice of the hypothesis class [Foster et al., 2017, 2019].

In this work we focus on the problem of developing parameter-free RL algorithms where the parameter to be focused on are those related to the environment transition, particularly the state space. Almost all RL algorithms assume knowledge of the state-space. For example, existing UCB-based reinforcement learning algorithms [Azar et al., 2017, Jin et al., 2018, Zanette and Brunskill, 2019, Zhang et al., 2020, 2021] make use of the state space size to construct the UCB bonus.

Instance-dependent algorithms dynamically adjust to the input data they find, and achieve a regret that not only scaling with the number of iterations $T$ , but also adapt to certain \u201cmeasures of hardness\u201d of the environment. Such algorithms perform better than the worst-case regret if the environment is \u201cbenign\u201d. In reinforcement learning, the most common \u201cmeasures of hardness\u201d considered in the community are Variance [Zanette and Brunskill, 2019, Zhou et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023] and Gap [Simchowitz and Jamieson, 2019, Xu et al., 2021, Dann et al., 2021, Jonsson et al., 2020, Wagenmaker et al., 2021, Tirinzoni et al., 2021], both related to the reward of the environment. Specifically, variance-dependent algorithms provide regret bounds that scale with the underlying conditional variance of the $Q^{\\star}$ function. Gap-dependent algorithms provide regret bounds of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log T/\\mathrm{gap}(s,a))$ where the gap notion is defined as the difference of the optimal value function and the $Q^{\\star}$ -function at a sub-optimal action $V^{\\star}(s)-Q^{\\star}(s,a)$ [Dann et al., 2021]. Additionally, some studies consider problems similar to ours, that is, how to adapt to the \u201cmeasure of hardness\u201d of the state space. Given an initial state space, Fruit et al. [2018] proposes an algorithm that adapts to the size of the reachable state space, resulting in improved performance when the initial state space is vacuous.

Both family of algorithms have the capability to adapt to the input data, allowing them to sequentially tune the hyperparameters and ultimately converge to the optimal hyperparameters inherent in the data. Consequently, when the number of iterations becomes sufficiently large, both instance-dependent algorithms and parameter-free algorithms tend to provide the same theoretical guarantees. However, this does not mean that the two types of algorithms are the same. The most significant difference is that instance-dependent algorithms require appropriate hyper-parameters initialization. Taking state-space adaptability as an example. Let $N$ represent the true number of states. An instancedependent algorithm must be provided with an initial value $M\\geq N$ . If this value is invalid, i.e., $M<N$ , the algorithm will fail to function properly. Moreover, the regret of instance-dependent algorithms is typically related to the initial input, even though this dependency may fade away as the number of iterations increases. This is also why we cannot simply set $M$ to infinity in an instance-dependent algorithm and call it parameter-free, that is, the regret of an instance-dependent algorithm always includes some burn-in terms that scale with $M$ . As $M$ goes to infinity, the burn-in term eventually dominates. In this sense, parameter-free learning is a strictly harder problem than instance-dependent learning.

First, to avoid wasting confidence on unreachable states, we initialize the confidence level of $\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}_{t}^{\\bar{1}}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ only if both $s$ and $s^{\\prime}$ are visited. The probability parameter $\\delta(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t(s,s^{\\prime})}$ -measurable, because it only depends on the data before epoch $t(s,s^{\\prime})$ . Thus, in order to avoid correlation, we can only use the data collected after epoch $t(s,s^{\\prime})+1$ to construct the confidence interval $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{1}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ . This leads to a problem: when $t(s^{\\prime})$ is much greater than $t(s)$ , we drop too much data that could be used to estimate $P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ , resulting in $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{1}(s^{\\prime}|\\bar{s},a)$ being loose compared to the existing confidence interval designed in Jin et al. [2019]. To address this issue, we introduce the second confidence interval $\\bar{Z}_{t}^{2}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ . The logic behind the estimator $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{2}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ is that $t(s^{\\prime})\\gg t(s)$ when the probability $P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ is very small and therefore $N_{t(s^{\\prime})}(s,a)-1$ can be used to certify an upper bound to $P(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ . The confidence level of $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{1}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ can only be determined after epoch $t(s^{\\prime})$ , whereas the confidence interval $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{2}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ is constructed based on data between $t(s)$ and $t(s^{\\prime})$ . By combining $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{1}(s^{\\prime}|s,a)$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{t}^{2}(s^{\\prime}|s,\\dot{a})$ , such a construction makes use of all the data after $t(s)$ to ensure a tight confidence interval.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
