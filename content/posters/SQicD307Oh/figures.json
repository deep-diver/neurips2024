[{"figure_path": "SQicD307Oh/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: An illustration of the mapping between the state space S and the pruned space S\u00b9. The left side represents the original state space S, where grey nodes denote the states in S\u00b9 and red nodes denote the others. The right side is the corresponding pruned space S\u00b9, where blue nodes denote the auxiliary states {s}h\u2208[H]. Given the structure, for any trajectory in space S (purple arrows), we can find a dual trajectory (yellow and green arrows) in the pruned space.", "description": "This figure illustrates the transformation from the original state space S to the pruned state space S+. In the original state space S, grey nodes represent states included in S+, and red nodes represent states not included in S+. The pruned state space S+ consists of states in S+ and additional auxiliary states (blue nodes) which represent groups of states not in S+. The figure shows how trajectories in the original state space S are mapped to equivalent trajectories in S+. This transformation is key to the state-free reinforcement learning algorithm proposed in the paper. ", "section": "Black-box reduction for State-free RL"}]
