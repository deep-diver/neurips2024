This provides a concise overview of the key differences and performance characteristics of the two methods.", "section": "3 The Player Algorithm"}, {"figure_path": "WqNfihAcu5/tables/tables_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison summary between S-ETC [8] and S-SE: setting and results.", "description": "This table compares the proposed algorithm, S-SE, with the existing S-ETC algorithm from the related work.  It highlights key differences in their settings (tacit model, debt-free reporting, and bonus nature) and the resulting regret bounds.  S-SE achieves a significantly improved regret bound compared to S-ETC, with both problem-dependent and problem-independent regret bounds provided. Note that the bonus nature differs as S-ETC uses additional rounds while S-SE employs payment.", "section": "3 The Player Algorithm"}]
