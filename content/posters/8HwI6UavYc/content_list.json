RAM3D takes multiview images of a static scene as input, along with text prompts specifying which object to erase and what should replace it. Our approach comprises four key steps: 1) We use a text-to-mask model with a text prompt to detect and segment the object to be erased from the input images. 2) We use a text-guided 3D inpainting technique to flil in the background region obscured by the removed object in a multi-view consistent manner. 3) Next, we use a similar text-guided 3D inpainting technique to generate a new 3D object corresponding to the input text description, which is seamlessly composited onto the background in all views. We thus obtain multiview consistent images of the edited 3D scene. 4) Finally, these updated dataset images are used to reconstruct the modified 3D scene, enabling novel view synthesis.

Subsequent research has explored various methods to enhance the quality of synthesized objects [15, 2, 16, 17] and disentangle geometry and appearance [18].

For scene-level editing, recent works primarily address object removal tasks for forward-facing NeRF scenes [27, 28, 29]. Instruct-NeRF2NeRF [3] and similar followup works [30, 31, 32] offer a comprehensive approach to both appearance editing and object addition, leveraging InstructPix2Pix [1] to update the scene dataset. However, as they modify the entire scene, they struggle to synthesise objects with complex geometrical texture patterns, and completely fail to remove objects from scenes. Blended-Nerf [26] and DreamEditor [33] allow localized object editing but do not support object removal. One closely related work is [28], which can remove and replace objects using one single image reference from the user. However, since this method relies only on a single inpainted image, it cannot handle regions with large occlusions across different views, and thus is only applied on forward-facing scenes. Another closely related work is RePaint-NeRF [34], which similarly allows text-guided scene editing on a masked region, but uses SDS loss to update a pretrained NeRF towards the text content.

Like our work, it also supports adding new objects to scenes. Similarly to [28], a single scene image is inpainted in 2D, providing a reference image of the new object. A pre-existing image-to-3D object model [37] then generates a 3D object from the segmented reference image, in isolation from the original scene. The coarse object mesh is transformed back into a 3D Gaussian representation and integrated into the scene through a laborious modelling process where the object is is manually placed into the scene. More importantly, the new object is not guaranteed to integrate seamlessly into the surrounding scene, which results in visible artifacts and quality issues when the method is applied to $360^{\\circ}$ scenes.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
