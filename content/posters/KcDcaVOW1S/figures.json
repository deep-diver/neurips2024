The comparison is done across different miscoverage rates (0.05 to 0.3).  The blue bars represent the average prediction set width (efficiency), while the gray bars show the empirical coverage rate (reliability).  The blue dashed line indicates the target coverage rate (1-\u03b1). The figure visually demonstrates that CT-SSF is more efficient (smaller width) while maintaining the desired coverage.", "section": "5.2 Simulations"}, {"figure_path": "KcDcaVOW1S/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparisons of the variants of CT-SSF.
