This significantly restricts their applicability to real-world assortment recommendation problems where complex relationships exist between customer choices, item valuations, and contextual factors.  The paper highlights this issue, and proposes to overcome it by developing more sophisticated models.\nThis paper addresses this issue by introducing contextual MNL bandit models that utilize general value functions.  The researchers propose a suite of novel algorithms tailored for both stochastic and adversarial contexts, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.  Key improvements include dimension-free regret bounds and the ability to manage completely adversarial contexts and rewards, representing a substantial advancement in the field.", "affiliation": "University of Iowa", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2ltOkbo67R/podcast.wav"}
