[{"figure_path": "2ltOkbo67R/tables/tables_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparisons of results for contextual MNL bandits with T rounds, N items, size-K assortments, and a d-dimensional linear value function class with norm bounded by B. All previous results depend on a problem-dependent constant k that is exp(2B) in the worst case, while ours (in gray) do not. The notation \u00d5(\u00b7) hides logarithmic dependency on all parameters. In the last column, \u2713 means polynomial runtime in all parameters; \u2713 means polynomial only when K is a constant; and X means not polynomial even for a small K.", "description": "This table compares the regret bounds and computational efficiency of various algorithms for contextual multinomial logit (MNL) bandits with linear value functions.  It highlights the dependence (or lack thereof) on a problem-dependent constant \u03ba, which can be exponentially large. The algorithms are categorized by the setting (stochastic or adversarial) and the type of feedback available (context and reward, context only, or reward only).  The 'Efficient?' column indicates whether the algorithm's runtime is polynomial in all parameters, polynomial only for constant K, or non-polynomial.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
