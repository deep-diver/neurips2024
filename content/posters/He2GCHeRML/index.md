### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Molecular learning, crucial for drug discovery, faces challenges due to the high cost of human annotation for molecular data. Active learning (AL) offers a solution by automatically querying labels for the most informative samples.  Existing AL methods struggle with 3D molecular graphs due to the complexity of comparing 3D geometries and the lack of principled methods for handling this. This research addresses these issues.

This paper proposes a new AL paradigm specifically for 3D molecular graphs. It introduces novel 3D graph isometries for more accurate diversity sampling, leveraging distributions of 3D geometries to eliminate redundancy.  A Bayesian geometric graph neural network efficiently computes uncertainties for sample selection.  The active sampling is formulated as a quadratic programming problem, resulting in a computationally efficient framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Part A shows the triangular isometry, where angles are measured between a reference vector (from the centroid to the farthest atom) and vectors pointing to other atoms. Part B demonstrates the cross-angular isometry, which includes angles formed by any two atoms relative to the reference vector, providing a more comprehensive representation of 3D molecular geometry.

### In-depth insights


#### 3D Graph Isometry
3D graph isometry, in the context of molecular representation learning, focuses on developing techniques to compare and classify 3D molecular structures based on their inherent geometric properties.  This is a challenging problem because molecules are not rigid bodies and can exist in various conformations.  **A key aspect is defining suitable isometries** ‚Äì transformations that preserve relevant geometric features, such as distances between atoms, angles formed by atomic bonds, and overall molecular shape.  These isometries are crucial for defining measures of similarity between molecules.  **The choice of isometries directly impacts the expressiveness of the resulting representation**; more expressive isometries can better distinguish subtle differences in molecular geometry, which is critical for accurate predictions of molecular properties.  Therefore, research in this area often involves designing novel isometries that provide a balance between expressiveness and computational efficiency, and rigorously analyzing their properties with respect to existing methods like the Geometric Weisfeiler-Lehman test (GWL) to demonstrate their effectiveness. The development of efficient algorithms for computing these isometries is also a major focus, as this is a computationally expensive task. The outcome of this research is improved 3D molecular graph representations that can be used in machine learning models for applications like drug discovery and materials science.

#### Bayesian GNNs
Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent a powerful paradigm shift in leveraging the strengths of both Bayesian methods and GNNs for improved uncertainty quantification and robustness. **Bayesian methods excel at quantifying uncertainty**, providing valuable insights into model confidence and aiding in decision-making, especially in scenarios with limited data or noisy observations.  **GNNs, on the other hand, are adept at capturing complex relationships and patterns within graph-structured data**, making them well-suited for tasks involving molecules, social networks, knowledge graphs, and other relational data.  The combination of these two powerful techniques results in models that are not only accurate but also provide measures of uncertainty associated with predictions. This is particularly important in high-stakes applications, such as medical diagnosis or drug discovery, where understanding uncertainty is crucial.  A key aspect of Bayesian GNNs is the incorporation of prior knowledge or beliefs about the model parameters. This prior knowledge can help to regularize the model, improve generalization performance, and make the model more robust to noise and overfitting.  Furthermore, Bayesian GNNs facilitate active learning strategies, enabling efficient and targeted data acquisition. By identifying data points where the model has high uncertainty, active learning focuses data collection efforts on the most informative samples, maximizing the impact of limited annotation resources.

#### Diversity Sampling
Diversity sampling, in the context of active learning for 3D molecular graphs, aims to select a diverse subset of unlabeled molecules for annotation.  This is crucial because including redundant samples doesn't significantly improve model performance, while diverse samples provide more comprehensive information about the underlying data distribution.  **Effective diversity sampling methods must consider the 3D geometry of molecules**, going beyond simple 2D structural comparisons, because the 3D structure significantly influences the chemical properties.  The challenge lies in developing efficient and expressive methods to quantify the dissimilarity of molecules in 3D space, and this often involves computationally expensive techniques. **A key aspect is selecting a measure of dissimilarity that captures the essential geometric features of molecules** while being computationally feasible for large datasets.  This often involves advanced graph isomorphism techniques or feature extraction methods that appropriately represent 3D structure.  Ultimately, the goal of diversity sampling is to maximize information gain by strategically selecting molecules that represent the diversity in the dataset, **thereby improving the model's generalization ability and reducing annotation burden**. 

#### Active Learning AL
Active learning (AL) in the context of 3D molecular graphs presents a unique opportunity to significantly reduce the annotation burden inherent in supervised learning approaches.  **The high computational cost** associated with methods like density functional theory (DFT) makes traditional supervised learning impractical for large datasets.  AL addresses this by strategically selecting the most informative samples for manual labeling.  **The key challenge** lies in defining effective criteria for sample selection, balancing the need for maximizing uncertainty (samples where the model is least confident) with the need for diversity (avoiding redundant samples).  The paper proposes an AL paradigm specifically tailored for 3D molecular graphs, leveraging novel 3D graph isometries and a Bayesian geometric graph neural network to quantify uncertainty.  **The resulting framework** effectively combines diversity and uncertainty measures to choose the most beneficial samples for annotation, demonstrating improved efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline methods.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending the proposed active learning framework to encompass diverse molecular datasets, including larger-scale datasets and those with varied chemical properties.  **Investigating the framework's performance with different 3D GNN architectures** beyond SphereNet and DimeNet++ would further strengthen its generalizability.  A crucial area for future investigation is the development of more sophisticated uncertainty quantification methods, potentially incorporating advanced Bayesian techniques or ensemble methods, to improve sample selection accuracy.  **Exploring different diversity metrics** and their impact on AL performance warrants attention.  Additionally, integrating the framework with other molecular property prediction methods could enhance its versatility. Finally, **applying the framework to real-world drug discovery and materials science challenges** is essential for demonstrating its practical value and identifying limitations in complex, real-world scenarios.
