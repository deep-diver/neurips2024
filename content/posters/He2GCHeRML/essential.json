Active learning (AL) offers a solution by automatically querying labels for the most informative samples.  Existing AL methods struggle with 3D molecular graphs due to the complexity of comparing 3D geometries and the lack of principled methods for handling this. This research addresses these issues.\nThis paper proposes a new AL paradigm specifically for 3D molecular graphs. It introduces novel 3D graph isometries for more accurate diversity sampling, leveraging distributions of 3D geometries to eliminate redundancy.  A Bayesian geometric graph neural network efficiently computes uncertainties for sample selection.  The active sampling is formulated as a quadratic programming problem, resulting in a computationally efficient framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "affiliation": "Florida State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "He2GCHeRML/podcast.wav"}
