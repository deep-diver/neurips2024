### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many state-of-the-art AI systems use compound inference, making multiple language model (LM) calls to improve performance. However, it's unclear how the number of LM calls affects overall performance. This paper investigates this issue by studying two simple compound systems: Vote and Filter-Vote.  These systems aggregate LM responses through majority voting, with Filter-Vote adding an extra LM filtering step.

The research reveals a surprising non-monotonic relationship between the number of LM calls and performance.  The researchers found that increasing the number of calls can initially improve performance but then lead to a decline. This behavior was explained by analyzing the diversity of query difficulty within a dataset, showing that additional calls help with "easy" queries but hurt performance on "hard" queries. To address this issue and optimize the number of LM calls, they developed an analytical scaling model which accurately predicts the optimal number of calls based on just a small dataset sample.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial because **it challenges the common assumption that more language model (LM) calls always improve compound AI system performance.**  This finding necessitates a re-evaluation of resource allocation in compound AI development and opens exciting avenues for optimizing these systems. The analytical model provided is also a significant contribution, enabling researchers to predict optimal LM call numbers and saving computational resources.

> This figure displays the scaling behavior of two compound AI systems, Vote and Filter-Vote, across four different language tasks (MMLU Physics, TruthfulQA, GPQA, and Averitec).  The x-axis represents the number of language model (LM) calls made by the system, and the y-axis represents the system's performance. The surprising finding is that performance is not always monotonically increasing with the number of LM calls. In some cases, performance improves initially, then decreases; in others, it decreases and then increases. This non-monotonic relationship highlights the complexity of compound AI systems and the need for a deeper understanding of how to optimize their design.

Finally, it shows symbols for the accuracy of the inference system and its analytical performance model.





### In-depth insights


#### LM Call Scaling
The study of 'LM Call Scaling' reveals a **surprising non-monotonic relationship** between the number of language model (LM) calls and a compound AI system's performance.  **Initially, increasing LM calls improves accuracy**, but **beyond a certain point, performance degrades**. This counter-intuitive finding is attributed to the **diversity of query difficulty** within a given task.  More LM calls benefit easier queries, but hurt harder ones. The optimal number of calls is dependent on the specific task's difficulty distribution.  A key contribution is a theoretical framework that models this non-monotonic behavior. This enables the prediction of optimal LM calls, maximizing accuracy without unnecessary computation, offering a crucial advance in optimizing resource allocation for compound AI systems.

#### Vote/Filter-Vote
The core of the proposed approach lies in analyzing the scaling properties of compound AI systems. The paper focuses on two fundamental system designs: **Vote** and **Filter-Vote**.  Vote aggregates multiple predictions via majority voting, mirroring strategies like Gemini's CoT@32. Filter-Vote refines this by incorporating an LM filter to remove potentially incorrect predictions before voting.  **The key finding is the surprising non-monotonicity of performance with respect to the number of LM calls.** Both systems exhibit performance that initially improves but may then degrade as more LM calls are added.  This unexpected behaviour stems from **query difficulty diversity within a dataset**. More calls boost accuracy on easy queries but hurt performance on hard ones, leading to a non-monotonic aggregate effect. This is further supported by theoretical models which accurately predict these non-monotonic trends, suggesting that the optimal number of calls is not simply more, but the number which best balances this trade-off between easy and hard queries. Thus, the paper proposes a valuable method for optimizing compound systems through careful consideration of query difficulty and its effect on scaling.

#### Query Difficulty
The concept of 'Query Difficulty' is central to the paper's analysis of compound AI systems.  The authors posit that **a query's inherent difficulty significantly impacts the system's performance**, particularly when multiple language model (LM) calls are aggregated.  This difficulty isn't simply a binary classification (easy/hard) but rather a spectrum.  **Easier queries show monotonic performance improvements with more LM calls**, converging towards near-perfect accuracy. Conversely, **harder queries exhibit a non-monotonic response**, initially degrading in accuracy before potentially improving slightly with substantially increased calls. This non-monotonicity arises from the diverse difficulty levels within a given task. The framework introduced helps to precisely define query difficulty and provides an analytical model to understand and even predict this behaviour, thus allowing to optimize the number of LM calls for maximum overall accuracy.

#### Scaling Model
The research paper explores the scaling properties of compound AI systems, focusing on how the number of language model (LM) calls affects their performance.  A core contribution is the development of a **novel scaling model** that predicts system performance as a function of the number of LM calls.  This model is particularly insightful because it reveals a **non-monotonic relationship**: increasing LM calls doesn't always improve performance; instead, an optimal number of calls exists, beyond which performance can degrade. The model's strength lies in its ability to **capture the interplay between easy and hard queries**. It suggests that additional LM calls boost performance on easy queries but harm it on hard queries, and the optimal number of calls depends on the distribution of query difficulty within a task.  This nuanced understanding allows for **more efficient resource allocation** and offers a potential method for optimizing compound AI systems without extensive experimentation.

#### Future Work
The paper's core contribution lies in analyzing the scaling properties of compound AI systems.  **Future work should naturally explore extending these analyses to a broader range of compound AI system architectures** beyond the simple Vote and Filter-Vote models considered. This includes investigating systems that utilize more sophisticated aggregation techniques,  more complex filtering mechanisms, or incorporate diverse LM models.  **A key area is developing more robust theoretical models** that can accurately predict system performance across various tasks and query difficulty distributions, going beyond the binary 'easy/hard' classification used in this paper.  **Another crucial direction is incorporating cost into the performance analysis.**  The current work focuses only on accuracy, while practical deployment requires considering the computational resources and monetary expense associated with increasing the number of LM calls.  Furthermore,  **empirical studies on a wider range of tasks, including those with subjective evaluation, are necessary** to fully validate the observed non-monotonic scaling behavior. Lastly, **researchers could investigate how the optimal number of LM calls interacts with other model parameters,** such as temperature or prompt engineering, to achieve a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of compound AI systems' scaling laws.

The results show that the model's predictions closely match the actual performance, highlighting the accuracy of the scaling law in capturing the relationship between the number of LM calls and the performance.
