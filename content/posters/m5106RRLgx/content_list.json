In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling properties of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LM calls affects the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote, two of the simplest compound system designs, which aggregate LM responses via majority voting, optionally applying LM filters. We find, surprisingly, that across multiple language tasks, the performance of both Vote and Filter-Vote can first increase but then decrease as a function of the number of LM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LM calls lead to higher performance on \u201ceasy\u201d queries, but lower performance on \u201chard\u201d queries, and nonmonotone behavior can emerge when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of LM calls that maximizes system performance, and define an analytical scaling model for both systems. Experiments show that our scaling model can accurately predict the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote systems and thus find the optimal number of LM calls to make.

Specifically, the real-world datasets include MMLU PHYSICS $[\\mathrm{HBB}^{+}20]$ , TRUTHFULQA [LHE21], GPQA $[\\mathrm{RHS}^{+}23]$ , and AVERITEC [SGV24]. MMLU PHYSICS contains high school physics questions extracted from the original MMLU dataset. TRUTHFULQA measures whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. GPQA queries are generated by experts in biology, physics, and chemistry. Each query in AVERITEC is a claim and the goal is to verify its correctness. Each query is prompted as a multiple-choice question for objective evaluation. The details of these datasets and prompts can be found in the Appendix. The synthetic dataset is $D_{\\alpha,p_{1},p_{2}}$ as introduced in Section 3, and we study the scaling behavior by varying the parameters. We use GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 on the real-world datasets.

The performance breakdown (shown in Figure 4(b)) gives a natural explanation. More LM calls lead to higher performance when a query is relatively difficult $(d_{F}(x)>\\bar{0}$ for Filter-Vote and $d_{V}(x)>0$ for Vote), but lower performance when a query is relatively easy $(d_{F}(x)<0$ for Filter-Vote and $d_{V}(x)<0$ for Vote). We also observe a high correlation between the performance predicted by our proposed analytical scaling model and the empirical performance, as depicted in Figure 4 (c).
