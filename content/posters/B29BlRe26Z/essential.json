These methods either suffer from slow convergence due to limited communication or from bias introduced by local updates. This paper tackles this problem. \nThe proposed solution, SLowcal-SGD, employs a customized slow querying technique. This technique, inspired by Anytime-SGD, allows machines to query gradients at slowly changing points which reduces the bias from local updates.  The algorithm also uses importance weighting to further enhance performance.  Experiments on MNIST dataset demonstrate that SLowcal-SGD consistently outperforms both Minibatch-SGD and Local-SGD in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.", "affiliation": "Technion", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "B29BlRe26Z/podcast.wav"}
