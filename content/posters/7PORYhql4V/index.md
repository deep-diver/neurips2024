### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning models, despite their complexity, exhibit unexpected regularities.  This paper investigates the distribution of optimized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with stochastic algorithms. A key challenge in deep learning is the inherent stochasticity of training, leading to a distribution of different optimized models, and understanding this distribution's properties is crucial.

The researchers focus on input salience maps which represent the sensitivity of the model's prediction to different input features. Their main finding is that as model capacity increases, the input salience of optimized DNNs converges towards a shared mean. This convergence trend is independent of the specific architecture of the model and consistently occurs across various model types. They introduced a semi-parametric approach for modeling this convergence, which helps explain several previously unclear phenomena, such as the efficacy of deep ensemble methods.

The baseline distance is 2, reflecting the range of cosine similarity values.  The table shows that deeper models (CL vs CS, RL vs RS) tend to have greater distances between their salience distributions, possibly due to increased training difficulty.

Note that here the baseline should be 2 since the cosine similarity lies in [-1,1]. It is observed that deeper models usually have larger distances (CS vs. CL, RS vs. RL). We deduce that this is because of the training for deeper models is more difficult.

### In-depth insights


#### DNN Salience Trends
Analyzing Deep Neural Network (DNN) salience trends reveals **crucial insights into model behavior and generalization**.  The distribution of salience maps across different, stochastically trained DNNs, even with varying capacities, demonstrates a surprising convergence.  **Larger models tend to exhibit more aligned salience patterns**, indicating a shared underlying mechanism for interpreting input features. This convergence has significant implications for deep learning, including improving our understanding of adversarial robustness and explaining the effectiveness of ensemble methods.  **The alignment in salience direction suggests a universal trend**, where different models prioritize similar input regions. This pattern highlights **the potential for improved model interpretability and explainability** by focusing on shared features across multiple model outputs.  Further research investigating these convergence trends is crucial for advancing our understanding of DNNs and developing more reliable and robust AI systems.

#### Convergence Analysis
A convergence analysis in a deep learning context would typically involve examining how the model's parameters evolve during training and whether they approach a stable state.  This could encompass investigating the behavior of loss functions over epochs, evaluating the change in model accuracy on training and validation datasets, and analyzing the gradients of the loss function to understand the optimization dynamics. **Key aspects to consider would be the rate of convergence, whether the model converges to a global or local minimum, and the impact of hyperparameters on the convergence process.**  The analysis might also include visualizing the parameter space or using mathematical techniques like examining eigenvalue distributions to gain insights into the stability and convergence behavior. **For stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the analysis would need to address the inherent randomness and explore the convergence in expectation or probability.**  The ultimate goal of such an analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of how models learn, pinpoint potential problems hindering optimal performance (e.g., poor generalization), and improve training strategies for faster and more stable learning.

#### Saw Dist. Modeling
The heading 'Saw Dist. Modeling' suggests a methodological approach within the research paper that utilizes the Sawtooth distribution (or a variation thereof) for modeling a specific phenomenon.  The Sawtooth distribution, known for its unique shape with a concentration of probability near its mean and then a gradual tapering off, is likely employed because it might **effectively capture the distribution's behavior**. This is especially useful if the observed data exhibits this characteristic concentration and tapering.  The choice of Sawtooth distribution reflects a **considered decision about the appropriate statistical model** which could be justified by the nature of the data or insights from exploratory data analysis. Within the paper, the use of this model will likely involve parameter estimation and model fitting techniques. A key strength of this approach could be its **ability to describe the underlying trend** in the data more accurately compared to simpler models, whilst also enabling deeper interpretation of the model parameters in the context of the research. However, limitations might arise from **assumptions underlying the Sawtooth distribution**. The model's success critically depends on the appropriateness of these assumptions to the underlying data-generating process.  Further validation and justification are required within the paper.

#### Black-box Attack
The research paper explores black-box attacks in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), focusing on the implications of the universal convergence trend of input salience.  The core idea is that the input salience, which essentially represents the sensitivity of a DNN's output to changes in its input, exhibits surprising similarities across different, stochastically trained models.  **This similarity is particularly pronounced as model capacity increases**, leading to higher resemblance in their mean saliency direction.  This has significant implications for black-box attacks, where the internal structure of the target model is unknown and the attacker must rely on readily observable information (like input gradients) to craft adversarial examples.  **The high degree of salience similarity means that an attack crafted against one model will often effectively transfer to other models**, especially larger ones.  This transferability is not merely an empirical phenomenon but arises naturally from the convergence of saliency distributions; hence, **attacking via the estimated mean salience direction can often be even more effective than targeting individual models**.  This observation also sheds light on the effectiveness of deep ensembles, as these effectively approximate the mean salience direction using multiple models.  In summary, the work provides a theoretical explanation for the practical success of deep ensembles and a novel perspective on the vulnerability of large DNNs to black-box attacks.

#### Deep Ensemble
Deep ensembles, which involve training multiple neural networks independently and combining their predictions, offer several advantages.  The primary benefit is improved **prediction accuracy**, often exceeding that of a single, larger model. This improvement arises from the ensemble's ability to reduce variance and capture diverse aspects of the underlying data distribution.  **Robustness** is another key advantage, as ensembles often show greater resistance to noisy or adversarial inputs than individual models.  This stems from the averaging effect, where outliers from individual models are mitigated.  However, deep ensembles also present challenges.  **Computational cost** is significantly increased due to the need for training multiple models. **Interpretability** is reduced, making it harder to understand the decision-making process of the ensemble.  Furthermore, the optimal number of ensemble members and their individual architectures require careful consideration and tuning. **Understanding the underlying reasons for the success of deep ensembles** remains a subject of ongoing research.  Future work should explore strategies to reduce the computational burden while retaining the ensemble's benefits.

> üîº This figure shows the results of a single model black-box attack where the adversarial samples are generated from the gradients of source models. The y-axis shows the width of the source models, while the x-axis shows the width of the target models. The color of each entry represents the attack success rate, with darker colors indicating higher success rates.

> üîº This figure compares three different black-box attack strategies on various model architectures (CNNs and ResNets) using CIFAR-10 datasets. The attacks target models of different capacities (width).  The attack strategies are: (1) using the gradient from the largest trained model (red), (2) using gradients from models of the same capacity as the target model (green), and (3) using the mean gradient direction across models of different capacities (blue). The y-axis represents the attack success rate, and the x-axis represents the capacity of the target model. The results show that using the mean gradient direction consistently outperforms the other two attack strategies, highlighting its effectiveness in the black-box setting.

> üîº This table presents the average Wasserstein distances between the individual similarity distributions of pairs of models within the same family.  The Wasserstein distance measures the dissimilarity between the distributions of cosine similarities across the testing set for each model.  The table shows these distances for different model families (CNNSmall, CNNLarge, ResNetSmall, ResNetLarge) and varying model capacities (k).  Larger distances suggest greater dissimilarity between the models' salience. The results highlight that deeper models (e.g., ResNet) exhibit larger dissimilarities compared to shallower models (e.g., CNN). This observation is attributed to the increased difficulty in training deeper models.

Note that here the baseline should be 2 since the cosine similarity lies in [-1,1]. It is observed that deeper models usually have larger distances (CS vs. CL, RS vs. RL). We deduce that this is because of the training for deeper models is more difficult.
