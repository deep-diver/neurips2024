The Wasserstein distance measures the dissimilarity between the distributions of cosine similarities across the testing set for each model.  The table shows these distances for different model families (CNNSmall, CNNLarge, ResNetSmall, ResNetLarge) and varying model capacities (k).  Larger distances suggest greater dissimilarity between the models' salience. The results highlight that deeper models (e.g., ResNet) exhibit larger dissimilarities compared to shallower models (e.g., CNN).
