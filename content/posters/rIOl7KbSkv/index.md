### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) generate high-quality text, raising concerns about misuse. Watermarking, embedding hidden information to verify source, is a solution, but existing methods have flaws.  Common designs prioritize robustness, multiple keys, and public detection APIs, creating vulnerabilities. 

This paper rigorously tests several simple attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. It demonstrates significant trade-offs between robustness, utility, and usability. The research proposes new attack strategies and offers guidelines and defenses to improve the security and usability of LLM watermarking in practice.  These include carefully considering the implications of design choices to minimize the risks of both watermark removal and spoofing attacks.

> This figure demonstrates the effectiveness of piggyback spoofing attacks against robust watermarks.  The left panel (a) shows that inserting toxic words into watermarked text doesn't prevent the watermark from being detected, making the output harmful.  The right panel (b) shows that even generating fluent, inaccurate content using GPT4 maintains watermark detection, illustrating the vulnerability of robustness to spoofing.

> This table presents examples of text generated by the LLAMA-2-7B language model, both with and without a watermark. It showcases three different attack scenarios: a piggyback spoofing attack (where incorrect content is generated but still appears watermarked), and two watermark removal attacks (one exploiting multiple keys, and another exploiting a public detection API).  The table highlights the Z-score (detection confidence) and perplexity (text quality) for each example, demonstrating how attacks can compromise the effectiveness of watermarking.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM watermark tradeoffs
The core of LLM watermarking hinges on embedding information within AI-generated text to verify its origin.  However, the paper reveals a crucial "no free lunch" aspect: design choices enhancing one desirable property (like **robustness against removal**) often inadvertently compromise others.  For example, robust watermarks, while resistant to removal, become vulnerable to **piggyback attacks**, where malicious actors subtly alter the text to embed harmful content while maintaining the watermark's signature. Similarly, using multiple keys to prevent watermark theft can backfire, increasing susceptibility to attacks that exploit the system's inherent redundancies for removal.  The research highlights the critical need to carefully balance these trade-offs, suggesting a layered approach incorporating anomaly detection and access control to mitigate risks, instead of relying solely on a single watermarking strategy.

#### Robustness attacks
Robustness attacks against LLMs exploit the inherent trade-off between watermark robustness and utility.  **A robust watermark, while resistant to simple removal attempts, paradoxically becomes vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that subtly alter the text.** These alterations might introduce inaccuracies or toxicity without triggering watermark detection.  This highlights a critical design challenge: achieving robustness without sacrificing the integrity and usability of the watermarked content. **The attacks leverage the watermark's resilience to minor changes, introducing harmful modifications within the acceptable threshold.**  This necessitates a more nuanced approach to watermark design, moving beyond simple robustness metrics to include holistic evaluation methods considering the potential for adversarial manipulation and the wider implications for content reliability.

#### Key-based defenses
Key-based defenses against LLM watermarking attacks revolve around the management and protection of cryptographic keys used to embed watermarks.  **Robustness against watermark removal is a key goal**, but ironically, this can also make watermarks vulnerable to spoofing attacks where malicious content appears watermarked.  **Multiple keys enhance security against watermark theft**, but this complicates watermark removal attacks, creating a trade-off between robustness and ease of removal.  **Public detection APIs**, while convenient for verifying watermarks, offer attack vectors too.  A holistic strategy should therefore involve strong key management, perhaps combined with techniques like differential privacy applied to detection API outputs, to balance watermark robustness with overall system security.

#### API attack vectors
API attack vectors represent a crucial vulnerability in large language model (LLM) watermarking systems.  **Publicly accessible detection APIs**, intended to verify the AI-generated nature of text, inadvertently provide attackers with a powerful tool. By repeatedly querying the API with slightly modified versions of watermarked text, attackers can iteratively refine their modifications to either remove the watermark entirely or subtly insert harmful content while maintaining a high watermark confidence score.  This highlights a critical trade-off: the convenience of public verification comes at the cost of increased security risk.  **Robustness**, often a desirable characteristic of watermarks, becomes a double-edged sword.  While intended to prevent simple watermark removal, it paradoxically enables attackers to generate deceptively watermarked outputs, whether toxic or factually incorrect, with minimal effort.  **Defenses**, such as differential privacy techniques to add noise to API responses, are essential to mitigate these risks. The need for layered security, including query rate limiting and user authentication, is clear, showcasing the multifaceted challenges in balancing usability and security in LLM watermarking.

#### DP defense
The research explores a defense mechanism against spoofing attacks on watermark detection APIs using differential privacy (DP).  **DP adds noise to the detection scores**, making it difficult for attackers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated content. The study demonstrates that **DP effectively mitigates spoofing attacks with minimal impact on detection accuracy**, highlighting a key trade-off between security and utility.  A critical aspect is the use of a pseudorandom function (PRF) to generate the noise, ensuring that only those with the secret key can remove or reduce the noise. Although effective against spoofing, the DP defense shows limitations against watermark removal attacks, where the attacker's actions might appear random to the detection system.  This underscores the complex interplay between robustness, utility, and security in LLM watermarking design and highlights the need for a multi-layered defense approach.

> This figure shows the results of spoofing attacks based on watermark stealing and watermark removal attacks using different numbers of watermark keys.  The x-axis represents the number of keys used. The y-axis shows three metrics: Z-score (confidence of watermark detection), attack success rate (ASR, percentage of successful attacks), and perplexity (PPL, measuring text quality).  The figure demonstrates a trade-off: increasing the number of keys improves resistance to watermark stealing (lower ASR in the spoofing attack) but makes the watermark more vulnerable to removal attacks (higher ASR in the removal attacks and lower Z-score). The perplexity generally improves with more keys.

The x-axis represents the detection z-score (z) of the original watermarked text, and the y-axis represents the ratio of the number of inserted tokens (s) to the length of the original sentence (l). The green points show data points where the condition in Theorem 1 holds true, while red points indicate where it does not. The blue line represents the theoretical bound from Theorem 1.  The percentage of data points that satisfy the theorem (85.78%) and those that do not (14.22%) are shown.

> This figure shows the results of two different piggyback spoofing attacks on robust watermarks. The first attack involves inserting toxic tokens into the watermarked text, while the second involves using GPT-4 to modify the text in a way that makes it inaccurate but still fluent.  Both attacks demonstrate the vulnerability of robust watermarks to spoofing attacks, even when the watermark itself remains undetectable.  The figure highlights a key trade-off in watermarking design: Robustness to editing attacks can make the system more vulnerable to spoofing.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/rIOl7KbSkv/figures_18_2.jpg)

The second attack uses GPT-4 to modify the watermarked text to make it inaccurate while maintaining fluency. The results show that this is also possible, with a high success rate. These findings highlight the inherent vulnerability of robust watermarks to spoofing attacks, a critical design trade-off.

> This figure shows the results of a watermark stealing attack on the KGW watermark using the LLAMA-2-7B language model with three keys.  The x-axis represents the number of tokens (in millions) obtained by the attacker, and the y-axis shows both the Z-score (a measure of watermark confidence) and the attack success rate (ASR). The red dashed line indicates the detection threshold with a false positive rate (FPR) of 1e-3.  As the number of tokens obtained by the attacker increases, the attack success rate also increases, eventually exceeding the detection threshold. This demonstrates the vulnerability of the system to watermark stealing attacks even with multiple keys, if the attacker can obtain a sufficient number of watermarked tokens.

The x-axis represents the number of watermark keys (n) used, ranging from 1 to 17.  The y-axis displays three key metrics: Z-score (reflecting watermark detection confidence), attack success rate (ASR), and perplexity (PPL, indicating text quality).  The plots demonstrate a trade-off: increasing the number of keys improves resistance to watermark stealing (lower ASR in the spoofing attack) but simultaneously increases vulnerability to watermark removal attacks (higher ASR in the watermark removal attack and slightly higher PPL).

Higher z-scores indicate a higher confidence in the watermark's presence, while lower perplexity scores suggest better sentence quality. The success rate of the attacks is determined using a false positive rate (FPR) threshold of 1e-3.  The figure demonstrates the trade-off between watermark robustness and vulnerability to attacks when employing multiple keys.

> This figure demonstrates the trade-off between watermark stealing resistance and watermark removal vulnerability when using multiple watermark keys.  The left panel shows that increasing the number of keys (n) significantly reduces the success rate of watermark stealing attacks. However, the middle panel reveals that increasing the number of keys makes the system increasingly vulnerable to watermark removal attacks, as the detection scores are drastically reduced. The right panel shows the perplexity of the generated text, indicating that using more keys generally leads to better sentence quality. This highlights a crucial design challenge:  enhancing security against one type of attack can unintentionally increase vulnerability to another.

> This figure presents the results of a piggyback spoofing attack using toxic token insertion on the OPT-1.3B language model.  It shows the maximum portion of toxic tokens that can be inserted into watermarked content without changing the watermark detection result.  The figure also shows the confidence scores from OpenAI's moderation model in identifying the content as violating its usage policy due to the inserted toxic tokens. The results demonstrate that a significant number of toxic tokens can be inserted into content generated by all the robust watermarking schemes, with a median portion higher than 20%.  The median confidence score for content flagged as violating OpenAI's policy is higher than 0.8 across all watermarking schemes, compared to an average confidence score of around 0.01 before the attack.
