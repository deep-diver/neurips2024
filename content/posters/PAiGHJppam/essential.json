Existing methods struggle to find precise solutions due to the inherent complexity of these problems. This often results in settling for approximate solutions, but even these are difficult to obtain using standard first-order methods. \nThis paper addresses this by proposing a novel approach, FC-BiO (Functionally Constrained Bilevel Optimizer). FC-BiO cleverly transforms the bilevel problem into a functionally constrained one. By doing so, the authors develop methods capable of finding near-optimal solutions.  This is a significant contribution because it provides both theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms that are demonstrably better than previously available methods. The algorithm's effectiveness is validated through numerical experiments demonstrating its superior performance on benchmark problems.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "PAiGHJppam/podcast.wav"}
