The x-axis represents the computation time, and the y-axis shows the difference between the current objective values and the optimal value for both the upper-level function (f(x) - f*) and the lower-level function (g(x) - g*). The plot demonstrates how quickly each algorithm converges towards the optimal solution.", "section": "6 Numerical experiments"}, {"figure_path": "PAiGHJppam/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The performance of Algorithm 1 compared with other methods in Problem (12)", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed Functionally Constrained Bilevel Optimizer (FC-BiO) algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods for solving a specific bilevel optimization problem (Problem 12).
