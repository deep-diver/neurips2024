It begins with the input data matrix, which is then converted into a bipartite graph. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to generate node embeddings for the samples and features. These embeddings are further processed by the Feature Correlation Unit (FCU) and Sample Correlation Unit (SCU), which explicitly model feature-wise and sample-wise correlations, respectively.  Finally, a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) combines the outputs from FCU and SCU to predict the missing feature values.
