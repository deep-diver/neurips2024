However, some model editing methods, such as the GRACE [38], introduce additional modules to the edited models, or employ auxiliary models, like the SERAC [18], to handle queries involving updated knowledge. These modifications to the model architecture prevent the edited models from being directly deployed using these aforementioned serving frameworks, significantly limiting the practical adoption of editing methods. Furthermore, as the number of edits on LLM increases, for methods that introduce additional, the memory consumption for storing and the time cost for retrieval become increasingly prohibitive. This significantly impacts the throughput and inference latency during deployment and serving. For further details on these effects, please refer to Appendix D.2.

", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Model Editing. Model editing aims to precisely modify knowledge within a language model with fine grain. Existing methods can be divided into 3 different categories: Retrieval-based, Extraparameters-based, and Locate-then-edit-based methods. Early works on editing focused on updating individual neurons using constrained fine-tuning [49; 50; 51], or hypernetworks [52]. A related line of work has focused on storing updates in an external memory [53]. Inspired by the linear associative memory property of FFN in transformers [54] and success with the approach in convolutional models [55], recent Locate-then-edit style works have proposed to edit MLP weights directly [17; 20; 37]. In the encyclopedic factual domain, work [17] proposed to edit single facts by ftiting a Rank One Model Edit (ROME) to the parameters of an MLP layer and showed that it outperformed prior methods. While [56] concentrates on editing commonsense knowledge. Work [57] focuses on editing the encoder-decoder model. Work [12; 14; 19] make a comprehensive survey in model editing. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Pitfalls of Model Editing. Since the concept of model editing was introduced, there exist few works to discuss the drawbacks of existing methods. In [23], two kinds of pitfalls are discovered, named knowledge conflict and knowledge distortion. MEMIT-CSK [56] finds common sense knowledge can also be localized in FFN of LLM layers and both subject, object, and relation play important roles in recalling memory, but they only focus on classification tasks. [58] focus on mitigating the reversal curse in model editing for LLM. Some recent works [22; 59] try to evaluate the multi-hop reasoning of updated knowledge. Work [27; 21] tries to assess the underly impact caused by editing. What\u2019s more, some works [60; 61; 62; 63] discuss the knowledge forgetting during fine-tuning. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Evaluation of LLM. Evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs [3; 4; 31; 30; 64; 32; 33] involves a diverse array of tests, where models are assessed across various tasks, showcasing their capabilities. Among the benchmarks employed, Bigbench [65; 29], MMLU [28], and HELM [66] are notable. These benchmarks utilize a range of automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEURT [67] and others requiring meticulous annotation to ensure data quality for downstream applications [68; 69; 70]. Typically, these evaluations emphasize accuracy across multiple choices, which serves as the primary metric [71; 72]. Foundation models, often tested across broad linguistic tasks\u2014both generative and multiple-choice\u2014are analyzed to ensure rigorous assessment standards [73; 28; 74; 65]. These methods, however, may focus on the accuracy within confined options and might not effectively capture the nuances of more open-ended, practical applications where models generate free-form text. Moreover, assessing the safety of LLMs is essential. Safety evaluations concentrate on three key areas: truthfulness [43], toxicity [44], and bias [75].

We employed various editing methods to modify multiple models, followed by evaluations across different benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that existing editing methods can preserve the general capabilities of the model within a limited number of edits, not exceeding a few dozen. When the number of edits is sufficiently large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model can be disrupted or even completely damaged. Additionally, we systematically investigated potential factors that might impact the performance of models post-editing and their potential effects on the model\u2019s basic capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that after only a few dozen edits, the safety of the model is compromised, including those models that have been aligned. Furthermore, we discuss the side effects, operational efficiency issues, and potential impacts brought by editing operations. We conclude that most of existing editing methods are only suitable for scenarios with no more than a few dozen updates. We are looking forward to future research addressing these challenges.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
