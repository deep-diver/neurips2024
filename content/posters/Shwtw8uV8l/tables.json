The metrics used are PSNR and SSIM, which assess the quality of the transmission layer separation.  The table highlights the best-performing model for each dataset and metric, indicating the superior performance of the proposed 'Ours' method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

The results illustrate the contribution of each component to the overall performance.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}]
