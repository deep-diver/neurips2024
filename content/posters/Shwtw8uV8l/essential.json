Existing dual-stream methods struggle with the intricate interaction between these layers and limited receptive fields, leading to unsatisfactory separation results. \nThe proposed Dual-Stream Interactive Transformer (DSIT) directly addresses these limitations. DSIT employs a novel dual-attention interaction mechanism to effectively capture both intra- and inter-layer feature correlations, solving the problem of limited receptive fields. Furthermore, it leverages pre-trained transformer embeddings, improving the model's understanding of complex scenes and mitigating the ill-posed nature of the task. The extensive experimental results showcase DSIT's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and image quality, especially in complex scenarios.", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "Shwtw8uV8l/podcast.wav"}
