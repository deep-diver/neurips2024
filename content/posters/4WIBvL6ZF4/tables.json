The comparison is based on four metrics: the estimated best subgroup treatment effect, its 95% confidence interval, the square root of N-scaled bias, and the standard deviation.  The results show that the proposed method achieves a smaller standard deviation and \u221aN-scaled bias, indicating higher efficiency and less bias, while maintaining comparable treatment effect estimates.", "section": "6 Synthetic real data study"}, {"figure_path": "4WIBvL6ZF4/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Notation table for the proposed dynamic subgroup identification strategy with CARA design.", "description": "This table lists the notations used in the paper, categorized by symbols and descriptions. It includes symbols for experiment parameters (number of stages, number of participants, etc.), participant-level data (treatment assignment, observed outcome, covariates), subgroup-level data (sample size, proportions, treatment effects), and algorithm-specific variables (tie sets, estimated treatment effects).

The variations differ in the methods used for selecting hyperparameters and merging subgroups.
