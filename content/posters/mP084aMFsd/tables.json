The execution time is reported in seconds, and the algorithms include S\u00b2GCSL (the proposed method), TNPAR, ADM4, CAUSE, PCMCI, MLE_SGL, and ACD. The table shows how the execution time scales with the size of the problem, measured by the number of event types (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 100). The algorithm with the lowest execution time for each problem size is highlighted in bold.  A '-' indicates that an algorithm did not complete execution within one hour.", "section": "4.2.2 Results on Synthetic Data"}, {"figure_path": "mP084aMFsd/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performances of different methods on metropolitan telecommunication network alarm data. The algorithm perform best under each metric is highlighted in bold.", "description": "This table presents the performance comparison of various algorithms on a real-world metropolitan telecommunication network alarm dataset.  The algorithms are evaluated based on four metrics: F1 Score (higher is better), Structural Hamming Distance (SHD, lower is better), Structural Intervention Distance (SID, lower is better), and Execution Time (ET, lower is better). The table shows that S\u00b2GCSL outperforms other methods across these metrics.  The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of S\u00b2GCSL in real-world applications.", "section": "4.3 Real-World Experiments"}]
