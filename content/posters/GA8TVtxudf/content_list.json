MRDE estimates normalized depths or disparities by factoring out the scale. Its scale-invariant nature enables largescale training on diverse datasets with distinct camera parameters, while at the cost of bringing in scale ambiguity. In contrast, MMDE predicts absolute depths in meters. Due to the unbounded output range and the intertwined relationship between depths and focal lengths, early works of this line often cannot perform well on test data with arbitrary scene scales or camera intrinsics. To compensate for this, recent progress resorts to injecting scene information [12] or camera information [10, 11, 14] into the model. The former attempt learns scene-specific scale priors, modeled with metric heads for indoor or outdoor scenes, and uses either to transform relative depths into metric depths in a heuristic manner. The latter aims to disambiguate scale prediction with extra camera inputs. However, as shown in Fig. 2, both lines of work require notably larger amounts of labeled training data to achieve similar mean absolute relative errors (AbsRel) as their MRDE counterparts.

Given that MMDE can be viewed as the composition of MRDE and metric scale recovery, we posit the latter might be the primary factor. MMDE models might face challenges in inferring scene scales without sufficient exposure to similar annotated scenes during training, which is not a problem for scaleinvariant MRDE. To validate our assumption, we evaluate a scale-related metric $(\\delta_{1})$ of an MMDE model, ZoeDepth [12], on randomly sampled test images. Meanwhile, we calculate the maximum cosine similarity between each test sample and all training samples with metric annotations using DINOv2 [18]. Our findings from Fig. 3 indicate a clear trend: higher similarity to training samples positively correlates with better performance, and vice versa. This reflects a scene dependency of MMDE models, likely arising from their supervised training paradigm. In other words, they tend to learn an implicit mapping between training scenes and metric scales from <image, metric annotation> pairs. As a result, adapting to novel scenes may require extra domain-specific fine-tuning. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address this dependency for better generalization capabilities, we propose to avoid scene-dependent supervised learning, while leveraging a scene-independent metric scale prior. Our insights are twofold. First, we observe generative painting models can paint objects of proper sizes based on partial contexts, indicating an underlying sense of scales. Additionally, humans can be potentially utilized as relatively universal landmarks, since humans exhibit sizes that are generally more comparable to each other than other common in-the-wild objects, e.g., tables, trees, and cars. To explicitly derive a metric scale prior from generative painting models, we notice state-of-the-art human mesh recovery (HMR) approaches [19\u201321] can robustly estimate human dimensions for in-the-wild images. Also, they typically output SMPL [22, 23] representations with shape space defined in meters. While the input image does not guarantee to include humans, we speculate an off-the-shelf image painting model can paint proportionate humans in the scene, which provides an opportunity to retrieve metric-scale information for the original input by measuring painted humans. Hence, we introduce a test-time adaptation pipeline, Metric from Human (MfH), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Concretely, it 1) paints humans with partial contexts of the input image, 2) estimates human dimensions from the painted image, and 3) propagates the metric-scale information from humans to the contexts for MMDE. In this way, we can distill the metric scale prior hidden inside the generative painting model, unleashing its power to comprehend diverse scenes.

Early approaches focused on supervised methods that predict either monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) [16, 24\u201327, 15] or monocular relative depth estimation (MRDE) [27\u201329, 9]. Despite remarkable progress in network architectures [30\u201333, 16, 13, 34, 15], existing MMDE methods often confine their training and testing to specific domains, leading to performance degradation under minor domain shifts and poor generalization to unseen environments. In contrast, relative depth models have demonstrated better generalization by leveraging scale-invariant losses [9, 35, 36] on diverse datasets. However, these models cannot recover metric scales, which are crucial for downstream applications. Recent works explored generalizable MMDE models [12, 11, 14, 10] for diverse domains, leveraging camera awareness through explicit incorporation of intrinsics [37, 11] or normalization based on camera properties [38, 17, 14]. They often require fine-tuning to adjust to specific domains [11, 10]. Several recent studies explore zero-shot MMDE, using language as a prior to ground predictions to metric scale [39\u201341]. However, their hand-crafted depth captions to connect the language and metric worlds are often too coarse to capture accurate depths. Our MfH instead distills metric scale priors from generative painting models, enhancing both the generalization capability and pixel-wise precision of zero-shot MMDE models without relying on metric depth annotations.

In contrast, feed-forward methods [44\u201349] directly regress the body shape and pose parameters from a single image using deep learning techniques. Among them, HMR 2.0 [20] is a fully transformer-based approach for recovering 3D human meshes from single images. We adopt it as our HMR model for estimating in-the-wild human structures and poses.

Our model achieves performance on par with, and sometimes superior to, these approaches, especially on ETH3D [54], which contains both indoor and outdoor scenes. It is noteworthy that these prior arts can do well on certain datasets while failing on others. For instance, ZeroDepth [11] performs well on iBims-1 but struggles to estimate depths on DIODE (Indoor) and ETH3D accurately. Similarly, UniDepth-V [10] shows promising results on DIODE (Indoor) while underperforming on the other two benchmarks. These findings signify the scene-dependent nature of existing fully supervised methods, which may result in degraded performance on unseen scenes. In contrast, our model demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization capabilities across diverse scenes.

We also ensure consistency by optimizing predictions in the same space as the target, i.e., the depth space for depth targets and the inverted depth space for disparity targets. Overall, we observe using Depth Anything as our MRDE model and painted disparities as our optimization target shows the best performance. Comparing the first two rows and the last two rows for each MRDE model, we see that optimizations in the disparity space yield superior results for ZoeDepth [12] and Depth Anything [2], whereas optimizations in the depth space prove more effective for Marigold [1]. A similar scenario can also be found in the last two rows of each MRDE model. This variation in performance may stem from the difference in their output spaces. To be concrete, ZoeDepth and Depth Anything produce inverted depths, while Marigold outputs depths. Optimizing in the original output space can provide better numerical stability, leading to better optimization results.

We view the results from bottom to top. First, optimizing all parameters $(7^{\\mathrm{th}}-8^{\\mathrm{th}}$ rows) yields the lowest error. When we fix the scaling factor to 1 while keeping the other parameters optimizable $(5^{\\mathrm{th}}{-}6^{\\mathrm{th}}$ rows), the model has the highest error and cannot be aligned with the ground truth. Instead, when using optimizable scales $(3^{\\mathrm{rd}}{-}4^{\\mathrm{th}}$ rows) in the metric head, the model can better capture depths, which indicates an accurate scene scale is crucial in MMDE. Removing the alignment between the input image MRDE and painted image MRDEs $\\mathrm{[^{\\,st}{-}}2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$ rows) results in sub-optimal predictions since the same contents on two different images might result in distinct MRDE predictions. The performance difference of using different optimization parameters while the true disparity as the target ( $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ vs. $5^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vs. $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ row) shows it is possible to apply an affine transformation upon MRDE to achieve good MMDE predictions, if with accurate scale and translation recovered.

Notably, employing an $l_{1}$ loss ( $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ row) yields inferior performance compared to losses incorporating an $l_{2}$ term $(2^{\\mathrm{nd}}{-}4^{\\mathrm{ih}}$ rows). This is probably because our generate-and-estimate process can introduce noises to a certain degree. Since the $l_{1}$ loss treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude, it can be more sensitive to small perturbations. An $l_{2}$ term that focuses more on large errors thus provides better robustness. Furthermore, a comparison between the $2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$ and the last two rows shows optimizing in the log space brings better performance, which is expected since logarithmic transformation tends to mitigate the impact of outliers. This also accords with the general experience in training depth models using ground truth annotations, suggesting that the depths of generated humans might also be normally distributed in the log space, akin to real-world scenarios. From the last two rows, we see optimizing with the $\\mathrm{MSE_{\\mathrm{log}}}$ loss or the $\\mathrm{SI_{log}}$ loss is not discrepant by much.

Our analysis reveals a clear linear association between the per-sample runtime and the number of painted images, as depicted in the time plot. The $\\delta_{1}$ and RMSE plots show an upward trend in MMDE performance with the increment in painting numbers, albeit sublinearly.

Our MfH works based on the assumption that humans can exist in the scene so that it is possible to paint a human upon the input image. While this holds for most usages of MMDE, it might not be ideal for some cases, e.g., close-up scenes. This opens up new challenges, such as incorporating objects other than humans into the generate-and-estimate pipeline as metric landmarks. Another assumption is the MRDE predictions align with true depths up to affine. Despite the training objectives of MRDE being linearly transformed true depths, the MRDE predictions can contain noises, making the linear metric head hard to capture accurate metric depths. Whether other parameterizations of the metric head can tackle this remains an open question. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Broader impacts.

As demonstrated in Tab. 6, under the MRDE setting, MMDE models all perform well on in-the-wild data. In contrast, under the MMDE setting, they degrade to various degrees. These results show that, with fully supervised training, depth models are generally more generalizable under the MRDE setting than the MMDE setting. Since the MMDE task can be understood as a combination of MRDE and metric scale recovery, we believe the latter can be more difficult to conduct in the wild. Either implicitly or explicitly, conventional MMDE models predict metric scales in a discriminative manner, conditioned on the input image. With the fully supervised training scheme, they may tend to rely on the relation between training scenes and the testing scene to infer the metric scale. If the testing scene is unseen during training, it can be difficult to infer a scene scale. The MRDE task is relatively easier since it can potentially utilize more local visual clues for lower-level predictions. While establishing a global correspondence between training scenes and the testing scene might be challenging, the model can still identify local correspondences to predict relationships within different parts of a scene.

They confirm that our MfH can robustly recover metric depths, as it consistently achieves low errors across various types of shots.

This interpretation aligns well with standing humans, which are typically generated in level-angle images. Moreover, we do not observe significant degradation with varying the distance of shots.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
