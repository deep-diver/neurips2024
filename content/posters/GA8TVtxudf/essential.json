This scene dependency limits their practical applicability and requires extensive labeled data for training.  The problem is further complicated by the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular relative depth estimation (MRDE), a related task that estimates relative depths. \nTo tackle these issues, the paper introduces Metric from Human (MfH). MfH cleverly uses humans as universal landmarks, leveraging generative painting models to generate humans within the input image. It then employs human mesh recovery (HMR) to extract human dimensions, which are used to estimate a scene-independent metric scale prior. This approach bridges generalizable MRDE to zero-shot MMDE without requiring any metric depth annotation during training. Experimental results show that MfH significantly outperforms other MMDE methods in zero-shot settings, demonstrating its superior generalization ability and highlighting the potential of integrating generative models and human priors for robust depth estimation.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "GA8TVtxudf/podcast.wav"}
