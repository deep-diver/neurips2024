To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HONESET, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM\u2019s capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the $65.3\\%$ enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable $124.7\\%$ improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the $\\mathrm{H^{2}}$ (honest and helpful) assessment.

Furthermore, several honest dimensions like sycophancy [13] of LLMs have been excluded in existing definitions of honesty. To mitigate this gap, we first refine and extend the definition of honesty in LLMs based on the definition proposed by Askell et al. [14], as the ability to recognize their limitations, remain objective without pandering, and thereby avoid spreading misinformation or inducing hallucinations.

This calibration helps determine the trust users should have in the LLMs\u2019 responses. Numerous studies have concentrated on enhancing the honesty of LLMs, with a primary focus on augmenting their calibration concerning outputs\u2014for instance, their ability to refuse to respond when uncertain [12, 73].
