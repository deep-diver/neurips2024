### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive mathematical abilities, but how they compute basic arithmetic like addition remains unclear.  This paper investigates how pre-trained LLMs perform this seemingly simple task. Previous research often focuses on smaller, simpler models or models trained from scratch, providing limited insight into the mechanisms of complex pre-trained LLMs. This paper addresses the limitations by directly analyzing a pre-trained, state-of-the-art LLM and its internal workings.

This study reveals that pre-trained LLMs surprisingly employ Fourier features to perform addition.  Specifically, it discovers that Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) primarily approximate the magnitude of the answer, leveraging low-frequency features, while attention mechanisms focus on modular addition (e.g., checking if the result is even or odd), using high-frequency features.  Importantly, the study demonstrates that pre-training is essential for this mechanism; randomly initialized models struggle to learn this method.  The research provides a detailed, mechanistic explanation, offering a significant contribution to our understanding of LLM capabilities.

### In-depth insights


#### Fourier Feature Use
The research paper reveals the intriguing use of Fourier features by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to perform addition.  **LLMs don't simply memorize answers; they employ a layered computational process.**  Initially, they approximate the answer's magnitude using low-frequency Fourier components, primarily through MLP layers. Subsequently, attention layers refine this approximation by employing high-frequency components to perform modular arithmetic (e.g., determining even/odd). This dual approach, leveraging complementary strengths of MLPs and attention mechanisms, allows for precise calculation.  **Crucially, pre-training is essential**, as models trained from scratch lack this capability and only exploit low-frequency features. The pre-trained token embeddings appear to be the key source of inductive bias that enables this sophisticated computational strategy.  The analysis is supported by ablations demonstrating that removing low-frequency components from attention mechanisms or high-frequency components from MLPs significantly impacts accuracy, confirming their distinct roles in the process.  **This work sheds light on the internal workings of LLMs, revealing sophisticated mechanisms previously unknown.** The findings open up new avenues for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs by focusing on the development of suitable pre-trained representations.

#### Pre-trained LLM Adds
The heading 'Pre-trained LLM Adds' suggests a focus on how large language models (LLMs), after pre-training, perform the fundamental arithmetic operation of addition.  A deeper exploration would likely investigate the **internal mechanisms** employed by these models, potentially revealing whether they utilize learned patterns, symbolic reasoning, or a hybrid approach.  The research could explore whether the models' ability to add stems from **memorization** during pre-training or if it represents a more fundamental understanding of numerical relationships.  A key aspect would be determining whether the model performs addition directly or uses an indirect method involving intermediate steps, such as converting numbers to text representations, performing operations on the textual form, and then converting the result back to a numerical value.   **Investigating the model's reliance on specific architectural components**, like attention mechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, to perform different aspects of addition would provide crucial insights into the underlying algorithmic procedures involved.  Finally, understanding how the **pre-training data influences the model's approach to addition** is critical. Determining whether the addition capabilities are a byproduct of the pre-training process or are specifically learned through focused fine-tuning would be essential.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes or deactivates components of a model to assess their individual contributions and understand the model's behavior.  In the context of this research paper, an ablation study might involve selectively removing or disabling specific layers (e.g., MLP or attention layers), frequency components (low or high), or pre-trained components (like token embeddings) to determine their impact on the model's ability to perform addition accurately.  **The results would reveal the relative importance of these components**, possibly showing that certain layers are crucial for approximation while others handle modular addition, and that pre-trained embeddings are essential for enabling the model to exploit Fourier features.  **By observing performance drops after removing specific components**, researchers can pinpoint which parts of the model are essential for the task and gain insight into the internal mechanisms.  Such analysis is crucial for confirming that the observed Fourier features are not merely artifacts but are truly causal factors underlying the model's mathematical capabilities.  **The study likely would show interactions between different model components and the importance of pre-training** in providing necessary inductive biases.

#### Pre-training Effects
The paper's analysis of pre-training effects reveals its crucial role in enabling LLMs to effectively compute addition using Fourier features.  **Models trained from scratch, lacking the inductive bias provided by pre-training, fail to utilize Fourier features and exhibit significantly lower accuracy.** This highlights the importance of pre-trained token embeddings, which introduce the necessary Fourier components into the model's representation of numbers.  **These pre-trained embeddings act as a crucial source of inductive bias,** guiding the network towards learning the efficient computational mechanisms observed in the fine-tuned models.  The study demonstrates that even when freezing the pre-trained embeddings, models initialized randomly can still achieve high accuracy when trained on an addition task, emphasizing the critical role of pre-trained representations in unlocking the computational capabilities of Transformers.

#### Future Work
Future research could explore the **generalizability of Fourier feature utilization** across diverse mathematical tasks and LLM architectures.  Investigating whether similar mechanisms are employed for more complex mathematical operations beyond addition and multiplication would be valuable.  A key area to examine is the **role of model size and training data** in shaping the emergence of Fourier features.  Does the prevalence of Fourier features increase with model scale, and how does the nature of the training data influence the representation? Furthermore, exploring **alternative training methods** that explicitly encourage the learning of Fourier features, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate solutions for algorithmic tasks, represents a significant area of potential advancement. Finally, understanding the **interaction between Fourier features and other mechanisms** within LLMs used for mathematical reasoning would enhance our understanding of the overall computational process.

The plots show that all four models exhibit outlier components with periods around 2, 2.5, 5, and 10.
