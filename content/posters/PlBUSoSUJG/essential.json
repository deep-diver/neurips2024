Existing solutions, like baseline subtraction and variance reduction techniques, offer limited improvements.  The high variance stems from the dependence of gradient calculations on the entire trajectory, making sample efficiency a major challenge.  Accurate forward models are often unavailable, increasing the complexity of addressing the variance issue.\nThis paper presents SoftTreeMax, a novel method that enhances softmax with multi-step discounted cumulative rewards and future state logits.  Theoretically, it shows that variance decays exponentially with planning horizon.  Practical implementation using a parallel GPU simulator demonstrates that SoftTreeMax reduces gradient variance by three orders of magnitude in Atari games, resulting in better sample complexity and performance than distributed PPO.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PlBUSoSUJG/podcast.wav"}
