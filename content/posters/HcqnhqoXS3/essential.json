Multi-task offline RL further aims to train a single agent capable of handling various tasks. However, existing multi-task offline RL methods struggle with generalization to entirely new, unseen tasks due to difficulties in managing conflicting gradients and extracting useful cross-task knowledge.  This is a significant limitation for real-world application, as these methods do not adapt well to unexpected scenarios. \nThe proposed Decomposed Prompt Decision Transformer (DPDT) tackles this challenge. DPDT uses a two-stage approach: In the first stage (decomposed prompt tuning), it efficiently learns a general prompt and task-specific prompts by leveraging pre-trained language models. The second stage (test-time adaptation) further tunes these prompts using test data. **The results demonstrate that DPDT significantly outperforms other approaches in zero-shot and few-shot generalization scenarios**, showcasing its effectiveness in multi-task offline RL and its potential to enhance the robustness of RL algorithms in real-world settings.", "affiliation": "Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HcqnhqoXS3/podcast.wav"}
