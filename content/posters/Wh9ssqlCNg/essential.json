Existing acceleration methods offer limited improvements and aren't tailored for ViTs' unique structure.  This poses a significant challenge for researchers seeking to leverage the power of ViTs in various domains.\nThis research introduces a novel acceleration framework to tackle this computational challenge. It employs sequence compression strategies like randomized token dropout and flexible patch scaling, reducing the cost of gradient estimation and accelerating convergence. A novel procedure identifies an optimal acceleration schedule, ensuring efficient training without sacrificing accuracy.  The approach achieves substantial speed-ups (4x for MoCo, 3.3x for SimCLR, and 2.5x for DINO) on ImageNet.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Wh9ssqlCNg/podcast.wav"}
