[{"figure_path": "d226uyWYUo/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Left shows a 3rd-order tensor. Middle describes the corresponding mode-i fibers of the tensor. Fibers are the higher-order analogue of matrix rows and columns. A fiber is defined by fixing every index but one. Right describes the corresponding mode-i unfolding of the tensor. The mode-i unfolding of a tensor arranges the mode-i fibers to be the columns of the resulting matrix.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of tensor unfolding used in the paper.  The left panel shows a 3D tensor. The middle panel displays how the tensor can be represented by its mode-1, mode-2, and mode-3 fibers (i.e., vectors obtained by fixing all but one index). The right panel depicts how each set of fibers is transformed into a matrix through mode-1, mode-2, and mode-3 unfoldings. This unfolding operation is crucial for applying matrix-based techniques to tensor analysis within the framework of the proposed method.", "section": "3 Methods"}]
