Existing methods often struggle with generalization across diverse datasets due to dataset-specific biases.  This limits practical utility in downstream applications requiring accurate spatial information.\nThis paper introduces RSA, a method that leverages language descriptions of scenes to transform relative depth maps into metric depth. RSA takes as input a text caption describing the objects present in an image and outputs parameters for a linear transformation applied to the relative depth map.  Evaluated on several datasets (NYUv2, KITTI, VOID), RSA shows improved accuracy and generalization, even outperforming common practices like linear fitting. This method holds significant promise for advancing monocular depth estimation in a variety of applications.", "affiliation": "Yale University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "vH7GcaDhAo/podcast.wav"}
