Consider the description above, one may observe that the scale of the 3D scene is closely related to the objects (and their typical sizes) populating it.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of the paper: using textual descriptions of a scene to infer the scale. Four example images are shown, each with a corresponding textual description and a label indicating the scale (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large).  The figure visually demonstrates the relationship between the objects present in a scene, their typical sizes, and the overall scale.", "section": "Abstract"}, {"figure_path": "vH7GcaDhAo/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview. We infer scale and shift from the language description of an image to transform the inverse relative depth from the depth model into metric depth (absolute depth in meters) prediction.", "description": "This figure illustrates the overall process of the RSA method.  It starts with an input image and its corresponding textual description.  The textual description is fed into the RSA model, which then outputs scale and shift parameters. These parameters, along with the inverse relative depth obtained from a pre-trained depth model processing the image, are used to compute the final metric depth prediction, which is then compared to the ground truth metric depth map for evaluation.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "vH7GcaDhAo/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Left: Predicted inverse scale w.r.t. median depth ground truth. Larger scenes tend to have larger median ground truth depth. For RSA trained on combined KITTI and NYUv2 with Depth Anything model, we fit an inverse proportional function for the predicted inverse scale in the test set (each point is an image), to verify that the scale is proportional to the median depth, that larger scenes are predicted with larger scales.", "description": "This figure shows a scatter plot and a fitted curve.  The scatter plot shows the relationship between the predicted inverse scale (y-axis) and the median value of depth ground truth (x-axis) for images in a test set.  The fitted curve, an inverse proportional function, demonstrates that the predicted inverse scale is inversely proportional to the median ground truth depth.  This confirms the model's ability to predict larger scales for larger scenes.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "vH7GcaDhAo/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Visualization of depth estimations on NYUv2.

For each image, it shows the original image, the depth map generated by RSA, the error map for RSA (showing the absolute relative error), the depth map generated by DPT, the error map for DPT, and finally, the ground truth depth map. The visualization demonstrates that while RSA and DPT produce visually similar depth maps, RSA significantly reduces the overall error compared to DPT.

The figure shows three example image pairs, their corresponding depth maps produced by RSA and DPT, and their absolute relative error maps.  The goal is to visually demonstrate how RSA, with its learned scale adjustment, improves upon DPT's depth estimations, particularly for scenes with large depth variations. Darker regions in the error maps indicate lower error. Zeros in the ground truth denote missing depth information.", "section": "Experiments"}]
