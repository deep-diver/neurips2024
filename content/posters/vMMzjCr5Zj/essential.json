Building a general-purpose pre-trained model for diverse time series data is challenging due to varying temporal scales, sampling rates, and noise levels. Existing models typically employ uniform segmentation, which isn't optimal for varied data characteristics. This limits their applicability and performance.\nTo tackle these issues, the researchers propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM). LPTM introduces an innovative adaptive segmentation module that automatically determines dataset-specific segmentation strategies during pre-training. This enables LPTM to achieve performance comparable to or better than specialized models while requiring significantly less data and training time.  The effectiveness of LPTM is validated through extensive experiments on various time-series tasks and datasets.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "vMMzjCr5Zj/podcast.wav"}
