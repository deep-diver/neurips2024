In this work, we introduce a canonicalization perspective that provides an essential and complete view of the design of frames. Canonicalization is a classic approach for attaining invariance by mapping inputs to their canonical forms. We show that there exists an inherent connection between frames and canonical forms.

Among these approaches, model-specific methods restrict every model component to respect data symmetries, which, however, often sacrifices expressive power [68, 39]. On the other hand, model-agnostic methods allow the use of arbitrary (non-invariant) base models, and ensure invariance or equivariance through averaging over group actions [40, 69, 45].

As an example, the WL hierarchies [65, 54, 72, 71, 73], alongside other complexity measures [46], have been the guideline for developing expressive graph neural networks [17, 39, 74].

In such cases, the automorphism group of an input could grow exponentially, consequently expanding the frame size exponentially as well. However, in theory, each graph has a single canonicalization, highlighting the potential for improvement in frames when dealing with invariance. Here we provide a concrete example concerning node features of graphs. As illustrated in Figure 1, each node in the graph possesses a unique node ID and a color representing its feature. Suppose we define the frame of this graph as the set of all permutations sorting the node features in the order of grey, blue, and green. For instance, one permutation might yield the sorted node $\\mathrm{IDs:~0,~1,~4,~6,~8,~3,~5,~2,~7.}$ Although the frame size for this graph is calculated as $5!\\times2!\\times2!=480$ , applying elements of the frame results in the same graph.

While one approach involves constructing a canonicalization first and then inducing its corresponding frame, a preferable option is to directly utilize canonicalization. The presence of input automorphism complicates the analysis and improvement of existing frames. An optimal canonicalization maintains a size of 1 for all inputs, irrespective of input symmetry. In contrast, the size of even optimal frames depends on input automorphism. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "3.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
