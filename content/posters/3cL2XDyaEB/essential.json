Existing methods often struggle to accurately classify samples from known classes and effectively reject OOD samples.  Many approaches try to estimate the uncertainty of predictions or the density of in-distribution features, which are shown to be fragile to various OOD examples.\n\nTo address these issues, EGonc, a novel energy-based generative open-set node classification method, is proposed.  EGonc generates substitute unknowns to mimic the distribution of real open-set samples, employs energy-based models as density estimators, and uses an additional energy logit to serve as an OOD indicator. The method offers strong theoretical properties guaranteeing a margin between IND and OOD detection scores and exhibits significant performance gains on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Shenzhen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3cL2XDyaEB/podcast.wav"}
