The x-axis represents the quantity of generated substitutes, which is expressed as a multiple of the average number of nodes in each known class. The y-axis shows the model's performance, measured by both accuracy and F1-score. The figure demonstrates that the performance of the EGonc model is stable across a wide range of substitute node quantities, indicating its robustness and efficiency.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "3cL2XDyaEB/figures/figures_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performance of EGonc under different quantity of substitutes.", "description": "The figure shows the performance of the EGonc model with different quantities of generated substitutes. The x-axis represents the quantity of generated substitutes, while the y-axis represents the model's performance (accuracy and F1-score) on different datasets (Cora, Citeseer, DBLP, Pubmed). The results suggest that the model's performance is relatively stable across a wide range of substitute quantities, indicating that a relatively small number of substitutes may be sufficient for achieving good performance.", "section": "4.3 Generalization Analysis"}]
