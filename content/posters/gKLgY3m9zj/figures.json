It details the relationships between the calibration dataset (Deal), input features (X), target variable (Y), model prediction (\u0176), prediction set (C(X)), and the event indicating whether the true label is contained within the prediction set (E). The nodes represent variables, with square nodes representing deterministic functions and round nodes representing stochastic functions.", "section": "2 Background"}, {"figure_path": "gKLgY3m9zj/figures/figures_34_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Expected [log |C(X)|]+ as a function of \u03b1.", "description": "This figure shows the empirical estimates of E([log|C(X)|]+) and the lower bounds derived from Fano's inequality and the model-based Fano inequality, plotted against different values of \u03b1 (the significance level).  The plots are generated from ResNet models trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.  The results illustrate the tightness of the model-based Fano lower bound for small values of \u03b1, suggesting that it can provide more precise estimates of the expected size of the prediction sets in conformal prediction.", "section": "G.3 Evaluating the lower bounds on the set size"}]
