IsoNet has no/late interaction between h(q) and h(c). IsoNet++ and GMN allow interaction between the representations of the query and corpus nodes. Under node pair interaction, the individual node embeddings h(q) are used for message passing directly, thereby exposing them only to their neighbors. In the corresponding combo step, nodes interact only with their respective partners, therefore missing out on information from the partners of its neighbors. However, under node pair partner interaction, the representation of a node is combined with that of its partner(s) first, using the intere block to obtain z(q) (12), which is used for message passing. Thus, when interacting with its neighbors, a node also gets information from the partners of its neighbors.", "description": "This figure illustrates the three different interaction modes between the query and corpus graphs in IsoNet, GMN, and IsoNet++. IsoNet uses no interaction, GMN uses node pair interaction, and IsoNet++ uses node pair partner interaction.
