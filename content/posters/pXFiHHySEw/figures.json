[{"figure_path": "pXFiHHySEw/figures/figures_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: BAS/Baseline, BAS/SCD, and BAS/PCD for the production and sales problem.", "description": "This figure presents a comparison of the performance of three different training methods (Baseline, SCD, and PCD) against a standard baseline method (BAS) for the production and sales problem. The x-axis represents the simulation number, and the y-axis shows the ratio of the post-hoc regret of BAS to the post-hoc regret achieved by each of the three methods. Points above the red dashed line (ratio = 1) indicate that a method outperforms BAS, while points below indicate that BAS performs better. Across all four scenarios (low-profit products with 4 quarters, low-profit products with 12 months, high-profit products with 4 quarters, and high-profit products with 12 months), SCD consistently outperforms BAS. PCD and Baseline also generally outperform BAS, but with less consistency than SCD. The results illustrate the advantage of the proposed training methods over the standard baseline.", "section": "5 Experimental Evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "pXFiHHySEw/figures/figures_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: BAS/Baseline, BAS/SCD, and BAS/PCD for the production and sales problem.", "description": "This figure displays the results of post-hoc regret ratios for four scenarios of the production and sales problem. The scenarios are defined by the combination of profit levels (low and high) and time horizons (4 and 12 quarters). Each simulation\u2019s ratio of post-hoc regret between BAS (standard regression methods) and the three proposed methods (Baseline, SCD, and PCD) is presented on the y-axis, while the x-axis represents the simulation number. The red dotted line indicates where the ratio equals 1, representing the cases where the proposed methods perform equally well with BAS. Points above the red line indicate that the proposed methods performed better than BAS, while points below indicate otherwise. This figure visually demonstrates the relative performance of the proposed approaches compared to BAS across multiple simulations and under various conditions.", "section": "5 Experimental Evaluation"}]
