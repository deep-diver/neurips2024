Existing methods often assume all parameters are revealed simultaneously, which is unrealistic.  This limitation significantly impacts the quality of solutions. This paper addresses this crucial issue.\nThe research proposes a novel framework called Multi-Stage Predict+Optimize, which models the sequential revelation of parameters.  It introduces three training algorithms specifically designed for neural networks used in predicting parameters and solving Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs).  The algorithms are compared against existing approaches on three benchmarks, demonstrating improved learning performance.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "pXFiHHySEw/podcast.wav"}
