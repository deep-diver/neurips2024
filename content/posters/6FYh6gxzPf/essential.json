Existing methods often treat grasp detection as secondary to 3D reconstruction or directly predict information gain, leading to suboptimal results and inefficiency. \nThis paper introduces ActiveNGF, an active grasp detection framework that incrementally models scene grasp distribution using a Neural Graspness Field.  **It addresses the issue of incomplete 3D information by incorporating a novel graspness inconsistency-guided policy for next-best-view selection.**  The proposed method significantly improves grasping performance and reduces time cost compared to previous methods, demonstrating superior trade-offs in real-world experiments.  **A neural graspness sampling method further enhances grasp pose detection accuracy.**", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Complex and Critical Software Environment", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "6FYh6gxzPf/podcast.wav"}
