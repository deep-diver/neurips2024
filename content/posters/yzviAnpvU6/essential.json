{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in zeroth-order optimization due to its novel approach of **reusing queries from previous iterations** to significantly reduce computational cost without compromising accuracy.  This is highly relevant given the resource-intensive nature of many real-world ZO applications and opens avenues for exploring more efficient gradient estimation strategies, impacting various fields like AI and AutoML. ", "summary": "ReLIZO boosts zeroth-order optimization by cleverly reusing past queries, drastically cutting computation costs while maintaining gradient estimation accuracy.", "takeaways": ["ReLIZO efficiently reuses past queries in zeroth-order optimization, reducing computational costs.", "It models gradient estimation as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP) for analytical solution.", "Experiments show ReLIZO's efficacy across various scenarios, including adversarial attacks and neural architecture search."], "tldr": "Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) methods are essential for tackling problems where gradients are unavailable, but they often require many function evaluations, making them computationally expensive.  Existing gradient estimation methods either introduce bias (smoothing) or suffer from high sample complexity (linear interpolation).  This significantly limits their applicability in resource-constrained settings. \nReLIZO offers a novel solution by cleverly reusing past queries during gradient estimation. It formulates gradient estimation as a QCLP problem, deriving an analytical solution that decouples sample size from variable dimensions, and allowing query reuse without extra conditions.  ReLIZO demonstrates superior efficiency and efficacy compared to other ZO solvers across various applications, including black-box adversarial attacks and neural architecture search, showcasing its potential to revolutionize resource-intensive optimization tasks.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "yzviAnpvU6/podcast.wav"}
