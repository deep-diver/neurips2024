It has been successfully applied to many fields, including science [41, 25], finance [35], and artificial intelligence [37, 45, 47], where the optimization functions are usually black-box without available gradients w.r.t. the variables. Typical ZO methods iteratively perform three major steps [35]: 1) estimate the gradient by sampling directions to update the variable and querying the function evaluation, 2) rectify the descent direction through momentum, element-wise sign operation, stochastic variance reduced algorithms, etc., and 3) update the variables according to the descent direction. Wherein, the first step, i.e. gradient estimation, is critical since it provides the essential direction to update variables, which have been explored by many recent works [5, 30].

The former proposes to sample a set of linearly independent directions to form an invertible matrix and compute the gradient through linear interpolation. Though such methods can get better descent directions, the sample size of directions should be the same as the dimension of variables, leading to an intractable complexity of building an invertible matrix and computing the matrix inversion as the dimension increases. A recent work [30] makes the sample size in linear interpolation strategy independent of the dimension of variables yet involves an extra orthogonal requirement of the sampled vectors. The latter group proposes to estimate the gradient by a sum of directional derivatives along random directions e.g. Gaussian and uniform on a unit sphere. Such methods are simple to implement and the sample size directions are independent of the variable dimension. However, it provides a gradient estimation of a smoothed version of the objective function [35], which differs from the original one with a bound w.r.t. a smoothing parameter [39]. Additionally, the prior work [5] shows that smoothing methods require significantly more samples than linear interpolation strategies to obtain an accurate estimation The work [28] leverages information theory showing that under the Lipschitz continuous gradient assumption, ZO methods require sample complexities growing polynomially with the variable dimension.

However, it is hard to be directly applied to the prior gradient estimation methods. On one hand, for smoothing strategies, it is hard to guarantee the reused samples obey the demanded distribution, which will further increase the gradient estimation bias. On the other hand, methods based on linear interpolation techniques require a large computation complexity since building an invertible matrix needs to compute the null space of reused samples.
