However, recent jailbreaking methods have successfully bypassed these filters by generating adversarial prompts. This poses significant security risks, as malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities to produce harmful imagery.  This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods and proposes a novel approach to address the issue. \nThe proposed method, named ColJailBreak, tackles this issue by adopting a collaborative generation and editing strategy. Initially, it generates safe content using normal text prompts and then utilizes image editing techniques to embed unsafe content. This approach leverages the fact that the initial generation phase is less likely to be flagged by safety filters, while the editing phase focuses on modifying local image regions. By employing adaptive safe word substitution, inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization, ColJailBreak effectively bypasses safety filters, generating unsafe content while maintaining high image quality and naturalness. This novel technique highlights the challenges in ensuring safety in AI systems and provides insights into new defense strategies.", "affiliation": "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "eGIzeTmAtE/podcast.wav"}
