Subfigures (a) and (b) display the training and test AUC scores, respectively, plotted against the number of training epochs.  Subfigures (c) and (d) show the same metrics but plotted against the running time of the algorithms.  The figure compares the performance of the proposed AccBO algorithm against several baselines, including StocBio, TTSA, SABA, MA-SOBA, SUSTAIN, VRBO, and BO-REP.  The results demonstrate that AccBO achieves higher AUC scores and faster convergence than the other methods.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "v7vYVvmfru/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Results of bilevel optimization on deep AUC maximization.
