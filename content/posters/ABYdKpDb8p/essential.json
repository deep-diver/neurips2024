This paper addresses this issue by exploring the transferability of learned INR features.  Existing methods are limited by computational expense and often require considerable amounts of data for training. \nThe paper introduces STRAINER, a new INR training method.  STRAINER shares the initial encoder layers across multiple INRs, learning transferable features and uses them to initialize new INRs at test time. Experiments show that STRAINER leads to significantly faster convergence and higher reconstruction quality. The method efficiently encodes data-driven priors into INRs.  Its success on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks showcases the wide applicability and transferability of the learned features.", "affiliation": "Rice University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "ABYdKpDb8p/podcast.wav"}
