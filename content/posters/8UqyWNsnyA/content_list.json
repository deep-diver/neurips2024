By exploiting students\u2019 response logs, SCM aims to predict their exercise performance as well as estimate knowledge proficiency in a subject. Data mining approaches such as matrix factorization can obtain high accuracy in predicting student performance on exercises, but the knowledge proficiency is unknown or poorly estimated. The situation is further exacerbated if only sparse interactions exist between exercises and students (or knowledge concepts). To solve this dilemma, we root monotonicity (a fundamental psychometric theory on educational assessments) in a co-factorization framework and present an autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization (AE-NMCF), which improves the accuracy of estimating the student\u2019s knowledge proficiency via an encoder-decoder learning pipeline.

As illustrated in Figure 1, given a set of exercises (could be recommended by a learning platform) with the expert-annotated knowledge concepts in a subject domain, a student is required to finish the exercises and leaves the responses. Based on the response log, cognitive modeling aims to $(a)$ estimate the student\u2019s cognitive levels on the knowledge concepts (i.e., cognitive diagnosis) and $(b)$ predict some exercise performance. With a comprehensive understanding of students, cognitive modeling is fruitful in applications such as computerized adaptive testing [1] and exercise recommendations [2]. To profile students\u2019 cognitive status, much progress has been made in the educational psychology area, where one popular avenue is to use cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) [3]. While most CDMs provide detailed insights into students\u2019 cognitive states, the subjective handcraft features (e.g., the slip and guess of an exercise) may only partially capture the nuances of actual cognitive functioning, triggering cascading errors in predicting student performance [4].

By transforming students\u2019 response logs into a scoring matrix, MF-based models directly predict the missing response values via latent factors, thereby reducing cascading errors. In contrast to CDMs, MF-based models enjoy high prediction accuracy and are inexpensive to deploy [6]. On the other hand, the latent factors uncovered from the factorization techniques, which encode students\u2019 implicit learning ability, are unexplainable, i.e., the true knowledge components of the students remain unknown in the latent vectors. Recognizing this problem, a follow-up scalable nonnegative matrix co-factorization (SNMCF) model [4] utilizes a point coverage function to learn students\u2019 proficiency levels via pre-trained latent factors. However, SNMCF solves the two learning tasks separately, i.e., the generation of latent features is aimed at performance prediction without considering the target of improving cognitive diagnosis, thereby compromising the identification of student cognitive levels. As such, the fundamental issue of identifying students\u2019 knowledge proficiency remains an open problem.

To this end, several challenges exist: How can we specify and assess the students\u2019 knowledge proficiency since the ground truth of the cognitive levels is unknown [1]?

The monotonicity states that a student\u2019s knowledge proficiency has a monotonic relationship with the probability of the right responses to related exercises. Furthermore, by investigating the form of an autoencoder, our key observation reveals that its self-reconstruction principle, which aims to reconstruct input data from the learned low-dimensional representations, is amenable to the requirement of the monotonic constraint. Leveraging this observation, we root the monotonicity in a co-factorization framework via the autoencoder mechanism. Consequently, an autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization (AE-NMCF) is presented, which enables an iterative link between students\u2019 knowledge proficiency and exercise performance, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy and diagnostic ability. As the resulting optimization problem is not convex and has nonnegative constraints \u2013 which makes the complexity acute by an inverse link function (often called response functions in the case of general linear models [8]) \u2013 we develop a projected gradient method based on block coordinate descent with Lipschitz constants and guarantee its theoretical convergence.

IRT predicts a student\u2019s exercise performance based on a single learning trait and exercise difficulty levels. In contrast, DINA probes a student\u2019s binary cognitive status in different knowledge concepts, which assumes that a student can answer correctly if she has mastered all the required knowledge concepts. Traditional CDMs engender a plethora of advanced models. For example, Cheng et al. [11] extend IRT using deep learning to enhance the diagnostic process. Noting the importance of the relation among knowledge concepts, Gao et al.
