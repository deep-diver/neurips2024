In this paper, we introduce a novel one-step dragbased image editing method, i.e., FastDrag, to accelerate the editing process. Central to our approach is a latent warpage function (LWF), which simulates the behavior of a stretched material to adjust the location of individual pixels within the latent space.

This strategy interpolates these regions using similar features from neighboring areas, thus enhancing semantic integrity. Additionally, a consistency-preserving strategy is introduced to maintain the consistency between the edited and original images by adopting semantic information from the original image, saved as key and value pairs in self-attention module during diffusion inversion, to guide the diffusion sampling.

These optimization approaches can be categorized primarily into motion-based [23, 28, 15, 16, 32, 4] and gradient-based [20, 19] $n$ -step iterative optimizations, as shown in Fig. 1(a). $n$ -step iterations in motion-based methods are necessary to avoid abrupt changes in the latent space, preventing image distortions and ensuring a stable optimization process.

In addition, gradient-based methods align sampling results with the drag instructions through gradient guidance [6]. In this way, they also require multiple steps due to the optimizer [13, 25] needing multiple iterations for non-convex optimization. For instance, DragonDiffusion [20] requires around 50 gradient steps to accomplish the latent optimization.

The study in [7] manipulates the cross-attention maps within the diffusion process and achieves text-based image editing. Imagic [11] further enhances these methods by optimizing text embeddings and using text-driven fine-tuning of the diffusion model, enabling complex semantic editing of images.

Existing drag-based image editing methods generally rely on $n$ -step latent semantic optimization in latent space to achieve image editing. These methods fall into two main categories: motion-based [23, 28, 32, 4, 16, 15, 9] and gradient-based [20, 19] optimizations. For example, DragGAN [23] employs generative adversarial network (GAN) for drag-based image editing with iterative point tracking and motion supervision steps. However, the image quality of the methods using GAN for image generation is worse than diffusion models [5]. Therefore, a series of diffusion-based methods have been proposed for drag-based image editing. For instance, DragDiffusion [28] employs iterative point tracking and motion supervision for latent semantic optimization to achieve drag-based editing. Building on this foundation, GoodDrag [32], StableDrag [4], DragNoise [16], and FreeDrag [15] have made significant improvements to the motionbased methods. Without coincidence, by utilizing feature correspondences, DragonDiffusion [20] and its improved version DiffEditor [19] formulate an energy function that conforms to the desired editing results, thereby transforming the image editing task into a gradient-based process that enables dragbased editing. However, these methods inherently require $n$ -step iterations for latent optimization, which significantly increases the time consumption. Although SDEDrag [22] does not require $n$ -step iterative optimization, it is still time-consuming due to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) process for diffusion. In addition, while EasyDrag [9] offers user-friendship editing, its requirement for over 24GB of memory (i.e., a 3090 GPU) limits its broad applicability.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
