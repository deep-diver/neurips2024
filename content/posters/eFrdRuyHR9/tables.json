We give the solving times to the nearest second, and provide the size of the state-space, |S|, the maximum number of actions one can take from a specific state, |A(S)|, and the planning horizon. In all benchmarks we are able to solve the problem in a few seconds.", "description": "This table presents the computational efficiency of the proposed method by reporting the average solving time of the acquisition function for three real-world benchmarks.

Amax represents the size of the box constraints in the traditional benchmarks. For the synchronous benchmarks and for SnAr we used a noise level of \u03c3\u00b2 = 0.001. For the asynchronous benchmarks, and the knorr pyrazole example we used \u03c3\u00b2 = 0.0001. For the Ypacarai example we used \u03c3\u00b2 = 0.001 and \u03c3\u00b2 = 0.01 for the episodic and immediate feedback respectively.", "description": "This table shows the hyperparameters used in the experiments for different benchmarks. It includes the maximum allowed change in parameters (\u0394max), the variance (\u03c3\u00b2rbf), and the length scale (lrbf) for the squared exponential kernel used in Gaussian process regression.  Different noise levels were used for synchronous and asynchronous experiments and the Knorr pyrazole synthesis example.", "section": "E.2 Benchmark Details"}]
