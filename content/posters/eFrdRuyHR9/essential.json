These constraints often arise from physical limitations or sequential dependencies inherent in the system being optimized.  Existing BayesOpt techniques struggle in these scenarios because they don't account for these transition constraints, resulting in suboptimal solutions.\nThis paper tackles this limitation by integrating BayesOpt with the framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors propose a novel utility function based on maximum identification via hypothesis testing and iteratively solve a tractable linearization using reinforcement learning to plan ahead for the entire horizon. The resulting policy is potentially non-Markovian, adapting to the history of previous decisions and system dynamics.  The approach is validated on various synthetic and real-world examples, demonstrating its ability to handle complex transition constraints effectively and improve the efficiency of optimization.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "eFrdRuyHR9/podcast.wav"}
