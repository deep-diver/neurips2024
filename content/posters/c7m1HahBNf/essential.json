Current methods, however, often lack efficiency or robustness. This paper focuses on score-based generative models, specifically diffusion models, to solve this.  These models are usually used for image generation but possess hidden structure that can improve image classifiers. \nThe researchers introduce DUSA, a novel method that exploits this hidden structure. DUSA extracts knowledge from a single diffusion timestep to guide the adaptation, making it significantly faster than previous methods. Experiments showed that DUSA outperforms other methods in various test-time adaptation scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "c7m1HahBNf/podcast.wav"}
