This work discloses the hidden semantic structure within score-based generative models, unveiling their potential as effective discriminative priors. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose DUSA to exploit the structured semantic priors underlying diffusion score to facilitate the test-time adaptation of image classifiers or dense predictors. Notably, DUSA extracts knowledge from a single timestep of denoising diffusion, lifting the curse of Monte Carlo-based likelihood estimation over timesteps. We demonstrate the efficacy of our DUSA in adapting a wide variety of competitive pre-trained discriminative models on diverse test-time scenarios.

Discriminative models are adept at making accurate predictions on training data [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], but can be fragile when confronted with unseen data [12]. This vulnerability can be attributed to their tendency to learn spurious correlation as a shortcut, hindering their transferability [13]. Generative models, however, are proficient in capturing the underlying structure of the data, giving them an edge in grasping the whole picture [14, 15, 16] and enhancing robustness [17, 18]. Prior works have verified the effectiveness of generative objectives in discriminative learning [4, 19], yet the utilization of pre-trained generative models is under-explored. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The recent surge of diffusion models [20, 21, 22] has ignited interest in adopting them for applications beyond image generation [23, 24, 25, 26]. In the context of test-time adaptation, a pre-trained task model is updated on the fly to make accurate predictions on incoming target samples without access to their labels. This presents challenges, as the target data distribution may differ from that encountered during pre-training. The literature reveals that we can not only extract discriminative features from capacious diffusion models [23, 24, 26, 27, 28], but also convert these models into generative classifiers that demonstrate human-level generalization on out-of-distribution samples [25, 29, 30]. Such properties render them viable choices for facilitating the test-time adaptation of discriminative models, which may underperform on unseen data [31]. Diffusion-TTA [32] ranks among the first to employ diffusion models for test-time adaptation, where task outputs are used to modulate the conditioning of a diffusion model with the objective of likelihood maximization. While DiffusionTTA is competitive, there\u2019s still room to unleash the full potential of diffusion models. To achieve this, two key aspects warrant further exploration. First, the conditioning space is typically low-dimensional in diffusion models [20, 22], which restricts its ability to capture the intricacies of complex data and thus impedes its expressiveness as a discriminative prior. Further, the common image-level condition lacks a fine-grained connection with data, limiting its potential in guiding dense prediction tasks. Conversely, the high-dimensional latent space of diffusion models exhibits a surprisingly interpretable semantic structure [33, 34, 35, 36, 37], making it a good fit for assisting discriminative tasks and easily extensible to dense prediction. Second, Diffusion-TTA is heavily reliant on the Monte Carlo method over as many as 180 timesteps to estimate a biased approximation of likelihood [32, 38], resulting in high computational complexity proportional to sampled timesteps.

Although a few works elucidate the semantic properties of the latent space [34, 37], they all take a generative viewpoint and are not tailored for discriminative tasks. We instead depart from the perspective of score functions [39, 40, 41] on the latent space, which is closely related to the denoising diffusion formulation [38, 42, 43].

The theoretical findings not only unveil discriminative priors hidden within score-based diffusion models, but applies to every single timestep and avoids likelihood estimation. A test-time objective is then derived by substituting the pre-trained task model and diffusion model for the implicit priors and score functions, respectively. Intuitively, the precise score estimation by diffusion models forms a well-structured semantic space, where the task model can learn implicit discriminative priors. Given their generative nature, the priors are further blessed with improved robustness, ultimately beneftiing task prediction. Another key advantage of our approach lies in shifting computational complexity from timesteps to the number of classes, which aligns closely with our focus on discriminative tasks.

In the module, we first adopt LogitNorm [54, 55] to force constraints on the pruned classes to stabilize training, where the logits output of the task model are $\\ell_{2}$ normalized before selection. Intuitively, we discourage the optimization in the magnitude of logits to mitigate overconfidence, especially on pruned classes. Then we handle the class bias problem by introducing randomness in selection. In detail, with a selection budget $b=k+m$ , we split it into two parts: $k$ for top- $\\cdot k$ classes select, and $m$ for a multinomial selection without replacement from the remaining classes, where the sampling probabilities are calculated from the logits before normalization. We only focus on the selected $b$ normalized logits, and apply softmax to get their probabilities for our DUSA objective. After a series of practical designs, we succeed in reducing the time complexity of DUSA from $\\mathcal{O}(K)$ to ${\\mathcal{O}}(b)$ , where a small $b$ should be valid for a large number of classes, as will be shown in Sec. 4.4.

Test-time adaptation [44] focuses on improving source data pre-trained model performance on out-of-distribution target data without label access during inference time. Early works lay more emphasis on adapting the activation statistics of batch normalization (BN) [62, 63, 66, 67]. Test-time training [68, 69, 70, 71] methods manage to adapt through devising a test-time self-supervised objective which is also injected into the pre-training stage, resulting in complicated pipelines and increased computational cost. To lessen dependence on source data and extra loss injection, fully test-time adaptation [44] is advocated to achieve adaptation with only unlabeled target data. Concretely, previous works are majorly based on entropy minimization objectives: Tent [44] directly minimizes entropy on batched data predictions, MEMO [72] proposes marginal entropy minimization via data augmentation, EATA [60] pursues a sample efficient entropy minimization and anti-forgetting regularization, while SAR [59] advocates sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization.

The long-standing discussion on the connections between generative and discriminative models [1, 75, 76] has inspired a handful of attempts to integrate the two seemingly disparate paradigms [2, 3, 4, 19, 77, 78, 79, 80]. Specifically, a collection of works showcase the impressive power of generative pre-training followed by supervised finetuning [15, 24, 27, 81, 82, 83, 84]. Besides, a few works utilize generative models as zero-shot recognizers [25, 29, 85]. Integrating generative modeling into the task of test-time adaptation is gaining traction. Prior works manage to boost task model performance with a variety of generative techniques, including GANs [86], MAEs [87], energy-based [88] and flow-based [89]. The recent prevalence of diffusion models with extraordinary generation capability stimulates a range of works on adapting them for discriminative tasks. As for TTA, two distinct research directions arise. Appreciating the generative power [90, 91] of diffusion models, a series of works propose to adapt samples in the input space [92, 93, 94]. Another largely under-explored direction is to repurpose the generative objective of diffusion models as a proxy of discriminative ability enhancement, with Diffusion-TTA [32] pioneering in incorporating task predictions into the class condition of denoising objective in an inversion [7, 25, 29, 95] style.

In image editing tasks, diffusion models are observed to exhibit a natural coarse-to-fine pattern during the reverse process [91, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]. Consequently, the trade-off between realism and fidelity in editing largely stems from the chosen intervals of timesteps. In discriminative tasks, timestep selection is also crucial to the quality of extracted features. An early study [83] elucidated the features within diffusion models, revealing that the most informative ones are derived from smaller timesteps. Subsequent works have reinforced this finding by utilizing a single small timestep across various tasks, including semantic segmentation, referring image segmentation, depth estimation [24], object detection [26], semantic correspondence [101], and one-shot image segmentation [102]. While our DUSA aligns with the existing literature on using a single timestep, it differs by extracting semantic priors rather than focusing on feature extraction.

In this work, an approach to incorporate generative diffusion models into the discriminative task of test-time adaptation is introduced. The leverage of knowledge from generative modeling teaches a whole picture of the scenario to the task model, enabling better robustness and adaptability and is thus favorable to some relevant scenarios like medical analysis and quality control of manufacturing in varying environments. However, the adoption of generative models might come with a risk of learning from a biased source of knowledge, leading to improper decisions from the adapted task model. A possible remedy for this is to foster the research into more unbiased or balanced training of generative models. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations. Our work presents an effective way of borrowing semantic priors from score-based diffusion models to benefti the discriminative task model that demands adaptation at test time without labels. We acknowledge that, as with any research endeavor, limitations exist in our work. Firstly, our competitive method involves a diffusion model pre-trained at least on the same set of source data as the task model, which may not be easily accessible for certain scenarios. However, we believe such a dilemma can be mitigated with advances in generative diffusion models, which have demonstrated remarkable progress in both generality and robustness. Our approach achieves significant adaptation efficiency gains against prior diffusion-based TTA methods, but there is still a gap in the time compared to methods that only update the task model. Therefore, it may not meet extreme efficiency demands in scenarios like autonomous driving. Our method, however, yields superior performance and is thus appealing to another set of tasks where trading a slight loss in efficiency for boosted accuracy is tolerable, e.g., non-emergent medical diagnosis. With this said, we highlight that our theoretical findings are not confined to diffusion models but extensive to all score-based models, therefore substituting a more lightweight technique in score estimation for the computationally expensive diffusion models can be a promising avenue. We leave it for future work.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
