The two subspaces in the figure correspond to the same concept but of different valuations.", "description": "This figure illustrates the geometric notion of concepts as affine subspaces in the latent space.  It shows two parallel planes representing the same concept but with different valuations (values of the concept).  The concept is defined by a linear transformation A, where AZ represents the concept valuation.  The figure visually demonstrates that the same concept can have different valuations depending on the specific instance of the data being represented.", "section": "Overview"}, {"figure_path": "r5nev2SHtJ/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Violin plot of the concept valuations (ashape, Z) for the different shapes and a vision transformer CLIP embedding (left) and a residual network CLIP embedding (right). Results show concentration of the concept valuations around the concept planes indicated by the horizontal lines.", "description": "Violin plots are shown for the concept valuations of the 'shape' concept for different shapes using two different CLIP models. Each plot shows the distribution of the concept valuations for each shape (cube, cylinder, ball, ellipsoid).  The horizontal lines represent the concept planes, which show the average valuation for each shape. The plots demonstrate that the concept valuations are concentrated around the concept planes, supporting the paper's claim that concepts can be represented linearly in the latent space.
