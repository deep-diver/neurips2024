The error bars represent the standard deviation of the estimates, indicating the variability in the ratio across multiple runs of the experiment.  The results indicate that for smaller input dimensions, using the fundamental domain reduces the computational cost without significantly reducing the accuracy of the linear region estimation.  However, the accuracy of the fundamental domain approach decreases as the input dimension increases.

The x-axis represents the number of monomials, and the y-axis represents the average number of linear regions observed across multiple randomly generated functions with that number of monomials.  The plot demonstrates a clear positive correlation, indicating that as the number of monomials increases, the number of linear regions tends to increase as well.", "section": "5 Symbolic Neural Networks"}, {"figure_path": "TJJ4gZtkS4/figures/figures_15_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Linear regions of a Puiseux rational function in 4 variables", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between the number of monomials and the average number of linear regions in a Puiseux rational function with four variables.
