Existing reinforcement learning methods usually focus on maximizing return, while ignoring the cost. This can lead to inefficient policies that achieve high returns but with very high costs.\nThis research proposes a new framework and algorithm called ROIDICE to address this issue. ROIDICE uses a technique called linear fractional programming to directly optimize ROI and incorporates a method to handle the distribution shift inherent in offline learning. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that ROIDICE achieves a superior trade-off between return and cost compared to existing algorithms.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6Kg26g1quR/podcast.wav"}
