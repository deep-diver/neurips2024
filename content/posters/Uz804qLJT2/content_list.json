We introduce a transformer-like model featuring deep multi-head self-attention, amenable to theoretical characterization within the Bayesian framework. Our results unveil the important role of attention paths in accounting for transformers\u2019 remarkable performance. We demonstrate that, in scenarios involving the interplay of attention paths at finite widths, generalization consistently improves compared to the GP regime, where such interplay is absent. Our theory explains this paths interplay in terms of a task-relevant kernel combination mechanism, where the network\u2019s total kernel results from the sum of many kernels, specific to pairs of paths, and optimally weighted to improve generalization. This mechanism is confirmed by experiments on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. More broadly, our results are relevant to the theory of deep learning, as they provide an example of non-scalar kernel renormalization [33, 43] in a widely adopted architecture such as the transformer, illustrating its importance in accounting for network performance. Non-scalar, as opposed to scalar [29], renormalization can affect the network\u2019s mean predictor and therefore lead to improved generalization. Our work provides a novel interpretation of its benefits in terms of an optimized kernel-task alignment. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Interpretability of our Theory. We provide interpretability to the kernel combination mechanism, by relating it to observable structures in the network weights, specifically to their magnitude and correlations. These predicted structures transfer well outside the Bayesian framework, to the weights of networks trained with gradient descent, broadening the applicability of our theory. As an example, we show that a trained network can be reduced in size with minimal performance loss, by pruning those heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory. The large size reduction achieved $(25\\%)$ appears in line with observations that a few specialized heads are responsible for most of the network performance [44], and the proposal of head pruning schemes during training [45]. Our theoretical insights may therefore be relevant to the quest for minimalistic and resource-efficient models [46, 47]. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and Outlook. The above results are enabled by our theory\u2019s ability to go beyond the GP limit [25], as well as incorporating a multi-head, multi-layer architecture\u2014a prerequisite for the very existence of attention paths. However, various limitations could still be addressed, opening for exciting research directions. For example, attention in our model is only a function of the bare input, rather than the previous layer\u2019s postactivation, as in standard transformers. In this case, the theoretical challenge would be to disentangle the learning of attention paths interplay from the learning of the attention paths themselves, since now also the attention matrix would depend on the value weights. Another limitation of our model is its linearity in the value weights. It may be possible to heuristically extend the theory to include nonlinear MLP blocks in between attention layers, by replacing the GP path-path kernels appearing in Eq. (10) with the corresponding GP kernels for the nonlinear case\u2014an approach which has proven successful in deep ReLU networks for certain regimes [29]. Introducing nonlinearities, strong feature learning may also emerge [48\u201350]. Note that, instead, our theory is readily extendable to the case of linear MLP blocks, as well as multiple outputs, following [29, 33]. Here we chose a minimal setting focusing only on those renormalization phenomena specific to the transformer architecture. Indeed, the presence of multiple outputs causes the same kind of renormalization independently of the network architecture (i.e., adding two new output indices to the order parameter), while deeper linear blocks would not alter the essence of attention paths interplay, only affecting details in the entropy part of the action. Extending the theory to include skip connections also seems viable. A very open challenge, instead, is to characterize the learning of the query and key weights, which relates to the more general challenge of extending the BPKR technique to nonlinear deep networks. Finally, our approach characterizes the inductive bias imposed by the network architecture on the parameter configurations that fti the training data, but not the bias imposed by a learning algorithm. It would therefore be interesting to import our theory to methods characterizing deep neural networks\u2019 training dynamics [51\u201353].

Different lines of works have studied the expressivity [10, 22, 21, 54], the inductive bias [11, 12] and the training dynamics [17, 16, 18] of attention layers. In particular, [54] shows that multi-layer attention networks are universal approximators for certain classes of functions, such as equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions, while [21] highlights their computational limitations, demonstrating that self-attention cannot model periodic finite-state languages, nor hierarchical structure, unless the number of layers or heads increases with input length. [16, 22] derive error bounds for non-linear models, with trainable queries and keys. As in our work, [19, 10, 55] focus on the training of value matrices. In [19, 10] query and key matrices are fixed and untrainable, while [55] sets them equal to the identity. Several theoretical studies have focused on in-context learning [56\u201360]. However, the works mentioned above derive generalization bounds and do not provide a tight characterization of the learning curves. A first tight analysis was done in [14], considering a single-layer model with factored self-attention. The authors of [13] provide a tight analysis of a single-layer attention model with trainable tied queries and keys and value weights fixed to the identity. Previous theoretical works have mainly focused on a single transformer block, where attention paths are not defined. For instance, [44] finds that one transformer block can learn different linguistic tasks according to the position of the self-attention layer. [58] shows that a transformer block can learn to encode topical models. [55] shows that one transformer block can encode patch associations. A different line of works has studied attention layers in the infinite-width limit [25, 26]. In particular, [25] establishes an equivalence between Gaussian processes and infinitely-wide multi-layer attention models with infinitely many attention heads. [26] leverages this framework and studies the inductive bias of infinitely-wide transformers towards permutation symmetric functions in sequence space.

Then, the second head sums over the tokens attended by the first head, thereby \u201ccounting\u201d the number of times a token has not changed state. More generally, outside the above mentioned limit, we can say that the good attention path focuses on the two most relevant pieces of information needed to solve the task: First, it preferentially pays attention to nearby tokens, which is important because of the memoryless nature of the Markov process; Second, it is able to detect the type of transition occurrying between nearby tokens (i.e. remaining in the same state, or changing state), which is important to distinguish between the two classes, since they differ by their transition probability.

We can get an intuition of why this is so by looking at their associated same-path kernels, Fig. 5(b). We can see that both the good-path and the two adversarial-path kernels appear very structured, with sharp excursions in their values for different pairs of examples. However, while the good-path kernel structure appears to be aligned with the task, well distinguishing the two classes, the adversarial-path kernels structure appears random w.r.t. to the task. We can expect that adding these adversarial kernels to the good one would destroy it\u2019s task-relevant structure, as can be visually understood from the total GP kernel. In contrast, the total renormalized kernel, in which the adversarial-path kernels do not contribute, preserves the task-relevant structure. Differently, the denoising-path kernel appears less structured and more uniform, with weaker noisy excursions. In fact, what we suspect is that there is nothing special about the specific realization of the random head involved in the denoising path, which is just implementing a noisy version of uniform attention. We verify this by substituting the random head with one implementing uniform attention and repeating the same experiment shown in Fig. 2(f) in the main text.
