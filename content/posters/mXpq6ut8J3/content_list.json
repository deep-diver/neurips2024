Actions should be simple and easy to understand for agents. Many bash commands have documentation that includes dozens of options. Simple commands with a few options and concise documentation are easier for agents to use, reducing the need for demonstrations or fine-tuning. This is a defining principle for all SWE-agent commands that we describe in Section 3.   \n2. Actions should be compact and efficient. Important operations (e.g., file navigation, editing) should be consolidated into as few actions as possible. Efficient actions help agents make meaningful progress towards a goal in a single step. A poor design would therefore have many simple actions that must be composed across multiple turns for a higher order operation to take effect. We show this idea in action in the Editing and Search interface analyses in Section 5.1.   \n3. Environment feedback should be informative but concise. High quality feedback should provide the agent with substantive information about the current environment state (and the effect of the agent\u2019s recent actions) without unnecessary details. For instance, when editing a file, updating the agent about revised content is helpful. Figures 3a, 3b and Table 3 show this.   \n4. Guardrails mitigate error propagation and hasten recovery. Like humans, LMs make mistakes when editing or searching and can struggle to recover from these errors. Building in guardrails, such as a code syntax checker that automatically detects mistakes, can help agents recognize and quickly correct errors. We show the effect of editing guardrails in Table 3. Analysis and ablation studies in Section 5 demonstrate how alternative ACIs affect LM performance.   \nOur studies shows how these principles appear recurrently across actions, feedback, and workflows.

Repository-level code editing introduces many reasoning challenges grounded in real SE subtasks, such as spotting errant code and identifying cross-file relationships and understanding codebasespecific symbols and conventions.

In a Shell-only setting, there are several commands that can be used to inspect file content.

First, commands that print files to standard output (e.g. cat, printf) can easily flood a language agent\u2019s context window with too much file content, the majority of which is usually irrelevant to the issue. Enabling a language agent to filter out distractions and focus on relevant code snippets is crucial to generating effective edits. While commands like head and tail reduce length to the first/last n lines, it is not intuitive to use bash commands to perform in-file navigation. It is either impossible or requires a long list of arguments to show specific file lines. Furthermore, since such Bash commands are stateless, \u201cscrolling\" up/down relative to the current file position typically requires regenerating the same lengthy command with minor changes. Interactive tools like more and less accommodate this, but (1) representing navigation actions (multiple key up/down clicks) is intuitive for humans, but is verbose and costly for language agents, and (2) even if jumping to a specific line number is allowed, it is not possible to quickly identify what classes/methods/symbols are declared in a file and then immediately go to their definitions.

This saves the model from having to do repetitive or additional actions that unnecessarily increase the potential for error. As a concrete example, if an agent used a sed command to view the first 100 lines of a file and wants to look at the next 100 lines, it will have to recalculate parameters such as the start line and end line and reflect these updates correctly in the subsequent generation.

Built in commands (e.g., sed) often require a lengthy list of arguments, and the mis-specification of an argument can easily throw a model off track as it attempts to correct self-incurred errors. We also observe that when agents use such commands directly, they struggle with the arithmetic skills required to generate an edit. Details such as including the correct indentation level, inserting delimiters at specific points in a line, and adhering to stylistic preferences of the codebase all require some amount of planning or calculation. Similar to the Shell-only file viewing process, file editing may also require repeating many commands. For instance, performing a multi-line edit can only be represented as multiple sed calls with requisite, delicate tweaks to the arguments for every turn. Furthermore, as referenced in Section 5.1, editing in Shell-only is usually a \u201csilent\" procedure.

During the development process, we experimented with variations to this message, including the omission of one or more parts. Our takeaway was that having all three messages is helpful. Without the error type, the agent might misdiagnose what the mistake was. Without a snippet of the changed file content, the agent will re-issue the same command more frequently.

For this particular scenario, the latter is necessary because the file snippet is not large enough to show the entirety of the basic_chain implementation.

The search_file command allows agents to search for terms at a file-level, which is helpful for efficient fine-grained localization. Taking a step back, the goal of these search commands is to make it easy for the agent to utilize any signal (e.g., line number, stack trace, natural language) about the root cause of an issue that may be present in the issue description or codebase.

The script printed the response status code to check if the request was handled correctly. It ran the reproduce_issue.py script, which executed successfully and received a 200 OK response, indicating that the issue was resolved.   \n5.

The regular expression is built from the \u2018notes\u2018 configuration option, which is a list of note tags. These tags are escaped using \u2018re.escape\u2018 and joined with a pipe \u2018|\u2018 to form an alternation pattern. This pattern is then used to create a regular expression that matches comments starting with one of the note tags followed by a word boundary $\\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Phi}$ .   \nThe issue might be with the word boundary $\\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}\\mathbf{b}^{\\star}$ , which does not match if the tag is followed by punctuation.

However, in the \u2018UserChangeForm\u2018, the label is defined in the Python code and not in the HTML template. This suggests that the \u2019for\u2019 attribute is likely added automatically by Django\u2019s form rendering.   \nTo resolve the issue, we need to ensure that when the form is rendered, the label for the \u2018ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\u2018 does not include a \u2019for\u2019 attribute. Since the rendering of form fields to HTML is handled by Django\u2019s form rendering system, we may need to customize the rendering for this specific field to exclude the \u2019for\u2019 attribute.   \nOne way to do this is to override the \u2018label_tag\u2018 method for the \u2018ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\u2018 to ensure it does not render a \u2019for\u2019 attribute.

When evaluating on software engineering tasks that feature an incredibly diverse number of issue descriptions, running code generations on a personal computing device can have negative side effects, such as the unintentional removal of digital assets (e.g., rm -rf asset/). To defend against this, we design SWE-agent to use ephemeral containers for both inference and evaluation. SWE-agent\u2019s execution environment and the SWE-bench evaluation framework are both carried out in sand-boxed code environments, which is made possible with Docker. Executing code in a Docker container ensures that its effects are mostly isolated from the rest of the system. While not considered as secure as virtualized hardware isolation, the namespace isolation provided by Docker containers is deemed sufficient for code that is not deliberately engineered to exploit recent container escape vulnerabilities.

For instance, an unofficial repository claiming to host an inference/evaluation harness for SWE-agent/bench could include a task instance with an issue description that tells the LM agent to build key logging functionality and store it in a hidden folder. To eliminate confusion and reduce the possibility of such an event, we provide clear guidelines listed on our GitHub repositories, data stores, and websites indicating the official repositories and channels that we actively maintain. We also encourage third parties to incorporate any improvements into our codebase and help with integrating such contributions.

Prior works have conceptualized and put forth prototypes of agents that can carry out offensive security measures. It is also not difficult to imagine that a system like SWE-agent can be incorporated into pipelines resulting in the production of malicious code. SWE-agent\u2019s strong performance on SWE-bench implies that future AI systems will likely be increasingly adept in the aforementioned use cases. Releasing SWE-agent as an open source tool can support research towards designing sound, effective constraints for what software engineering agents are permitted to do.

Many components of SWE-agent were crafted from observations of recurring behavior within a single trajectory or across multiple trajectories.

Contemporary works have explored automated prompting to improve performance on traditional sequence to sequence tasks, supplanting the need for manual prompt design.

We hope that thinking about improving performance of agentic workflows on these domains through the lens of ACI design can be a symbiotic process. For instance, for a task such a shopping on the web, in place of a typical Google-style search tool, could agents benefit from additional information beyond a list of each page\u2019s title and snippet? Would the design vary if the nature of the downstream task were to change slightly?

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
