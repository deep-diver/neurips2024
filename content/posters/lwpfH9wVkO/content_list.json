We provide the first PAC-Bayes bound capable of providing such rich information by bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical and true probabilities of a set of $M$ error types, which can either be discretized loss values for regression, or the elements of the confusion matrix (or a partition thereof) for classification.

For over two decades now, PAC-Bayesian theory has been at the core of studies on generalisation abilities of machine learning algorithms.

The outstanding empirical success of deep neural networks in the past decade calls for better theoretical understanding of deep learning, and PAC-Bayes has emerged as one of the few frameworks that can be used to derive meaningful (and non-vacuous) generalisation bounds for neural networks: the pioneering work of Dziugaite and Roy [2017] has been followed by a number of contributions, including Neyshabur et al.

This is in stark contrast to the complexity of contemporary real-world learning problems, such as medical diagnosis where the severity of Type I and Type II errors may be crucial and context-dependent. This work aims to bridge this gap by deriving a generalisation bound that provides information-rich measures of performance at test time by controlling the probabilities of errors of any finite number of user-specified types. More precisely, we bound the KL-divergence between the empirical and true distributions over the different error types. From this single bound one can then derive bounds on arbitrary linear combinations of these error probabilities, which will all hold simultaneously with the same probability as the original bound. In addition, these bounds are guaranteed to be non-vacuous (this follows since the KL-divergence blows up on the boundary of the simplex).

A number of PAC-Bayes bounds in this setting (e.g. Maurer [2004]) have been unified by a single general bound found in B\u00e9gin et al. [2016]. Briefly, B\u00e9gin et al. [2016] prove a bound on the discrepancy $d(R_{S}(Q),R_{D}(Q))$ between the error probability $\\bar{R}_{D}(Q)$ of a stochastic classifier $Q$ (a distribution over $\\mathcal{H}$ which classifies by first drawing $h\\sim Q$ and then classifying according to $h$ ) and its empirical counterpart $R_{S}(Q)$ (the fraction of the sample $Q$ misclassifies). The bound holds with high probability for all $Q$ simultaneously. The bound in B\u00e9gin et al. [2016] is binary in the sense that $\\boldsymbol{\\wp}$ contains two elements, but a more subtle way to look at this is that only two cases are distinguished\u2014correct classification and incorrect classification.

In multiclass classification for example, one can choose the error types to be the set of all different possible mis-classifications, in which case our bound will control the entire confusion matrix, bounding how far the true confusion matrix (i.e. expected over the data-generating distribution) can diverge from the empirical one (i.e. on the training set). From this one can then derive bounds on the probabilities with which each mis-classification may be made, and arbitrary linear combinations of these error probabilities, and all of these will hold simultaneously with the same probability as the original bound.

Second, they deal with the spectral norm, whereas we employ the KL-divergence. Since the KL-divergence follows a simple formula, this means we can much more easily infer bounds on the individual error probabilities, which would be very challenging for the spectral norm. The follow-up work Ko\u00e7o and Capponi [2013] shows how a proxy of the spectral norm bound can be used as a training objective that may deal with imbalanced classes. In the present work, we show how our bound can be used as a differentiable training objective directly (without the need of a proxy) and that it can more sensitively deal with imbalanced classes, or errors of different severity, by assigning each error type a user-specified loss value.

Designing priors which are optimal in some sense (i.e., minimising the Kullback-Leibler term in the right-hand side of generalisation bounds) has been at the core of an active line of work in the PAC-Bayesian literature. For the sake of simplicity, and since it is out of the scope of our contributions, we assume here that the prior is given beforehand, although we stress that practitioners should pay great attention to its tuning. For our purposes, it suffices to say that if one is using a data-dependent prior then it is necessary to partition the sample into $S=S_{\\mathrm{Prior}}\\cup S_{\\mathrm{Bound}}$ , where $S_{\\mathrm{Prior}}$ is used to train the prior and $S_{\\mathrm{Bound}}$ is used to evaluate the bound. Since our bound holds uniformly over posteriors $Q\\in\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{H})$ , the entire sample $S$ is free to be used to train the posterior $Q$ . For a more in-depth discussion on the choice of prior, we refer to the following body of work: Ambroladze et al. [2006], Lever et al. [2010, 2013], Parrado-Hern\u00e1ndez et al.

Indeed, Figure 2h shows that $Q$ does not appreciably move from its initialisation at $P{\\mathrm{-KL}}(Q\\|P)$ remains below 0.1 whereas in the MNNIST experiment, which has the same number of parameters, exceeds 30. It is therefore unsurprising that Figures 2d and 2f show negligible change in the empirical error probabilities and the bound on $\\mathrm{kl}(\\bar{R_{S}}(Q)\\|R_{D}(Q))$ , respectively.

Morvant\u2019s result is either not applicable or their confidence region is much larger than ours and essentially takes up the entire simplex, hence the volume estimate of 1.000.
