The volume represents the size of the region in the probability simplex where RD(Q) is likely to fall. Smaller volumes indicate tighter bounds. The results show that for the MNIST dataset, the authors' method yields a smaller confidence region, indicating tighter bounds, while for the HAM10000 dataset, the Maurer bound produces a smaller region.", "section": "Numerical experiments"}, {"figure_path": "lwpfH9wVkO/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: 95% confidence intervals for the volumes of the confidence regions for RD(Q).

The methods being compared are:  'Individual' (a union bound of individual Maurer bounds), 'Ours' (the proposed method from the paper), 'Intersection' (a more conservative bound combining 'Individual' and 'Ours'), and 'Morv.' (Morvant et al.'s method). The table shows 95% confidence intervals for the volume of the confidence region for each method, for different values of M (number of error types) and m (sample size). This allows for a quantitative comparison of the tightness of the various methods.", "section": "6 Numerical experiments"}]
