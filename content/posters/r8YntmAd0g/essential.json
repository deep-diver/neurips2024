Existing DP optimizers, like DP-SGD, inject noise to maintain privacy, significantly affecting accuracy.  This trade-off limits the use of DP in many critical applications. \nThis paper introduces DOPPLER, a novel approach that leverages a low-pass filter to reduce the impact of DP noise in the frequency domain. By analyzing the frequency characteristics of both the gradients and the noise, DOPPLER effectively enhances the signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results show substantial accuracy improvement (3%-10%) on various models and datasets, demonstrating DOPPLER's effectiveness in mitigating the performance degradation associated with DP training.  The study also provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed method.", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "r8YntmAd0g/podcast.wav"}
