To extensively evaluate the generalizability of the proposed CAST in unseen domains, we conduct a generalization experiment from the outdoor dataset KITTI [39] to another outdoor dataset ETH [61]. Note that the KITTI and ETH datasets use Velodyne-64 3D LiDAR and Hokuyo 2D LiDAR, respectively, leading to very different appearances and distributions of point clouds. Hence, our generalization study is practical in applications and solid to demonstrate the generalizability of different methods. For fairness, all methods adopt $30\\mathrm{cm}$ for voxel down-sampling, and all methods involving RANSAC set the maximum iterations to be 50000 and the confidence to be 0.999 as the convergence criteria. To enhance the robustness, our method is combined with RANSAC estimating an initial pose from 250 coarse correspondences to reject the outliers during fine matching, and utilizes the global registration in GeoTransformer [12] to refine the pose estimate. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "We present the translation errors, rotation errors, and the registration recalls in Table 11. Our method achieves satisfying accuracy and robustness, showcasing better generalizability than the coarse-to-fine baseline GeoTransformer [12] and other point-wise descriptors [8, 1, 20]. We also compare the our learnable compatibility graph embedding (CGE) with spectral matching (SM) [62] for outlier rejection in our method. With RANSAC filtering out severe outliers in advance, spectral matching can lead to better performance than learning-based CGE in unseen domains. Notably, all point-wise methods including CAST exhibit lower registration recalls in generalization studies than patch-wise local descriptor SpinNet [19] and BUFFER [48] incorporating patch-wise and point-wise features. This is mainly because they adopt a feature pyramid network architecture to learn features with abundant global context, which is detrimental for generalization [19]. Furthermore, we conduct an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) experiment for CAST, which tunes the network by learning to align a point cloud to itself after random rotation and cropping. The results indicate that our model can easily adapt to an unseen domain and achieve robust and accurate performance after one epoch\u2019s unsupervised tuning (only 20 minutes on an NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU).

Finally, Table 10 reports the standard deviations (1-sigma) of our evaluation metrics, which are assumed to be Gaussian distributed. Despite the randomness from voxel down-sampling and RANSAC, the performance of our method remains stable. Notably, the runtime of some methods such as [8, 19, 50] in Table 3 are quite different from results in [48], since we report the average runtime including data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature matching, and pose estimation, while the source codes of these methods save some intermediate results such as descriptors to avoid repeated calculation of the same point cloud in different pairs, which leads to unfair runtime comparison.

(2) Due to the sparsity and non-uniformity of keypoints, the inlier ratio of keypoint correspondences still falls short of what is required for robust pose estimation without a hypothesis-and-selection pipeline.
