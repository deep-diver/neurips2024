Current approaches also struggle to achieve detailed textures and geometries from limited input data. These limitations hinder progress in creating realistic virtual characters or avatars for different fields. \nThis paper introduces ID-to-3D, a novel method that addresses these challenges. **ID-to-3D leverages score distillation sampling and task-specific 2D diffusion models to generate expressive, identity-consistent 3D human heads from limited input data**, such as a small set of images.  By employing a compositional approach and a lightweight model architecture, the method achieves high-quality results without needing large 3D scanned datasets. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in geometry and texture detail, and an unprecedented level of identity consistency across various expressions.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "SLuZpdMDFg/podcast.wav"}
