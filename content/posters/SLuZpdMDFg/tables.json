The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score, a common metric for assessing the quality of generated images, is used to evaluate the realism of the generated 3D heads' textures and geometries.  Lower FID scores indicate better quality, meaning the generated assets are more realistic and closer in style to real-world examples. The table includes results from several state-of-the-art methods (indicated by an asterisk (*)) that use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) from text prompts, along with the results from the proposed ID-to-3D method. Comparing the FID scores allows one to see how the proposed method performs against the others in creating high-quality 3D head assets.", "section": "4.1 Identity Generation"}]
