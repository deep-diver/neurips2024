Figure 1(a) shows a profile function with six intervals, illustrating an asymmetric dependency on the prediction error. The performance ratio decreases with increasing error up to a point and then increases. Figure 1(b) shows a Pareto profile, a special case where the performance ratio is at most t1 for any error, except when the prediction is error-free (t2 < t1). This demonstrates the difference between a general profile and the extreme cases encompassed by Pareto optimality.", "section": "3 Brittleness of Pareto-Optimal Algorithms and Performance Profiles"}, {"figure_path": "esTPCUJZhe/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Illustration of profile functions.", "description": "The figure consists of two subfigures. Figure 1a shows a sample profile function F with six intervals. The intervals [q1, q2), [q2, q3), [q3, q4) correspond to a decreasing portion of the profile, and the rest to the increasing portion. The prediction p\u02c6 belongs to both portions. Figure 1b illustrates a Pareto profile in which there are only three intervals and where the prediction p\u02c6 is in the middle interval.
