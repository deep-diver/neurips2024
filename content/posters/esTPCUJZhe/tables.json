It shows performance ratios for worst-case sequences and real Bitcoin exchange rate data, illustrating the impact of prediction error and highlighting PROFILE's robustness and ADA-PO's dominance in certain scenarios.", "section": "6 Experimental evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "esTPCUJZhe/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2 ADA-PO (adaptive Pareto-optimal)", "description": "This table presents pseudocode for the ADA-PO algorithm, an adaptive Pareto-optimal algorithm for the one-way trading problem.  The algorithm incorporates a two-phase approach. The first phase handles rates smaller than the predicted maximum rate, prioritizing robustness.  The second phase, triggered when rates meet or exceed the prediction, leverages deviations from worst-case scenarios to maximize profit while maintaining robustness.  The algorithm dynamically adapts the threshold function to optimize performance across varying input sequences.", "section": "5 An Adaptive Pareto-Optimal Algorithm"}]
