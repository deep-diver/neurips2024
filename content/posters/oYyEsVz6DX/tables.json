Because there is an inverse correlation between accuracy and interpretability, selecting models that perform well on both metrics is challenging. The table helps identify models that are both accurate and relatively interpretable, making them potentially more desirable candidates for applications where both accuracy and interpretability are important. Each row represents a model, providing its name and its corresponding ImageNet top-1 accuracy and MIS scores.", "section": "4.2 Analyzing & Comparing Hundreds of Models"}]
