Existing methods often represent classes as Gaussian distributions but struggle with two key problems. First, **they fail to adapt the covariance matrices of classes as the model learns new tasks**. Second, **they are susceptible to task-recency bias**, where the model favors recently seen tasks, often due to a dimensionality collapse of feature representations.\n\nThis paper introduces AdaGauss, a novel method that directly addresses these issues. AdaGauss dynamically adapts covariance matrices for each task, ensuring accurate classification. Furthermore, **it incorporates a novel anti-collapse loss function to combat dimensionality collapse and reduce task-recency bias**. Through extensive experiments, AdaGauss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various EFCIL benchmarks. This improvement highlights the importance of adapting covariances and the effectiveness of the anti-collapse loss in achieving robust continual learning.", "affiliation": "Warsaw University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Continual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "5H4l37IsZ8/podcast.wav"}
