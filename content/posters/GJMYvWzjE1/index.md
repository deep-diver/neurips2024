### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current language models (LMs) often fail to grasp the hierarchical nature of language, hindering their performance on tasks needing transitive inference or hierarchical knowledge transfer.  This is a major limitation as many real-world concepts and knowledge domains are inherently hierarchical.



To address this, the researchers introduce Hierarchy Transformer Encoders (HITs), a novel approach that retrains transformer-based LMs in hyperbolic space. This space's expansive nature is well-suited for hierarchical data.  **HITs utilize hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses to effectively cluster and organize related entities hierarchically.**  The results show that HITs consistently outperform existing models on various tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and transferability of the proposed approach. **This work makes a substantial contribution by providing a novel solution to enhance the hierarchical reasoning capabilities of language models.**

> üîº This figure illustrates the difference between the output embedding space of pre-trained transformer language models and the proposed Hierarchy Transformer Encoder (HIT). Pre-trained models use a tanh activation function which confines their output embeddings within a d-dimensional hypercube.  The HIT model maps the output embeddings to a Poincar√© ball, a hyperbolic space better suited for representing hierarchies.  The Poincar√© ball has a radius of ‚àöd,  and its boundary circumscribes the hypercube.  This allows HIT to explicitly model hierarchies using hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses, as shown in the right panel by the clustered and hierarchically organized entities.

### In-depth insights


#### Hyperbolic LM Retraining
Retraining language models (LMs) within a hyperbolic space offers a novel approach to explicitly encode hierarchical structures inherent in language, a limitation of current LMs.  This **hyperbolic LM retraining** method leverages the expansive nature of hyperbolic geometry to effectively organize and cluster semantically related entities. By situating the output embeddings of pre-trained LMs in a Poincar√© ball, with curvature adapting to embedding dimension, and training with hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses, the method enhances the model's capacity to simulate transitive inference and predict hierarchical relationships.  The use of hyperbolic losses is particularly crucial, as they encourage the formation of clusters reflecting hierarchical relationships, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional Euclidean embedding approaches. **The effectiveness and transferability** of this approach is demonstrated through improved performance on tasks such as multi-hop inference and mixed-hop prediction, showcasing its potential for various NLP applications that involve hierarchical data.

#### Transitive Inference
Transitive inference, the ability to deduce implicit relationships based on explicitly stated ones, is a crucial aspect of higher-order reasoning.  In the context of language models, **successful transitive inference demonstrates a deeper understanding of hierarchical structures and semantic relationships** within a knowledge base.  The paper likely investigates how well a language model, possibly through a novel training technique, can perform transitive inference tasks.  **Benchmarking the model's performance against pre-trained models highlights the effectiveness of the new approach in capturing these complex relationships.**  The results might show improved accuracy in inferring unseen relationships compared to standard models, indicating a more nuanced comprehension of hierarchical knowledge.  A key point to consider is whether the model truly understands the transitive relationship or simply memorizes patterns from the training data.  **The study likely probes for genuine understanding through careful task design and testing, evaluating the model's ability to generalize to novel scenarios and unseen data points.**  Ultimately, the analysis of transitive inference results offers insights into the model's cognitive capabilities and its potential applications in knowledge representation and reasoning.

#### Hierarchy Encoding
The concept of 'Hierarchy Encoding' in the context of language models centers on the challenge of effectively representing hierarchical structures inherent in human language.  Traditional language models often struggle with this, exhibiting limitations in capturing transitive inference and simulating hierarchical reasoning tasks.  The proposed approach tackles this by leveraging **hyperbolic geometry**, a non-Euclidean space particularly well-suited to encode hierarchical relationships.  By situating word embeddings within a Poincar√© ball, and employing specific losses like **hyperbolic clustering** and **centripetal loss**, the model is trained to explicitly represent hierarchical information. This method surpasses traditional approaches by effectively clustering related entities and positioning them hierarchically based on their semantic distance.  Importantly, this results in improved performance on tasks requiring hierarchical understanding, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed **hyperbolic hierarchy encoding** method and its potential in addressing the limitations of previous methods. The approach's success underscores the significance of incorporating explicit hierarchical representations in language models for enhanced performance in various NLP applications.  Further research could explore expanding this work to diverse datasets and evaluating it against other specialized hierarchy encoding techniques.

#### Hyperbolic Losses
The concept of "Hyperbolic Losses" in the context of hierarchical structure learning within language models is a crucial innovation.  It leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry, specifically its ability to efficiently represent hierarchical relationships, to improve model performance.  The approach likely involves defining losses that penalize embeddings that violate hierarchical constraints within a hyperbolic space.  **Two key losses are probable: a clustering loss** that pulls semantically similar entities closer and pushes dissimilar entities farther apart, and a **centripetal loss** that ensures that higher-level (more general) entities are positioned closer to the origin of the hyperbolic space than lower-level (more specific) entities. **The choice of hyperbolic space allows for the representation of hierarchical information in a way that's not easily achievable in Euclidean space.**  The curvature of the hyperbolic space could be dynamically adjusted, potentially based on embedding dimensions, further enhancing the model's ability to adapt to varying hierarchical complexities. The effectiveness of this method relies heavily on the careful design and weighting of these losses and how they interact during the training process.  **Successful implementation results in embeddings that naturally reflect the hierarchical structure of the data,**  allowing for improved knowledge transfer and inference tasks.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section suggests several promising avenues.  **Addressing catastrophic forgetting** during hierarchy re-training is crucial, as this could impact the model's overall language understanding.  **Investigating methods to handle entity naming ambiguity** is also important; this would improve the robustness of the approach and reduce noise.  The authors also propose extending HIT to handle multiple hierarchies and to incorporate multiple types of hierarchical relationships simultaneously to increase the model's general applicability.  Finally, developing a **hierarchy-based semantic search** leveraging the HIT model's capabilities is highlighted as a valuable direction for future research. This would create a new paradigm in semantic search that could significantly improve performance and efficiency. These are all impactful suggestions that would enhance the model's practicality and effectiveness.

> üîº This figure illustrates the effect of the proposed hyperbolic loss function (L<sub>HIT</sub>) on the learned entity embeddings.  In Euclidean space, the forces pulling sibling entities (phone/computer, laptop/pc) toward their parent (e-device) while pushing them apart from each other would be contradictory. However, the hyperbolic space allows this, as distances grow exponentially towards the boundary, making it suitable for hierarchical structures.

> Figure 2: Illustration of the impact of L<sub>HIT</sub> during training. In Euclidean space, it seems contradictory that both 'phone' and 'computer' are pulled towards 'e-device' but are also pushed away from each other. However, in principle this is not a problem in hyperbolic space, where distances increase exponentially relative to Euclidean distances as one moves from the origin to the boundary of the manifold.

> üîº This histogram shows the distribution of hyperbolic norms for WordNet entities embedded using the Hierarchy Transformer encoder (HIT). The x-axis represents the hyperbolic norm, and the y-axis represents the count of entities with that norm.  The distribution shows an exponential rise in the number of child entities, with a sharp decline in entities beyond a norm of approximately 23, indicating that few entities reside at the highest hierarchical levels.  The relatively small range of norms (approximately 8 to 24) suggests that HIT effectively accommodates all WordNet entities within a limited region of the high-dimensional manifold.
