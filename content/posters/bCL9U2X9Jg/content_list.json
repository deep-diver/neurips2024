Results show our selection tokens are effective in finding regions that contain detailed information about the tag entities, e.g., brand, composition. In the last transformer layer, only selection tokens and global token are kept (Eq. 4) (image tokens are dropped) to allow the latter effectively learns fine-grained representations from the former. We also visualize what the global token of CLIP focuses by marking image tokens with the maximum attention values with it for each attention head (12 in total). Note the overlap exists, i.e., one image token may have the maximum attention value with the global token in multiple attention heads. Results show CLIP is ineffective in finding tag entity-related information and sometimes focuses on totally unrelated regions. It is observed that visually dominant areas which are closer to the global view of the product, e.g., dark areas in a dark product in Fig. 14 (g), (i), (j), tend to win higher attention scores with the global token. Consequently, regions with detailed information such as logos are overlooked. One potential reason is that, pre-training data on general domain often consist of a simple caption and a few very distinctive objects (Fig. 2), which enables CLIP to capture features better from a high-level view. In this case, focusing more on a global view of objects instead of a local view helps the model to differentiate large and distinctive object in an image. However, when it comes to fashion domain, where multiple details of a single product are required to be aware of, CLIP fails because CLIP still tries to capture the global view of an object and ignores local view, even through it has already been finetuned. By contrast, with our model, Brands are all picked. Composition prefers solid color areas, where material is more clear. Sub-category is reflected by sleeves, collar and shoulder.

However, we break into the CLIP encoder by introducing tag-aware fusion blocks. Specifically, the above models, including FashionSAP [14], do not explicitly align image patch tokens within ViT layers with text information, which we prove to be critical in fashion domain where the details do matter. To this end, our tag-aware selection tokens select and fuse image patch tokens. They differ from typical new additional tokens (VPT [18], DeiT [43]), which are simply added to input layers and structurally similar to the CLS token.

In summary, group tokens in GroupViT serve as \u201ccollectors\u201d, thus image tokens are iterated to be allocated to a group token. By contrast, in $E^{2}$ , the process is opposite: selection tokens are iterated to select one most relevant image token. We do attention with different objects therefore are not interchangeable. GroupViT cannot select the most relevant image tokens, while ours does not support grouping of them. Our framework design is also significantly different. GroupViT adopts an iterative approach, where grouped tokens are consecutively fed as inputs to transformer layers, introducing new group tokens at each stage.

While we facilitate the image encoder, EI-CLIP [27] improves the text encoding process by reducing word ambiguity in tag entities with additional text encoders. Thus we are orthogonal to each other.

In contrast, $E^{2}$ does not require separated tag entities as text input. In our model, same to existing works [10, 56] and CLIP, tag entities are concatenated with the description as one string, which is input to the CLIP text encoder. This is more practical and especially helpful in cases where tag entities are mixed with descriptions and separating them is infeasible. We also evaluate EI-CLIP under this setting, which follows existing works [10, 56] and ours (w/o E. in Table 9).

We achieve this by designing a better way to exploit tag entities, i.e., introducing selection tokens associated with these entities, while they seek for a general way to better align an image-text pair without considering the of characteristics of fashion data. Thus our work is orthogonal to theirs and we can build $E^{2}$ based on their pre-trained models. We choose CLIP in this work as it is the most representative one, based on which makes it extendable to others. Because codes and pre-trained models of mentioned CLIP variants are not released, we are not able to evaluate all of them.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
