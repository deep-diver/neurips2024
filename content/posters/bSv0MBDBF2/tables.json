It shows that the DDPath methods consistently outperform the baseline methods, indicating that DDPath is more effective at highlighting the most relevant image regions for prediction while reducing noise and inaccuracies in the selection of salient pixels.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "bSv0MBDBF2/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparisons of different interpretation methods on ImageNet validation set in terms of Insertion and Deletion.
