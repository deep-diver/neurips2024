(a) The existing paths are irrelevant to data distributions. (b) The proposed denoising diffusion path approaches the distribution of real data. (c) Traditional IG [8] and SmoothGrad [9] struggle to maintain a continuously increasing Softmax probability along the integration path. This behavior can be counterintuitive and contradict human cognition, where the confidence in a prediction should generally rise as evidence accumulates. In contrast, the proposed DDPath achieves a more natural behavior by ensuring a continuously increasing Softmax probability along the path, even if the path itself exhibits fluctuations.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of the proposed Denoising Diffusion Path (DDPath) method.  Panel (a) shows traditional attribution paths, which are often noisy and do not reflect the data distribution.

At each step in the DDPath, the images are sampled from a pre-trained diffusion model \u03b8 guided by a classifier \u03c6.", "description": "This figure illustrates the Denoising Diffusion Path (DDPath) method.  It shows a sequence of images generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, starting from a noisy baseline image (x0) and progressing towards the target image (xT). Each image (xi) along the path is sampled from a Gaussian distribution N(\u03bc\u03b8(xi), \u03a3\u03b8(xi)), where the mean \u03bc\u03b8(xi) is guided by a classifier \u03c6 to ensure that the samples remain close to the data distribution and progressively reduce noise. The classifier's role is to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that the sampled images are progressively closer to the target image. The parameter \u03b8 represents the parameters of the pre-trained diffusion model, which are kept frozen during the path generation. The probability P\u03c6(Y|xi) represents the classifier's confidence in predicting the class Y given the image xi.
