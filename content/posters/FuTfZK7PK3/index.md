### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated learning (FL) optimizes models collaboratively across distributed clients, but existing optimizers like FedProx often struggle with slow convergence.  This is particularly challenging in the 'interpolation regime' where models are overparameterized, a common scenario in modern machine learning. The slow convergence significantly limits the practicality and efficiency of FL, hindering its wider adoption.

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing and analyzing several server-extrapolation strategies to boost FedProx's convergence.  The researchers introduce Extrapolated FedProx (FedExProx) along with theoretically sound and adaptive extrapolation methods (FedExProx-GraDS and FedExProx-StoPS).  They demonstrate that FedExProx improves upon existing methods by significantly accelerating convergence in convex and strongly convex settings, validating their findings with numerical experiments. The adaptive variants further enhance practicality by removing the need for prior knowledge of specific model parameters.

FedProx is a baseline federated learning optimizer. FedExProx enhances FedProx by incorporating server-side extrapolation. The results demonstrate that FedExProx consistently outperforms FedProx across different step sizes, indicating that the server simply averaging iterates from clients is less effective compared to using extrapolation.

### In-depth insights


#### FedProx Extrapolation
The concept of "FedProx Extrapolation" centers on enhancing the Federated Learning (FL) optimizer FedProx by incorporating extrapolation techniques.  **FedProx itself addresses the challenges of FL by using a proximal term to stabilize local model updates**, but extrapolation aims to further accelerate convergence.  The core idea is to project the server's model update further along the direction suggested by the average of clients' local updates.  This approach leverages the intuition that, in certain settings, moving beyond the immediate average can lead to faster progress toward the optimal solution.  The paper likely explores several extrapolation strategies, possibly including constant and adaptive methods.  **Adaptive strategies dynamically adjust the extrapolation parameter based on observed quantities such as gradient diversity or stochastic Polyak stepsize**, aiming to automatically optimize the extrapolation process without requiring manual tuning.  Theoretical analysis probably provides convergence rate improvements under assumptions like convexity or strong convexity of the loss function, and numerical experiments demonstrate enhanced performance over standard FedProx.

#### Adaptive Extrapolation
Adaptive extrapolation techniques in federated learning aim to dynamically adjust the extrapolation parameter during the learning process, **enhancing convergence speed and efficiency**. Unlike static extrapolation methods that use a fixed parameter, adaptive methods leverage insights from the data and model to make informed adjustments.  **Gradient diversity and stochastic Polyak step size are two promising approaches** for adaptive extrapolation, offering the potential to eliminate reliance on unknown smoothness constants and improve performance across various settings.  These techniques demonstrate a **significant advancement in federated learning**, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous data and limited communication bandwidth.  **Theoretical analysis and empirical results suggest that adaptive extrapolation can achieve faster convergence** compared to fixed extrapolation and standard federated learning optimization methods, leading to more efficient and robust model training.

#### Convergence Analysis
A rigorous convergence analysis is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and reliability of any federated learning algorithm.  The analysis should consider various factors such as **communication efficiency**, **data heterogeneity**, **client participation**, and **algorithm design**.  A strong convergence analysis will provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's ability to reach a solution within a certain number of iterations or communication rounds.  **Convergence rates**, expressed as a function of problem parameters and algorithm settings,  quantify the speed of convergence.  It is also important to explore the effects of different extrapolation strategies on convergence behavior, considering both theoretical bounds and empirical results. The analysis must also address practical challenges like **dealing with non-convex objective functions**, **adapting to noisy or unreliable communication environments**, and **handling partial client participation**.  Robustness to various settings and scenarios is critical to demonstrating the practical applicability and efficacy of the proposed methods.  A comprehensive study would offer comparisons to existing algorithms, demonstrating clear improvements and showcasing the advantages of using server extrapolation strategies.

#### Numerical Experiments
A thorough analysis of the 'Numerical Experiments' section would involve examining the datasets used, ensuring their relevance and appropriateness for the research questions.  The experimental setup, including the metrics employed for evaluation and the methodologies used, needs to be meticulously examined.  **Reproducibility is key**, therefore, clear descriptions of the parameters, hardware, and software are crucial for validating the results.  **Statistical significance** testing and error analysis should be part of this evaluation, verifying the robustness of the findings.  Finally, a critical examination of the presented results is crucial, analyzing whether they support the paper's claims, along with considering any limitations or potential biases in the experimental design or data interpretation.  **A comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches** would establish the novelty and significance of the contributions.  All these combined provide a robust and thorough evaluation of the 'Numerical Experiments' section.

#### Future Research
The authors suggest several avenues for **future work**, acknowledging limitations in their current analysis.  Extending the theoretical analysis and empirical results **beyond the interpolation regime** is a critical next step, potentially requiring new variance reduction techniques. Investigating the applicability of server-side extrapolation to **non-convex problems** presents another significant challenge.  A particularly interesting direction lies in exploring the integration of server-side extrapolation with **client-specific personalization**, creating more customized models. The authors also suggest examining the use of adaptive rules, such as gradient diversity, to optimize the choice of extrapolation parameter in various settings, particularly non-convex and non-interpolated scenarios.  Finally, further investigation into the practical **computational efficiency** of the proposed adaptive extrapolation methods, especially when considering high-dimensional settings or large client participation, would significantly enhance the work's value.
