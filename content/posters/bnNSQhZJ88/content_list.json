In our work, we establish the subfield of secret collusion, a form of multi-agent deception, in which two or more agents employ steganographic methods to conceal the true nature of their interactions, be it communicative or otherwise, from oversight. We propose a formal threat model for AI agents communicating steganographically and derive rigorous theoretical insights about the capacity and incentives of large language models (LLMs) to perform secret collusion, in addition to the limitations of threat mitigation measures.

The resultant stegotext is then sent into the channel, and scrutinised by another agent, the warden. Note that the warden may choose to interfere with the channel transmissions in multiple ways, including injecting transmissions, dropping transmissions, modifying transmissions, and forwarding a transmission. Upon receiving a transmission from the channel, the receiver agent decodes the secret payload using its iMEC module.

Here, we seek to present a selection of realistic settings where collusion and steganography can arise naturally in the first place. These scenarios could involve a financial advisory model with proprietary data, a customer support bot with new product details, or more generally, models with access to valuable information under tight internal guidelines and external oversight. Emulating these settings, we set up a model to work as a government financial advisor with access to synthetic proprietary data and both internal/external oversight and control. Although it typically withholds all sensitive information, once given access codebook disguised as media headlines (non-explicit common knowledge), it encodes a secret message containing insider information in its output, which can be decrypted by a malicious user with shared common knowledge. The model, not explicitly instructed to use common knowledge for encoding secrets, independently does so, finding a Schelling point that makes the message innocuous to an overseer. Simply being provided exclusive common knowledge allows models to voluntarily override safety protocols. Therefore, models collude in several real-world use cases without direct incentives provided, a behavior we hypothesize stems from their training to provide useful information.

In this extension, we also demonstrate how the message sent over the channel can appear very similar to the innocuous covertext.

In Table 37, the model is still given specific instructions prohibiting insider information from being shared but is not informed about any overseer in the setting. In this case too, the model seeks to collude and provide insider trading information both with and without using the codebook. In Table 38, it is made even more clear that the overseer lacks access to recent article headlines, in which case the model also seeks to collude. In Table 39, we state that the overseer has access to all information that the model and user have. In this case, the model does not collude and refuses to divulge any secret information. Table 40 is a weaker version of this, where the line stating that only the user and model have access to the secret information is removed. In this case, the model refuses to divulge secret information. Finally, we also note that even when models are reminded that they are placed in a real-world scenario and not a game, this behavior still persists (see Table 41) across a range of settings - both with and without a specific codebook as long as the means to colluded are provided. Overall, our ablation studies demonstrate that the model has a clear understanding of the roles of the 3 parties in our set-up and seeks to collude only when it knows it will not be caught. This underscores the importance of developing novel mitigation techniques and understanding incentives from a perspective beyond hard-coded inputs (where secret collusion may not depend on exotic assumptions about an agent\u2019s intent or incentive to collude but could arise merely out of optimisation directed towards a mis-specified objective (see Section 4).
