Existing methods are either computationally expensive or lack accuracy. This necessitates the development of efficient and accurate uncertainty quantification methods.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel uncertainty estimation method built upon Bayesian inference. It uses a variational multi-scale approach, constructing diversified parameter space samples by leveraging scale information in 3DGS parameters. An offset table technique efficiently draws these samples.  The learned offset posterior quantifies uncertainty for each Gaussian component and improves the rendering quality. Experiments demonstrate superior calibration and rendering compared to previous methods, and the ability to remove noisy Gaussians automatically.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Baptist University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "qpeAtfUWOQ/podcast.wav"}
