However, due to the difficulty of collecting fine-grained depth labels in real scenarios, real-world depth labels are often coarse, noisy, and incomplete, resulting in a trade-off between the quality and generalization of MDE. Thus, although significant progress in zero-shot MDE has been achieved with techniques like mixing diverse training datasets [31] and unleashing large-scale unlabeled data [49], previous MDE approaches often suffer from over-smoothing of details, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1.

Compared to real data, existing synthetic RGB-D datasets exhibit lower variety and contain fewer samples which limits the generality of the learned prior. Despite several attempts to improve the generalization of diffusion-based MDE, such as label infilling [39] and transferring 2D image priors [17], current diffusion-based approaches still have relatively limited a-priori knowledge of global layout.

A variety of attempts are devoted to improving the robustness of MDE in the wild, i.e., zero-shot depth estimation, which aims to predict depth for any input image taken in unconstrained settings [3, 4, 53, 55, 52, 15, 29]. Considering that MDE is a geometrically ill-posed problem, many zero-shot MDE works are designed to estimate affine-invariant depth, i.e., predicting the depth values up to an unknown global scale and shift [31, 17, 53, 12, 49]. For example, MegaDepth [23] and DiverseDepth [51] collect internet images for network training, improving adaptation to unseen scenes. Furthermore, MiDaS [31] proposes a family of scale- and shift-invariant losses to handle the different depth representations, e.g., metric depth and inverse depth (disparity), across datasets, so as to mix diverse training datasets and reach robust zero-shot transfer. By replacing CNN backbones with powerful vision transformers, DPT [30] and Omnidata [8] further boost the performance of zero-shot depth estimation. Recently, Depth Anything developed a semi-supervised strategy to unleash the power of large-scale unlabeled images (62M) and acquire a robust representation for in-the-wild prediction [49].

The emergence of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) brought up a new paradigm for image generation, producing high-quality images with realistic details [13, 44, 34].

In the realm of MDE, DDP [16] describes a diffusion-based framework for dense visual prediction tasks, and DiffusionDepth [7] further utilizes Swin transformers [24] for image encoding, performing iterative refinement in the depth latent space. Considering the noisy and sparse depth labels in practice, several techniques are proposed, e.g., depth infilling [40] and self-supervised pre-training [39], to achieve better MDE performance. A recently emerging trend is to exploit the prior knowledge in foundational diffusion models for MDE [56, 17, 12]. Marigold [17] proposes an efficient fine-tuning protocol to leverage the rich prior in the Stable Diffusion model [34] for depth estimation, producing visually compelling depth results. Following this direction, DepthFM [12] improves inference speed with flow matching, and GeoWizard [10] utilizes cross-modal relations for joint depth and normal prediction. However, existing diffusion-based approaches still struggle to outperform the feed-forward MDE models like Depth Anything [49] (Tab. 2), due to the difficulty of learning diverse geometric depth priors from datasets with few or sparse depth labels [39].

Without depth conditioning, model #1 in Tab. 5 performs similarly to previous diffusion-based methods like Marigold [17], and struggles with generalization only from synthetic training data. By utilizing the geometric prior from the pre-trained depth estimator, model $\\#2$ achieves consistent improvements in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, as shown in Tab. 5. (ii) Global Pre-Alignment. Despite the improvements gained with depth conditioning, we find the zero-shot performance still remains below the pre-trained Depth Anything model [49]. In other words, even having good depth maps from the pre-trained model as initialization, the naive conditioning model (#2) struggles to balance the contribution of different priors and does not yield an improvement. This is because model #2 overfits the distribution of training data and under-utilizes the prior knowledge in the pre-trained model. By aligning the depth conditioning to the ground truth during training, model #3 better learns to follow the depth conditioning at a global scale and brings further improvements in zero-shot generalization. (iii) Local Patch Masking. Our full model #4, with the masked training objective, exhibits the best performance. By flitering out significantly dissimilar regions with patch masking, we ensure that BetterDepth closely adheres to depth conditioning at local scales, thus better exploiting the prior for zero-shot transfer.

Since BetterDepth comprises a pre-trained MDE model and a diffusion-based refiner, the model size is determined by the chosen architectures of both components. Apart from focusing on the utilization of large foundation models, we also plan to investigate the possibility of using more lightweight components in the BetterDepth framework, e.g., efficient U-Net [36] as the diffusion refiner, in future research to benefit efficient deployment in practice. In addition, the inference speed is also bounded by the chosen depth model and diffusion network, where the diffusion part usually poses the trade-off between speed and quality [13, 17]. Although BetterDepth could potentially boost speed using fewer ensemble members and fewer denoising steps, with slight performance drops as depicted in Fig. 7b and 7c, techniques like latent consistency models [26] could also be taken into account for further improvements. (ii) Utilization of Training Data. From the perspective of the training strategies, better pre-alignment approaches like outlier-aware methods could have more patches survive during training for better performance. Although the models trained with small datasets, e.g., BetterDepth2K in Tab. 2, already achieve comparable results to our full model, indicating that limited patches can be sufficient, better alignment methods could potentially improve patch preservation to further boost the training. (iii) Metric Depth. Finally, improving the performance of metric depth estimation [52, 15, 29] and transferring affine-invariant depth to metric depth are promising directions but pose several challenges, e.g., scale/shift ambiguity and diverse depth ranges.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
