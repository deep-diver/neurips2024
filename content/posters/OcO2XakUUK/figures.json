Figure 1a shows system accuracy versus the training sample size on a realizable synthetic dataset (Mixture-of-Gaussians). This plot demonstrates that the proposed surrogate losses (LRL2D, q=0.7 and q=1) which are theoretically realizable H-consistent significantly outperform existing surrogate losses (LCE, LOVA, Lgeneral). Figure 1b shows system accuracy versus coverage on the HateSpeech dataset with general cost functions. It illustrates that as the inference cost (\u03b2) increases, the coverage of deferral methods increase while system accuracy decreases.  The proposed LRL2D losses perform similarly to other Bayes-consistent methods.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
