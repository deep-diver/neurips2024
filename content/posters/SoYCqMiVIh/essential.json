This makes it difficult to achieve detailed, pixel-level understanding of disease mechanisms.  \n\nThis research proposes a novel method called the variational event-based model (vEBM), leveraging optimal transport to overcome these issues. The vEBM drastically speeds up the inference process, making it computationally feasible to model high-dimensional data. **It allows for pixel-level disease progression analysis**, offering a new level of granularity and interpretability. The results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrated the improved speed and accuracy, showcasing the vEBM's potential for transforming disease research.", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "SoYCqMiVIh/podcast.wav"}
