The dataset contains snapshots from I individuals, with j, k = {1,2,3,4} features and latent events; the features can be of any type and can be incomplete. B. Before inference, probabilistic models of normality and abnormality are fit to the dataset, giving the likelihood look-up tables P(Y|\u03b8P,C) (Section 2.1); these are fixed throughout inference, as denoted by the inner box outside the training loop. To infer the permutation matrix S (Section 2.2), the ELBO (Section 2.3) is optimised and S is updated each iteration using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm (Section 2.4). C. The resulting hard permutation, s, i.e., the disease event sequence, is obtained from S, using the Hungarian algorithm. We note that S represents the full distribution of event probabilities, which can be sampled to obtain uncertainty.", "description": "This figure schematically describes the variational event-based model (vEBM) using a toy dataset with four features.  Panel A shows the input data as snapshots from multiple individuals, with each feature potentially exhibiting abnormality or normality.  Panel B illustrates the inference process, where probabilistic models of normality and abnormality are first fit to the data.  The core of the inference uses the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) and iteratively update the permutation matrix (S). Panel C demonstrates how the hard permutation (s), representing the disease event sequence, is derived from the inferred permutation matrix S.
