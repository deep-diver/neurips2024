However, **optimizing ENNs is notoriously difficult**, often requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.  Existing methods address this by approximating equivariance or through careful regularization. These methods, however, don't directly address the core optimization problem, leaving room for improvement.\nThis work proposes a novel framework that tackles the optimization problem head-on. By **relaxing the hard equivariance constraint during training and progressively constraining it until reaching an equivariant solution**, they enable optimization over a significantly larger hypothesis space. This approach leads to improved generalization performance on several ENN architectures, demonstrating its effectiveness across different datasets and tasks.  The results suggest **a promising new direction for training high-performing ENNs**.
