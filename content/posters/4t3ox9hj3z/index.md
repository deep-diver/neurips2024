### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many scientific domains rely on learning dynamical systems from time series data.  However, a model with low test error may still fail to reproduce the true dynamics or associated statistical properties like Lyapunov exponents.  This is especially problematic when dealing with chaotic systems.  This paper highlights the limitations of traditional generalization analysis in this context, emphasizing the need for a new framework that captures underlying physical measures.

This paper proposes a novel ergodic theoretic approach to address this gap.  The researchers introduce dynamics-aware notions of generalization, which consider the reproduction of dynamical invariants and analyze how different types of neural network parameterizations learn these invariants.  They rigorously show how adding Jacobian information during training significantly improves statistical accuracy.  The authors verify these results on various chaotic systems, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the underlying dynamics and accurately predicting statistical moments.

> The figure compares the results of three different models for simulating the Lorenz system: the true solution, a model trained with mean-squared error (MSE), and a model trained with Jacobian information. The MSE model produces atypical orbits that deviate from the true system's behavior, while the Jacobian model accurately reproduces both the short-term and long-term dynamics, including the probability distribution of orbits. This highlights the importance of including Jacobian information during training to ensure statistical accuracy in learned dynamical systems.

> This table compares the statistical properties of the true Lorenz system against those learned by neural networks trained using two different loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Jacobian matching (JAC).  The comparison includes the Wasserstein-1 distance between the empirical distributions, the difference in Lyapunov exponents (LEs), and the difference in average states. The results show that the JAC loss leads to significantly better agreement with the true system's statistics than the MSE loss.





### In-depth insights


#### Ergodic Generalization
The concept of "Ergodic Generalization" in the context of learning dynamical systems from time series data proposes a novel framework that addresses the limitations of conventional generalization measures.  **Instead of solely focusing on prediction accuracy**, this framework emphasizes the ability of a learned model to capture the underlying statistical properties of the true dynamical system. This is crucial because a model that accurately predicts short-term behavior might fail to reproduce the system's long-term statistical properties, such as invariant measures or Lyapunov exponents. The ergodic nature of many dynamical systems is central to this concept, as it implies that time averages along a typical trajectory converge to ensemble averages. The core idea behind ergodic generalization is to ensure the learned model faithfully emulates these statistical properties, **going beyond simple point-wise prediction accuracy**. This approach leads to more robust and physically meaningful models for understanding complex dynamical systems.

#### Neural ODE Limits
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) offer a powerful approach to model dynamical systems by representing the system's evolution as a continuous-time process.  However, **NODEs are not without limitations**.  A key challenge is their sensitivity to the choice of numerical solver used for integration. Different solvers can lead to varying degrees of accuracy, and the choice of solver can significantly impact the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.  **The expressiveness of NODEs can also be limited**, especially when modeling complex dynamics with high dimensionality or intricate interactions.  Furthermore, training NODEs effectively can be computationally expensive, particularly when dealing with long time series.  **Careful consideration must be given to hyperparameter tuning**, and training stability is often a concern. Finally, **a theoretical understanding of NODEs' generalization properties remains incomplete**, making it difficult to provide guarantees on the accuracy of their predictions, particularly in chaotic systems.  These various limitations highlight the importance of further research to fully understand the potential and pitfalls of using NODEs in practice.

#### Jacobian Regularization
Jacobian regularization, in the context of training neural networks for dynamical systems, is a crucial technique for enhancing the models' ability to capture the underlying dynamics accurately.  **It addresses the issue of generalization failure**, where models with low test error still fail to reproduce the true system's behavior, particularly its long-term statistical properties and invariants like Lyapunov exponents.  By incorporating Jacobian information (the derivative of the vector field) into the loss function, the training process is directly guided to learn not only the system's trajectory but also its sensitivity to perturbations. This helps ensure that the learned model better emulates the true system's behavior, **improving the statistical accuracy of its predictions**.  **The results indicate that adding Jacobian information significantly increases the accuracy of statistical measures (probability distributions and Lyapunov exponents)** and the fidelity of reproduced attractors, demonstrating the effectiveness of this regularization for learning complex dynamical systems.

#### Shadowing Dynamics
Shadowing dynamics, in the context of chaotic systems, refers to the remarkable ability of a slightly perturbed trajectory to remain close to an actual trajectory of the system for an extended period.  **This concept is crucial for understanding the reliability of numerical simulations and data-driven models of complex, chaotic systems.**  In such systems, small errors in initial conditions or numerical integration can rapidly amplify, leading to significant divergence. Shadowing theory provides a framework for assessing whether a numerically computed or learned trajectory faithfully represents the underlying dynamics, even if it's not exactly the same.  **The existence and prevalence of shadowing orbits are central to the concept of statistical accuracy of learned models of chaotic systems.**  Models which reproduce relevant statistical properties like Lyapunov exponents or invariant measures while failing to perfectly match individual orbits demonstrate the significance of the shadowing property in capturing the essence of the dynamics.  **This notion is tightly connected to the broader question of generalization in machine learning applications.**  A model's ability to generate statistically accurate results, rather than exact reproductions of training data, is essential for many applications and reflects the fundamental robustness of the underlying dynamical system.

#### Generative Models
Generative models offer a powerful approach to learning complex systems by directly modeling the underlying probability distribution of the data.  Unlike discriminative methods that focus on prediction, generative models aim to capture the essence of the system's dynamics, enabling both sampling of new states and analysis of the system's inherent structure.  **In the context of chaotic systems, generative models can be particularly useful in representing the complex, high-dimensional probability distributions that often characterize these systems.**  However, standard generative models may not fully capture temporal dynamics; they might not accurately reproduce dynamical invariants like Lyapunov exponents, and might struggle with issues like training instability in the presence of chaotic behavior. **Dynamic generative models, which explicitly incorporate the temporal dynamics into the generative process, offer a promising solution to these challenges.**  These models combine the power of generative modeling with the ability to reproduce dynamical properties, potentially leading to a better understanding and simulation of chaotic systems.  The success of such models hinges on appropriate choices of architectures and training methods that can effectively manage the complexities introduced by the chaotic nature of the underlying systems. **Future research could explore the development of novel generative models specifically tailored to chaotic dynamics, along with rigorous theoretical analysis to assess their ability to capture and reproduce key features of the system.**

> This figure compares the learned and true Lyapunov exponents (LEs) for the Lorenz '63 system.  The LEs were computed using the QR algorithm over 30,000 time steps, starting from 10,000 random initial states.  The 'MSE' LEs are from a neural ODE model trained with mean squared error loss, while the 'JAC' LEs are from a model trained with a Jacobian loss function (which includes Jacobian information).  The plot shows that the Jacobian-trained model ('JAC') more accurately reproduces the true LEs, particularly the stable LE, which is negative. This result demonstrates the importance of Jacobian information for learning statistically accurate models of chaotic systems.
