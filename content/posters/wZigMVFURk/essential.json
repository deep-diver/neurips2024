This is because the discrete sampling of points fails to capture the continuous nature of PDEs. \nTo address this, RoPINN introduces a novel region optimization paradigm. By extending the optimization process from individual points to their continuous neighboring regions, RoPINN leverages a simple Monte Carlo sampling to improve accuracy and generalizability, effectively calibrating the sampling process to ensure both optimization and generalization. Extensive experimental results on various PDEs demonstrate RoPINN's efficacy and broad applicability across different PINN architectures, improving the state-of-the-art performance without any increase in computational overhead.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "wZigMVFURk/podcast.wav"}
