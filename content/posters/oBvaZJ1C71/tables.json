It shows the quality diversity score (QD), the number of playable games, and the number of games with fitness above 0.5, both in all cells of the archive and only in novel cells (cells not occupied by games in the initial dataset). The results are averaged across three independent runs and highlight GAVEL's success in generating high-fitness games, especially in under-explored regions of the game space.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "oBvaZJ1C71/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: The proportion of mutations generated from training-set and validation-set games that are novel, compilable, and both novel and compilable.
