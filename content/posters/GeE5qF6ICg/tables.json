The classification layers are placed on top of two different unsupervised feature extraction networks (STDP-CSNN and SoftHebb-CNN).  The table shows the mean and standard deviation of accuracy, achieved across 10-fold cross-validation, for various methods (R-STDP, SSTDP, S2-STDP) and variations using the proposed Neuronal Competition Group (NCG) architecture. The number of neurons per class is varied to evaluate the impact on performance.  The results illustrate the improvement in accuracy achieved through the use of the NCG architecture, especially when combined with the S2-STDP training rule.", "section": "5.2 Accuracy Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "GeE5qF6ICg/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Accuracy of spiking classification layers trained with STDP-based methods, on top of Hebbian-based unsupervised feature extractors.", "description": "This table presents the classification accuracy results achieved using different supervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) training methods on a spiking classification layer.
