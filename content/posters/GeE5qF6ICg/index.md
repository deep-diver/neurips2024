### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks. However, training SNNs using local learning rules like Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) remains a challenge. While unsupervised STDP with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition is effective for feature extraction, applying it to supervised classification poses difficulties due to unbalanced competition. This limits the ability of SNNs to accurately learn various class-specific patterns.

This research introduces Neuronal Competition Groups (NCGs), which improve the classification capabilities of SNNs trained with supervised STDP. NCGs use a two-compartment threshold mechanism for balanced competition regulation within each class. Experimental results on image datasets demonstrate that NCGs significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised STDP rules by learning multiple patterns per class. This makes it possible to achieve comparable accuracy to fully-supervised methods with improved efficiency.

> üîº This figure illustrates the architecture of a spiking classification layer using Neuronal Competition Groups (NCGs). Each class has its own NCG, a group of neurons that compete for activation using intra-class Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition.  Lateral inhibition ensures that only the first neuron to spike in the group wins and receives a weight update, based on a temporal error signal. A competition regulation mechanism, based on adaptive thresholds, ensures fair competition among neurons within each NCG. This method allows for learning of multiple class-specific patterns per class.

> Figure 1: Spiking classification layer with Neuronal Competition Groups (NCGs). In this layer, each class is mapped to an NCG and the prediction is based on the first spike. An NCG is a group of M neurons connected with lateral inhibition to enable intra-class WTA competition: the first neuron to fire inhibits the other ones and undergoes a weight update based on a temporal error (which depends on the learning rule considered). The sign and amplitude of the error pushes neurons to fire earlier (positive sign) or later (negative sign). Competition regulation occurs only within the NCG mapped to the class of the input sample to ensure balanced competition among neurons on samples of their class. NCGs improve the classification capabilities of a layer by promoting the learning of various patterns per class.

### In-depth insights


#### Supervised STDP
Supervised Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a crucial advancement in spiking neural network (SNN) training, addressing the limitations of traditional backpropagation.  **Instead of relying on global error signals, supervised STDP leverages local learning rules**, modifying synaptic weights based on the precise timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes, along with an error signal. This approach offers significant advantages for neuromorphic hardware implementation due to its inherent locality and biological plausibility.  Several variations of supervised STDP have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses concerning accuracy, efficiency, and compatibility with different coding schemes.  A key challenge in supervised STDP, particularly when combined with winner-takes-all (WTA) competition, lies in achieving balanced learning across neurons within a class, preventing the dominance of certain neurons and ensuring the learning of diverse patterns per class. This necessitates sophisticated competition regulation mechanisms to promote robust and effective learning. The exploration and development of robust and efficient supervised STDP algorithms are central to realizing the potential of SNNs for energy-efficient and biologically-inspired computing.

#### NCG Architecture
The Neuronal Competition Group (NCG) architecture is a novel approach to enhance spiking neural network (SNN) classification.  **NCGs improve classification by promoting the learning of diverse patterns within each class.**  Instead of a single neuron per class, an NCG comprises multiple neurons that compete internally (intra-class WTA), learning distinct features. A key innovation is the **two-compartment threshold mechanism**, regulating this competition.  One threshold governs decision-making during inference, ensuring fairness; the other adapts during training, balancing competition among neurons. This dual-threshold system prevents unfair dominance by a single neuron, leading to **improved accuracy and better generalization**. The NCG architecture is combined with state-of-the-art supervised STDP rules, demonstrating significant accuracy gains across diverse image recognition benchmarks.

#### Competition Regulation
The sub-heading 'Competition Regulation' highlights a critical aspect of the proposed Neuronal Competition Group (NCG) architecture.  Standard Winner-Takes-All (WTA) mechanisms in supervised learning scenarios often lead to **imbalanced competition**, where a single neuron dominates, hindering the learning of diverse patterns within a class. The authors ingeniously address this by introducing a **two-compartment threshold system**.  Each neuron possesses a fixed threshold for decision-making and a dynamic threshold for weight updates, activated only for samples of its class. This clever design promotes balanced intra-class competition by ensuring that neurons aren't unfairly disadvantaged due to varying thresholds.  The **adaptive threshold adjustment** further refines this balance, preventing a single neuron from monopolizing updates, resulting in a more robust and effective learning process. This mechanism is crucial for improved class separation and overall classification accuracy, as demonstrated by experimental results, making it a significant contribution to supervised spike-based learning.

#### Experimental Results
The Experimental Results section of a research paper is crucial for demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods.  A strong presentation would begin with a clear description of the experimental setup, including datasets used, evaluation metrics, and the parameters of the methods. It's vital to show a rigorous comparison with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating a clear improvement.  **Statistical significance** should be rigorously established using appropriate methods, and the results should be clearly visualized via graphs and tables.  **Ablation studies**, systematically removing components of the model, help isolate the contribution of each part.  **Error analysis** can further enhance understanding of strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, a discussion of limitations and potential future work based on the observations would strengthen the results section.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the NCG architecture to multi-layer networks** is crucial, requiring investigation into effective inter-layer competition mechanisms.  The current single-layer implementation provides a strong foundation, but a multi-layer approach would unlock the potential for processing more complex data and achieving significantly improved performance.  Further exploration of the **interaction between NCGs and diverse STDP learning rules** beyond the ones tested here (R-STDP, SSTDP, S2-STDP) should yield valuable insights into optimized learning strategies. Investigating **alternative competition regulation mechanisms** that offer enhanced balance and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead presents another exciting challenge.  Finally, a comprehensive examination of the **generalizability of NCGs across various datasets and tasks**, moving beyond image classification to other domains such as time series analysis or natural language processing, would solidify its practical applicability and broaden its impact.
