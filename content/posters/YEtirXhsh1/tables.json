The comparison is based on two commonly used detectors: SECOND-IOU and PointPillars.  For each scenario and detector, the table shows the Average Precision (AP) in Bird's Eye View (BEV) and 3D Box IoU, both for the source-only model and the adapted models.  The \"Closed Gap\" columns show the improvement achieved by each method over the source-only baseline.
