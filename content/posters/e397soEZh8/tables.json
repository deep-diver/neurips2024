The ablations include removing the Taylor expansion, Tree Positional Encoding (Tree PE), and variable resolution.  A baseline Transformer model is also included for comparison.

It compares the model's performance across three different datasets (stdlib:ID, stdlib:OOD, Unimath, and TypeTopology), each representing a different level of difficulty and distribution of data. The table reports the Average Precision (AVEP) and R-Precision (R-PREC), which are standard metrics for ranking tasks, for different model variations with ablations to components of the architecture such as Taylor expansion, positional encoding, and variable resolution. The results show the effect of each component on overall performance across all datasets, highlighting the model's robustness and the importance of each architectural choice.", "section": "5.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "e397soEZh8/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Model performance under different ablations across all evaluation sets.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative evaluation of the QUILL model's performance on premise selection tasks across three different datasets: stdlib:ID (in-distribution), stdlib:OOD (out-of-distribution), Unimath, and TypeTopology.  The table shows the average precision (AVEP) and R-precision (R-PREC) metrics for the QUILL model under various ablations.  The ablations involve removing or modifying key components of the model, such as the Taylor expansion, tree positional encoding, and variable resolution. By comparing the performance of the full model against these ablated versions, the authors assess the contribution of each component to the overall performance. The results highlight the importance of each structural component of the model for achieving high performance.", "section": "5.2 Results"}]
