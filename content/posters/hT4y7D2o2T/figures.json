Two modalities (e.g., microscopy images and gene expression data) are shown.  Separate classifiers estimate propensity scores for each modality, reflecting the shared information between the modalities and a treatment variable (t).  These scores are then used to match samples across modalities within each treatment group, effectively creating pseudo-paired data by finding samples with similar propensity scores despite coming from different data sources.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "hT4y7D2o2T/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Visualization of propensity score matching for two modalities (e.g., Microscopy images and RNA expression data).
