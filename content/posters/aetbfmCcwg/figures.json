(orange solid vertical line) of the ground truth distribution P (orange solid curve) from synthetic data. (1) First, a random sample of original data of size n with empirical distribution Pn (orange histogram) is collected from this ground truth. Theory on asymptotic linearity prescribes that the sample mean (orange dashed vertical line) will deviate from the population mean by order of 1 over root-n (grey arrow). (2) Subsequently, a deep generative model is trained on these original data, yielding an estimated distribution Pn (blue solid curve). Its mean (blue solid vertical line) may in turn differ from the original sample mean by an order larger than 1 over root-n (red arrow), which is referred to as regularisation bias in Decruyenaere et al. (2024). (3) Finally, synthetic data of size m (here m = n) are sampled from the estimated distribution Pn, forming the empirical distribution Pm = Pm (blue histogram with sample mean indicated by the blue dashed vertical line). The mean of both distributions Pn and Pm will again differ by order of 1 over root-m (green arrow). Ideally, the data analyst, who uses the synthetic data to estimate 0(P) by 0(Pm), needs to take into account these three sources of random variability. (4) The large sample behaviour of the synthetic data estimator 0(Pm) is depicted by repeating the above procedure multiple times across increasing sample sizes of n = m and storing each estimate of the synthetic sample mean. Although the estimator remains unbiased for (P) (dashed line), its empirical standard error becomes larger than in the original data due to the additional sources of variability. However, the correction factor \u221a1 + m/n to the model-based standard error previously proposed by Raab et al. (2016) only captures the original data sampling variability (grey funnel) and a lower bound of the synthetic data sampling variability (green funnel), while the uncertainty associated with the regularisation bias (red funnel) remains unaccounted for. Since it cannot readily be expressed analytically, our debiasing strategy will eliminate the latter by shifting the mean of the distribution 0(Pn) estimated by the generative model towards the original sample mean (thereby removing the red arrow and funnel). Additionally, choosing synthetic sample sizes of m \u2192 \u221e will shrink the synthetic data sampling variability (ultimately removing the green arrow and funnel), such that the synthetic data estimator exhibits similar large sample behaviour as in original data.", "description": "This figure illustrates the three sources of uncertainty when using synthetic data generated by a deep generative model to estimate a population parameter.  It shows how the sample mean from original data, the estimated mean from a trained generative model, and the sample mean from synthetic data generated by that model will all differ from the true population parameter.
