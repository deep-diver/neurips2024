### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) evaluation is currently hindered by two major problems: many samples don't require visual understanding, and unintentional data leakage occurs during training.  This leads to misjudgments about actual multi-modal improvements and misguides research. 

To address this, the authors introduce MMStar, a new benchmark with 1500 carefully selected samples.  These samples are designed to be purely vision-dependent, minimize data leakage, and challenge the advanced multi-modal capabilities of LVLMs.  Furthermore, they propose two new metrics: multi-modal gain and multi-modal leakage, to provide more accurate measurements of LVLMs' true performance and data leakage during training.

### In-depth insights


#### LVLM Evaluation Issues
Current Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) evaluation methods suffer from two key issues.  First, many benchmark datasets include questions whose answers **do not require visual input**, relying instead on general world knowledge readily available to strong Language Models (LMs). This inflates reported LVLM performance and obscures the true contribution of the visual modality. Second, there's significant evidence of **unintentional data leakage** in both LM and LVLM training datasets, leading to LMs and LVLMs successfully answering visually-dependent questions without access to the image. This data leakage misrepresents true multi-modal capabilities and undermines the reliability of the benchmarks. Addressing these issues demands the creation of new benchmarks with meticulously curated samples, carefully designed to be truly vision-dependent and free from leakage, along with more sophisticated evaluation metrics that account for these problems.  Only then can researchers fairly assess the progress and potential of LVLM research.

#### MMStar Benchmark
The MMStar benchmark is presented as a solution to address the shortcomings of existing vision-language model (VLM) evaluation methods.  **Current benchmarks suffer from two key issues**: reliance on samples where visual content is unnecessary for accurate response, and unintentional data leakage during LLM and VLM training.  MMStar is meticulously constructed to mitigate these problems.  It features **1500 human-selected samples**, ensuring each requires genuine multi-modal understanding.  The benchmark's structure, emphasizing **6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes**, provides a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of VLM capabilities. Two novel metrics, multi-modal gain and multi-modal leakage, are also introduced to measure actual performance improvements and data contamination, offering a more robust and informative evaluation framework.  The rigorous curation process and focus on vision-critical samples differentiates MMStar, potentially establishing a new standard for VLM evaluation.

#### Multimodal Gain/Leakage
The concept of "Multimodal Gain/Leakage" in evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) is crucial.  **Multimodal gain** quantifies the genuine performance improvement achieved by integrating visual information into the model.  This is distinct from the performance of the language model alone.  **Multimodal leakage**, on the other hand, highlights the issue of unintended data memorization during training. This leakage manifests when models answer questions correctly even without visual input, indicating they've memorized answers from their training data. Accurate evaluation necessitates careful consideration of both aspects.  A benchmark that successfully isolates genuinely multimodal capabilities from the effects of data leakage provides more robust and reliable evaluations, preventing misleading conclusions regarding the actual benefits of multimodal training. Therefore, **measuring both multimodal gain and leakage is essential for a fair assessment of LVLMs**.

#### MMStar Analysis
MMStar analysis in this research paper would deeply investigate the performance of various Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on a newly developed benchmark dataset.  **A key aspect would be assessing the models' ability to correctly answer questions that require genuine visual understanding**, as opposed to relying on textual information or memorized data.  The analysis would likely involve **comparing the performance of different LVLMs across various dimensions of multi-modal capabilities**, potentially revealing strengths and weaknesses of individual models.  **Crucially, the analysis would incorporate novel metrics designed to measure data leakage and actual multi-modal gain**, providing a more accurate evaluation that accounts for unintentional memorization of training data.  The results could **highlight the state-of-the-art in LVLM performance, identify areas for improvement in model design, and inform the development of better benchmark datasets.**  Ultimately, this section would serve as a central element to assess the true capacity and reliability of the current generation of LVLMs.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could involve **expanding the MMStar benchmark** to include a broader range of visual tasks and complexities, **addressing the limitations** highlighted in the current study.  Further investigation into **mitigating data leakage** during the training of LLMs and LVLMs is crucial. This might involve exploring novel training techniques or developing more robust evaluation methodologies.  A key area for future exploration would be **developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics** capable of not only assessing accuracy but also quantifying the nuances of multi-modal understanding such as reasoning and knowledge integration. Finally, it will be valuable to delve into the **broader societal implications** of increasingly powerful LVLMs, with a focus on mitigating potential biases, ensuring fairness, and addressing ethical concerns.

> The figure shows the percentage of questions in several popular multi-modal benchmarks that could be answered correctly by most LLMs without using any visual input.  It illustrates the prevalence of samples where visual content is unnecessary, highlighting a shortcoming in the design of these benchmarks.  The high hit rates (ScienceQA at 57.2%, AI2D at 46.2%) indicate that a significant portion of these benchmarks primarily assess LLMs' textual capabilities rather than true multi-modal reasoning.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/evP9mxNNxJ/figures_6_1.jpg)

> This figure shows the process of curating the MMStar benchmark dataset.  The left panel (a) illustrates the data reduction steps from 22,401 initial samples to the final 1,500 samples through a coarse filter and manual review process. The right panel (b) displays the composition of MMStar, showing its six core capabilities (inner ring), eighteen detailed axes (outer ring), and the number of samples per axis (middle ring).

> The figure is a scatter plot showing the average performance of various LLMs on the MMStar benchmark against the number of parameters in each model.  The plot demonstrates that, despite differences in model size and architecture, most LLMs achieve performance very close to that of a random baseline (indicated by the dashed horizontal line). This suggests that visual content is crucial for solving the MMStar benchmark, as the LLMs are unable to leverage their language understanding capabilities alone to provide accurate answers. The best-performing LLM, Qwen1.5-1.8B, still only achieves a score only slightly above the random baseline.

Panel (b) shows cases where the question implies the answer, making the image irrelevant. Panel (c) illustrates samples unintentionally present in LLM training data, allowing LLMs to answer without visual input. Panel (d) shows samples that LVLMs can solve without images, suggesting leakage into LVLM training data.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/evP9mxNNxJ/figures_18_1.jpg)

> This figure shows four examples of problems found in existing multi-modal benchmark datasets. The problems highlighted are: 1. Visual content is unnecessary for many samples. The answers can be directly inferred from the questions and options, or the world knowledge embedded in LLMs. 2. Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. LLMs and LVLMs could still answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content, indicating the memorizing of these samples within large-scale training data.
