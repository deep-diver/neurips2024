While effective, using a constant step-size in SA introduces a bias, meaning the algorithm doesn't converge exactly to the desired solution but rather oscillates around it. This bias is particularly problematic in machine learning applications and can significantly impact the accuracy of the results.  This paper focuses on constant-step SA algorithms with Markovian noise (where the noise follows a Markov chain), a setting frequently encountered in real-world applications. Previous research often overlooked the dependency of noise on algorithm parameters; this study explicitly addresses this dependency. \nThe researchers propose a novel method to precisely quantify this bias using infinitesimal generator comparisons and semi-groups.  They show that under specific conditions, the bias is of order O(\u03b1), where \u03b1 is the step size.  Furthermore, they demonstrate that using a time-averaged approach (Polyak-Ruppert averaging) reduces the bias to O(\u03b1\u00b2). They validate their findings through numerical simulations, showcasing that a Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique can significantly reduce bias and enhance algorithm accuracy. **This is a significant contribution as it provides a framework for understanding and controlling the bias in a common type of SA algorithm.** **The findings provide valuable tools for improving the performance of stochastic algorithms across a variety of applications.**", "affiliation": "Univ.
