### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep equilibrium models (DEQ) offer superior parameter efficiency but suffer from high computational costs during inference due to iterative fixed-point calculations.  Existing acceleration strategies, like fixed-point reuse and early stopping, address this issue inefficiently by applying uniform controls across all dimensions.  This paper identifies the phenomenon of 'heterogeneous convergence', where different dimensions converge at different speeds. This phenomenon is exploited by DeltaDEQ to selectively skip computation in already-converged dimensions. 

DeltaDEQ introduces a delta updating rule that caches intermediate linear operation results, recalculating only if activation changes exceed a threshold.  Experiments show remarkable FLOPs reduction (84% for INR, 73-76% for optical flow) across various datasets while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-update DEQ models.  The method proves orthogonal to existing acceleration techniques and generalizes beyond DEQ models. The code is publicly available.

### In-depth insights


#### DeltaDEQ: Heterogeneous Convergence
The concept of "DeltaDEQ: Heterogeneous Convergence" introduces a novel approach to accelerate deep equilibrium model (DEQ) training and inference.  It leverages the observation that **different dimensions of the hidden state converge at varying speeds** during iterative updates in DEQs. This heterogeneity is then exploited by DeltaDEQ via a **sparse update mechanism**, where computations are skipped for dimensions already deemed converged, leading to significant FLOPs reduction.  The key is identifying and utilizing this **asynchronous convergence behavior** to optimize the computational cost of the fixed-point iteration.  DeltaDEQ's effectiveness is empirically demonstrated across diverse tasks, showcasing its potential for broader applications in implicit neural networks and iterative methods generally. The method appears particularly efficient when combined with other acceleration techniques, such as fixed-point reuse.

#### Delta Rule Acceleration
Delta Rule Acceleration is a novel method to enhance computational efficiency in deep equilibrium models by leveraging the **heterogeneous convergence** phenomenon.  The core idea is that different dimensions of the hidden state converge at varying speeds. By identifying and exploiting this disparity, Delta Rule Acceleration selectively skips computations for already-converged dimensions. This is achieved through a **delta updating rule**, storing past linear operations and propagating state activations only when changes exceed a threshold.  This method shows **substantial FLOPs reduction** across various tasks like implicit neural representation and optical flow estimation while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method's orthogonality to existing acceleration techniques like fixed-point reuse makes it a valuable addition to the DEQ model optimization arsenal. **Further research** should explore the method's effectiveness across a wider range of architectures and datasets, potentially leading to even greater improvements in computational efficiency.

#### INR & OF Experiments
The 'INR & OF Experiments' section likely details the application of the proposed DeltaDEQ method to two distinct tasks: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) and Optical Flow (OF) estimation.  **INR experiments** would probably involve training DeltaDEQ on image datasets to reconstruct images from input coordinates, comparing its performance (reconstruction quality, computational efficiency) against existing INR techniques.  **Optical flow experiments** would focus on evaluating DeltaDEQ's ability to accurately predict pixel motion between video frames, potentially using benchmarks like Sintel and KITTI. The authors would likely highlight **performance improvements** offered by DeltaDEQ in terms of FLOPs reduction and speedup while maintaining comparable accuracy to baseline DEQ methods.  The discussion would probably analyze the heterogeneous convergence phenomenon within the context of both tasks, showing how DeltaDEQ effectively leverages this characteristic for computational gains.  Key metrics for evaluation would likely include PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for INR and AEPE (Average Endpoint Error) for OF, along with FLOP counts and inference time comparisons.

#### Limitations and Future
The paper's core contribution, DeltaDEQ, demonstrates significant FLOPs reduction in deep equilibrium models by exploiting heterogeneous convergence.  **A key limitation is the reliance on sparsity**, which may not consistently materialize across diverse datasets or model architectures. While effective in RNN and CNN-based models, the generalization to transformer networks requires further investigation.  **Hardware practicality for sparse convolutions is another limitation**, necessitating specialized hardware for optimal performance gains.  **Future work should focus on addressing this hardware limitation**, potentially through optimized sparse convolution libraries or tailored hardware designs.  Furthermore, research into adaptive thresholding mechanisms and more robust sparsity prediction techniques could enhance performance and expand applicability.  **Investigating DeltaDEQ's effectiveness in scenarios with temporal correlations beyond video frames** is also warranted.  Finally, exploring the application of DeltaDEQ to a broader range of implicit models and optimization methods beyond fixed-point iteration is an important direction for future development.

#### Related Works
The 'Related Works' section would ideally delve into existing acceleration techniques for implicit neural networks, **contrasting and comparing them to the proposed DeltaDEQ method.**  It should discuss methods that exploit temporal correlations in input data, such as fixed-point reuse or early stopping, highlighting their limitations and how DeltaDEQ addresses them.  **A detailed comparison with other sparsity-inducing techniques, such as layer skipping or activation pruning,** would provide valuable context, emphasizing DeltaDEQ's unique focus on heterogeneous convergence and its ability to achieve sparsity without sacrificing expressiveness.  Furthermore, a thorough analysis of existing DEQ models and their limitations regarding computational cost during inference is crucial, illustrating how DeltaDEQ offers a novel approach to overcome these challenges.  Finally, the discussion should clearly articulate how DeltaDEQ **differs from and improves upon prior work**, highlighting its potential advantages and unique contributions to the field.

Only the non-zero elements of ‚àÜzi participate in the MxV operation, significantly reducing computations.  The cached results from the previous iteration are added to further improve efficiency.
