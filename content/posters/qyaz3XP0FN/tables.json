Metrics: e.e. is the relative error in electric energy, see (25); for the Sinkhorn divergence, see Appendix B.5.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the proposed Higher-Order Action Matching (HOAM) method with two different quadrature rules (Simpson's and Gauss-Legendre) against three other state-of-the-art methods (CFM, NCSM, and AM) across six different examples of parametric dynamical systems.  The metrics used for comparison are the relative error in the electric energy (e.e.) and the inference runtime (r.t.).  The table demonstrates HOAM's superior performance in terms of both accuracy and speed.", "section": "Numerical experiments"}]
