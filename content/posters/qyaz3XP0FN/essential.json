Existing methods like score-based diffusion and flow-based modeling face challenges in handling high-dimensional systems, requiring multiple inference steps and struggling to generalize across parameters.  These methods also typically focus on individual trajectories, whereas studying the overall population behavior might be more efficient. \nThis paper introduces a novel method, Higher-Order Action Matching (HOAM), which learns a reduced model of population dynamics by leveraging optimal transport theory. HOAM infers parameter-dependent gradient fields that approximate population dynamics, then uses these to rapidly generate sample trajectories.  The method uses higher-order quadrature rules and Monte Carlo sampling to accurately estimate the objective from sample data and stabilize training, achieving accurate predictions with orders of magnitude speedups in inference compared to traditional methods and outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qyaz3XP0FN/podcast.wav"}
