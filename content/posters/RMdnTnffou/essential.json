Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve interpretability by relating predictions to human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs have limitations such as reliance on pre-defined concepts and insufficient granularity. This research tackles these issues.\nThis paper proposes Coarse-to-Fine Concept Bottleneck Models (CF-CBMs), a novel hierarchical framework that addresses the limitations of traditional CBMs.  CF-CBMs leverage vision-language models for concept discovery, employing a data-driven Bayesian approach for concept selection at both a coarse level (whole image) and fine level (image patches).  **Experimental results show CF-CBMs significantly outperform existing approaches in classification accuracy** and demonstrate improved interpretability through a new evaluation metric (Jaccard Index).", "affiliation": "Inria", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "RMdnTnffou/podcast.wav"}
