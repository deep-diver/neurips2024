Current SNN implementations typically use the firing rate or average membrane potential as output, limiting their potential. This paper addresses these issues.\nThe paper proposes a **learnable initial membrane potential (IMP)** to generate additional firing patterns, accelerating membrane potential evolution. It introduces a **Last Time Step (LTS) approach** to accelerate convergence in static tasks and a **label-smoothed Temporal Efficient Training (TET) loss** to address optimization-regularization conflicts.  These methods yield significant accuracy improvements on ImageNet and state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "College of Artificial Intelligence, Southwest University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6AepMNrz7a/podcast.wav"}
