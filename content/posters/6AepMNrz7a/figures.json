The horizontal and vertical axes in the figure represent all possible spike patterns (16 total) that IF neurons may receive and emit. The white squares indicate that IF neuron can receive the spike pattern from the horizontal axis and emit a spike pattern on the vertical axis, known as pattern mapping.", "description": "This figure visualizes the mapping between input and output spike patterns of an Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neuron over four time steps.  Each axis represents all 16 possible spike patterns (combinations of 0s and 1s over four time steps). White squares indicate successful mappings: a specific input pattern (horizontal axis) leads to a specific output pattern (vertical axis). The three subfigures (a, b, c) show how adjusting the initial membrane potential (IMP) influences the number and types of possible mappings.  (a) shows the mappings with IMP set to 0.0, (b) shows it with IMP set to 0.25, and (c) with a learnable IMP.  The changes demonstrate how the IMP affects the neuron's ability to generate a diverse set of spike patterns and map input patterns to outputs.", "section": "3.2 Membrane Dynamics Related to IMP"}, {"figure_path": "6AepMNrz7a/figures/figures_4_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: The test accuracy at each time step on the CIFAR10 dataset.", "description": "The figure shows the test accuracy of SNNs at each time step on the CIFAR10 dataset. The accuracy is extremely low at T=1 (only 10.76%). However, as the time step T increases, the model accuracy exhibits an upward trend, exceeding 90%.  This illustrates the impact of the membrane potential's evolution on SNN accuracy during the processing of static inputs. The accuracy is directly related to the membrane potential, which is the only time-varying term in static tasks.
