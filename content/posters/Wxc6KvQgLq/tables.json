It shows the number of problems solved (coverage) by different planners, including domain-independent planners and the newly proposed learning-based planners. The table highlights the top three performing planners in each domain, using color coding to indicate performance intensity.  It also specifies that the evaluation metric is the number of solved problems, with higher values indicating better performance.  Importantly, it notes that all planners except for hMCUT are satisficing (finding any solution) planners, whereas hMCUT is an optimal planner.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Wxc6KvQgLq/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Coverage and median of expansions of solved problems for each CCWL and GNN model with varying number of iterations and layers.
