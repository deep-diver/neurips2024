In contrast, inverse optimization works \u201cin reverse\u201d by inferring the optimization objective given the optimal solution. The inherent assumption in IO is that an agent generates its decision by solving an optimization problem. The assumed optimization problem is called the Forward Optimization Problem (FOP), which is parametric in the exogenous signal $\\hat{s}$ with the corresponding optimal solution $\\hat{u}$ . Therefore, IO aims to deduce the objective function of the FOP from a dataset of exogenous signal and decision pairs, $\\{(\\hat{s}_{i},\\hat{u}_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ . In this work, we assume the constraints are known a priori. Consequently, we can leverage the FOP derived from the expert\u2019s dataset by solving it to mimic the expert\u2019s behavior when encountering new exogenous signals. IO has garnered widespread attention within several fields, giving rise to numerous studies encompassing both theoretical and applied research. Application domains include vehicle routing [11, 30, 40], transportation system modeling [28, 8], portfolio optimization [24, 38, 22], power systems [9, 15, 31], electric vehicle charging problems [16], network design [14], healthcare problems [5], as well as controller design [2].

In classic IO, only a single signal-decision pair is considered, where the decision is assumed to be the optimal solution of the FOP (i.e., there is no noise), and different classes of FOPs have been studied, such as linear conic problems [1, 35, 19]. However, in real-world applications, there are usually many observations of signal-decision pairs, and due to the presence of noise, it is usually unreasonable to assume that all observed decisions are optimal w.r.t a single, true data-generating FOP. Additionally, for complex tasks, the chosen FOP may only approximate the task, not allowing for perfect replication of the observed behavior from the expert. These cases are referred to as data-driven IO problems. In such scenarios, a loss function is usually used to compute the discrepancy between observed data and the decision generated by the learned FOP. Examples of loss functions include the 2-norm distance loss [4], suboptimality loss [24], variational inequality loss [8], KKT loss [20], and augmented suboptimality loss [39].

These methods have been extensively studied within the context of IO [34, 8] and have shown promising results for scaling IO to address practical problems. The application of kernel methods in IO allows for the exploration of a broader class of optimization problems, thereby enhancing the model\u2019s ability to generalize from observed decisions to unseen situations.

Another limitation is the absence of theoretical analysis on the convergence rate of the SSO algorithm, which we leave for future research. Furthermore, in our numerical experiments in Section 5, the proposed KIO model, even with the SSO algorithm, required substantial memory resources\u2014up to 256 GB when using 100k data points.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
