The input to the SSM includes the previous hidden state (h<sub>t-1</sub>) and the current input (x<sub>t</sub>). The input (x<sub>t</sub>) first goes through a projection layer (B<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup>) before being processed by the SSM. The SSM contains a dynamic state transition matrix (A) and an output projection layer (C<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup>). A selection mechanism determines which parts of the input sequence flow into the hidden states. The output of the SSM is the current hidden state (h<sub>t</sub>) and the current output (y<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup>). The process incorporates a discretization step (\u0394t) to handle varying time intervals in the input data.
