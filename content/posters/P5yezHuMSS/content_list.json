The model builds on the popular continuum model formalized by Azevedo and Leshno [10], where stable matchings are characterized by a cutoff structure in which applicants are matched to their favorite firm among those where their score exceeds the firm\u2019s cutoff. In the model we introduce, an applicant\u2019s score is equal to an estimated value that is a noisy realization of their true value. Under monoculture, all firms use a single shared estimate of an applicant\u2019s value; under polyculture, firms obtain separate, independently drawn estimates of the applicant\u2019s value.

One limitation of this existing work is that it does not consider market-level effects, which are present in domains such as hiring and college admissions. For example, if the total number of available positions is fixed and if firms intend to fill all of these positions, then the total rate of systemic exclusion does not change (the number of people that do not end up receiving a position is fixed).

For example, Castera et al. [13] analyzes statistical discrimination in stable matching. In their model, the values of applicants from two groups are estimated by two decision-makers, potentially with correlation (monoculture). Like us, they leverage a continuum model of applicants [10]. Their findings focus on aggregate measures of applicant-side welfare across groups. They show, for example, that the group of applicants evaluated with less correlation is matched with higher probability. More directly related to our work, they show that decreased correlation (even in one group), reduces the number of applicants who receive their top choice; this parallels our finding in Theorem 2(ii), which implies that fewer applicants are matched to their top choice under polyculture. This finding reflects a general result developed in the school choice literature: that increasing correlation in how decision-makers evaluate applicants also increases the total number of applicants matched to their top choice. It is wellestablished that in school matching, the use of a single lottery number (rather than an independent lottery per school) results in more students being matched to their top choices and is more robust to differences in the number of listed schools [2, 18, 9, 7, 5].

Consequently, we can analyze outcomes for individual applicants, whereas the markets literature primarily considers homogeneous applicants. This reveals the relevant trade-offs between monoculture and polyculture. For example, we show (Theorem 2) that increased correlation (monoculture) increases the probability that an applicant is matched to their top choice, but can also increase the probability that a high-value applicant does not match at all. Our analysis with many firms and applicants also reveals market emergent phenomena not apparent in smaller markets. In follow-up work, we show that Theorem 1 extends to a setting with arbitrary student preferences and college capacities [40].

We use the ACSIncome dataset\u2014specifically, individuals from Texas in 2018 [19]. (We also perform experiments using data from California; see Appendix C.) The ACSIncome dataset has 10 features that are used to predict a binary 0-1 outcome.7 For each of the ${\\binom{10}{2}}=45$ pairs of features, we train a logistic regression model using a 90 percent train split. We then evaluate markets where each applicant corresponds to a point in the test split. This yields markets with 13,593 total applicants, of which 5,055 have value 1 and 8,538 have value 0. We assume that there are 5 firms, each with capacity 1000, and that applicants have uniformly random preferences over these firms. Each of the 45 models yields a monoculture market in which all 5 firms use that same model to rank applicants. We let the accuracy of a single model be the average value of matched applicants in the corresponding monoculture market (i.e., the percentage of matched applicants with value 1).

For each subset, we consider the 5 corresponding monoculture markets (where each firm uses the same model to evaluate applicants), and 1 corresponding polyculture market (where each firm uses a different model). For each market, we plot (1) the average value of matched applicants (i.e., accuracy), and (2) the average firm rank among matched applicants (testing Theorems 1 and 2 respectively). These plots are given in Figure 4, where each column corresponds to one subset of 5 models. As Theorems 1 and 2 predict, polyculture outperform monoculture in terms of accuracy, but monoculture outperforms polyculture in terms of rank of applicant matches. Indeed, for 47 out of 50 subsets of models, the polyculture market is more accurate than all monoculture markets (this effect is present but less strong for California8); for 50 out of 50 subsets of models, the monoculture market produces better average applicant outcomes (indeed, matched applicants almost always match to their top choice).

We presented three main theoretical findings, which we verified in computational experiments.

A second assumption is of maximum-concentrating noise. In comparison to the homogeneous firms assumption, it should be emphasized that Theorem 1 does not necessarily generalize beyond this assumption, as suggested by some of our empirical results (see Appendix C for ML experiments for the California subset of the data). In fact, our follow-up work demonstrates that long-tailed noise results in the opposite finding in Theorem 1 [40].

Closest to our work is that of Kleinberg and Raghavan [35], who introduce a model of algorithmic monoculture in which there are two decision-makers who each hire one applicant. As in our model, decision-makers have shared true preferences over a set of applicants, instantiated as a ranked list. However, each decision-maker only has access to a noisy version of this ranked list: they each can either use an idiosyncratic noisy list or a common (but more accurate) noisy list. One decision-maker then selects the top applicant on their list. The second decision-maker chooses the top applicant on their list that has not yet been chosen. Welfare is measured by the rank of the chosen applicants according to the true preference list. Kleinberg and Raghavan [35] show that the decision-makers can be better off if they both use their idiosyncratic (more noisy) lists in comparison to using the shared list. In our work, we show that this effect becomes more pronounced when considering a large market with many decision-makers and applicants. By building on the model of Azevedo and Leshno [10], we overcome issues of tractability, while also gaining a cleaner interpretation for why the effect found in Kleinberg and Raghavan [35] holds, in terms of distributional order statistics and their effect on admission thresholds for each decision-maker. Moreover, we are able to model two-sided effects, where applicants also have preferences over decision-makers.

They define the rate of systemic failure to be the probability that a randomly drawn applicant receives a negative decision from all decision-makers. In computational experiments, they provide evidence that when decision-makers train machine learning models using the same data, the rate of systemic failure tends to increase. Toups et al. [43] document homogeneous outcomes in several commercial APIs, which they suggest could be a consequence of algorithmic monoculture arising from shared data or model usage. These empirical studies do not consider market effects such as fixed capacity constraints of decision-makers; in the setup we consider, since decision-makers have fixed capacity, the number of applicants who experience systemic failure remains constant (assuming that applicants too only \u201caccept\u201d one offer).

Moreover, the model provider does not seek to evaluate users, but rather to make predictions in their service. Jagadeesan et al.

Of course, not all domains of algorithmic decision-making share this feature. In the domains that do, our work suggests systemic exclusion is not clearly the primary concern, but rather who faces systemic exclusion, as well as the other measures of welfare (e.g., worker power). Jain et al. [31] argue that algorithmic decision-making should be viewed through the lens of opportunity pluralism [22]. A key implication of their argument is that the use of algorithmic decision-making by one or multiple decision-makers should be analyzed with respect to its impact on how opportunities are restricted at large.
