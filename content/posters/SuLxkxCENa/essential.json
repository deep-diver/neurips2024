This approach can be computationally expensive, especially for complex algorithms with many steps.  Furthermore,  the number of iterations is algorithm dependent and must be known beforehand.  These limitations hinder the scalability and efficiency of NAR models. \nThis paper introduces Deep Equilibrium Algorithmic Reasoners (DEARs), a novel approach that directly solves for the algorithm's equilibrium state using a deep equilibrium model. This method eliminates the need for iterative computations, making it significantly faster than existing NAR approaches and greatly reducing the computational cost.  DEARs achieve comparable or even superior performance to traditional NAR models on benchmark algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.  The proposed method also introduces modifications to improve robustness and stability.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "SuLxkxCENa/podcast.wav"}
