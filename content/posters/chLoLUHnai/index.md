### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Training neural networks often involves gradient descent (GD).  While theoretical analyses typically focus on small stepsizes leading to monotonic risk reduction, **large stepsizes used in practice lead to initial risk oscillations before monotonic decrease**. This discrepancy has hampered a full understanding of GD's behavior.  Existing studies fail to address this issue, especially in the context of complex, non-homogeneous neural networks.

This research investigates large stepsize GD in non-homogeneous two-layer networks. The authors demonstrate that **after an initial oscillating phase, the empirical risk decreases monotonically**, and network margins grow nearly monotonically, showing an implicit bias of GD. Importantly, they show that **large stepsize GD, incorporating the two-phased behavior, is more efficient than small stepsize GD** under suitable conditions, extending theory beyond simplified setups.

### In-depth insights


#### Large Stepsize GD
The study explores the dynamics of large stepsize gradient descent (GD) in training neural networks, particularly focusing on two-layer networks.  A key finding is the identification of two distinct phases during training: an initial phase where empirical risk oscillates, followed by a stable phase with monotonic risk decrease. This transition occurs once the empirical risk drops below a stepsize-dependent threshold. **The analysis reveals that the normalized margin grows nearly monotonically in the second phase,** indicating an implicit bias of GD towards maximizing margins, even in non-homogeneous networks.  Importantly, the research demonstrates that, with a suitably large stepsize, GD is more efficient than its small stepsize counterpart, achieving a faster convergence rate while minimizing the risk.  **The results extend the understanding of GD beyond the commonly studied small stepsize and mean-field regimes**, offering valuable insights into the practical optimization of neural networks.

#### Stable Phase Bias
The concept of "Stable Phase Bias" in the context of large stepsize gradient descent for neural network training is a compelling area of research.  It suggests that the seemingly chaotic initial phase of training, where the empirical risk fluctuates, eventually transitions to a stable phase characterized by monotonic risk decrease. **This transition is not merely a consequence of the optimization algorithm converging towards a minimum but, rather, an emergent property potentially tied to an implicit bias that favors certain solutions**.  Understanding this bias is crucial as it could explain the generalization performance observed in practice despite the non-convex nature of the loss landscape.  **Further investigation is needed to fully characterize this bias**, considering factors like network architecture, activation functions, and data properties. Determining whether this stable phase bias is fundamentally linked to max-margin solutions or represents a more general phenomenon warrants further study.  **The existence of this bias could also have significant implications for algorithm design and hyperparameter tuning**, as it may provide a theoretical basis for choosing optimal step sizes and for potentially guiding the search for efficient training strategies.  Ultimately, unravelling the mysteries of the stable phase and its underlying bias will lead to a more profound comprehension of deep learning's successes.

#### Non-Convex Loss
The concept of a non-convex loss function is central to many machine learning problems, particularly those involving neural networks.  **Non-convexity introduces challenges in optimization**, as gradient descent methods may converge to local minima instead of the global optimum, leading to suboptimal performance.  However, the same non-convexity can also be a source of strength. Recent research suggests that the implicit bias of gradient descent in non-convex landscapes can lead to surprisingly good generalization, even when the empirical risk is not fully minimized.  Understanding this interplay between optimization difficulty and generalization capability is a key focus of modern machine learning research.  **The choice of loss function and the optimization algorithm significantly impact the final model's properties**, including its bias, variance, and robustness to noisy data or adversarial examples. Therefore, analyzing the effects of non-convex loss functions requires a thorough understanding of both the optimization process and the properties of the resulting model. The ability to handle non-convexity is crucial in dealing with high-dimensional data and complex relationships.  **Further exploration of specific non-convex loss functions**, such as those based on cross-entropy or other specialized metrics, offers valuable opportunities for advancing our understanding of model behavior and improving predictive accuracy.

#### Margin Improvement
The concept of "Margin Improvement" in the context of large stepsize gradient descent for training neural networks is a crucial finding.  It demonstrates that despite the oscillations observed in the empirical risk during the initial training phase, **the normalized margin, a measure of the classifier's confidence, grows nearly monotonically once the training enters a stable phase.** This implies that even with large stepsizes, which deviate significantly from the behavior of gradient flow, the algorithm exhibits an implicit bias towards maximizing the margin. This implicit bias is particularly important because it suggests that the algorithm is not simply memorizing the data but is instead learning a more generalizable representation.  **The margin improvement is not limited to linearly separable data or homogenous networks**, signifying a broader applicability of this behavior. The analysis extends prior work which focused on small stepsize gradient descent, revealing novel insights into the optimization dynamics of large stepsize algorithms often used in practice.  **This discovery is a significant theoretical contribution to our understanding of implicit bias**, helping us bridge the gap between theory and practice in deep learning.

#### Fast Optimization
The heading 'Fast Optimization' likely discusses how the proposed method achieves faster convergence compared to traditional gradient descent.  The authors probably demonstrate that **large step sizes**, while initially causing oscillations in the empirical risk, ultimately lead to faster risk reduction in the stable phase. This is a crucial finding as it challenges the conventional wisdom of using small step sizes for GD.  The analysis likely compares the convergence rate (e.g., O(1/t¬≤) vs O(1/t)) of large vs. small step size GD, showing a significant speedup in optimization for the former. **Theoretical bounds** on the number of steps required to reach a certain risk level are presented, potentially showing the superiority of the proposed method for large-scale learning scenarios.  **Empirical results** visualizing faster training curves with large step sizes are probably also presented to support this claim. This section is critical as it offers practical advice and justifies the use of larger step sizes, which are often employed in practice but lack strong theoretical justification.

The plots illustrate the empirical risk, normalized margin, and test accuracy over training iterations. The key observation is that a larger step size leads to an initial oscillatory phase in the empirical risk, followed by a monotonic decrease, while a smaller step size results in a consistently monotonic decrease. Despite the initial oscillations, the larger step size achieves a better test accuracy and a similar final normalized margin as the smaller step size.
