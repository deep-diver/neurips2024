Existing methods often rely on strong assumptions, like Gaussian-distributed sampling vectors, which are unrealistic in practice.  Moreover, they are vulnerable to even small amounts of corrupted data. This paper directly addresses the issue of robustness in phase retrieval by introducing adversarial corruptions to the data model, making it more realistic. \nThe proposed method uses a two-step approach: first a lightweight convex program finds an initial solution, then robust gradient descent refines it. This approach achieves near-sample-optimal and nearly-linear-time performance, proving it can accurately recover the signal even when a fraction of the measurements are adversarially corrupted.  The simplicity and provable guarantees of this approach significantly advance the field, extending to other non-convex problems.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "RTaSjoxmw9/podcast.wav"}
