### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many robotic manipulation tasks require following complex, long-horizon instructions. Current approaches often struggle with ambiguity and implicit sub-tasks.  Humans excel at such tasks by visualizing subgoals during planning. 

PERIA addresses this by combining language and vision planning.  It uses a multi-modal language model (MLLM) to reason and generate imagined subgoal images which are then used to guide the robot's actions.  This holistic approach significantly improves the accuracy of instruction following and task success rate compared to methods using only language or vision planning.

> This figure illustrates the PERIA framework, which mimics human cognitive processes for complex instruction following.  It shows four stages: 1. Perceive: the robot perceives the environment and the task instruction; 2. Reason: the robot reasons out the steps required to complete the task, breaking down the complex instruction into sub-instructions; 3. Imagine: the robot imagines the intermediate subgoals and generates corresponding images; 4. Act: the robot acts according to the imagined subgoals and sub-instructions. The overall process is analogous to how humans interpret and execute complex instructions, using both logical reasoning and visual imagination.

> This table presents the success rates of different models on various long-horizon manipulation tasks.  The tasks are categorized into three benchmark datasets: LoHoRavens (Blocks&Bowls and Letters), and VIMA-BENCH.  Each dataset includes several tasks, which are further subdivided into sub-categories.  The table shows the mean success rate and standard deviation across 5 independent runs for each model and task.  The purpose is to compare the performance of PERIA (the proposed method) against several baseline methods, demonstrating its superiority in handling these complex tasks.





### In-depth insights


#### Holistic Planning
Holistic planning, in the context of robotics and AI, signifies a paradigm shift from modular, task-specific approaches to a more integrated and comprehensive strategy.  Instead of breaking down complex manipulation tasks into a series of independent sub-tasks, **holistic planning emphasizes the simultaneous consideration of all relevant factors**, including environmental perception, language understanding, and action execution.  This integrated approach mirrors human cognition, where visual imagery and logical reasoning work in tandem. **By unifying language and vision planning**, the system can generate more robust and adaptable plans that avoid the compounding errors inherent in sequential, modular methods.  The key to success lies in **multi-modal alignment**, enabling the system to seamlessly translate between language instructions and visual representations.  This holistic approach enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of task completion, making it particularly suitable for long-horizon, complex manipulation tasks that demand a higher level of adaptability and robustness.

#### Vision-Language
The intersection of vision and language in artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving field, and a crucial aspect of enabling machines to understand and interact with the world in a human-like manner. **Vision-language models (VLMs)** aim to bridge the gap between these two modalities, allowing machines to process both visual and textual information simultaneously.  This is achieved by training models on large datasets of paired images and text, enabling them to learn complex relationships between visual content and its linguistic descriptions.  **Effective VLMs are vital** for various downstream applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and robot manipulation.  One key challenge is achieving robust and accurate performance across diverse visual inputs and varying language styles.  Further research is needed to improve the **generalization and robustness of VLMs**, particularly in complex or ambiguous scenarios.  Additionally, efficient and scalable training methods are critical for developing more sophisticated and powerful VLMs that can truly understand and respond to the multimodal nature of the world.

#### MLLM Reasoning
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) represent a significant advancement in AI, enabling more nuanced reasoning capabilities compared to unimodal models.  In the context of robotic manipulation, **MLLM reasoning excels by integrating visual and textual information to understand complex instructions.**  This integration allows the model to not only parse commands literally but also to reason about the implied steps necessary for task completion. The MLLM can leverage its multimodal understanding to make inferences about object properties, spatial relationships, and the sequential nature of actions required. **A critical aspect of MLLM reasoning is its ability to handle ambiguous instructions**, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks, thus mitigating the risks of errors associated with long-horizon planning. This decomposition involves a higher level of cognitive processing, simulating elements of human planning. The ability to generate intermediate subgoals, both visually and textually, reflects the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of the MLLM. Ultimately, **effective MLLM reasoning is pivotal for achieving robust and reliable robotic manipulation** in open-ended environments.  It bridges the gap between abstract human commands and precise robotic actions, which is a considerable step towards more generalized and versatile robotic autonomy.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize enhancing PERIA's adaptability to novel environments and tasks.  **Online learning and adaptation techniques** are crucial to overcome limitations posed by reliance on pre-collected datasets.  Addressing the computational intensiveness of the current framework, including exploring **more efficient training strategies and lightweight model architectures**, is vital.  Furthermore, **thorough real-world evaluations** are necessary to assess PERIA's robustness and effectiveness in diverse, dynamic settings, accounting for factors like noisy sensors and physical constraints.  Extending PERIA's capabilities to handle increasingly complex, open-ended instructions warrants investigation, as well as exploring integration with more advanced, multimodal LLMs.  Finally, developing **comprehensive safety mechanisms** is paramount, including rigorous testing and safeguards to mitigate potential biases or unintended consequences.  These future directions aim to make PERIA a truly versatile and safe tool for robotic manipulation in the real world.

#### Task Generalization
The concept of "Task Generalization" in the context of robotic manipulation using language and vision models is crucial.  It assesses the model's ability to **successfully perform novel tasks** that were not encountered during training.  This involves evaluating performance on tasks with new objects, novel object configurations (placements), and unseen combinations of instructions and objects.  **High generalization capabilities** are essential for real-world applicability, enabling the robot to adapt to unpredictable and diverse scenarios.  The paper likely demonstrates the generalization performance of their proposed PERIA framework by testing it on unseen tasks of increasing complexity, measuring success rates and evaluating the quality of both language and vision planning components in these novel situations.  **Robustness against unseen situations** is a key aspect of generalizability, indicating the model's resilience to variations in the environment or instructions.  Strong generalization suggests a deeper understanding of the underlying principles governing manipulation rather than rote memorization of specific training examples.  The results likely showcase how the holistic approach of PERIA, integrating language and visual reasoning, contributes to superior generalization, surpassing methods relying solely on language or vision.

> This figure illustrates the PERIA framework, which consists of three main stages: Perceive, Reason, and Imagine.  In the Perceive stage, a lightweight multimodal alignment is performed on the encoding side of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to enable the model to understand both visual and textual information. In the Reason stage, instruction tuning is applied to the MLLM to allow it to generate stepwise language plans. Finally, in the Imagine stage, the MLLM is jointly trained with a diffusion model to generate coherent subgoal images that align with the language plans. An alignment loss is also used to ensure consistency between the language and vision planning.  The entire framework is trained end-to-end.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/zw2K6LfFI9/figures_5_1.jpg)

> This figure illustrates three different approaches to generating subgoal images using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM).  The first approach (a) uses visual tokens extracted from the MLLM during language planning, providing more expressive guidance than either captions (b) or decomposed instructions alone (c). In (a), the MLLM processes both language and vision and creates the visual tokens to guide the image generation model.  (b) only uses the text captions from a vision language model to generate the images. (c) shows image generation solely relying on decomposed language instructions, lacking the benefit of visual context. The figure highlights PERIA's approach which integrates language planning and visual planning for more effective subgoal image generation.

> This figure showcases three example tasks demonstrating PERIA's holistic approach to language and vision planning.  Each row represents a different task: stacking blocks by size, sorting blocks into color-matched bowls, and spelling a word using letter blocks. The left column shows the original task instruction. The middle column depicts stepwise sub-instructions generated by PERIA's language planning module, guiding the robot through sequential actions. The right column presents the corresponding subgoal images generated by the vision planning module, providing intuitive visual milestones that complement the textual instructions. The combination of language and vision planning helps the robot successfully complete these complex manipulation tasks, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency compared to methods relying solely on language or vision.

![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/zw2K6LfFI9/figures_12_1.jpg)

> This figure shows examples of how PERIA performs holistic language and vision planning for three different tasks. Each task starts with a high-level instruction (e.g., 'Stack all blocks in a pyramid and each layer in one color'). PERIA then decomposes this instruction into a sequence of stepwise sub-instructions, which are accompanied by corresponding subgoal images.  These subgoal images visually represent the intermediate states that the robot should achieve towards the completion of the task.  The combination of language and vision planning provides more intuitive and informative guidance to the robot than language-only planning, making the instruction-following process more robust and efficient.
