It shows the behavioral preference set, cost function (velocity constraint), threshold range for the velocity constraint, and the objectives of each task (a combination of speed, jumping height, and energy consumption). This information is crucial for understanding the experimental setup and the specific challenges each task presents.", "section": "5 Experiment"}]
