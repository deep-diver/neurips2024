Text-to-image Generation: A pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model generates an initial image based on the input text prompt. 2. Upsampling process: The generated image is upscaled (in this use case by a factor x4) and encoded into the latent space to guide the creation of a higher-resolution image. 3. Image guidance preparation: The encoded image is degraded through the diffusive forward model, creating the guidance latents. 4. Image generation: the Slider (indicated by a blue line) adjusts the extent of guidance. Left of Slider (Guided Generation): guidance latents control the image generation. The framework fuses guidance latents (green patches) with high-resolution latents (purple patches) using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). The phases are averaged and combined with the amplitude, then transformed back via the inverse FFT (iFFT). A chess-like mask integrates information from the successive guidance step (orange), resulting in fully processed patches (cyan).
