However, generating images at ultra-high resolutions remains challenging due to the high computational costs associated with scaling up pre-trained models.  Existing methods often necessitate multiple GPUs or extensive training, resulting in limitations in accessibility and scalability. This research paper tackles the problem of generating high-resolution images efficiently using a single GPU. \nThis paper introduces Pixelsmith, a novel framework that addresses the challenges of high-resolution image generation. Pixelsmith employs a cascading approach, using the output of lower-resolution generation as a baseline for higher-resolution sampling. A key innovation is the introduction of the 'Slider,' a mechanism that allows dynamic control over the balance between structural integrity and fine-grained detail enhancement. By denoising patches instead of the entire latent space, Pixelsmith minimizes memory requirements, making gigapixel image generation feasible on a single GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that Pixelsmith significantly improves image quality, diversity, and sampling speed, surpassing the limitations of existing approaches.", "affiliation": "University of Glasgow", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "Ffb30OVVCa/podcast.wav"}
