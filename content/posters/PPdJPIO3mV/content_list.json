One recent and effective strategy is to merge token representations within Transformer models, aiming to reduce computational and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. Prior works have proposed algorithms based on Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM), which divides tokens into distinct sets and merges the top $k$ similar tokens. However, these methods have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to tokensplitting strategies and damage to informative tokens in later layers. This paper presents a novel paradigm called PITOME, which prioritizes the preservation of informative tokens using an additional metric termed the energy score. This score identifies large clusters of similar tokens as high-energy, indicating potential candidates for merging, while smaller (unique and isolated) clusters are considered as low-energy and preserved.

Instead of pruning, this method combines tokens with high semantic similarity, removing background tokens and merging less informative foreground ones. Its versatility extends to training and non-training scenarios, drastically reducing compute and memory usage. A notable example is ToMe [15], which introduced the Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM) algorithm, prominent for its simplicity and effectiveness in merging highly similar tokens. Since ToMe, several works, including ToFu [16], Pumer [17], LTPM [18], and DiffRate [19], have built upon BSM with various adaptations in vision and language domains. In BSM, tokens representing image patches are separated into sets $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ , and their pairwise cosine similarity is computed. The top $k$ similar pairs of tokens between the sets $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ are merged. However, the performance of this algorithm is sensitive to the token-splitting strategy. For instance, ToMe\u2019s approach, which first splits tokens based on index parity, can lead to incorrect merging since tokens in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ can subsequently only be merged with those in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ (Figure 1). Moreover, while BSM excels in initial layers with many redundant tokens, deeper layers risk merging informative tokens due to latent object correlations. Though current enhancements [19] mitigated this by considering token attention scores in BSM [20], their adaptability to different ViT architectures, each with potentially distinct attention score distributions [21], remains a challenge. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this work, we propose PITOME (Protect Informative Tokens before Merging), a method designed to safeguard crucial information-bearing tokens prior to the merging step. Our method prioritizes preserving informative tokens by utilizing an additional metric termed the energy score inspired by connections to graph energy in spectral graph theory [22, 23] (Theorem 1). Specifically, our energy score assesses large clusters of similar tokens as possessing high energy (like background and repeated textures), thereby marking them as suitable candidates for merging, while smaller, distinct regions (foreground) are deemed low-energy and thus treated as protected informative tokens. The proposed energy term operates on the graph built for input tokens, taking into account their relationships and aggregating information from nearby neighbors when their similarities exceed certain thresholds. This approach facilitates a deeper contextual comprehension compared to previous works [15\u201317, 19] that rely solely on attention scores or feature embedding per token. Subsequently, we only select the highest-scoring tokens and pass them on for merging in the next steps, ensuring the preservation of important tokens, particularly in the latter stages when only a few remaining ones. During the merging process, we continue leveraging sorted energy vectors from earlier stages by distributing tokens with similar energy into two sets, $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ , resulting in candidates in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ having a high probability of finding compatible matches in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ .

Others explore strategies such as head or feature pruning [11, 33] or the integration of domain-specific modules [9, 5, 34, 10]. However, many of them necessitate joint training with the backbone model from scratch. For instance, DynamicViT [35] runs approximately 150 hours of fine-tuning on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to prune the DeiT-S model [36].

However, like efficient transformers, these methods typically require training. Additionally, most pruning techniques are dynamic, meaning the number of tokens varies across different inputs, which improves accuracy but complicates batching for practical deployment. To address this, numerous pruning methods employ masks during the training phase rather than directly eliminating tokens; however, it yields to cancel out the speed advantages associated with pruning.

They have demonstrated the ability to double the throughput of state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViT) on both images and videos with minimal accuracy degradation in various scenarios. However, BSM-based approaches are sensitive to the selection of sets in the matching process, potentially resulting in the loss of informative tokens due to heuristic merging procedures. To address these issues, methods like DiffRate [19] and Crossget [44] leverage attention scores in ViT or cross-modal guidance to identify important tokens during the matching process, though they remain sensitive to the distribution of the token space, especially with imbalanced clusters. Another direction involves adapting more intricate algorithms, such as $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot$ -means [45], spectral clustering [46], graph pooling [47], or graph coarsening [24, 48], to merge similar tokens. While these strategies offer some guarantees and well-controlled outputs, their iteration schemes are highly complex and may not align with the goal of reducing model complexity in ViT layers. Our PITOME, on the other hand, enables the advantages of both approaches. It maintains efficiency comparable to BSM, remains robust to token partitioning strategies, and offers a reasonable trade-off between speed and accuracy. Moreover, PITOME is theoretically proved to approximate the spectral spectrum of the original token space under reasonable assumptions, resembling the behavior of other spectral clustering methods.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
