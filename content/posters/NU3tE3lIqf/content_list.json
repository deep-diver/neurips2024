These fields are rendered using volumetric rendering [12]. Despite producing highly realistic renderings, NeRFs require evaluating numerous samples from the field per pixel to accurately approximate the volumetric integral. Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14, 50, 49, 51, 15, 54] has emerged as a faster alternative. 3DGS explicitly represents the scene as a set of 3D Gaussians, which enables real-time rendering via rasterization at a rendering quality comparable to NeRFs.

Both NeRFs and 3DGS are designed to learn consistent geometry while simulating non-Lambertian effects, resolving ambiguity through implicit biases in the representation.

However, in practical applications, images are captured without control over the environment. Examples include crowd-sourced 3D reconstructions [34, 1], where images are collected at different times, seasons, and exposure levels, and reconstructions that keep 3D models up-to-date via regular image recapturing.

Adding an MLP conditioned on an appearance embedding would slow down rendering, as each frame would require evaluating the MLP for all Gaussians. For occlusion handling, NeRFs [24, 31] use uncertainty modeling to discount losses from challenging pixels. However, in cases with both appearance changes and occlusions, these losses are not robust, often incorrectly focusing on regions with difficult-to-capture appearances instead of focusing on the occluders.

In real-world scenes, e.g. the unstructured internet photo collections [35], difficulties arise not only from dynamic occlusions like moving pedestrians and vehicles but also from varying illumination. Previously, these issues were tackled using multi-plane image (MPI) methods [20]. More recently, NeRF-W [24], a pioneering work in this area, addresses these challenges with per-image transient and appearance embeddings, along with leveraging aleatoric uncertainty for transient object removal. However, the method suffers from slow training and rendering speeds. Other NeRF-based methods followed NeRF-W extending it in various ways [37, 47]. Recent concurrent works, including our own, explore the replacement of NeRF representations with 3DGS for this task. Some methods [33, 6] address the simpler problem of training 3DGS under heavy occlusions, or only tackling appearance changes [23, 48, 8] with no occlusions. However, the main challenge is integrating appearance conditioning with the locally independent 3D Gaussians under occlusions. VastGaussian [22] applies a convolutional network to 3DGS outputs which does not transfer to large appearance changes, as shown in the Appendix. SWAG [5] and Scaffold-GS [23] address this by storing appearance data in an external hash-grid-based implicit field [26], while GS-W [52] and WE-GS [41] utilize CNN features for appearance conditioning on a reference image. In contrast, our method employs a simpler and more scalable strategy by embedding appearance vectors directly within each Gaussian. This design not only simplifies the architecture but also enables us to \u2019bake\u2019 the trained representation back into 3DGS after appearances are fixed, enhancing both efficiency and adaptability.

To allow 3DGS-based approaches to handle the uncontrolled capture of scenes, we propose two key components: (1) appearance modeling enables our approach to handle the fact that the observed pixel colors not only depend on the viewpoint but also on conditions such as the capture time and the weather. Following NeRF-based approaches for reconstructing scenes from images captured under different conditions [24, 30], we train an appearance embedding per training image to model such conditions. In addition, we train an appearance embedding per Gaussian to model local effects, e.g., active illumination of parts of the scene from lamps. Both embeddings are used to transform the color stored for a Gaussian to match the color expected for a given scene appearance. To this end, we predict an affine mapping [30] in color space via an MLP. (2) uncertainty modeling allows our approach to handle occluders during the training stage by determining which regions of a training image should be ignored. To this end, we extract DINO v2 features [27] from training images, and pass them as input to a trainable affine transformation which predicts a per-pixel uncertainty, encoding which parts of an image likely correspond to static regions and which parts show occluders.

Considering that the appearance MLP shares weights across all Gaussians, we observed potential instability in training when randomly initializing the MLP.

(5) as $\\beta_{k}=0.01\\hat{\\beta_{k}}$ and $\\gamma_{k}=0.01\\hat{\\gamma_{k}}+1$ .

We sample 100 000 points on the sphere and then project them to all training cameras, removing any points not visible from at least one camera. This set of sky points is then added to our initial point set, with their opacity initialized at 1.0, while the opacity of the rest is set at 0.1.

The results are presented in Table 4. As we can see from the table, WildGaussians appearance modeling outperforms other baselines. While VastGaussian [22] seems to work well for cases where the appearance difference is small, it fails in cases with large appearance changes and causes noticeable artifacts in the images. In the case of a simple affine color transformation (w/o Gaussian embeddings), this modeling is not powerful enough to capture local appearance changes such as lamps turning on. We can also see the effectiveness of the uncertainty modeling. However, for the Trevi Fountain, the uncertainty does not improve the performance, which is likely caused by 1) the scene has a small number of occlusions, 2) the water in the scene is often mistaken for a transient object as it is not multi-view consistent. For reference, we also included a comparison with a method trained with explicit segmentation masks obtained from the MaskRCNN predictor [11].
