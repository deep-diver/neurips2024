### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Training neural networks efficiently and effectively is a major challenge.  A key hyperparameter is the learning rate (LR), which controls the size of the steps taken during optimization. While using large LRs initially is common practice to avoid poor local minima and improve generalization, there's limited understanding on exactly how large is optimal and what the differences in the resulting models are. This paper aims to address this gap.



The researchers conducted a controlled experiment by fixing the initial LR and exploring its effect on model performance. They found that only a narrow range of initial LRs, just above the convergence threshold, consistently led to the best results after fine-tuning or weight averaging.  **Models trained with these optimal LRs exhibited high-quality minima, and only focused on relevant features** in the dataset.  Using either too small or too large initial LRs yielded suboptimal results.  These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of neural network training, particularly in choosing the right initial learning rates, and offer practical guidance for researchers.

> üîº This figure shows the test accuracy of a scale-invariant ResNet-18 model trained on CIFAR-10 with different fixed learning rates (LRs).  It illustrates three distinct training regimes identified by the authors: 1) convergence (low LRs where the model monotonically converges to a minimum), 2) chaotic equilibrium (medium LRs where the loss noisily stabilizes), and 3) divergence (high LRs leading to random-guess accuracy).  The dashed lines separate these regimes, and the plot displays the mean test accuracy and standard deviation over the last 20 of 200 training epochs. This is a key figure in establishing the three training regimes which are central to the paper's experimental methodology.

### In-depth insights


#### Optimal LR Range
The concept of an optimal learning rate (LR) range is crucial for effective neural network training.  The paper investigates the impact of different initial LRs on model generalization and feature learning.  It identifies a **narrow range of initial LRs**, slightly exceeding the convergence threshold, that consistently yields superior results after fine-tuning or weight averaging.  **This optimal range allows the optimization process to locate a basin containing only high-quality minima**, as opposed to unstable minima found with smaller LRs or basins lacking good solutions found with larger LRs.  Furthermore, initial LRs within the optimal range promote a **sparse set of learned features**, focusing on those most relevant for the task, unlike the less selective feature learning observed with both suboptimal LR choices.  The study underscores that simply using a large LR is insufficient; rather, a precise and well-defined range, carefully chosen based on the specifics of the network and task, is key to achieving optimal performance.  The existence of this optimal range **highlights the complex interplay between LR, optimization dynamics, and generalization**.  Further research should focus on generalizing the findings beyond specific network architectures and datasets and on establishing more robust methods for identifying the optimal LR range.

#### Loss Landscape Geom
Analyzing the loss landscape geometry offers crucial insights into the optimization process of neural networks.  **The 'Loss Landscape Geom' section would ideally explore the characteristics of the minima reached after training with varying learning rates.**  This involves investigating the curvature and connectivity of these minima, determining whether they form clusters or basins, and analyzing the relationships between the geometry and the generalization ability of the resulting models.  A key aspect would be to **compare the geometry of minima obtained with large learning rates versus those achieved with small learning rates**, revealing differences that might explain the observed superior generalization of models trained with large initial rates.  Furthermore, the analysis could delve into the **relationship between local and global minima**, assessing if large rates facilitate escaping poor local minima and reaching regions of better solutions. Finally, this section could include visualizations of the loss landscape, showcasing the pathways taken during training and providing quantitative measures of curvature and connectivity to support the presented findings.  **Such a comprehensive analysis would offer deeper understanding of why large learning rates are beneficial.**

#### Feature Sparsity
The concept of feature sparsity, explored in the context of neural network training with varying learning rates, reveals crucial insights into model behavior and generalization.  **Higher initial learning rates**, within an optimal range, promote the learning of a sparse subset of features, focusing on those most relevant to the task. This **sparsity isn't merely a byproduct**; it's linked to the location of high-quality minima in the loss landscape. Conversely, training with excessively small or large initial learning rates leads to dense feature learning, unstable minima, and poor generalization.  The optimal learning rate range seems to strike a balance, avoiding both the underfitting of overly simplistic models (small LRs) and the overfitting resulting from learning too many potentially irrelevant features (large LRs).  **Feature sparsity appears essential** for achieving both good generalization and locating these beneficial minima. The observed feature sparsity suggests that the model is more specialized and efficient in its representation of data, which is a key factor in its improved ability to generalize.

#### Practical Setting
The heading 'Practical Setting' in a research paper usually signifies a shift from controlled experiments to real-world application.  It suggests the authors are testing their findings in a less-controlled environment, evaluating the robustness and generalizability of their approach. This section would likely demonstrate the method's performance on standard datasets or in a setting more closely resembling actual usage scenarios. **Key aspects within this section would include comparing results obtained in the practical setting with those from the controlled experiments.**  Any discrepancies could provide valuable insights into the limits of the method's applicability. Additionally, a comparison would highlight aspects like the impact of noisy data, data heterogeneity, and the presence of confounding factors, as these are absent or minimized in controlled settings.  **The success of the method in the practical setting is a crucial test of its broader utility and value.**  It confirms the method's ability to provide comparable or improved results even under less ideal circumstances, demonstrating its true potential for practical use.  Finally, it could discuss challenges encountered during implementation and potential modifications or adaptations made to suit the practical setting.  **This section is crucial for assessing the practical relevance and impact of the research findings**.

#### Future Research
The paper's 'Future Research' section could fruitfully explore several avenues.  **A deeper theoretical understanding** of the observed empirical phenomena is crucial. Why does a specific range of learning rates consistently yield superior results?  Is there a fundamental mathematical relationship between the loss landscape's geometry and the resulting feature sparsity?  **Further investigation into the role of model architecture** is warranted.  Do these findings generalize across various network depths, widths, and activation functions?  **A more thorough examination of practical LR scheduling strategies** is needed to bridge the gap between controlled experiments and real-world training protocols.  **The interaction between LR, normalization techniques, and other hyperparameters** requires further study. Finally, **expanding the scope of applications** beyond image classification to other domains like natural language processing and time series analysis will validate the robustness and generality of the key findings.

> üîº This figure shows the test accuracy results for fine-tuning and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) on a scale-invariant ResNet-18 model trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.  The x-axis represents the pre-training learning rate (PLR), and the y-axis shows the test accuracy. The black line indicates the test accuracy after the initial pre-training phase with different PLRs. Colored lines represent the test accuracy after further fine-tuning (left) with a small learning rate (FLR) or SWA (right) with different numbers of models. Dashed lines separate the three training regimes identified in the paper (convergence, chaotic equilibrium, and divergence), while the dotted line further divides the second regime into two subregimes (2A and 2B).  The figure illustrates the impact of initial LR on the final model performance.

> üîº This figure visualizes the geometric relationships between different model solutions obtained through various training methods.  Specifically, it shows the angular distance and error barriers (both training and test error) between three types of solutions for each pre-training learning rate (PLR):  1) Solutions obtained by fine-tuning with the smallest fine-tuning learning rate (FLR); 2) Solutions obtained by fine-tuning with the largest FLR; and 3) Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) of five models.  The plot illustrates how the geometry of the loss landscape changes depending on the initial learning rate used for pre-training, providing insights into the optimization process and the quality of the solutions obtained.  The SI ResNet-18 model was trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.

> üîº This figure shows the test accuracy for various model architectures (SI ConvNet and SI ResNet-18) trained on different datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100).  It compares the results of fine-tuning with different final learning rates (FLRs) and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) after pre-training with different pre-training learning rates (PLRs). The black line represents the test accuracy after the pre-training stage. Dashed lines separate the three training regimes (convergence, chaotic equilibrium, divergence), and the dotted line further subdivides the second regime (chaotic equilibrium) into two subregimes (2A and 2B).  The plot illustrates how the optimal range of initial learning rates for obtaining high generalization performance after fine-tuning or SWA varies depending on the model architecture and dataset.

> üîº This figure shows how the accuracy of different frequency bands changes when varying the boundary between low and mid-frequencies for fine-tuning with a small learning rate (FLR) in the practical setting using Vision Transformer (ViT).  The x-axis represents the pre-training learning rate (PLR), and the y-axis represents the accuracy for different frequency ranges. The different colored lines show the accuracy for different frequency bands.  The figure demonstrates how the choice of pre-training learning rate (PLR) affects the learned features, and that there is an optimal range for generalization.

> üîº This figure shows the relationship between sharpness and test error for fine-tuned solutions obtained after pre-training with different learning rates. Each point represents a fine-tuned model with the same pre-training point but different fine-tuning learning rates. The color of the point indicates the pre-training learning rate, ranging from low (purple) to high (red). Black points represent pre-trained models without fine-tuning.  The figure demonstrates that while there's a general trend suggesting that models with lower sharpness have lower test error, the relationship is not straightforward and the sharpness is not a reliable indicator of generalization in this particular setting.

Groups of points of the same color represent fine-tuned solutions with different FLRs but with the same pre-trained point. Different colors denote different PLRs of the second regime: from low (purple) to high (red). Black dots correspond to the pre-trained points of the first regime, replicating the results of Kodryan et al. [35]. SI ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10.
