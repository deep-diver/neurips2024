As a result, the utilization of crowd-sourced candidate label sets proves to be a valuable strategy in substantially mitigating labeling expenses [20]. To address colorectal cancer classification under dual inexact supervision, Tang et al. [21] have introduced the MIPL algorithm named DEMIPL. This approach employs an attention mechanism to aggregate all instances within a bag into a bag-level feature representation and a disambiguation strategy to identify the true label. Following DEMIPL, ELIMIPL algorithm has been proposed to exploit the label information from both candidate and non-candidate label sets [22]. Additionally, the early MIPL algorithm MIPLGP predicts a bag-level label by aggregating all instance-level labels within the bag without utilizing attention mechanisms [16].

These oversights could lead to two major issues. First, the attention scores for positive and negative instances can be quite similar, and in some cases, negative instances may even receive higher attention scores than positive ones, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Second, the classifier may even assign higher predicted probabilities to non-candidate labels than to candidate labels. Figure 1(c) illustrates a scenario where ELIMIPL assigns predicted probabilities to the candidate labels that are only marginally higher than the non-candidate ones. Furthermore, ELIMIPL may even output lower predicted probabilities for candidate labels than non-candidate ones, as depicted in Figure 1(d). Such erroneous predictions may have serious consequences in applications. For example, in medical image classification, misclassifying images of severe conditions as mild or disease-free may cause patients to miss the opportunity for timely treatment. In this paper, we term this phenomenon as margin violations, where the attention scores of negative instances surpass those of positives, or the predicted probabilities for non-candidate labels exceed those for candidate ones.

To overcome this limitation, we adopt the $O n e$ vs. Rest $(O\\nu R)$ decomposition strategy employed in MIPLGP [16] for degradation of MIPL data. Specifically, when presented with a multi-instance bag $X_{i}$ linked to a candidate label set $\\boldsymbol{S}_{i}$ , we assign each label from the candidate set to the bag, and thus generate $|S_{i}|$ multi-instance bags where each bag is associated with a singular bag-level label. For each class $c$ $(c\\in\\{1,2,\\cdots\\,,k\\})$ , we train and test the $c$ -th classifier by transforming the label $c$ to 1 (positive) and all other labels to 0 (negative). In the testing phase, a multi-instance bag yields $k$ predictions from the $k$ classifiers. If only one prediction is positive, the corresponding class label of that positive prediction is considered the classification result for the bag. In cases where there is more than one positive prediction among the $k$ predictions, we choose the class label associated with the classifier demonstrating the highest prediction confidence as the classification result for the bag. If all $k$ predictions are negative, the classification result is the class label with the lowest prediction confidence. In particular, LOSS-ATTEN is a multi-class MIL algorithm, eliminating the need for employing the One vs. Rest decomposition strategy.

In contemporary multi-instance learning methodologies, a prevalent strategy involves incorporating attention mechanisms to aggregate features from each multi-instance bag into a unified feature representation, subsequently fed into a classifier. Ilse et al. [4] introduced both the plain attention mechanism and gated attention mechanism to effectively enhance the performance of binary multi-instance learning. An extension of this paradigm is the loss-based attention mechanisms [43], providing a solution for multi-class tasks. Owing to the exceptional performance of the attention mechanisms, multi-instance learning methods based on attention mechanisms have gained widespread adoption in tasks such as histopathological image classification [49, 50]. These attention mechanisms typically fall under the category of soft attention mechanisms, wherein the weighted sum of attention scores for all instances in a multi-instance bag yields a bag-level feature representation. Conversely, Li et al. [51] introduced hard attention mechanisms, which focus on selecting a subset of instances from multi-instance bags to construct the feature representation.

Margin violations also exist in partial-label learning, prompting researchers to introduce the maximum margin criteria as a viable solution. Nguyen and Caruana [39] employed the maximum margin criterion to augment the distinction between the model\u2019s highest predicted probability on candidate labels and its highest predicted probability on non-candidate labels. Similarly, Yu and Zhang [38] focused on maximizing the margin between the model\u2019s predicted probability on the true label and its highest predicted probability on labels other than the true one. However, these methods require an alternating optimization, contributing to the intricacies of the optimization procedure. In recent years, numerous deep learning-based partial-label learning algorithms have emerged. Lv et al. [33] utilize linear classifiers or multi-layer perceptrons to learn feature representations from instances, employing progressive disambiguation strategies to identify true labels. Following this line of thought, Feng et al. [34] delved into the generation process of partial-label data and proposed two theoretically guaranteed partial-label learning algorithms. Similarly, Wen et al. [35] introduced a weighted loss for disambiguation, serving as a generalized version across multiple algorithms.

Its objective is to tackle the challenge of inexact supervision simultaneously present in both instance and label spaces. To our knowledge, only three viable MIPL algorithms, i.e., MIPLGP [16], DEMIPL [21], and ELIMIPL [22], currently exist. Tang et al. [16] have introduced the MIPL framework, with MIPLGP adopting an instance-space paradigm. MIPLGP is structured in three steps. Firstly, it augments a negative class for each candidate label set. Secondly, it treats the candidate label set of each multi-instance bag as that of each instance within the bag. Finally, it employs the Dirichlet disambiguation strategy and the Gaussian processes regression model for disambiguation. On the other hand, DEMIPL follows the embedded-space paradigm and consists of two steps. Initially, it aggregates each multi-instance bag into a unified feature representation through the disambiguated attention mechanism. Subsequently, it employs a momentum-based disambiguation strategy to discern true labels from candidate label sets. Following this way, Tang et al. [22] have proposed ELIMIPL to exploit the information from candidate and non-candidate label sets via three loss functions. Specifically, ELIMIPL learns the mappings from the multi-instance bags to the candidate label sets and the sparsity of the candidate label matrix. Moreover, it incorporates the non-candidate label information via an inhibition loss. Recently, Yang et al. [54] have proposed a probabilistic generative model for multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) that infers latent ground-truth labels by modeling the data generation process of MIPL. From a theoretical perspective, Wang et al. [55] have established connections between MIPL and latent structural learning, as well as neurosymbolic integration.
