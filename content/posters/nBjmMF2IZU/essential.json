Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on pre-collected datasets, which may not capture the full range of decision-making scenarios. This limits the ability of AI agents to adapt and learn effectively in real-world situations.\nThis paper introduces a novel algorithm that addresses these challenges by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL). The key innovation is the integration of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which allows the VLM to generate intermediate reasoning steps leading to more efficient exploration.  The generated text actions are then parsed into executable actions, and RL is used to fine-tune the entire VLM based on the obtained rewards.  Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM decision-making abilities, outperforming existing commercial models in several challenging tasks.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "nBjmMF2IZU/podcast.wav"}
