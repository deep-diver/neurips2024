Existing methods, while effective, often involve substantial memory overhead for gradient computations. This research paper explores a weak-to-strong specialization approach, aiming to directly transfer knowledge from a series of task-specific small models to a much larger model without additional training. This approach addresses the limitations of prior methods, which often employ static knowledge transfer ratios and a single small model, leading to suboptimal performance.\nThe paper proposes a dynamic logit fusion method that employs a series of task-specific small models.  It adaptively allocates weights among these models at each decoding step, learning these weights using Kullback-Leibler divergence. The method demonstrates leading results across various benchmarks in both single-task and multi-task settings. By transferring knowledge from a 7B model to a 13B model, the performance gap is significantly reduced, even outperforming full fine-tuning on unseen tasks. This approach integrates in-context learning and task arithmetic, further enhancing its versatility and effectiveness.  The **dynamic weight allocation** and use of **multiple expert models** are key innovations that enhance performance and generalization.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "RMfiqfWAWg/podcast.wav"}
