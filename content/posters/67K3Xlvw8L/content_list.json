We address these challenges by first establishing a precise problem definition and defining \u201chonesty\u201d inspired by the Analects of Confucius. This serves as a cornerstone for developing metrics that effectively measure an LLM\u2019s honesty by quantifying its progress post-alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible training framework which is further instantiated by several efficient fine-tuning techniques that emphasize honesty without sacrificing performance on other tasks.

The key principles of alignment are often summarized as the \u201cHHH\u201d criteria: helpful, harmless, honest (Askell et al., 2021). There has been a significant focus on enhancing the helpfulness and harmlessness of LLMs (Bai et al., 2022a,b). However, honesty, despite its importance in establishing reliable and safe AI (Kaddour et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023), has received relatively less attention in research (i.e., Evans et al.

Essentially, honesty demands the model to be faithful to its own level of knowledge and express it candidly (Askell et al., 2021; Schulman, 2023). In this paper, we define \u201chonesty\u201d based on the spirit of Confucius and Disciple (1 BC): an honest model should candidly answer questions it knows and humbly admit to those it does not, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Some research emphasizes calibration (Lin et al., 2022a; Cui et al., 2023), which requires the model to convey a certain degree of uncertainty in its responses and can be seen as a finer-grained handling of known questions.
