However, current methods struggle to effectively model samples with diverse compositions and conformations, particularly in complex biological mixtures like cellular lysates.  Analyzing these complex samples is crucial for understanding cellular processes, but existing techniques fall short; they either handle conformational or compositional heterogeneity sequentially or resort to strong assumptions about the structural states.  This limits their ability to provide accurate structural insights, particularly for biomolecules undergoing large conformational transitions.\nThe researchers introduce Hydra, a novel approach that utilizes a mixture of neural fields. This innovative method enables the simultaneous inference of protein structures, orientations, compositional classes, and conformational states.  By employing a new likelihood-based loss function, Hydra adeptly navigates the complexities of heterogeneous samples, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in both synthetic and experimental data.  Hydra's ability to fully reconstruct both conformational and compositional variability fully ab initio represents a significant advancement, expanding the capabilities of cryo-EM and paving the way for the study of increasingly intricate biological samples.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "TuspoNzIdB/podcast.wav"}
