Existing methods often require architecture-specific models, limiting their applicability and generalizability. They also neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in many networks.\n\nThe proposed Set-based Neural Network Encoder (SNE) addresses these issues by using set-to-set and set-to-vector functions to encode network weights efficiently and in an architecture-agnostic manner.  SNE considers the hierarchical structure of networks during encoding and employs Logit Invariance to ensure minimal invariance properties.  This approach, coupled with a pad-chunk-encode pipeline, allows it to handle neural networks of arbitrary size and architecture.  Evaluation shows SNE outperforms existing baselines in standard benchmarks and on newly introduced tasks evaluating cross-dataset and cross-architecture generalization.  **SNE's architecture-agnostic nature and improved generalizability represent significant advancements in neural network analysis and property prediction.**", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "i3me9bCSCy/podcast.wav"}
