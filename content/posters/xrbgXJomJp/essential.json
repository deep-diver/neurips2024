Existing methods often struggle with instability due to adversarial training. Cooperative settings require learning both local value functions for individual actions and a joint value function to exploit centralized learning.  This creates a difficult optimization problem.\nThis paper introduces Multi-agent Inverse Factorized Q-learning (MIFQ), addressing these issues.  MIFQ leverages inverse soft Q-learning, avoiding adversarial training. It uses mixing networks for centralized learning, theoretically establishing convexity conditions in the Q-function space.  Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including a challenging version of StarCraft, demonstrate MIFQ's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.", "affiliation": "Singapore Management University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xrbgXJomJp/podcast.wav"}
