However, extending this framework to a multi-agent context introduces the need to simultaneously learn both local value functions to capture local observations and individual actions, and a joint value function for exploiting centralized learning. In this work, we introduce a new multi-agent IL algorithm designed to address these challenges. Our approach enables the centralized learning by leveraging mixing networks to aggregate decentralized Q functions.

Therefore, we introduce a generalized version of IGM, called Individual-Global-Consistency (IGC), which requires that the distribution of joint actions produced by the optimal joint policy matches the collection of local action distributions produced by the individual optimal policies.

There is a rich body of existing works focusing on generating policies that mimic an expert\u2019s behavior given data of expert demonstrations in single-agent settings. A classic approach is behavioral cloning which casts IL as a supervised learning problem, attempting to maximize the likelihood of the expert\u2019s trajectories [32, 28]. This approach, while simple, requires a large amount of data to work well due to its compounding error issue. An alternative approach is to recover the reward function (either implicitly or explicitly) for which the expert\u2019s policy is optimal [13, 18, 30, 20, 10].

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
