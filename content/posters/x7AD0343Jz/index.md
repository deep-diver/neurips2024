### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for complex tasks, but their ability to learn compositional structures remains unclear. This study investigates the sample efficiency of LLMs in learning compositional tasks by training LLMs on four carefully designed tasks that demand a composition of discrete sub-tasks.  **The main challenge addressed is how well LLMs can reuse knowledge acquired during the training of the individual sub-tasks to improve the efficiency of learning compositional tasks.**

The researchers found that LLMs are highly sample-inefficient in compositional learning.  **LLaMA models, for example, required significantly more data samples to learn the compositional tasks than was needed to relearn the individual sub-tasks from scratch.**  In-context prompting showed similar inefficiencies, with limited success in solving compositional tasks.  Furthermore, theoretical analysis supports these findings, highlighting the limitations of gradient descent training for memorizing compositional structures.

> This figure shows a visualization of how a compositional algorithmic task, specifically the PEN task, can be represented as a computational graph. The PEN task involves processing a sequence of words by jumping between different words according to a matching criterion and outputting their neighbors. The graph illustrates the task's structure, where nodes represent intermediate variables and edges represent primitive operations. The color coding helps match the operations in the graph to their corresponding steps in the PEN task's pseudo-code.  It highlights the relationships between primitive operations (left, match, right) and the overall compositional structure of the task.

> This table summarizes the results of experiments using GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro on two algorithmic tasks, PEN and PERM, with various prompting methods.  The results show that even with detailed prompts and chain-of-thought prompting, both models struggle to achieve high accuracy. The main challenge seems to be in composing multiple sub-tasks required for the overall task.  Hand-crafted, sub-task-based prompting provides slightly better performance, particularly for GPT-4.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM Composition Limits
The study of "LLM Composition Limits" reveals crucial insights into the capabilities and constraints of large language models (LLMs) in handling compositional tasks.  The research highlights the **significant sample inefficiency** of current LLMs in learning compositional algorithms, requiring substantially more data than learning individual sub-tasks. This challenges the assumption that LLMs effortlessly generalize to complex tasks.  The findings underscore a **memorization-based learning behavior** in LLMs, as they struggle to reuse previously learned components rather than compositionally constructing solutions. This limited ability to generalize has practical implications for LLM applications, indicating a need for more sophisticated training methods or architectural designs to mitigate this critical limitation.  **Theoretical analysis** using complexity theory strengthens these empirical findings by showing how the sample inefficiency is an inherent characteristic of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models.  This suggests that fundamentally new approaches may be necessary to fully unleash the compositional power of LLMs.

#### Algorithmic Task Design
Effective **algorithmic task design** is crucial for evaluating compositional learning in large language models (LLMs).  Well-designed tasks should possess a clear compositional structure, allowing for the decomposition into smaller, independently solvable sub-tasks.  This modularity enables a nuanced analysis of the LLM's ability to reuse learned primitives when tackling the complete task, separating genuine compositional generalization from superficial pattern-matching.  **Synthetic tasks** offer a level of control to minimize confounding factors, but ideally, these tasks should also reflect real-world problem characteristics to ensure practical relevance.  The **selection of primitive operations** used in the sub-tasks needs careful consideration.  A balanced choice between simplistic, easily learnable primitives, and more complex primitives that require more substantial learning effort can highlight the model's ability to generalize beyond simple memorization.  The overall design must also consider the **sample efficiency** of the task. A computationally efficient task may be less demanding of resources, and an efficient task design that reduces sample size is beneficial for both research and practical applications.

#### Sample Inefficiency
The research paper reveals a critical limitation of Transformer Language Models (LLMs) in compositional learning: **sample inefficiency**.  This means LLMs require significantly more training data than expected to learn compositional tasks, even when their constituent sub-tasks are already mastered. The inefficiency is striking; models need more examples than those needed to train the sub-tasks from scratch.  This **challenges the hypothesis that LLMs learn compositionally**, suggesting that they primarily memorize individual sequences instead of abstracting and recombining fundamental rules.  This inefficiency is further supported by a theoretical analysis, proving that gradient descent in feedforward models suffers from inherent sample inefficiency in memorizing solutions to combinatorial problems.  The results highlight a crucial barrier to creating more advanced, generalizable AI systems and underscore the need for developing new training methods to overcome this limitation.

#### In-context Prompting Fails
The failure of in-context prompting in compositional algorithmic tasks highlights a critical limitation of current large language models (LLMs).  **While LLMs excel at pattern recognition and leveraging existing knowledge from massive datasets, they struggle to generalize and compose knowledge in novel, unseen scenarios** presented by these tasks.  The experiments demonstrate that simply providing a few examples or a detailed task description is insufficient to enable LLMs to effectively break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks and recombine their solutions.  **This failure underscores a lack of true understanding and reasoning abilities** and reveals a significant gap between the impressive capabilities of LLMs and the requirements for robust, generalizable AI. The inherent sample inefficiency revealed suggests a need for new learning paradigms beyond simple in-context prompting that encourage generalization and compositionality. This necessitates a shift towards methods that enable models to learn abstract rules and principles, instead of relying heavily on statistical correlations in the training data.

#### Future Research
Future research should prioritize developing more effective methods for inducing compositional learning in LLMs. This could involve incorporating stronger inductive biases into model architectures or modifying training procedures to better encourage the reuse of learned sub-tasks.  **Expanding the range of benchmark tasks beyond the currently used synthetic examples is crucial** to ensure broader generalizability and robustness of findings. Investigating the interplay between model size, data efficiency, and training strategies is another vital direction, particularly in the context of limited data scenarios.  **A deeper theoretical understanding of compositional learning within the framework of gradient descent is needed**, perhaps exploring alternative optimization techniques that could mitigate the sample inefficiency observed in this work.  Finally, **more extensive investigation into the decomposability of existing tasks is needed**, exploring whether pre-training on complex tasks aids in the efficient learning of simpler sub-tasks, and how such knowledge is subsequently leveraged for compositional generalization.
