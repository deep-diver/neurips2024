Current methods, such as in-context learning, have limitations in addressing dynamically changing environments and incorporating external knowledge effectively. This paper tackles these issues by developing a novel framework, RAGRAPH. \n\nRAGRAPH uses a retrieval-augmented approach, integrating external graph data to enrich the learning context. It does so via a toy graph vector library, which captures key attributes of the data. During inference, RAGRAPH retrieves similar toy graphs and integrates this data to enhance model learning.  Extensive experiments show that RAGRAPH significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across various graph tasks, including node and graph classification, and link prediction, on both static and dynamic datasets. Importantly, it achieves this without needing task-specific fine-tuning, showcasing its high adaptability and robustness.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Graph Neural Networks"}, "podcast_path": "Dzk2cRUFMt/podcast.wav"}
