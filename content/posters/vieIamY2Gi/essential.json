Existing methods like simulation-based variational approaches and off-policy methods have limitations in efficiency, stability, and reproducibility.  Benchmarking is inconsistent, hindering comparative analysis and progress.\nThis paper introduces a novel exploration strategy for off-policy training of diffusion models. It leverages local search in the target space combined with a replay buffer to improve sample quality.  Furthermore, a unified library is presented for different diffusion-structured samplers, including simulation-based methods and continuous generative flow networks, enabling robust benchmarking and identifying the strengths and limitations of existing techniques. The proposed method demonstrates enhanced performance across various target distributions.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "vieIamY2Gi/podcast.wav"}
