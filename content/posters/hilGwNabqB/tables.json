The experiment uses the CIFAR-10 dataset with a non-IID data distribution across 20 clients, where each client only has data from 5 out of 10 classes.  Different AD compositions are tested (CIFAR10(10), CIFAR10(8), CIFAR10(5), CIFAR10(2))  to assess the effect of class representation within the AD on the overall model accuracy, as well as an AD comprised of images from the SVHN dataset.
