This paper addresses this issue by highlighting the absence of practical methods for modeling the interdependencies between protein sequences and structures.\n\nThe proposed solution, CoupleNet, tackles this challenge by dynamically integrating sequence and structural features at multiple levels. This is achieved through a novel two-type dynamic graph that captures both local and global relationships, coupled with concurrent convolutions on nodes and edges. Experimental results demonstrate CoupleNet's superior performance compared to existing methods, especially when dealing with proteins exhibiting low sequence similarities. **This approach provides a more comprehensive and accurate representation of proteins, leading to improved accuracy in protein function prediction.**", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "0e5uOaJxo1/podcast.wav"}
