PHYSS-EKS significantly outperforms all models, and due to the EKS prior only requires a 1 epoch for inference. PHYSS-SVGPH achieves the same performance as AUTOIP but is over twice as fast.", "description": "This table presents the test performance results for four different models (PHYSS-EKS, PHYSS-SVGP, PHYSS-SVGPH, and AUTOIP) on a diffusion-reaction system.  The metrics used to evaluate performance include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), total wall clock time, and number of epochs. The results demonstrate that PHYSS-EKS achieves the best predictive performance and computational efficiency, while PHYSS-SVGPH shows similar accuracy to AUTOIP but is significantly faster.", "section": "7 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "tCf7S75xFa/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Test performance on the simulated damped pendulum.

It compares the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD), and the total wall-clock time taken by each model.  The results are broken down by the number of collocation points used for the experiment.  The goal is to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PHYSS-GP method compared to other methods.", "section": "7 Experiments"}]
