Existing methods typically leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) alongside additional segmentation-specific networks, leading to high computational costs. This paper addresses these limitations. This paper tackles the high computational cost of existing OVSS methods.  Current approaches rely on large, complex models with additional segmentation networks, resulting in high training costs and inefficient use of resources. This is especially problematic given the complexity of OVSS, which requires sophisticated techniques to handle unseen object classes. The problem is that existing methods rely on additional explicit segmentation-specific networks resulting in extensive training costs.  \nThis research introduces Relationship Prompt Network (RPN), a novel method that uses prompt learning to enable a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to directly perform OVSS without any additional segmentation networks. RPN uses a Relationship Prompt Module (RPM) which generates relationship prompts guiding the VLM.  The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters than existing models.  This demonstrates the efficacy of prompt learning in simplifying the OVSS pipeline and highlights the potential for parameter-efficient models in computer vision.", "affiliation": "School of Informatics, Xiamen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "PKcCHncbzg/podcast.wav"}
