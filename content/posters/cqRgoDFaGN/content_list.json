However, in some text-to-image architectures, such as SD3 [16], self-attention needs to handle sequences combining text and visual tokens.

Initially, we slightly generalize the definition of SNR and conduct a unified analysis of various training strategies through the examination of SNR probability density functions during the training process. We find that there is a trade-off between robustness and performance in the training of diffusion models. Different noise schedules exhibit varying levels of robustness. Using weighting during the training can enhance the performance ceiling, but it may also decrease the robustness of the process. Additionally, we discover that utilizing a directional loss as an auxiliary loss function for velocity prediction significantly boosts training performance. Based on these observations, we conduct experiments with DiT-XL-2 on ImageNet $256\\!\\times\\!256$ and observe substantial acceleration in training. We refer to this straightforward training approach as FasterDiT. We hope our work inspires further exploration into training strategies for generative models.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
