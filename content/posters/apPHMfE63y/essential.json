This manipulation can significantly impact the system's effectiveness and user experience. Existing algorithms often fail to account for such strategic behavior, leading to poor performance. \nThis research introduces the Optimistic Grim Trigger Mechanism (OptGTM), an algorithm designed to address this problem. OptGTM uses a combination of online learning and mechanism design techniques to discourage strategic manipulation while minimizing regret, that is, the difference between the system's performance with and without manipulation.  The paper demonstrates theoretically and through simulations that OptGTM outperforms traditional algorithms in scenarios with strategic agents.", "affiliation": "Alan Turing Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "apPHMfE63y/podcast.wav"}
