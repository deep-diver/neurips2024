Existing methods often require extensive computation or make strong assumptions about the problem structure.  This hinders their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, existing algorithms that use offline data often rely on online oracles, which aren't practical in many offline settings. \nThis paper introduces LOLIPOP, a novel algorithm that addresses these limitations.  LOLIPOP cleverly leverages a layerwise exploration-exploitation tradeoff to achieve near-optimal regret bounds with significantly reduced computational cost.  **It only requires O(H log T) calls to an offline density estimation oracle, making it highly efficient for offline learning.** The algorithm is also versatile enough to be applied to pure exploration tasks, expanding its applicability beyond reward-based settings.  The results provide a major advancement in offline reinforcement learning.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "848vuK2cKp/podcast.wav"}
