[{"figure_path": "848vuK2cKp/tables/tables_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Algorithms' performance with general finite model class M and i.i.d. contexts. The optimal rate here refers to \u00d5(poly(H, S, A) \u221aT log |M|). All algorithms assume realizability, so it is omitted from the table. The reachability assumption and the varying representation assumption are very stringent for tabular CMDP, for details we refer to Appendix B.", "description": "This table compares the performance of various algorithms for solving contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs).  It shows the regret rate (how far from optimal the algorithm's performance is), the computational complexity (measured by the number of oracle calls), and any assumptions made by each algorithm.  The optimal regret rate is given as a benchmark, and the table highlights the efficiency of the proposed LOLIPOP algorithm in terms of oracle calls.", "section": "Introduction"}]
