### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty, but solving them efficiently remains a challenge.  Existing methods often require extensive computation or make strong assumptions about the problem structure.  This hinders their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, existing algorithms that use offline data often rely on online oracles, which aren't practical in many offline settings. 

This paper introduces LOLIPOP, a novel algorithm that addresses these limitations.  LOLIPOP cleverly leverages a layerwise exploration-exploitation tradeoff to achieve near-optimal regret bounds with significantly reduced computational cost.  **It only requires O(H log T) calls to an offline density estimation oracle, making it highly efficient for offline learning.** The algorithm is also versatile enough to be applied to pure exploration tasks, expanding its applicability beyond reward-based settings.  The results provide a major advancement in offline reinforcement learning.

> üîº This figure illustrates the dependencies between the different components of the LOLIPOP algorithm.  It shows how the estimations from the previous epoch (M<sub>m‚àí1</sub>) are used to construct the policy cover (Œ†<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup>) and policy kernel (p<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup>) for the current epoch. Then, the oracle (OffDEM) is called to get new estimations (M<sub>m</sub>) using data collected with the current policy.  Finally, it shows how trusted occupancy measures and transitions are computed, feeding back into the next iteration.

> Figure 1: The dependence graph of the construction. The estimation M<sub>m‚àí1</sub> = {P<sub>m‚àí1</sub><sup>h</sup>, R<sub>m‚àí1</sub><sup>h</sup>}<sub>h‚àà[H]</sub> from the previous round provides the optimal policy œÄ<sub>m‚àí1</sub> (Line 9) and the regret estimation reg<sub>m‚àí1</sub> (Line 8) for the construction of Œ†<sub>m</sub>, p<sub>m</sub>. The estimation P<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup>, R<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup> is generated by calling the oracle OffDEM on the trajectories collected with policy kernel p<sub>m</sub> (Line 12). The trusted transitions and trusted occupancy measures T<sub>h</sub><sup>m</sup>, d<sub>h</sub><sup>m</sup> are computed from a<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup>, P<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup> (Eqs. (2) and (3)). The policy cover Œ†<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup> is the union of œÄ<sub>m‚àí1,ct</sub> and the policies {œÄ<sub>m,s,a</sub><sup>ct</sup>}<sub>s,a‚ààS√óA</sub> calculated in Line 8 which requires T<sub>h‚àí1</sub><sup>m</sup>, d<sub>h</sub><sup>m</sup>. The policy kernel p<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup> is the inverse gap weighting on Œ†<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup> (Line 10).

> üîº This table compares the performance of various algorithms for solving contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs).  It shows the regret rate (how far from optimal the algorithm's performance is), the computational complexity (measured by the number of oracle calls), and any assumptions made by each algorithm.  The optimal regret rate is given as a benchmark, and the table highlights the efficiency of the proposed LOLIPOP algorithm in terms of oracle calls.

> Table 1: Algorithms' performance with general finite model class M and i.i.d. contexts. The optimal rate here refers to √ï(poly(H, S, A) ‚àöT log |M|). All algorithms assume realizability, so it is omitted from the table. The reachability assumption and the varying representation assumption are very stringent for tabular CMDP, for details we refer to Appendix B.
