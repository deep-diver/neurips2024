The estimation M<sub>m\u22121</sub> = {P<sub>m\u22121</sub><sup>h</sup>, R<sub>m\u22121</sub><sup>h</sup>}<sub>h\u2208[H]</sub> from the previous round provides the optimal policy \u03c0<sub>m\u22121</sub> (Line 9) and the regret estimation reg<sub>m\u22121</sub> (Line 8) for the construction of \u03a0<sub>m</sub>, p<sub>m</sub>. The estimation P<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup>, R<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup> is generated by calling the oracle OffDEM on the trajectories collected with policy kernel p<sub>m</sub> (Line 12). The trusted transitions and trusted occupancy measures T<sub>h</sub><sup>m</sup>, d<sub>h</sub><sup>m</sup> are computed from a<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup>, P<sub>m</sub><sup>h</sup> (Eqs. (2) and (3)). The policy cover \u03a0<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup> is the union of \u03c0<sub>m\u22121,ct</sub> and the policies {\u03c0<sub>m,s,a</sub><sup>ct</sup>}<sub>s,a\u2208S\u00d7A</sub> calculated in Line 8 which requires T<sub>h\u22121</sub><sup>m</sup>, d<sub>h</sub><sup>m</sup>. The policy kernel p<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup> is the inverse gap weighting on \u03a0<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup> (Line 10).", "description": "This figure illustrates the dependencies between the different components of the LOLIPOP algorithm.  It shows how the estimations from the previous epoch (M<sub>m\u22121</sub>) are used to construct the policy cover (\u03a0<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup>) and policy kernel (p<sub>m</sub><sup>ct</sup>) for the current epoch. Then, the oracle (OffDEM) is called to get new estimations (M<sub>m</sub>) using data collected with the current policy.  Finally, it shows how trusted occupancy measures and transitions are computed, feeding back into the next iteration.", "section": "3.2 Detailed Construction and Guarantees of Each Component"}]
