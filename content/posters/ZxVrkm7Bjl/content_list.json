By allowing recurrence in depth, UTs have advantages over standard Transformers in learning compositional generalizations, but layer-sharing comes with a practical limitation of parameter-compute ratio: it drastically reduces the parameter count compared to the non-shared model with the same dimensionality. Naively scaling up the layer size to compensate for the loss of parameters makes its computational resource requirements prohibitive. In practice, no previous work has succeeded in proposing a shared-layer Transformer design that is competitive in parameter count-dominated tasks such as language modeling. Here we propose MoEUT (pronounced \u201cmoot\u201d), an effective mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based shared-layer Transformer architecture, which combines several recent advances in MoEs for both feedforward and attention layers of standard Transformers together with novel layer-normalization and grouping schemes that are specific and crucial to UTs.

The core characteristic of UTs is recurrence in depth via sharing parameters across layers. This reintroduces the expressive power of recurrence provided by recurrent neural networks (RNNs, [11, 12, 13]). Layer sharing allows UTs to outperform regular Transformers on compositional problems such as logical inference tasks, while also yielding improvements on small-scale language modeling and translation tasks. In particular, UTs have been shown to have better compositional generalization properties [14, 15] by being able to decompose structured problems without supervision and generalize to longer sequences [16].2 These empirical findings confirm that UTs are more general architectures with superior generalization properties compared to standard Transformers, in principle. However, UTs suffer from a fundamental problem of parameter\u2013compute ratio: sharing the parameters among $L$ layers of an $L$ -layer Transformer\u2014while keeping the same model dimensionalities\u2014results in a model with $L$ times fewer parameters (ignoring the input/output layers to simplify the discussion). Upscaling the size of the layer to compensate for the loss of parameters (essentially by making it $L$ times wider) usually yields a very big layer whose computational requirements in terms of compute and memory are prohibitive in practice [19, 20]. In sum, despite their potential, UTs are much less compute-efficient than standard Transformers, and thus, they are not popular for parameter-dominated tasks such as modern language modeling.

As for MoEUT, we roughly match the model\u2019s dimensionalities and number of active channels to our dense baselines. We ran a hyperparameter optimization for the regularization losses, and we found that a minimal regularization is necessary for stabilizing the training. However, larger regularization tends to hurt performance significantly. All other hyperparameters are set based on Tan et al.\u2019s biggest translation experiments. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Effectively, SUTs, which lack our specific methods, have a significant performance disadvantage compared to our MoEUT and the parameter-matched dense baseline. Upon careful investigation, we found that most of this poor performance comes from the ACT mechanism that the authors advertise as one of the main components of their model. After removing the ACT, the performance improves dramatically. However, even with this setup, it underperforms both MoEUT and the standard Transformer baseline. This is also confirmed on downstream tasks in Tab. 2 in the appendix. Moreover, as we show in Appendix A.7, our model runs much faster and uses only a fraction of the memory required for the SUT. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any prior UT architectures that are both competitive and efficient in language modeling.

We investigate the effect of the layer grouping (Sec. 2.3) on our 244M parameter MoEUT model in Fig. 6. Here, $G$ denotes the number of non-shared layers within the group. $G=2$ corresponds to the model used in all other analyses. $G=1$ is a fully shared-layer model, without any grouping, and $G=18$ corresponds to the baseline fully non-shared $\\sigma$ -MoE model [28]. All hyperparameters are identical among all models, except for the number of MLP experts $(N_{E})$ and attention experts $(N_{A})$ , which are adjusted to match the parameter count of the dense baseline. In Fig. 6, we observe that $G=2$ is optimal, and the recurrence in the layer dimension is indeed beneficial. Another interesting question is whether the grouping described in Sec. 2.3 and Fig. 1 is the right way to stack layers. Let us call the two layers in the group A and B. The grouping we discussed so far stacks layers in the form of \u201cABABAB\u201d, e.g., for a 6-layer network. An alternative is to first repeat one of the layers multiple times, followed by the repeated version of the other: \u201cAAABBB\u201d. The \u201cAABB\u201d column of Fig. 6 shows this setup for our best $G=2$ model. It can be seen that the grouping proposed in Sec. 2.3 indeed works significantly better.

If this were the case, the model would resemble a regular Transformer instead of a Universal one. To confirm that our model is more versatile than that, we analyze whether certain experts in the MLP layers are activated only in specific layers. We measure how many times each expert is activated in each layer. This allows us to visualize the distribution of layers that each expert prefers. To better visualize the structure, we reorder experts by a heuristic which we call \u201clayer position score\u201d defined as the average of the layer indices weighted by the number of expert activations in that layer. Fig. 9 shows the results. The yellow spot in the bottom right corner indicates that some experts are assigned mostly to the final layer. However, for the other experts, there is a wide range of layers where the expert is activated. Experts seem to be active in a continuous sequence of layers.

If only $K$ experts are consistently used by a token across different contexts, it means that the token is fully \u201cspecialized\u201d to consistently use a single set of $K$ experts. This is almost the case for many tokens if we look at the first layer (blue curve): the number of unique experts used is low, i.e., the selection mainly depends on the token\u2019s identity. However, in the subsequent layers, the situation is quite different: the total number of experts used increases significantly, indicating that the context of the token is taken into account for the expert selection.

We emphasize that our focus is on developing scalable and performant Universal Transformers for parameter-dominating tasks such as language modeling. This has been a long-standing limitation of UTs. For example, Lan et al. [50] study shared-layer BERT models [51] and find that layer-sharing hurts performance in exchange for better parameter efficiency. Kaplan et al. [19] report that even though Transformer language models with inter-layer parameter-sharing scale better in terms of number of parameters, they fail to achieve compute-efficiency\u2014in contrast, our MoE-based approach is more compute-efficient than the corresponding dense baseline. On the other hand, UTs have been well-known for their compositional generalization capabilities. We refer the readers to the numerous corresponding works (e.g., [16, 15, 38, 52, 14, 10]) for results supporting the beneftis of layer sharing. Future work may also use our MoEUT in such compositional settings as a generally more efficient UT architecture. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "MoE for Transformer language models.

It is worth noting that despite many works on MoEs for Transformers (see, e.g., [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]), many of them have only focused on applying MoE to the feedforward layers. Notable exceptions are mixture-of-attention [27] and SwitchHead [31] (Sec. 2.2), which focus on MoE self-attention layers. In addition, until recently, it has been considered challenging to make MoE-based language models competitive against the dense baseline in the parameter-matched setting (unlike FLOPs/MAC-matched settings). In MoEUT, we use $\\sigma$ -MoE [28], an MoE design that has been shown to be competitive even in such a setting.

Regarding layer grouping, Takase and Kiyono [54] study various layer grouping variants to improve the efficiency of sharedlayer Transformers, also showing that layer grouping outperforms vanilla Universal Transformers. However, they consider models with large group sizes ( $G=6$ for 12 layers) and few recurrent steps (2). We find that models with smaller $G$ with more steps perform better.
