[{"figure_path": "Dgt6sh2ruQ/tables/tables_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: A summary of our algorithmic results on Algorithm 1. Constants are omitted.", "description": "This table summarizes the theoretical results obtained from Algorithm 1 under different information feedback models (full or partial) and problem characteristics (unique, non-degenerate fluid linear program (LP) or worst-case scenarios).  It shows the regret bounds achieved in both discrete and continuous settings for the request and external factors.  The regret represents the difference between the accumulated reward of the algorithm and the optimal reward.  Full-Info refers to full information feedback where the external factor is always observed, while Part-Info indicates partial information feedback, where the external factor is only observed when a non-null action is taken.", "section": "Beyond the Worst Case"}]
