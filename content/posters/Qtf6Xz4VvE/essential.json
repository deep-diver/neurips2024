The complex, high-dimensional probability distributions they learn make analysis difficult.  Previous studies only partially revealed the model's learning mechanisms.  This study focuses on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a prototypical energy-based model. \nThe researchers used a combination of analytical and numerical methods to investigate the learning dynamics of RBMs. They tracked the evolution of the model's weight matrix through singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions. The transitions mark the model's progressive learning of the principal modes of the data distribution. The analytical results were validated by training RBMs on real datasets with increasing dimensions, confirming sharp phase transitions in high-dimensional settings. The study provides a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis to support their findings.", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 PSL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Qtf6Xz4VvE/podcast.wav"}
