For each dataset (MNIST, CelebA, HGD), different image sizes were used, resulting in variations in the number of visible units (Nv), hidden units (Nh), learning rate (\u03b5), and minibatch size (Nms). These hyperparameters were selected to ensure effective training and analysis of the models.", "section": "E Details on the training and the numerical analysis"}]
