Nodes represent units, and edges indicate interference between units.  The color coding highlights the effect on a single unit (unit 2, colored orange) by its neighbors (colored blue).  The gray nodes are not directly connected to unit 2 and do not affect its reward, demonstrating the sparsity of the interference.", "section": "3 Model & Background"}, {"figure_path": "ZxZOvVOiiL/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: We simulate rewards via a sparse network interference pattern, and plot the cumulative regret as a function of N and T.

The Network MAB algorithms demonstrate significantly lower regret compared to the standard UCB approach. Notably, the Network MAB (Known) algorithm, which leverages knowledge of the network structure, exhibits even lower regret than the Network MAB (Unknown) algorithm, highlighting the benefits of incorporating network information into the learning process. The results corroborate the paper's theoretical findings demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed algorithms in the presence of sparse network interference.", "section": "6 Simulations"}]
