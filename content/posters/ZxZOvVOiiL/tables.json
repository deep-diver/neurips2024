It begins by sampling actions uniformly at random for E time steps to explore the action space. Then, it uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the observed rewards to learn a sparse linear representation of the reward function for each unit. Finally, it selects the action that maximizes the estimated average reward for the remaining T-E time steps.", "section": "4 Network Multi-Armed Bandits with Known Interference"}]
