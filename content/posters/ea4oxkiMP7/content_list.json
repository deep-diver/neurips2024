From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos.

The precise delineation of spatial regions constitutes a pivotal component in numerous applications, like interacting with the scene in embodied AI [17, 71], interaction modeling in graphics [28, 95], robotics manipulation [52, 115], and AR/VR [11].

They delineate the region where objects should be operated without specifying the region of subjects intended for executing such operations, and vice versa. This oversight limits their efficacy in shaping final interactions. Some studies explore correlations between interacting parties to jointly estimate interaction regions for both the subject and object [34, 100, 102], in which observations of the interacting parties are quite crucial, whether appearances within exocentric visuals or compatible structures formed by geometries of the subject and object. However, the egocentric view possesses incomplete observations of interacting parties, for instance, when sitting on a chair or interacting with hands accompanied by head rotation, the interacting parties are only partially visible or even completely invisible. This leads to ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, which undermines the effectiveness of these methods, resulting in gaps when directly applied to egocentric scenarios.

This motivates us to ponder: what clues could drive machines to capture effective interaction contexts and infer interaction regions from the egocentric view? Analogous to humans, in this paper, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to infer 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos (Fig. 1). Normally, objects are designed to fulfill certain human needs, the linkage between their functionalities and structures reveals their interaction concepts, implying the intention and interaction regions. When engaging in interactions with specific objects, visual observation synergistically changes with head movement, conveying the interaction intention [51]. The subject intention and object concept formulate an interaction \u201cbody image\u201d [72, 75], with it, the region humans intend to contact, and the region that objects afford for such interactions could be pre-envisioned during forming the interaction (Fig. 2).

Specifically, the appearance and motion features are mapped into interaction clues, and the object geometric feature, along with a semantic token that represents the functionality, queries these clues to calculate the 3D affordance through a parallel cross-attention. With affordance, the appearance feature is taken to query complementary interaction clues from head motion and 3D affordance in parallel, excavating the subject intention and modeling the contact representation. Despite the framework being heuristic, egocentric interaction scenarios are quite distinct e.g., with hand or body, which leads to varying effects of multiple interaction clues on modeling interaction regions in different scenarios. To adapt to this variability, EgoChoir employs modulation tokens to adjust gradients of specific layers that map interaction clues in the parallel cross-attention, endowing the model to adopt appropriate interaction clues for robustly estimating interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios.

These methods achieve significant progress in perceiving a certain side of the embodiment or surroundings. However, when embodied agents interact with their surroundings, the interaction manifests in both the interacting subject and the facing object.

Another paradigm explores correlations between geometries and interaction contents in 2D visuals e.g., exocentric images [29, 62, 74, 80, 101, 102], taking correlations to guide the estimation. This endows the model to actively anticipate based on interaction contents, which generalizes better in unseen cases.
