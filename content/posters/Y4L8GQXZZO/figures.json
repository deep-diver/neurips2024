The left graph (a) illustrates how varying the data distribution affects the optimal mixing coefficient for achieving the highest accuracy. The right graph (b) focuses on the influence of the number of users; it shows that as the number of users increases, the optimal coefficient tends toward a more globally-weighted approach (\u03b8 closer to 0).  Both graphs demonstrate that a hybrid approach (combining global and local prompts) consistently outperforms using only a global or local prompt.", "section": "6.2 Performance evaluation under various data heterogeneity"}, {"figure_path": "Y4L8GQXZZO/figures/figures_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The image demonstrates the framework of the PromptFolio algorithm.
