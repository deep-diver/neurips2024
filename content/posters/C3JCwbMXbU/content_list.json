The challenges of this task arise from the dual need to generalize across diverse domains and accurately quantify category novelty, which is critical for applications in dynamic environments. Recently, meta-learning techniques have demonstrated superior results in OSDG, effectively orchestrating the meta-train and -test tasks by employing varied random categories and predefined domain partition strategies. These approaches prioritize a welldesigned training schedule over traditional methods that focus primarily on data augmentation and the enhancement of discriminative feature learning. The prevailing meta-learning models in OSDG typically utilize a predefined sequential domain scheduler to structure data partitions. However, a crucial aspect that remains inadequately explored is the influence brought by strategies of domain schedulers during training. In this paper, we observe that an adaptive domain scheduler benefits more in OSDG compared with prefixed sequential and random domain schedulers. We propose the Evidential Bi-Level Hardest Domain Scheduler (EBiL-HaDS) to achieve an adaptive domain scheduler. This method strategically sequences domains by assessing their reliabilities in utilizing a follower network, trained with confidence scores learned in an evidential manner, regularized by max rebiasing discrepancy, and optimized in a bi-level manner. We verify our approach on three OSDG benchmarks, i.e., PACS, DigitsDG, and OfficeHome. The results show that our method substantially improves OSDG performance and achieves more discriminative embeddings for both the seen and unseen categories, underscoring the advantage of a judicious domain scheduler for the generalizability to unseen domains and unseen categories.

Recent OSDG works often take a meta-learning approach [54, 46] which simulates different cross-domain learning tasks during training. These methods conventionally use a predefined sequential domain scheduler to create meta-train and meta-test domains within each minibatch. But is fixing the meta-learning domain schedule a priori the best way to go? As a step to explore this, our work investigates the new idea of adaptive domain scheduler, which dynamically adjusts the training order based on ongoing model performance and domain difficulty. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "OSDG is critical for many real-world applications with changing conditions, ranging from healthcare [33] and security [5] to autonomous driving [19]. Despite the remarkable success of deep learning, the recognition quality often deteriorates when facing out-of-distribution samples. This problem is amplified in OSDG settings, where the model faces a dual challenge of identifying and rejecting unseen categories, e.g., by delivering low confidence score in such cases [27, 46] while simultaneously generalizing well to unseen data appearances (domain shift). Historically, research efforts in OSDG have predominantly focused on the latter, developing methods to adapt models to varying domain conditions. Strategies to improve domain generalization include the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [4], contrastive learning [65], and metric learning [27]. MLDG [46] for the first time proposed to use meta-learning to handle OSDG tasks. However, all these works follow the OSDG protocols where different source domains preserve different distributions of known categories, which diverges the domain gaps for different categories. This divergence makes the challenge more inclined towards the domain generalization aspect. Wang et al. [54] revised these benchmarks for OSDG, standardizing the category distribution across source domains to achieve a more balanced evaluation of both domain generalization and open set recognition challenges. This revision includes established open-set recognition methods such as Adversarial Reciprocal Points Learning (ARPL) [8]. Recently, Wang et al.

In this paper, we observe that different ordering strategies for domain presentation used for data partition during the meta-training and testing phases lead to significant variations in OSDG performance, emphasizing the critical role of domain scheduling in optimizing model generalization.

The key idea of our method is to quantify domain reliability, defined as the aggregated confidence of the model on the samples across unseen domains, which will then be used as the main criterion for the data partition. To assess the domain reliability, we incorporate a secondary follower network to assess the domain reliability alongside the primary network. This allows for prioritizing the optimization of meta-learning on less reliable domains, facilitating an adaptive domain scheduler-based data partitioning. This follower network is trained using bi-level optimization, which involves a hierarchical setup where the solution to a lower-level optimization problem (evaluating domain reliability) serves as a constraint in an upper-level problem (meta-learning objective). Optimization of the follower network is guided by confidence scores generated through our proposed max rebiased evidential learning method, which adjusts the confidence by amplifying the differences between the decision boundaries of different classes. As a result, the follower network can better quantify the reliability of each domain based on how distinct and consistent the classification boundaries are, improving the ability to generalize to unseen domains. EBiL-HaDS enhances cross-domain generalizability and differentiation of seen and unseen classes by prioritizing training on less reliable domains through adaptive domain scheduling.

Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., MEDIC and ODG-Net, the proposed EBiL-HaDS achieves promising performance improvements for all the domain generalization splits.

Through using EBiL-HaDS to achieve a more reasonable domain scheduler during the training, we observe that on the most challenging domain generalization split, i.e., Cartoon as unseen domain, EBiL-HaDS delivers the most performance benefits. The core strength of EBiL-HaDS is its adaptive domain scheduling, optimized through a bi-level manner to achieve maximum rebiased discrepancy evidential learning. This ensures comprehensive and discriminative data partitions during training, enhancing generalization to unseen domains, which is observed from the above experimental analyses. Significant performance gains in challenging DG splits, such as the unseen Cartoon domain, demonstrate its effectiveness in handling extreme domain shifts.

Despite the suboptimal dataset partitioning leading to declines in both close-set accuracy and OSCR, the superiority of our method remains largely unaffected by the choice of unknown classes. It consistently achieves the highest close-set accuracy and OSCR across most domains within the DigitsDG dataset, while also maintaining competitive performance in the remaining domains. This demonstrates the model\u2019s proficiency in distinguishing and recognizing known classes within the training set, as well as its capability of managing unseen classes, thereby highlighting its robustness in open-set environments.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
