It compares the accuracy and privacy metrics of three different fine-tuning methods: one without LoRA adapters, one with regular LoRA fine-tuning, and one using the proposed P3EFT method. The metrics include accuracy on three datasets (SST2, QNLI, and MNLI) and three privacy leakage measures (Spectral attack AUC, Norm attack AUC, and K-means accuracy). The table shows that P3EFT achieves comparable accuracy to regular LoRA fine-tuning while offering significantly better privacy protection.", "section": "4.2 Main fine-tuning experiments"}, {"figure_path": "6Wm4202Wvc/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Accuracy and privacy metrics.
