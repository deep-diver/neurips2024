With these designs tailored to domain-driven generation, our DomainGallery achieves convincing performance on both intra-category and cross-category generation scenarios, while supporting extra attributes added by text prompts. Additionally, DomainGallery can be aggregated with subject-driven generation as well, which further extends its applicability.

In such cases the common attributes among all the images may be subtle and hard to tell. Therefore, for few-shot domain-driven methods (not limited to DomainGallery), domains with clear common attributes are preferred. \u2022 Currently the performance of DomainGallery on domains of contents (e.g. FFHQ sunglasses) is still in need of further improvement, as we admit that the cross-category images on FFHQ sunglasses shown in Fig. 11 have undergone some cherry-picking.
