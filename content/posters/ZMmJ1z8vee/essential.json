Previous methods struggle to finetune these models effectively, leading to issues like overfitting and difficulty capturing subtle domain characteristics.  The reliance on finding suitable source datasets for transfer learning also limits their applicability.\nThis paper introduces DomainGallery, a novel few-shot domain-driven image generation method.  It tackles these challenges using four key attribute-centric finetuning techniques: prior attribute erasure, attribute disentanglement, regularization, and enhancement. Experiments demonstrate DomainGallery's superiority over existing methods, achieving improved performance across various generation scenarios (intra-category, cross-category, extra-attribute addition, and personalization).", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "ZMmJ1z8vee/podcast.wav"}
