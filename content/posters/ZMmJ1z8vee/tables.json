The underlined results of DreamBooth have severe overfitting issues hence achieve good KID scores, see qualitative results in Fig. 10.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different image generation methods on five datasets for intra-category image generation.  The metrics used are FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and I-LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) to assess image quality, and KID (Kernel Inception Distance) to measure diversity.  Lower FID and I-LPIPS scores indicate better image quality, while lower KID scores show better image diversity.  The table highlights the superior performance of the proposed DomainGallery method compared to baselines such as DreamBooth and DomainStudio, particularly in terms of balancing image quality and diversity.", "section": "5.2 Experimental Result"}]
