Existing physics-based methods struggle due to imperfect physical models and noisy input data, requiring simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing. \nThis paper introduces OSDCap, which uses a novel online filtering method (inspired by Kalman filtering) to combine kinematic observations from videos with a physics-based simulation. This method attentively balances the strengths and weaknesses of both input streams, resulting in more accurate and physically plausible motion capture.  The key contributions include a meta-PD controller for torque prediction, a recurrent neural network for attentive filtering, and a learnable inertia bias prediction to address inaccuracies in human body models. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "RkOT8rAmRR/podcast.wav"}
