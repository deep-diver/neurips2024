### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current latent-based image generative models use autoencoders to map images into a latent space. However, autoregressive models, despite using the same latent space, significantly underperform. This paper investigates this discrepancy, proposing that latent space stability is crucial for generative performance.  Previous methods prioritized reconstructive quality, potentially neglecting generative aspects.

The paper introduces DiGIT, a new image tokenizer. DiGIT uses K-means clustering on latent features from a self-supervised learning model to create a stable and discrete latent space. Experiments show that using this new method within autoregressive models dramatically improves image understanding and generation, outperforming previous methods. This highlights the importance of latent space stability for generative modeling and opens new research avenues in image autoregressive model development.

> This figure compares different image generation models based on their performance in linear probing (measuring image understanding) and class-unconditional/conditional image generation.  The size of each bubble corresponds to the number of model parameters. Subfigure (a) shows class-unconditional performance (FID and Top-1 Accuracy), and subfigure (b) shows class-conditional performance (FID and Inception Score).  The key takeaway is that DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both linear probing and image generation.

> This table presents the results of an experiment designed to assess the stability of latent spaces generated by two different methods: VQ Token and Discriminative Token.  The experiment introduces varying levels of noise (SNR) to image pixels and measures the impact on the latent spaces.  The change in tokens (VQ Token change and Disc Token change) and the cosine similarity between the tokens before and after adding noise (VQ Token cos-sim and Disc Token cos-sim) are reported for each SNR level.  Lower change values and higher cosine similarity values indicate greater stability.





### In-depth insights


#### Latent Space Stability
The concept of "Latent Space Stability" is crucial for the success of image autoregressive models.  The paper highlights that while latent diffusion models (LDMs) and masked image models (MIMs) achieve high-quality image generation, autoregressive models significantly lag behind. This is attributed to the **instability of the latent space** used by autoregressive models.  **An unstable latent space** means that small perturbations in the pixel space can lead to large changes in the latent representation, causing errors to propagate during the autoregressive generation process.  Conversely, the iterative nature of LDMs and MIMs allows for error correction, making them less susceptible to latent space instability.  The paper suggests that **optimizing for a stable latent space**, rather than solely focusing on reconstruction quality, is key for improving autoregressive model performance.  This insight is validated by proposing a new method that stabilizes the latent space using a discriminative self-supervised learning model. The resulting discrete image tokenizer then enables the autoregressive model to generate superior results. This is a key advancement as it bridges the performance gap between autoregressive and iterative image generative models.

#### DiGIT Tokenizer
The DiGIT tokenizer represents a novel approach to image tokenization, **departing from traditional autoencoder-based methods**.  Instead of relying on reconstruction-focused autoencoders like VQGAN, DiGIT leverages a **discriminative self-supervised learning model** (DINOv2) to generate discrete image tokens.  This key difference leads to a more **stable latent space**, crucial for the success of autoregressive generative models. The stability is achieved by disentangling the encoder and decoder training, focusing initially on feature extraction and later on pixel reconstruction.  This approach contrasts with iterative methods that correct for latent space instability during generation.  By applying K-Means clustering on the learned features, DiGIT creates a codebook of discrete tokens, improving both image understanding and generation, demonstrating results that surpass those obtained by existing autoregressive models. The **disentanglement of training and the use of a discriminative model** are critical to the tokenizer's effectiveness, demonstrating the value of a well-structured, stable latent space for autoregressive image generation.

#### Autoregressive Modeling
Autoregressive modeling, in the context of image generation, presents a compelling alternative to iterative methods.  Unlike diffusion models that iteratively refine noisy images, autoregressive models predict the next pixel (or token) conditioned on the preceding ones, directly constructing the image. **This approach has inherent advantages in terms of sample efficiency and theoretical simplicity.** However, a major challenge lies in the stability of the latent space‚Äîthe compressed representation of the image used for generation.  A stable latent space is crucial for accurate autoregressive generation, as error propagation in sequential prediction can severely impact the quality of the resulting image. The research emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the latent space, suggesting that the success of autoregressive models depends heavily on addressing this stability issue.  **By using a novel method for image tokenization, DiGIT significantly improves the generation quality of autoregressive models, demonstrating the potential of this approach when coupled with an effective latent space management technique.** The results highlight the importance of optimizing the latent space for image generation and showcase the power of autoregressive models when this optimization is successfully achieved.

#### Generative Performance
Generative performance in image AI models is a crucial aspect, often evaluated through metrics like FID and Inception Score.  **Higher Inception Scores** indicate more diverse and higher-quality generated images, while **lower Fr√©chet Inception Distances (FID)** show that generated images are closer to real images in terms of visual features.  The paper highlights a significant discrepancy: although employing the same latent space, autoregressive models lag behind diffusion and masked image models in image generation.  This suggests that merely optimizing a latent space for reconstruction isn't sufficient for generative capabilities.  **Latent space stability** emerges as a key factor; iterative models, like diffusion models, can correct errors from unstable latent representations, unlike the autoregressive approach. Therefore, methods focusing on stabilizing the latent space before applying autoregressive modeling, as the proposed method in the paper attempts to do, are likely to yield significant improvements in generative performance.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the stability of the latent space** is crucial, potentially through novel architectures or training methodologies beyond K-Means.  **Enhancing the scalability of the model** to handle larger datasets and higher resolutions is a key challenge.  Investigating alternative SSL models for tokenizer training could lead to further performance gains.  **Direct pixel prediction** from the discrete tokens, bypassing intermediate VQGAN or MaskGIT stages, would greatly streamline the process and could unlock better autoregressive models.  Finally, **exploring different architectures** (beyond Transformers) and assessing their compatibility with the proposed methods should be considered.  This unified perspective on latent space stability has promising implications, warranting further exploration in both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations.

> The figure illustrates the architecture of the DIGIT model.  An image is divided into patches, which are fed into a frozen discriminative self-supervised learning (SSL) model, such as DINOv2. This model extracts visual features from each patch.  These features are then clustered using K-Means, creating a codebook of discriminative tokens.  The resulting tokens are then fed into the DIGIT autoregressive model. The DIGIT model is a transformer architecture containing multiple transformer blocks which utilizes the next-token prediction principle for generating an image from the sequence of tokens, starting with a beginning-of-sequence token. The model is trained in a way that the discriminative SSL model's parameters are frozen, and the DiGIT transformer's parameters are trainable.
