However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling.

At the global level, the loss function is computed using an aggregate output such as [CLS] token or mean pooling. In contrast, patch-level models involve patches directly in loss computation. Reconstructive models, such as MAE, aim to recover image pixels in a manner akin to autoencoders, while discriminative models are optimized to learn the distinguishable features. As demonstrated in Table 4(a), the discriminative objective plays a pivotal role in image generation in that it can stabilize the latent space.
