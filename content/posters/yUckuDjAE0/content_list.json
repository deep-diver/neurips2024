The most successful approaches to assessing similarity between images involve encoding them into a compact latent space and computing the $L^{p}$ -distance between the resulting latent features. Image encoders are typically residual neural networks or vision transformers that are pre-trained in a supervised [78], weakly-supervised [36], or self-supervised [31] fashion.

It lacks semantic meaning but adversarial training (AT) for robustness using these norms (via adversarial training [52] and its many follow-up variants, e.g., [69, 80, 12, 72, 14, 61, 37]) has been found to also improve the robustness to distribution shifts associated with common, realistic image corruptions like blur or contrast changes [20, 33].

In general, releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
