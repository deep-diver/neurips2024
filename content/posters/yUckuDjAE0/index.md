### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for measuring image similarity often rely on standard norms in latent spaces, lacking semantic meaning and struggling with real-world corruptions.  Existing adversarial training (AT) techniques, which aim to improve model robustness, also suffer from limitations in handling these corruptions.  The LP-norm, commonly used, doesn't consider semantic similarity and thus often fails to correctly identify similar images. 

This paper proposes a novel method to learn Bregman divergences directly from pixel space to measure semantic similarity. This approach learns divergences that consider real-world corruptions as close to the originals, unlike traditional LP-distances.  By replacing projected gradient descent in AT with the mirror descent associated with the learned divergences, they achieve state-of-the-art robustness, particularly for contrast corruption. This method shows improvement on datasets of human perceptual similarity judgments and demonstrates the learned divergences' effectiveness in distinguishing between corrupted and noisy images.

### In-depth insights


#### Bregman Divergence
Bregman Divergence (BD) is a powerful generalization of several common distance measures, offering a flexible framework for measuring dissimilarity in various spaces.  **The core idea behind BD is its reliance on a strongly convex function, the base function, to define the distance between two points.** This allows for the incorporation of underlying geometric structures inherent in the data space which are often ignored by standard Euclidean metrics. The authors leverage BD to learn semantic similarity between images, going beyond simple pixel-wise differences.  **This is achieved through a self-supervised learning algorithm that learns a suitable base function, making the resulting BD sensitive to meaningful image corruptions.** This learned BD then forms the foundation for the development of adversarial attacks, replacing standard gradient descent with mirror descent. This innovative approach significantly enhances the robustness of adversarially trained models, particularly for contrast corruptions. **The ability to learn BD from data, coupled with its elegant mathematical properties, makes it a promising tool for various computer vision tasks requiring robust similarity assessment.**

#### Adversarial Training
Adversarial training is a crucial technique in machine learning for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks.  **The core idea is to augment the training data with adversarially perturbed examples**, generated by methods such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), to explicitly expose the model to inputs designed to fool it.  This process forces the model to learn more robust features, less susceptible to minor input modifications.  **The effectiveness of adversarial training hinges on several factors:** the choice of attack algorithm, the strength of the attack (perturbation size), and the training strategy employed.  While highly effective in improving robustness, adversarial training also presents challenges.  **It can be computationally expensive**, requiring significant resources for generating adversarial samples and retraining models.  **It can also lead to a trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy**, where models may perform less well on clean, unperturbed data after undergoing adversarial training.  Ongoing research focuses on improving the efficiency and efficacy of adversarial training, exploring alternative attack strategies, and mitigating the potential downsides of the technique.

#### Corruption Robustness
The research explores image corruption robustness, focusing on learning Bregman divergences to measure semantic similarity.  **Unlike traditional L_p norms, learned divergences prioritize semantic similarity**, considering real-world corruptions (blur, contrast changes) as close to the original, even if pixel-wise differences are large.  This is achieved through a novel self-supervised algorithm, learning base functions for Bregman divergences from image data.  **The learned divergence effectively distinguishes between corrupted and noisy images, exceeding human perceptual similarity judgments on relevant datasets**.  Moreover, it improves adversarial training (AT) by replacing projected gradient descent with mirror descent, leading to state-of-the-art robustness against contrast and fog corruptions, significantly surpassing L_p and LPIPS-based AT methods. The approach demonstrates **the power of learning data-driven similarity measures for robust machine learning**, showcasing its potential for addressing the challenges of out-of-distribution generalization.

#### Mirror Descent
Mirror descent is a powerful optimization algorithm particularly well-suited for problems involving non-Euclidean geometries or complex constraint sets.  **Its key advantage lies in its ability to adapt to the underlying geometry of the problem space**, using a Bregman divergence to measure distances and guide the search for optimal solutions.  Unlike gradient descent, which relies on Euclidean distances, mirror descent employs a more general distance metric defined by the chosen Bregman divergence.  This adaptability is crucial when dealing with data that is not well-represented in a Euclidean setting, such as probability distributions or other complex structures.  The algorithm elegantly integrates a mirror map that transforms the original space into a dual space where the optimization is simpler and often more efficient. **The method's efficiency stems from its ability to handle constraints in a natural way**, through projections onto the feasible set in the primal space.  In the context of adversarial training, mirror descent offers a compelling alternative to standard gradient-based attacks, by utilizing learned Bregman divergences to define neighborhoods of clean images and perform attacks in a semantically meaningful way. **This leads to improved robustness against real-world corruptions, as demonstrated by the paper's results on CIFAR-10-C**.  However, challenges remain, notably the computational cost and the heuristic nature of projection methods involved; future work should focus on improving efficiency and the development of more sophisticated projection techniques.

#### Semantic Similarity
The concept of semantic similarity is central to this research, focusing on how to **effectively measure the similarity between images** based on their meaning rather than simply their pixel-level differences.  The authors critique existing methods like L_p distances, arguing that they fail to capture true semantic meaning.  Their proposed solution is to learn Bregman divergences directly from the data, resulting in a more **flexible and robust metric**. This learned divergence is then used to refine adversarial training, resulting in improved image robustness to various corruptions. **The innovation lies in learning a task-specific distance metric** instead of relying on pre-defined Euclidean or other fixed-distance functions. This focus on semantic similarity allows for a more nuanced understanding of image relationships and a more effective approach to improving the robustness of image recognition models.
