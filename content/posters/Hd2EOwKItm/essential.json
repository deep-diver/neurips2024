Furthermore, the complex process often involves text preprocessing that can discard valuable information. These challenges hinder the widespread adoption and exploration of this promising field. \nSuperClass addresses these issues by employing a simple, classification-based approach. It directly uses tokenized raw text as labels, eliminating the need for text encoders and large batch sizes. This innovative methodology significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing contrastive methods on various downstream tasks.  The scalability of SuperClass, as demonstrated by experiments on different model and data sizes, makes it a highly attractive and accessible solution for researchers in the field.", "affiliation": "ByteDance Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Hd2EOwKItm/podcast.wav"}
