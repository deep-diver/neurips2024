Results are shown for PSNR and SSIM metrics on the DAVIS-test and Set8 datasets, with intervals of T=6, T=12, and T=24.  The findings reveal that while performance remains relatively consistent on the shorter DAVIS-test videos, using a larger interval (fewer key frames) leads to a noticeable decrease in performance on the longer Set8 videos.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Experiments"}]
