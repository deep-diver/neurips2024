[{"figure_path": "pK2qGRY2Hv/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Transition kernel with Tucker rank (S, S, d)", "description": "This figure shows a 3D tensor representing the transition kernel P<sub>h</sub>(s'|s, a) with Tucker rank (S, S, d).  The dimensions represent state (S), action (A), and next state (S'). The core tensor is of size S x S x d, indicating a low-rank structure along the action dimension.  The figure visually demonstrates how the transition probabilities are decomposed into a lower-dimensional representation, which is a crucial aspect of the paper's focus on low-rank structure in reinforcement learning.", "section": "3 Preliminaries"}]
