It shows how their work integrates the benefits of both Generational Training (for overcoming local optima in open-ended tasks) and implicit third-person social learning (a more general approach than explicit imitation learning). The table emphasizes that their method uniquely combines these two techniques to achieve cultural accumulation.", "section": "Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "pMaCRgu8GV/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparisons to prior work.

It highlights the differences between approaches that explicitly use imitation learning versus those that rely on implicit social learning, and those that use a single-lifetime learning framework versus those using generational training. The authors' work is positioned as a synthesis of these approaches, combining implicit social learning with a generational framework to achieve cultural accumulation.", "section": "6 Related Work"}]
