The comparison uses both 2D metrics (CLIP Score and Inception Score) and 3D quality metrics (3D Consistency and Visual Quality), which are assessed via a user study. Higher scores indicate better performance.  The results demonstrate that SceneCraft outperforms the baselines across all metrics.", "section": "Quantitative Results"}]
