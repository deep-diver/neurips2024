Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), which process a single image using floating-point values, spiking neural networks encode spatial-pixel image into temporal spike train. Information is transmitted by the occurrence of spikes (using 0 to signify no spike and 1 to denote a spike) whenever the membrane potential of a spiking neuron exceeds its threshold, thereby emulating biological neurons [30, 37, 14]. The distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics, discrete representation, and event-driven properties of SNNs enable them to operate efficiently on neuromorphic hardware [26, 4, 20, 46]. This makes them increasingly applicable to a variety of tasks [42, 19, 48], such as spatiotemporal pattern recognition [41] and high-speed detection [15]. As SNNs attract increasing attention from academia and industry, the issue of security [35] becomes more important. When SNNs are applied to safety-critical systems, their reliability should be a major concern [10]. While SNNs have demonstrated better robustness compared to ANNs [11, 32, 31], recent studies have shown that they are still vulnerable to noise [17, 8]. Among all types of perturbations, adversarial noise [35], which refers to visually imperceptible alterations that can mislead a well-trained network, is particularly concerning. Therefore, improving the robustness of SNNs is crucial for their real-life deployment.

[9] suggests that the utility of spike timing in SNNs could improve the robustness against attacks. [39, 32, 3] analyze the adversarial accuracy of SNNs trained with leak factor in LIF spiking neurons. However, these analyses rely solely on experimental analysis and lack sufficient theoretical support to ensure generalizability across all datasets and networks. Other work aims to improve the robustness of SNN from biological aspects. [10] further introduces stochasticity in biological neurons as a stochastic gating mechanism for spiking neurons to enhance model robustness. However, this may result in the loss of the original information. The noise environment encountered by the biological nervous system is highly complex, with various types of noise spanning different frequency ranges [43]. Adversarial noises also exhibit different frequencies across datasets, rather than being fixed [23, 1]. Despite this complexity, the biological nervous system maintains robustness.

Additionally, as shown in Fig. (1b), the changes in membrane potential in biological neurons are determined by ion concentration inside and outside the cell membrane. Different environments and types of nerve axon fibers can affect the degree of leak of the membrane potential [38, 13], which contributes to the biological nervous system\u2019s processing of complex noise [33].

[11] investigate the security of SNNs from the impact of structural parameters on the robustness of SNNs to adversarial attacks, and demonstrate that the inherent robustness of SNNs is highly conditioned by the choice of (time window; firing voltage thresholds) combination. [9] systematically demonstrates that precise spike timing is conducive to improving the robustness of neural networks, providing opportunities for understanding the robustness of the brain. [32] confirms that the leak factor in LIF neurons offers an extra knob to control the adversarial perturbation. [3] also investigates the role played by leak factor and concludes from frequency domain analysis that leak factor can filter high-frequency components thus improving model robustness. However, the spiking neurons used in these works only offer a simplified representation of the intricate dynamics of the biological system [10], and the robustness verification of the above works is mainly carried out experimentally, lacking a theoretical explanation. It\u2019s doubtful that their conclusion can adapt to other datasets and varying noises. Then, StoG [10] is proposed to further introduce stochasticity which is observed in biological neurons into the spiking neurons. The more biologically plausible StoG method can improve the robustness efficiently, however, it sacrifices a little original accuracy. In contrast to the aforementioned work, we conducted a theoretical analysis of the robustness of SNNs, showing that it is constrained by the encoding method and the membrane potential leak factor.

Developing more biologically plausible models is essential for improving robustness and advancing SNN applications.

In contrast, the biological nervous system can maintain stability even in complex noise environments, benefiting from the selective visual attention mechanism [7, 45] of the brain (as illustrated in Fig. (1a).

Considering the leak factor\u2019s dual role in original information transmission (Eq. (2)) and robustness enhancement (Eq. (6)), we propose EL. The EL dynamically learns the optimal robustness leak factor across different time steps and neurons, which also increases the expression capability of SNN, helping maintain clean accuracy and improving robustness. We further compare EL with two alternative strategies. The first strategy sets all leak factors to 0. The second strategy, termed Reg-EL (REL), adds L2 regularization to the EL to further constrain the leak factor. As shown in Tab. 6 in Appendix.

Specifically, our approach theoretically presents a unified framework for SNN robustness, demonstrating that refining the encoding technique and evolving the membrane potential leak factor can enhance SNN robustness. Then we propose a novel image encoding method for SNNs, termed frequency encoding (FE). FE captures information of varying frequencies at different time steps, which preserves the original information while suppressing different frequency range noises, effectively filtering out image noise. Building upon FE, we propose an evolutionary leak factor (EL). EL ensures that different neurons in the network learn the optimal robustness leak factor at different time steps. It facilitates the continual learning of information correlations across varying time steps, enabling more effective utilization of pertinent information and thereby enhancing SNN robustness. Experimental results validate that both our FE and EL methods can effectively improve the robustness of SNN to different noises, and can be used in conjunction with other methods to improve the robustness further.

Therefore, we analyze the influence by validating whether $\\mathrm{\\textregistered}$ term for robustness improvement affects $\\circleddash$ term or $\\circledast$ term\u2019s effectiveness for the same goal. To be specific, as analyzed in main paper, RAT (weights regularization) is essentially minimizing $\\circleddash$ term. And we now add a gradient constraint via the L2 norm (gradient penalty regularization (GP)) to minimize $\\circledast$ term. We conduct additional comparisons with these two methods to two alternatives of our methods. These two alternatives are implemented by additionally optimizing $\\lambda$ for methods RAT and GP (keeping remaining parts unchanged), represented as $\\mathrm{RAT+EL}$ and $\\mathrm{GP+EL}$ , respectively. As shown in Tab. of the main paper and Tab. 5 and Tab. 6, $\\mathrm{RAT+EL}$ and $\\mathrm{GP+EL}$ significantly improve the robustness of RAT and GP, across different attack types and datasets, respectively. These results show that leveraging $\\Phi$ term for robustness improvement does not interfere with $\\circleddash$ term or $\\circledast$ term\u2019s effectiveness for the same goal, indicating that the leak factor does not affect other terms in Eq.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
