Current methods often lack theoretical support and use simplified simulations of biological neurons, limiting their generalizability.  This paper addresses these issues by proposing a unified framework for SNN robustness.  \nThe paper introduces FEEL-SNN, a novel approach that leverages **Frequency Encoding (FE)** to mimic selective visual attention and **Evolutionary Leak factor (EL)** to simulate adaptive membrane potential leaks in biological neurons.  FE filters out unwanted noise based on frequencies, while EL allows each neuron to dynamically adjust its leak factor to ensure optimal robustness at different times. This combined approach significantly improves SNN robustness against various noise types and attacks, showing higher accuracy and resilience in rigorous experimental evaluations.", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "TuCQdBo4NC/podcast.wav"}
