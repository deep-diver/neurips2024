Existing research often focuses on transformers' expressive power, lacking a comprehensive understanding of their post-training operations.  In particular, the role of multiple heads within transformer layers remains an open question, especially regarding their impact on the process of in-context learning. This paper tackles this limitation by investigating how trained transformers leverage multi-head attention during in-context learning.\nThis study addresses this issue by analyzing a trained transformer's performance on a sparse linear regression task.  Through a combination of experiments and theoretical analysis, the researchers demonstrate that multi-head attention exhibits distinct patterns across different layers. Importantly, the first layer primarily focuses on data preprocessing using all available heads, while subsequent layers perform simple optimization steps using a single dominant head. The team proves that this two-stage \u2018preprocess-then-optimize\u2019 strategy surpasses standard approaches like gradient descent and ridge regression in terms of performance. This finding offers new insights into the workings of transformer models, and could potentially guide future improvements in model design and training.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fG8TukiXa5/podcast.wav"}
