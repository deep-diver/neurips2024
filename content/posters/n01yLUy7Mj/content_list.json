In the context of information theory, the channel which connects two information sources is referred to as the information channel [10], and its reliability and effectiveness is often studied through Mutual Information (MI) analysis between the two sources [53]. The training dynamics of contrastive models inherently involve a significant degree of shared knowledge between the vision and language sources, as both models must map similar points close in the embedding space. This suggests the existence of a vision-language information channel (Figure 1a) wherein the shared knowledge between the two modalities is stored.

As a result, applying existing attribution techniques [51, 60, 45, 2] does not suffice. Moreover, the information channel is composed of discrete units of information (i.e., bits), however these attribution techniques provide general, high-level interpretations (e.g., attributing the main object in the scene). They do not break-down the entangled attribution into their internal components. For instance, when applied to images of different dog breeds, attribution techniques might highlight the entire dog, indicating that the model is focusing on the correct object. However, they do not reveal what exactly in the main object influenced the model\u2019s decision. Which specific features of the dog were important? Is it the shape of the nose, the ears, the body, the head or the snout? ImageNet [30], for example, is a coarse-grained dataset, requiring models to learn distinctive concepts of an object to make decisions, but current explainability techniques do not reflect this.

Those are discrete visual units that are not in the textual domain, however each of them can be described via a textual concept. Therefore, we refer to textual concepts in the vision encoder as textual descriptions of those visual concepts. As a result, multimodal concepts in the vision encoder are corresponding pairs of visual-textual semantics describing discriminative parts of an object (Figure 1b). Depending on the dataset, an object can also refer to the main scene (e.g., lake or ocean in Places365 dataset [65]). Notably, our approach does not involve training any model to generate those multimodal concepts. The textual component of these multimodal concepts at the vision encoder are now expressive of the visual concepts in the text domain. Once the mapping of visual concepts to textual concepts is achieved, we proceed with extracting textual concepts from the language encoder. This can be achieved by identifying points around the zero-shot prediction (Figure 1c). Given the output embedding of the predicted class (green point) from the language encoder, we identify related textual concepts (grey points) around that prediction. These directly serve as textual concepts explaining the prediction.

NLEs are annotated textual explanations for the output prediction for a variety of vision and vision-language tasks, where models are explicitly trained to generate such explanations. The visual explanation counterpart is typically obtained by visualizing the attention weights of the prediction. However, there are two significant issues in NLEs. Firstly, we argue that any interpretability technique based on training is not faithful to the model being interpreted, and falls more towards the task of image captioning where the caption is the explanation. Explanations should not reflect what humans desire, but rather reflect the model\u2019s own reasoning. Training these models also involves learning biases and statistical correlations, akin to the challenges faced by any machine learning model. A recent work [47] showed that trained textual explanation models are highly susceptible to the shortcut bias learning problem, rendering the explanation ineffective despite achieving state-of-the-art results on Natural Language Generation metrics. Secondly, both the visual and textual explanations generated by NLEs are general, high-level and entangled (e.g., highlighting the main object in the scene). On the other hand, our multimodal explanations tackle both issues outlined in NLE. They are (i) training-free and (ii) offer distinctive, fine-grained concepts.

The set of descriptors with the highest similarity with respect to the global image are considered as an explanation for the prediction.

We also consider two CLIP ConvNeXt-Base models [33] from OpenCLIP, trained on LAION-400M [50] (ConvNeXt-B1), and on an aesthetic subset of LAION-5B [49] (ConvNeXt-B2). In total, our analysis comprises 13 CLIP models. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Quantitative Analysis: We start by examining the MI and its dynamics across models. In Table 3, we report the MI (applying Eq. 1) and AUC (as described in Section 3.3) for all CLIP models we analyze. Additionally, we include the dataset size used for training each model and its respective zero-shot classification accuracy on the ImageNet validation set [30]. We report these metrics for both PCA and K-means, which consistently show correlation. We sort the models based on their top-1 zero-shot accuracy. We remind readers that we define stronger shared knowledge based on higher AUC rather than higher MI. In Figure 5 (detailed further), we provide examples of classes that support this claim and contribute to this phenomenon. Our first observation is that AUC aligns well with accuracy, with ViT-B/16-dfn ranking top. Our second observation is that CLIP ViT models are characterized with stronger shared knowledge than CLIP CNNs (ResNets and ConvNeXts). This supports the premise that pretraining transformer models, which lack inductive biases, perform better when trained on larger datasets [12].

We first fix the pretraining data and vary the model and patch size. For this analysis, we use ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14 and ${\\mathrm{ViT}}{\\mathrm{J}}/{14}\\uparrow$ trained on WIT 400M. We show the curves in Figure 3 (left). As shown, larger models with more patches (either via a smaller patch size or a via a larger image size) correspond to higher AUC, suggesting that these models are better at encoding shared knowledge. Next, we fix the model size and vary the pretraining data. The results are shown in Figure 3 (middle). As shown, larger and higher-quality data lead to improved shared encoding on ImageNet. In Section G of the Appendix, we also perform analysis on the Places365 [65] and Food101 [5] datasets. The previous observations may be well-known and non-surprising. Nonetheless, what is noteworthy is the direct relationship established between the strength of the shared encoding (represented by the AUC) and model size, pretraining data and zero-shot accuracy. For example, we fit a linear line to the data points to approximate the AUC-accuracy relationship in Figure 3 (right), and determine the coefficients to be 11.24 and 25.97 for ViT models (blue line). This suggests that the accuracy is related to the strength by a factor of 11. Similarly, approximating the AUC-data relationship provides insights into the amount and quality of pretraining data required to achieve a desired strength of shared knowledge. This principle also extends to model size and could allow us to design small, efficient models. Finally, this relationship is valuable for model selection, especially in cases where accuracy alone is insufficient for distinguishing between models (e.g., models with very similar accuracies such as ${\\mathrm{ViT}}{\\mathrm{-}}{\\mathrm{L}}/14\\uparrow$ and ViT-B/16-dfn). In Table 3 and Figure 3 (green line), we show that AUC demonstrates a linear correlation with accuracy and model size within the ResNet family. It is worth noting that AUC-Accuracy relationship only holds within a given architecture; different architectures (ViT, ResNets, ConvNeXts) have different designs and ways of learning representation. Therefore, they differ in how they utilize data and encode shared knowledge. As an example, $\\mathsf{R N}{\\cdot}50\\!\\times\\!16$ includes much more dimensions to store information than ConvNeXt-B2, and it is reasonable to expect that the shared information in RN- $50\\!\\times\\!16$ is stronger, despite ConvNeXt-B2 achieves a slightly higher accuracy. In fact, the gradual design trajectory of ConvNeXt [33] was built and tuned towards a higher classification accuracy.

The corresponding textual description for each visual cluster is provided below, aligned with its corresponding color. Different from attribution-based techniques [51, 60, 45, 2] which typically highlight high-level and general features, our multimodal explanations disentangle the features to offer visually and textually distinctive, fine-grained concepts.

In Figure 5 we show examples of three classes from ImageNet: sock, siamang and crayfish. Results are averaged across all $B$ images of the class ( $B=50$ for ImageNet validation set). On the left, we show the MI curves. Note that, although the initial MI value for siamang is higher than that of sock, the AUC for sock (2.10) surpasses that of siamang (1.82). This is attributed to the fact that the curve for siamang starts at a higher point but drops faster at early stages. This shows that considering MI alone without its dynamics, is not representative of the strength of shared information. Next, we aim to delve deeper into this analysis using our multimodal explanations. To accomplish this, we examine the same semantic concept corresponding across all images. In Figure 5 (right), we showcase the semantic concept representing a gibbon body for the \"siamang\" class (e.g., dark fur with light markings; four-limbed primate), visually identified by the red color. Similarly for the \"sock\" class, we show the semantic concept of patterns and styles (e.g., various colors, patterns, and styles; plush texture; decorative pattern), visually identified by the blue color. Analyzing the curves and the area under them suggests that general concepts such as patterns and styles are better encoded than discriminative concepts such as the body of a siamang. This rationale stems from the fact that CLIP was trained on a dataset from the internet, which is less discriminatory; it is less common to encounter images of an endangered specie of a gibbon compared to general concepts such as patterns and styles, which are prevalent characteristics across many objects in the world.

As shown, the token features of the last layer are dissimilar to all previous layers, while the similarity of the key features is consistent across all layers. This is rational since token features (a function of the key features) have to adapt their feature space to align with language features. However, by running object localization experiments on the full ImageNet validation split, we find that this phenomenon is only present in large models. In Table 1 we report the CorLoc metric where we fit a bounding box around the most prominent region and calculate the percentage of samples with an IoU larger than 0.5 between that box and the ground-truth bounding box. In general, key features are more stable. By further examining the results, we note that PCA performs significantly worse than Graph Decomposition (GDC) of the feature affinity matrix, suggesting the presence of complex features that cannot be captured through linear combinations of dimensions, requiring graph-based approaches to model higher-order relationships. Therefore, we adopt eigenvector decomposition of the graph affinity matrix as the primary method for extracting prominent patches.

However, interpolation usually results in pixel overshooting effects. As an alternative interpolation technique, we use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [28] to interpolate the patchbased importance map to a finer-grained pixel-based map. Prior to this, we remove noisy scattered patches by extracting the largest fully-connected component (FCC) of the importance map, which represents the largest primary connected region. A recent work [15] shows that this approach enhances explainability. It is important to note that both the FCC and CRF preserve the original importance map\u2019s integrity and do not compromise its faithfulness. This is quantitatively demonstrated in Table 3 for several ViT and ResNet CLIP models. We first evaluate the effect of interpolating the binary importance map produced by eigendecomposition using nearest neighbor interpolation. To perform this evaluation, we blur the non-prominent regions of the image (those with a negative sign in $e_{f}$ ) using an $11\\times11$ Gaussian kernel, effectively removing the details from these areas. We opt to blur those areas rather than zeroing them out in order to avoid the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem reported in [21, 46]. We then reassess the zero-shot accuracy. As shown, using only the most prominenet features identified by eigendecomposition does not drastically reduce the zero-shot accuracy, with a loss of only $3\\%$ on average. This validates that the features obtained by eigendecomposition are indeed the most important and are the ones that mainly (largely) contribute to the model\u2019s performance. Next, we show the effect on zero-shot accuracy when taking the FCC, followed by CRF. As shown, this results in very marginal effects on accuracy compared to Nearest Neighbor interpolation, indicating that these components does not alter the underlying importance map. Note that the marginal effect can be either positive, where the FCC enhances zero-shot accuracy, or negative, where excluding regions other than the fully-connected component reduces accuracy. In both scenarios, the effect is very minimal and can be considered negligible. Therefore, we decided to use these two components to achieve better visualizations.

Next, a linear classifier is trained on top of $U$ to classify images.

Training a new classifier to predict targets from a set of concepts allows us to understand what concepts the new classifier learned, and not what the existing model learned. In fact, the work of [64] (further discussed in Section J) shows that linear classifiers utilize completely irrelevant textual concepts to make predictions, highlighting that re-training a linear classifier results in a complete transformation in the decision-making process of the original model to be explained.

This renders these methods unfaithful to the model and more akin to the task of image captioning, with the exception that they are trained on a subset of features from different layers. This is especially evident in DeViL [11] where an autoregressive generator is trained on the CC3M image captioning dataset [52] using a subset of features from different layers implemented by applying Dropout. Furthermore, these models capture biases and statistical correlations between the features and descriptions, despite achieving high evaluation scores on Natural Language Generation metrics. This phenomenon is evident by three key observations from the literature. Firstly, [47] highlighted that trained textual explanation models are characterized with the shortcut bias learning problem, rendering the textual explanation ineffective. Secondly, there exists a disparity in performance when a neuron text generator trained on MILAN annotations [19] using features from one network (e.g., ResNet-101), is used to explain features of a different network (e.g., ViT). In such scenarios, the achieved results are notably low, often approaching levels of $30\\%$ accuracy, owing to discrepancies in feature spaces. This discrepancy underscores the fundamental premise that feature distributions cannot be assumed similar across models. Thirdly, the work of [64] shows that even non-autoregressive models such as simple linear classifiers use completely irrelevant textual concepts at the bottleneck to make predictions, showing that training renders the extracted textual concepts as ineffective. Another challenge in Neuron Annotation arises from the impracticality of annotating all neurons within a model. Due to this constraint, only a fraction of neurons can feasibly be annotated. For example, a ViT with 12 layers contains 2048 neurons in each of its hidden MLP layers, amounting to 24,576 neurons in total. However, MILAN [19] annotates only 1200 neurons ( $4\\%$ of the total MLP neurons). Consequently, these neuron annotation techniques offer a narrow view of the model\u2019s global behaviour.

We implement this using DropBlock [17], an effective dropout technique [58] applicable to CNNs which drops a group of neighboring patches rather than individual patches. We use the per-class descriptors as ground-truth descriptors and train the classifier with Binary Cross-Entropy Loss on the full ImageNet training set, and validate it on the ImageNet validation set. An overview of this process for both training and concept labeling is shown in Figure 5. The feature activation map of the neuron with the highest norm usually identifies the main object in the scene, and acts similar to the Fiedler eigenvector we use in Section 3.1 of the main paper, while the remaining neurons act as the visual concepts we use. We show examples of this from 6 different images in Figure 6, with the left-most feature activation map representing the highest spatial norm. For each feature map, we normalize its values to be in the range between 0-1, and mask out values lower than a threshold of 0.9. We discover that neuron 689 (highest spatial norm) always encodes the main object, while other neurons are responsible for encoding visual concepts related to the object. The classifier attains a top-all accuracy of $65.76\\%$ , where \"top-all\" denotes the accuracy when all textual concepts of a class are accurately predicted. However, it is important to acknowledge that achieving high accuracy in this context is challenging due to the potential applicability of textual concepts from images of one class to images from another class. For instance, textual concepts such as large eyes may be relevant to numerous ImageNet classes, potentially exceeding 200 classes, yet they are only designated as one of the ground-truth concepts for 34 classes. Consequently, while predictions remain technically correct, they are penalized in terms of accuracy. Hence, we assess accuracy at the top-10 level rather than top-all, which involves considering the top-10 predicted textual concepts and measuring their alignment with the ground-truth concepts. This evaluation yields an accuracy of $83.84\\%$ .

The deletion metric [42] starts with the original image and gradually removes image information (e.g., pixels or patches) deemed most important by the explanation algorithm. The output score of the predicted class is then plotted as a function of the image information being removed, resulting in a curve. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is then computed. A sharp decrease in this curve (low AUC) generally reflects a faithful explanation to the model. The intuition behind the deletion metric is that the removal of the \"cause\" will decrease the probability of the predicted class as important pixels are gradually removed. The insertion metric follows a similar process but in reverse, starting with a baseline image which removes the visual information of the image (e.g., a heavily blurred version of the image), and gradually adds pixels or patches. In this case, a higher AUC indicates a more faithful explanation. ", "page_idx": 22}, {"type": "text", "text": "To adapt these metrics to our multimodal explanations and to the baseline methods, we perform the following steps: Initially, we rank the concepts in descending order of importance. Since each multimodal (visual-textual) concept is considered as one entity, the scores of the two modalities should be interdependent and mutually influential. We therefore compute the product of two similarity scores. The first score represents the CLIP visual similarity between the image and the visual concept, and the second represents the CLIP visual-language similarity between the image and textual descriptor. A visual concept and descriptor both representative will yield a higher score in this ranking process. Following the ordering of multimodal concepts, we proceed to add (in the case of insertion) or remove (in the case of deletion) the concepts. Given that the entities in our case are the concepts rather than individual pixels or patches, this process entails $L$ steps of insertion or deletion, where $L$ represents the number of concepts. Subsequently, we plot the zero-shot predicted class score against the concepts being added or removed. It is worth noting that removal of visual information typically involves zeroing out regions of the image, a practice that some recent studies [21, 46] have found leads to a change in the curve primarily due to the generation of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples when portions of the image are zeroed out. To avoid this problem, we opt to blur the concept instead of zeroing it out. Figure 7 illustrates examples of both insertion and deletion steps along with their corresponding curves. We additionally incorporate the AccDrop metric proposed in [7] (denoted as the Positive Perturbation Test in [7]), which behaves similar to the deletion metric, but keeps track of the accuracy score rather than the predicted class score. By averaging results across the ImageNet validation set, this curve illustrates the decrease in validation accuracy as concepts are removed from the images. Lastly, we present the AccIncrease metric, which stands in contrast to AccDrop. Evaluation is conducted on the ImageNet validation set, and the results are averaged.

In the simplest case, one could crop the region of interest from the image, and only feed that region to CLIP. This approach [59], however, removes contextual information and blurs the resulting cropped image, since the small crop has to be resized to the larger image size which CLIP expects. Recently, [54] show that by simply drawing a red circle on the region of interest, the CLIP vision encoder\u2019s attention shifts towards that region, effectively encoding it while also preserving contextual information and preserving spatial information. This work greatly outperforms the cropping-based approach.

The work of [64] investigates how well contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP learn textual concepts (denoted as primitive concepts) that together compose the predicted label (denoted as a compositional concept). This work first builds a Concept Bottleneck model for CLIP, and then analyzes it. Similar to [39], the bottleneck layer is built by the similarity of an image to all textual descriptors. A linear model is then trained on top of the similarity output to classify images. A prediction can then be directly explained by the linear combination of the textual concepts from the bottleneck layer. Next, a classifier is trained on the binary ground-truth textual concepts (denoting this model as Oracle-Prim), achieving almost $100\\%$ accuracy and validating the hypothesis that a linear compositional model can be learned from the ground-truth primitive concepts. The quantification of primitive concepts learned is measured by the difference between the classifier weights of Oracle-Prim (the learned classifier weight values when trained and fed with the binary ground-truth concepts) and the bottleneck model (the learned classifier weight values when trained on the similarity output of CLIP but fed with the binary ground-truth concepts). A smaller difference implies better performance of the bottleneck classifier. Note that this measure does not depend on the input, since in both cases the classifier is fed with the ground-truth textual concepts. They find that the difference is high. However, when the bottleneck classifier is fed with the similarity output from CLIP (what it was trained on) rather than the ground-truth concepts, the difference becomes smaller (better), implying that the classifier is utilizing irrelevant primitive concepts for prediction. To confirm this, they further evaluate the accuracy between the Oracle-Prim model and the ground-truth concepts, and show that it is almost perfect $(\\approx\\!97\\%)$ . Then they evaluate the accuracy between the bottleneck classifier and the ground-truth concepts, and show that it is very low, even approaching $0\\%$ .
