Unfortunately, training such an ensemble becomes computationally intractable as the complexity of the model architecture grows.

Furthermore, our proposed approach scales to modern network architectures such as Attention U-Net and yields more accurate uncertainty estimates compared to existing methods.

However, recent advances in accelerated sampling strategies have largely mitigated this issue and allow for few [53] (and in some cases single [54]) step sampling from DMs. Secondly, hyper-networks suffer from a scalability problem in that their number of parameters scales with the number of primary network parameters. This stems from the fact that the dimensionality of the hyper-network\u2019s output layer is (in most cases) proportional to the number of parameters in the primary network [9]. Several works address this issue by proposing more efficient weight generation strategies [61, 2, 26]. Nonetheless, these problems remain a promising avenue for future research.

Unfortunately, the gold standard for uncertainty estimation\u2014deep ensembles\u2014is prohibitively expensive to train, especially on modern network architectures containing billions of parameters. In this work, we propose HyperDM, a framework capable of approximating deep ensembles at a fraction of the computational training cost. Specifically, we combine Bayesian hyper-networks and diffusion models to generate a distribution of predictions with which we can estimate total uncertainty and its epistemic and aleatoric sub-components. Our experiments on weather forecasting and CT reconstruction demonstrate that HyperDM significantly outperforms pseudo-ensembling techniques like Bayesian neural networks and Monte Carlo dropout in terms of prediction quality. Moreover, when compared against deep ensembles, HyperDM achieves up to an $M\\times$ reduction in training time while yielding predictions of similar (if not superior) quality, where $M$ is the ensemble size.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
