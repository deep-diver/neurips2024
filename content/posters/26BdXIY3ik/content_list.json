Considering the complex topological structure information presented in the graph, this paper seek to leverage these critical structure information to assist the transfer of shared node knowledge. To this end, we propose an innovative SGDA framework named TFGDA that employs a Subgraph Topological Structure Alignment (STSA) strategy to encode structure information into latent space.

Furthermore, current works [2, 10, 4] primarily utilize adversarial training to reduce domain discrepancy. However, adversarial training is an unstable process that may destroy the discriminative details hidden in features [11], thereby affecting the transfer of shared knowledge. To remedy this issue, we propose a Sphere-guided Domain Alignment (SDA) strategy, aiming to achieve more stable domain alignment. Concretely, SDA initially maps node features to the spherical space.

To address this overftiting issue, we devise a Robustness-guided Node Clustering (RNC) strategy to effectively enhance the model\u2019s robustness.

Therefore, maximizing this objective $\\mathcal{L}_{m i}$ involves a trade-off between minimizing the conditional cluster assignment entropy $E(\\phi|\\phi^{\\xi})$ and maximizing the entropy of individual cluster assignments $E(\\phi)$ . Specially, the minimum value of $E(\\phi|\\phi^{\\xi})$ is 0, which is achieved when the cluster assignments can be precisely predicted from each other. The maximum value of $E(\\phi)$ is $\\ln K$ , achieved when all clusters have an equal probability of being selected, where $K$ is the number of classes. This situation arises when the data is evenly distributed among the clusters, resulting in an equal distribution of their masses. Hence, the loss function cannot minimized when all samples are assigned to the same cluster. In such case, maximizing MI naturally achieves a balance between reinforcing predictions and equalizing the cluster masses, thereby avoiding the occurrence of degenerate clustering solutions.
