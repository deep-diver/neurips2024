### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often struggle with non-stationary optimization landscapes due to continuously changing objectives, leading to instability and suboptimal performance.  Existing methods, like target networks and clipped policy updates, attempt to mitigate this issue but lack theoretical grounding.  Adam, a widely used optimizer, relies on a global timestep assumption that breaks down in non-stationary settings.

This paper introduces Adam-Rel, a modified Adam optimizer that uses a **relative timestep** within each epoch. This simple modification prevents large updates resulting from objective changes.  Through rigorous experiments on Atari and Craftax, the authors demonstrate that Adam-Rel significantly outperforms standard Adam and other related methods.  The study also offers a theoretical analysis explaining the benefits of the proposed method and showcases its effectiveness in handling various types of non-stationarity.

### In-depth insights


#### Adam's Nonstationarity
The concept of "Adam's Nonstationarity" explores how the Adam optimizer, widely used in machine learning, behaves in the nonstationary environment typical of reinforcement learning (RL).  **Adam's inherent reliance on past gradients assumes stationarity**, meaning the data distribution remains consistent over time. However, in RL, the environment and the agent's policy are constantly changing, leading to nonstationary gradients. This mismatch causes issues like **large, unpredictable updates**, hindering learning and potentially leading to instability. The paper likely investigates the theoretical analysis of Adam's update rule under nonstationary conditions, revealing how past gradients can hinder adaptation in changing environments. It further proposes and evaluates modifications to the Adam algorithm, such as the introduction of a relative timestep or a reset mechanism, to improve performance in nonstationary settings.  **The analysis likely demonstrates that adapting Adam for RL requires modifications to better handle the dynamics of nonstationary data.**

#### Adam-Rel: Epoch Reset
The proposed Adam-Rel algorithm, featuring an epoch reset mechanism, offers a novel approach to mitigating the challenges of non-stationarity in reinforcement learning.  By resetting Adam's internal timestep at the beginning of each epoch, **Adam-Rel prevents the accumulation of outdated momentum estimates** that can hinder learning when the objective function changes due to policy updates or other factors. This approach effectively addresses gradient magnitude instability by avoiding excessively large updates in the presence of abrupt objective shifts. Unlike complete optimizer resets, Adam-Rel preserves valuable momentum information, leading to more efficient and stable learning. **The epoch reset strategy elegantly transitions to learning rate annealing when gradient changes are gradual**, further enhancing robustness and performance.  Empirically, Adam-Rel demonstrates improvements in various RL benchmarks, showcasing its practical efficacy in addressing non-stationarity, a persistent issue in RL optimization.  **Its simple implementation and adaptability make it a promising solution for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of Adam in non-stationary reinforcement learning environments.**

#### Atari & Craftax Tests
The Atari and Craftax tests in the research paper served as crucial empirical evaluations to assess the performance of Adam-Rel, a novel optimizer designed to address nonstationarity in reinforcement learning.  **Atari**, a benchmark known for its diverse and challenging games, provided a strong test of the algorithm's robustness across multiple tasks with varying degrees of complexity and dynamics. Similarly, **Craftax**, with its procedural generation of environments, offered a unique assessment of the algorithm's ability to adapt and optimize consistently even when facing significant environmental variability. The results from both benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance by Adam-Rel over standard Adam, confirmed the algorithm's efficacy and emphasized its significant contribution to addressing the challenges presented by nonstationarity in RL.**  The detailed analysis across these two very different testing environments provides compelling evidence supporting the claims made in the paper.  The selection of both on-policy and off-policy settings further strengthened the validity and generalizability of the findings.

#### Gradient Norm Analysis
A Gradient Norm Analysis section would delve into the magnitude of gradients during training, exploring how these magnitudes change over time and in response to various factors.  **Nonstationarity in reinforcement learning (RL)** would be a key focus, investigating how shifts in the objective function (e.g., due to target network updates) impact gradient norms.  The analysis might involve comparing gradient norms across different algorithms (e.g., Adam vs. Adam-Rel) or different phases of training (e.g., early vs. late stages).  **Visualizations, such as plots of gradient norms over time,** would be crucial for illustrating the observed patterns and relationships.  Furthermore, the analysis could compare empirical findings with theoretical predictions of gradient behavior under nonstationary conditions.  This comparison would help assess the accuracy and limitations of theoretical models and potentially guide the development of more robust optimization techniques for RL.  **An important aspect would be to examine the relationship between gradient norms and algorithm performance**, such as return or success rates.  Finally, the analysis should also discuss the implications of gradient norm behavior for algorithm stability and design choices.  In short, Gradient Norm Analysis is critical for understanding RL optimization and improving its efficacy.

#### Future Work: RL Scope
Future research directions in reinforcement learning (RL) could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending Adam-Rel to continuous non-stationary settings** is crucial, as many RL algorithms face this challenge.  **Investigating the interplay between Adam-Rel and other RL techniques**, such as different learning rate schedules or exploration strategies, would offer valuable insights.  **Analyzing the impact of Adam-Rel on more diverse RL tasks and environments**, beyond the Atari and Craftax benchmarks, is important for assessing its generalizability.  Furthermore, a deeper **theoretical understanding of the interaction between non-stationarity and optimization algorithms**, particularly Adam's update rule, could lead to the development of more robust and efficient methods. Finally, **directly addressing the plasticity loss** problem‚Äîthe inability of models to adapt to changing objectives‚Äîusing this approach warrants future investigation.
