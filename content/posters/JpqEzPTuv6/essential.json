Recent PLL algorithms are highly complex and varied, making it difficult to determine optimal design choices.  This creates a need for a better understanding of what makes a PLL algorithm truly effective.\nThis paper addresses this issue by performing a comprehensive empirical analysis of existing PLL methods.  **The researchers identify that successful methods share a common behavior:  a progressive transition from uniform to one-hot pseudo-labels.  This transition is achieved through a process called mini-batch PL purification.**  The authors then present a minimal algorithm that leverages this process, demonstrating surprisingly high accuracy,  highlighting the critical role of mini-batch PL purification.  This simplifies future research by providing essential design guidelines.", "affiliation": "Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "JpqEzPTuv6/podcast.wav"}
