This leads to suboptimal performance, as promising candidates might be prematurely discarded.  The paper highlights the significant performance limitations caused by ignoring uncertainty in iterative machine learning model training, particularly in the early stages.\nThis paper introduces a novel UQ-guided scheme to address this issue. By quantifying model uncertainty and incorporating it into the candidate selection and budget allocation process, the UQ-guided scheme enhances existing HPO techniques.  Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements, achieving over 50% reduction in accuracy regret and exploration time compared to traditional methods. This work emphasizes the importance of considering model uncertainty for effective HPO.", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Hyperparameter Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "k9uZfaeerK/podcast.wav"}
