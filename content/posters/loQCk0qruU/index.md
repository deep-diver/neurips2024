### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large vision models, while powerful, often struggle with **low confidence** when fine-tuned on limited data (few-shot learning).  This significantly limits their use in real-world applications where trust and reliability are paramount.  Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, while improving efficiency, exacerbate this under-confidence. 



The researchers introduce Bayesian-PEFT, a novel framework that tackles this problem head-on.  It uses **two key Bayesian components**: base rate adjustment to boost confidence and a diversity-inducing evidential ensemble to ensure robust performance.  Results across multiple datasets showcase a dramatic improvement in both **accuracy and calibration**, demonstrating the effectiveness of Bayesian-PEFT for building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

> This figure compares the accuracy and expected calibration error (ECE) of various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods on the CIFAR100 dataset for few-shot (1-20 shot) adaptation.  It demonstrates that while PEFT methods achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from poor calibration (high ECE), especially in low-shot learning scenarios.  The figure highlights the under-confidence problem where models are often too hesitant to make confident predictions, even when they are accurate.  Bayesian-PEFT, a new method proposed in the paper, aims to address this issue.

> This table presents the prediction accuracy and expected calibration error (ECE) for different few-shot learning scenarios across four benchmark datasets (Cifar10, Cifar100, Food101, Flowers102).  The results are broken down by the number of shots (1, 2, 5, 10, 20) and show the performance of four model types: a standard model, an evidential model, a calibrated evidential model (base-rate adjusted), and the proposed Bayesian-PEFT model. This allows for a comparison of the calibration and accuracy improvements achieved by each method.





### In-depth insights


#### Bayesian PEFT
Bayesian Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (Bayesian PEFT) is a novel approach that enhances the performance of standard PEFT methods by incorporating Bayesian principles.  **It directly addresses the under-confidence issue** commonly observed in PEFT-adapted foundation models, especially in low-data regimes.  This is achieved through two key components:  **base rate adjustment** which strengthens the prior belief based on pre-training knowledge, boosting confidence in predictions; and the construction of a **diversity-inducing evidential ensemble**, which leverages belief regularization to ensure diverse ensemble members and improve reliability.  The combination of these components provides **well-calibrated uncertainty quantification**, crucial for trustworthy predictions in high-stakes applications. The theoretical analysis underpinning Bayesian PEFT establishes its reliability and accuracy, validated empirically across diverse datasets and few-shot learning scenarios.  **Its superior performance relative to standard PEFT and post-hoc calibration methods** highlights its potential as a significant advancement in efficient and reliable model adaptation.

#### Underconfidence Issue
The research paper highlights a critical "underconfidence issue" in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large vision foundation models.  **Adapted models, while achieving high accuracy in few-shot learning scenarios, exhibit surprisingly low confidence in their predictions.** This underconfidence, measured by high Expected Calibration Error (ECE) scores, significantly limits the models' reliability and applicability, especially in high-stakes decision-making. The root cause is identified as the **rich prior knowledge from pre-training overshadowing the limited knowledge gained during few-shot adaptation**. This leads to overly conservative predictions, hindering confident decision-making.  The paper proposes a novel Bayesian-PEFT framework to address this, integrating PEFT with Bayesian components to strengthen prior beliefs and build a diverse evidential ensemble, ultimately improving both prediction accuracy and calibration.

#### Base Rate Adj
The heading 'Base Rate Adj,' likely refers to a method adjusting base rates within a Bayesian framework.  This is crucial because **foundation models often show underconfidence**, especially in few-shot scenarios.  By adjusting base rates, the model's prior belief (knowledge from pre-training) is strengthened, leading to **more confident predictions** without sacrificing accuracy.  The adjustment strategy likely involves modifying Dirichlet parameters, balancing prior knowledge with limited new data.  The theoretical justification would involve showing that base rate adjustments maintain prediction accuracy while increasing confidence, perhaps by widening the gap between belief assigned to the true class versus others.  This technique directly addresses the core issue of **overly cautious predictions** arising from the clash between massive pre-training and limited fine-tuning data.

#### Evidential Ensemble
An evidential ensemble in the context of machine learning leverages the principles of evidential reasoning to combine predictions from multiple models. Unlike traditional ensembles that simply average predictions, an evidential ensemble explicitly models uncertainty associated with each prediction. Each model provides not only a prediction but also a measure of its confidence (belief) in that prediction. **The ensemble then integrates these beliefs using the rules of subjective logic or similar frameworks, leading to a final prediction that reflects the collective evidence from all models.** This approach is particularly useful when dealing with diverse and potentially conflicting information or scenarios where individual models may be highly uncertain. The resulting prediction provides a more robust and calibrated estimate, along with a quantifiable measure of overall uncertainty. The use of evidential theory makes this method powerful because it allows for representing different sources of uncertainty and combining evidence from diverse models while handling inconsistencies effectively.  Moreover,  **evidential ensembles are inherently more reliable in situations where few-shot learning or challenging data conditions lead to significant uncertainty in individual model predictions.**

#### Future Works
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending Bayesian-PEFT to other PEFT methods** beyond the ones tested (VPT, Adapter, Bias) is crucial to establish its broader applicability and effectiveness.  Investigating the impact of different backbone architectures and pre-training strategies on Bayesian-PEFT's performance would provide valuable insights.  **Developing more sophisticated methods for base rate adjustment** and diversity-inducing evidential ensemble techniques could further improve the model's calibration and uncertainty quantification.  It's also important to **evaluate B-PEFT on larger, more complex datasets and real-world applications** to assess its robustness and scalability. Finally, examining the use of B-PEFT with self-supervised pre-trained models and exploring the interaction of model uncertainty with out-of-distribution detection are exciting directions for future research.
