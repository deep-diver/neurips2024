Independent sampling can lead to increased computational cost and slow convergence. This paper addresses these challenges. \n\nThis research introduces **without-replacement sampling** based algorithms (WiOR-BO and WiOR-CBO) for both standard and conditional bilevel optimization.  These algorithms demonstrate **faster convergence rates** compared to existing methods and show significant computational savings by requiring fewer gradient evaluations and backward passes. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world tasks, showcasing the superiority of the proposed algorithms.
