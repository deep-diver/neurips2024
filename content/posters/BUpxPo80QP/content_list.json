Our key observation is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled. That is, the high-level semantics of an interaction, aligned with its textual description, can be informed by human motion and the initial object pose. Meanwhile, the low-level dynamics of the interaction \u2013 specifically, the subsequent behavior of the object \u2013 is governed by the forces exerted by the human, within the constraints of physical laws.

Nevertheless, by decoupling interaction dynamics from semantics, a key advantage emerges in our InterDreamer framework: interaction dynamics can be learned from motion capture data without the necessity of text annotations. We instantiate this idea by developing a world model, which predicts the subsequent state of an object affected by the interaction. The key here is to reach generalizable representations in different motion and objects. To do so, we exert control over the object through the motion of vertices on the human body. These vertices are solely sampled in regions where contact occurs, agnostic to the overall object shape and whole-body motion. Such abstraction empowers the model to learn the simple dynamics from a publicly available 3D HOI dataset BEHAVE [7], and generalize naturally to other datasets [47, 66].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
