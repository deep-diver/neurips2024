### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many scientific applications involve estimating the distribution of parameters that best match observed data.  This is challenging because many parameter distributions can lead to nearly identical data. **Existing methods often struggle with this ill-posedness, and those that use likelihood-based approaches are not applicable to simulators with intractable likelihoods.**

This paper introduces Sourcerer, a new method that uses the maximum entropy principle. Sourcerer works directly from samples generated from the simulator and doesn't require computing likelihoods, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches. **Sourcerer successfully recovers source distributions with significantly higher entropy without compromising simulation accuracy across various benchmark tasks, including a real-world electrophysiology dataset.**

> üîº The figure illustrates the concept of maximum entropy source distribution estimation.  It shows that multiple different source distributions q(Œ∏) can produce the same data distribution q#(x) after being passed through a simulator p(x|Œ∏). This is a problem because the inference task (source distribution estimation) becomes ill-posed; there isn't a unique solution. The solution proposed in the paper is to select the maximum entropy source distribution, which is guaranteed to be unique.

> Figure 1: Maximum entropy source distribution estimation. Given an observed dataset D = {x1,...,xn} from some data distribution p‚ÇÄ(x), the source distribution estimation problem is to find the parameter distribution q(Œ∏) that reproduces p‚ÇÄ(x) when passed through the simulator p(x|Œ∏), i.e. q#(x) = ‚à´ p(x|Œ∏)q(Œ∏)dŒ∏ = p(x) for all x. This problem can be ill-posed, as there might be more than one distinct source distribution. We resolve this by targeting the maximum entropy distribution, which is unique.

### In-depth insights


#### MaxEnt Source Estimation
MaxEnt source estimation presents a novel approach to a long-standing challenge in scientific modeling: inferring the underlying distribution of simulator parameters from observational data.  The method leverages the principle of maximum entropy, **prioritizing the most uncertain distribution** that's still consistent with the data. This elegantly addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, where multiple parameter distributions could lead to similar observations.  The use of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance further enhances the approach's practicality by enabling evaluation without relying on tractable likelihood functions, which are often unavailable for complex scientific simulators.  This sample-based approach makes MaxEnt source estimation broadly applicable, demonstrating superior performance in recovering high-entropy distributions across various tasks, from simple benchmarks to complex real-world datasets.  The **combination of maximum entropy and the Sliced-Wasserstein distance** marks a significant contribution, offering a robust and principled method for navigating the inherent uncertainties in scientific model inference.

#### Sample-Based Inference
Sample-based inference, as a methodology, offers a compelling alternative to traditional likelihood-based approaches, particularly when dealing with complex or intractable models.  Its strength lies in its ability to work directly with simulated data, bypassing the need for explicit likelihood calculations. This is crucial for many scientific applications where models are highly complex and the likelihood function is either unavailable or computationally expensive to evaluate. By focusing on the distance between simulated and observed data distributions, sample-based methods offer a flexible and powerful framework.  **The choice of distance metric is key** and must be carefully considered to match the problem's unique features. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) is highlighted in the paper for its computational efficiency and differentiability. However, **the generalizability of the approach depends on the choice of distance metric and its suitability for high-dimensional data**.   The maximum entropy principle, as adopted by the authors, provides a principled approach for choosing among equally valid solutions, which is especially beneficial in cases where the inverse problem is ill-posed. By maximizing entropy, the method effectively incorporates uncertainty quantification into the estimation procedure, which is a significant advantage for scientific modeling. The method's sample-based nature enables its application to scientific simulators with complex dynamics, potentially opening up new avenues for analyzing complex scientific systems where likelihood-based methods fall short. **The demonstrated applications to electrophysiological data analysis and other high-dimensional problems showcases the significant impact of this approach**.

#### Sliced-Wasserstein Metric
The Sliced-Wasserstein distance is a **powerful tool** for comparing probability distributions, particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or intractable likelihoods.  It cleverly addresses the computational challenges of directly calculating Wasserstein distances in high dimensions by **projecting** the distributions onto many lower-dimensional subspaces (typically one-dimensional).  The Wasserstein distance is then computed on these projections, and the final Sliced-Wasserstein distance is the average of these lower-dimensional distances. This approach offers a **significant computational advantage**, making it suitable for large datasets and complex simulations. Its **differentiability** is a key strength, allowing for use in gradient-based optimization methods, as demonstrated in the paper's source distribution estimation framework.  However, the choice of the number of projections and the type of projection can influence results.  **Careful consideration** must be given to the selection of these hyperparameters to ensure robust and reliable comparisons, especially in the presence of complex data structures or significant noise.

#### High-Dimensional Results
In the realm of high-dimensional data analysis, the challenges are amplified significantly.  This section would likely delve into the application of the proposed maximum entropy method to datasets exhibiting high dimensionality, possibly examining both deterministic and probabilistic simulators.  **The core focus would be to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the method** when dealing with a large number of variables or parameters, particularly where traditional likelihood-based methods struggle.  A key element would be evaluating its performance against established baselines, assessing the fidelity of the resulting simulations, and examining the trade-off between accuracy and the preservation of uncertainty (high entropy) in the inferred source distributions.  **The use of sample-based metrics, such as the Sliced-Wasserstein distance,** is crucial in this setting to bypass the computational limitations of high-dimensional likelihood calculations, and its efficacy would be a central point of discussion. The section would likely present compelling case studies, possibly including specific applications within scientific domains where high-dimensional data is prevalent, showcasing the benefits and practical utility of this novel approach.

#### Hodgkin-Huxley Model
The Hodgkin-Huxley model, a cornerstone of neurophysiology, is tackled in this research with a novel approach.  The paper uses the model not to simulate neuron behavior directly, but as a complex, high-dimensional simulator within a broader framework of source distribution estimation.  This is a significant departure from typical uses of the model, demonstrating its adaptability as a testing ground for advanced statistical methods.  **Instead of focusing on precise parameter fitting, the study aims to infer a distribution of parameters** that, when run through the model, reproduces observed electrophysiological data. The use of this model highlights the power of the proposed maximum-entropy approach, which excels when dealing with ill-posed inverse problems where many parameter sets can yield similar output. The authors leverage the model's complexity to evaluate their methodology's robustness, which is noteworthy given the high-dimensionality of the model's parameter space and the high volume of real-world data used for validation.  **The results obtained from the Hodgkin-Huxley model showcase the practical application of their source estimation technique**, a valuable contribution to the field of scientific inference, where uncertainty quantification is critical.

These parameters are then passed through a simulator, p(x|Œ∏), producing samples of simulated data,  q#(x). The Sliced-Wasserstein Distance (SWD) measures the discrepancy between the simulated data (q#(x)) and the observed data distribution, p‚ÇÄ(x).  The goal is to find the maximum entropy distribution q(Œ∏) that minimizes the SWD, balancing between maximizing entropy (uncertainty) and matching the observed data.

We show the mean and standard deviation over five runs for differentiable simulators and surrogates of Sourcerer on the benchmark tasks, and compare to NEB. All approaches achieve C2ST accuracies close to 50%. For the Sliced-Wasserstein-based approach, the entropies of the estimated sources are substantially higher (bold) with the entropy regularization (Œª = 0.35 for TM, IK, SLCP, Œª = 0.062 for GM, gray line in Fig. 3).

> üîº This table presents a quantitative comparison of Sourcerer's performance against Neural Empirical Bayes (NEB) across four benchmark tasks.  It shows the mean and standard deviation of C2ST accuracy (a measure of how well the simulations match the observations) and entropy (a measure of uncertainty) for both differentiable simulators and their learned surrogates, with and without entropy regularization.  The results highlight Sourcerer's ability to achieve high entropy without sacrificing simulation fidelity, especially when entropy regularization is used.
