In safe RL, constraints are often defined by the expectation of the discounted sum of costs [2, 25], where cost functions are defined to capture safety signals. These expectation-based constraints can leverage existing RL techniques since the value functions for costs follow the Bellman equation. However, they inadequately reduce the likelihood of significant costs, which can result in worst-case outcomes, because expectations do not capture information on the tail distribution. In real-world applications, avoiding such worst-case scenarios is particularly crucial, as they can lead to irrecoverable damage. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "In order to avoid worst-case scenarios, various safe RL methods [10, 26] attempt to define constraints using risk measures, such as conditional value at risk (CVaR) [20] and its generalized form, spectral risk measures [1].

[10] have introduced auxiliary variables to estimate CVaR. These approaches have effectively prevented worst-case outcomes by implementing risk constraints. However, the nonlinearity of risk measures makes it difficult to develop methods that ensure optimality. To the best of our knowledge, even for well-known risk measures such as CVaR, existing methods only guarantee local convergence [10, 32].

Spectral risk measures, including CVaR, have a dual form expressed as the expectation over a random variable [7]. Leveraging this duality, we propose a bilevel optimization framework designed to alleviate the challenges caused by the nonlinearity of risk measures. This framework consists of two levels: the outer problem, which involves optimizing a dual variable that originates from the dual form of spectral risk measures, and the inner problem, which aims to find an optimal policy for a given dual variable. For the inner problem, we define novel risk value functions that exhibit linearity in performance difference and propose a policy gradient method that ensures convergence to an optimal policy in tabular settings. The outer problem is potentially non-convex, so gradient-based optimization techniques are not suitable for global convergence. Instead, we propose a method to model and update a distribution over the dual variable, which also ensures finding an optimal dual variable in tabular settings. As a result, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first algorithm that guarantees convergence to an optimum for the RCRL problem.

There are two main approaches to handling constraints: the Lagrangian [26, 29, 32] and the primal [15, 30] approaches. The Lagrangian approach deals with dual problems by jointly updating dual variables and policies, which can be easily integrated into the existing RL framework. In contrast, the primal approach directly tackles the original problem by constructing a subproblem according to the current policy and solving it. Subsequently, risk estimation can be categorized into three types. The first type [29, 32] uses an auxiliary variable to precisely estimate CVaR through its dual form. Another one [26, 30] approximates risks as the expectation of the state-wise risks calculated using a distributional critic [8]. The third one [15] approximates CVaR by assuming that cost returns follow Gaussians. Despite these diverse methods, they only guarantee convergence to local optima. In the field of risk-sensitive RL, B\u00e4uerle and Glauner [7] have proposed an algorithm for spectral risk measures that ensures convergence to an optimum. They introduced a bilevel optimization approach, like our method, but did not provide a method for solving the outer problem. Furthermore, their approach to the inner problem is value-based, making it complicated to extend to RCRL, which typically requires a policy gradient approach.

The legged robot locomotion tasks aim to control bipedal and quadrupedal robots to maintain a specified target velocity, which consists of linear velocity in the $X$ and $Y$ directions and rotational velocity in the $Z$ direction, without falling. Each robot takes actions as PD target joint positions at a frequency of $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ , and a PD controller in each joint operates at ${500~\\mathrm{Hz}}$ . The dimension of the action space corresponds to the number of motors: ten for the bipedal robot and 12 for the quadrupedal robot. The state space includes the command, gravity vector, current joint positions and velocities, foot contact phase, and a history of the joint positions and velocities. The reward function is defined as the negative of the squared Euclidean distance between the current velocity and the target velocity. There are three cost functions to prevent robots from falling. The first cost is to balance the robot, which is formulated as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf{1}_{g[2]/||g||_{2}\\ge\\cos(\\pi/12)}.}\\end{array}$ , where $g$ is the gravity vector. This function is activated when the base frame of the robot is tilted more than 15 degrees. The second cost is to maintain the height of the robot above a predefined threshold, which is expressed as ${\\bf1}_{h\\leq b}$ , where $h$ is the height of the robot, and $b$ is set as 0.7 in the bipedal robot and 0.35 in the quadrupedal robot. The third cost is to match the foot contact state with the desired timing. It is defined as the average number of feet that do not touch the floor at the desired time. We set the thresholds for these cost functions as $0.025/(1-\\gamma),0.025/(1-\\gamma)$ , and $0.4/(1-\\gamma)$ , respectively, where $(1-\\gamma)$ converts the threshold value from an average time horizon scale to an infinite time horizon scale.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
