This is a challenging problem, especially when considering gradient variations. Existing methods often struggle with suboptimal regret bounds or lack efficiency. \nThis paper introduces a novel, simple, and efficient algorithm that achieves optimal gradient-variation regret for strongly convex, exp-concave, and convex functions.  It uses a two-layer ensemble structure with only one gradient query per round and O(log T) base learners. The key innovation lies in a novel analysis overcoming the difficulty of controlling algorithmic stability, using linearization and smoothness properties.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "yO5DVyCHZR/podcast.wav"}
