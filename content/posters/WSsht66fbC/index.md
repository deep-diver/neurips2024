### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many safety-critical reinforcement learning tasks struggle with designing appropriate cost functions to ensure safe agent behavior.  Manually defining these functions is often prohibitively expensive and complex.  Existing methods also suffer from scalability issues and rely on less intuitive state-level feedback.

This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning from Safety Feedback (RLSF), which addresses these challenges. RLSF infers cost functions from trajectory-level feedback, which is often easier to collect.  It also uses a novel sampling technique that efficiently targets novel trajectories. Experiments show RLSF achieves near-optimal performance, comparable to using a known cost function, and scales well across different benchmark environments.

### In-depth insights


#### Constrained RL via Feedback
Constrained reinforcement learning (RL) tackles the challenge of ensuring safe and effective agent behavior in safety-critical applications.  A common approach involves incorporating a cost function alongside the reward, penalizing unsafe actions.  However, designing appropriate cost functions can be extremely difficult and resource-intensive.  **Feedback-based methods offer a compelling alternative**, where the cost function is learned implicitly from feedback provided by a human evaluator or a surrogate system. This feedback can be given at various levels of granularity, from individual state-action pairs to entire trajectories.  **A key challenge lies in efficiently collecting and leveraging the feedback**, as obtaining feedback for each trajectory might not be feasible. Therefore, methods for intelligently selecting which trajectories to present for feedback are needed.  This often involves the use of uncertainty or novelty sampling techniques to maximize the information gain from limited human effort. Furthermore, developing robust and efficient algorithms for inferring the cost function from noisy or incomplete feedback is crucial, often requiring a transformation of the problem to make it easier to solve.  **Surrogate loss functions or other techniques** can aid in credit assignment and facilitate the learning process.  **Finally, the scalability and applicability of feedback-based constrained RL approaches** is a crucial consideration, particularly when dealing with complex and high-dimensional environments. The goal is to develop methods that are both effective in learning safe policies and efficient in terms of feedback requirements.

#### Novelty-Based Sampling
The proposed novelty-based sampling method offers a **significant improvement** over existing query strategies by selectively presenting novel trajectories to the evaluator.  Instead of relying on computationally expensive uncertainty estimation or arbitrary sampling schemes, it leverages the inherent intuition that errors are more likely to occur on unfamiliar data points.  By focusing feedback collection on such regions, **efficiency is maximized**, reducing the evaluator's burden and accelerating learning.  The method's effectiveness is empirically demonstrated by its near-optimal performance on benchmark environments, requiring far fewer queries than comparable techniques. **Novelty is defined** via state density; trajectories are considered novel if they traverse states rarely encountered during previous data collection rounds.  The inherent decreasing querying schedule further enhances efficiency, as the prevalence of novelty naturally diminishes as the agent's policy refines. This sampling mechanism is **robust and intuitive**, adapting seamlessly to diverse environments and providing a pragmatic solution to the feedback bottleneck in safety-critical reinforcement learning.

#### Surrogate Cost Learning
Surrogate cost learning tackles the challenge of directly inferring complex cost functions in constrained reinforcement learning (RL) by employing a simpler, **approximating surrogate**.  Instead of learning the true cost function, which is often expensive or intractable to specify explicitly, a more manageable surrogate model is trained, typically a supervised learning model. This model learns to predict cost from readily available data, such as trajectory-level feedback from human evaluators or system-generated labels.  This approach is particularly useful when acquiring state-level feedback is impractical due to the high cost or difficulty of the process. The key advantages of this approach are its scalability to complex environments and efficient handling of noisy, trajectory-level feedback.  **However, a key consideration is the potential bias introduced by the surrogate model.**  Careful design and evaluation are necessary to ensure the surrogate effectively captures the essential safety aspects of the true cost function, preventing significant deviations in agent behavior and maintaining appropriate safety guarantees. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the training data, making **data selection strategies crucial** for optimal performance.

#### Cost Function Transfer
The concept of "Cost Function Transfer" in reinforcement learning (RL) is intriguing.  It proposes leveraging a learned cost function from one task or environment to improve the performance of an RL agent in a related but different task. This is particularly appealing in safety-critical applications where obtaining labeled data for cost function learning can be expensive or even impossible. **The core idea is to transfer knowledge about unsafe states or behaviors, encoded in the learned cost function, rather than directly transferring the policy itself.** This approach can significantly reduce the need for extensive data collection in new scenarios. However, several critical factors need consideration. **The success of cost function transfer highly depends on the similarity between the source and target tasks.** If the tasks are too dissimilar, the transferred cost function might not accurately capture the safety-relevant aspects of the target task, leading to poor performance or even unsafe behavior. **Another key challenge is generalizability:** a cost function effectively learned in one environment might not generalize well to another, even if the tasks appear similar.  Furthermore, **robustness to noise and uncertainty in the source cost function** is crucial as errors can easily propagate into the target domain.  Investigating appropriate similarity measures between tasks and techniques for robust cost function transfer are essential for the practical success of this approach.  Addressing these challenges would open up exciting possibilities for efficient and safe RL in diverse applications.

#### Limitations and Future
The authors acknowledge several limitations.  **Feedback collection is expensive**, particularly in complex scenarios. The reliance on trajectory-level feedback, while reducing the evaluator's burden, **introduces an overestimation bias** in the inferred cost function that may lead to overly conservative policies. While a heuristic bias correction is proposed, it requires additional tuning.  Future work should address these issues, potentially by investigating more sophisticated feedback mechanisms and exploring techniques to reduce the overestimation bias.  **Transferring the inferred cost function to new agents or tasks** is a promising area for future exploration, and extending the approach to settings with noisy or inconsistent feedback is also important.  Further investigation into the scalability of the method to even larger, more complex environments should be conducted.

It shows training curves for return and cost violation rate for different buffer sizes (100k, 1M, and 4M) across the SafetyPointCircle and SafetyPointGoal environments.  The results indicate that smaller buffers (100k) lead to more conservative policies, while larger buffers (4M) achieve better performance.

The plot shows that the surrogate loss produces more stable gradients during training, allowing for smoother convergence and improved performance.
