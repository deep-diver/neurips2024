Several different graph generation methods are compared, including GraphRNN, SPECTRE, GDSS, MOOD, DiGress, DDPO, and the proposed GDPO method.  The table shows the performance of each method across four metrics: Deg (degree distribution), Clus (clustering coefficient distribution), Orb (orbit count distribution), and VUN (percentage of generated graphs that are valid, unique, and novel). Lower values for Deg, Clus, and Orb indicate better performance (i.e., closer agreement with the test dataset distribution). Higher VUN indicates better performance. The results demonstrate GDPO's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.", "section": "6.1 General Graph Generation"}, {"figure_path": "8ohsbxw7q8/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Molecule property optimization results on ZINC250k.", "description": "This table presents the results of molecule property optimization on the ZINC250k dataset.  Several methods, including GCPN, REINVENT, FREED, MOOD, DiGress, DiGress with guidance, DDPO, and GDPO (the proposed method), are compared based on two metrics: Hit Ratio and DS (top 5%).  The Hit Ratio indicates the proportion of unique generated molecules satisfying specific criteria (docking score, novelty, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility), while DS (top 5%) represents the average docking score of the top 5% of molecules based on these criteria. Results are shown for five different target proteins (parp1, fa7, 5ht1b, braf, and jak2).

Deg, Clus, and Orb measure the discrepancy between the generated graphs' degree, clustering coefficient, and orbit distributions compared to the test set. V.U.N measures the proportion of generated graphs that are valid, unique, and novel. Lower values for Deg, Clus, and Orb indicate better performance, while a higher value for V.U.N signifies better results.
