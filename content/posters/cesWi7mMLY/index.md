### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning models often misclassify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, especially in long-tailed recognition scenarios where some classes are under-represented.  Existing OOD detection methods struggle because training data often contains outlier samples that don't accurately represent true OOD data, leading to distribution shifts and reduced performance. This paper introduces AdaptOD, a novel method to address this challenge. 



AdaptOD uses a dual-normalized energy loss to obtain a more balanced energy distribution across all classes. This avoids bias towards over-represented classes and leads to better initial outlier distribution.  AdaptOD also employs dynamic outlier distribution adaptation (DODA), which dynamically adjusts the outlier distribution to better match the true OOD distribution during inference.  By effectively addressing the distribution shift problem, AdaptOD significantly outperforms existing OOD detection methods in long-tailed recognition scenarios, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

### In-depth insights


#### Long-Tailed OOD
The term "Long-Tailed OOD" encapsulates a crucial challenge in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection where the in-distribution (ID) data exhibits a long-tailed distribution.  This imbalance, with a few dominant classes and many under-represented ones, significantly impacts OOD detection performance.  **Standard OOD methods often struggle because they are biased towards the head classes**, leading to misclassification of tail classes as OOD.  **This necessitates techniques that address class imbalance while accurately identifying true OOD samples.**  Solutions may involve tailored loss functions that prioritize tail classes, data augmentation strategies to balance class representation, or novel methods to adapt the model's understanding of the outlier distribution to better align with true OOD data.  **Effective methods need to avoid over-reliance on easily-classified head classes, ensuring reliable performance across the entire range of ID classes and distinguishing them effectively from OOD.**

#### AdaptOD Method
The AdaptOD method is a novel approach for addressing the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in long-tailed recognition (LTR) scenarios.  Its core innovation lies in **dynamically adapting the outlier distribution** during inference, thereby mitigating the distribution shift between training outliers and true OOD samples. This is achieved through two main components: **Dynamic Outlier Distribution Adaptation (DODA)**, which leverages predicted OOD samples to refine the outlier distribution online; and **Dual-Normalized Energy Loss (DNE)**, which balances prediction energy across imbalanced ID samples for a more reliable initial outlier distribution.  This two-pronged approach offers several key advantages. Firstly, it **eliminates the need for manual tuning of sensitive margin hyperparameters** commonly found in energy-based losses. Secondly, **test-time adaptation reduces the reliance on perfectly matched outlier and true OOD distributions**, making the method more robust in real-world settings. Finally, it consistently achieves superior performance in various LTR scenarios compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.  The effectiveness of AdaptOD is demonstrated empirically across multiple benchmark datasets and configurations, highlighting its versatility and robustness.

#### DODA & DNE
The core of AdaptOD lies in its two key components: **Dynamic Outlier Distribution Adaptation (DODA)** and **Dual-Normalized Energy Loss (DNE)**.  DODA cleverly addresses the distribution shift problem often encountered in long-tailed recognition by dynamically adjusting the outlier distribution during inference. This adaptation leverages the information from predicted OOD samples, making it a test-time adaptation strategy.  In contrast, DNE tackles the imbalance in the ID data by introducing a novel loss function. This loss normalizes both class-wise and sample-wise energy, preventing bias towards head classes and thus improving the quality of the initial outlier distribution for DODA. In essence, **DNE provides a better starting point**, ensuring that DODA has a more accurate baseline to adapt from, thus leading to more reliable OOD detection.

#### LTR Benchmark
A robust LTR benchmark is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of long-tailed recognition methods.  It needs to **address class imbalance**, a core characteristic of LTR datasets, by incorporating a wide range of tail-to-head ratios. A good benchmark should also **include diverse datasets** representing various domains and data complexities, ensuring generalizability of model performance.  Furthermore, it's important to **carefully define evaluation metrics** that capture both overall accuracy and performance on tail classes, preventing bias towards head-class dominance. **Representative OOD (out-of-distribution) data** should be incorporated to assess the robustness of models against unseen data, which is particularly important in real-world scenarios. Finally, a well-structured benchmark facilitates comparisons across different methods, providing insights into strengths and weaknesses of various approaches for addressing the challenges of long-tailed recognition.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising directions.  **Extending AdaptOD to handle more complex scenarios** such as those involving significant class imbalance or noisy labels is crucial.  Investigating the impact of different outlier data sources and their characteristics on model performance would be valuable.  **Developing more efficient methods for adapting the outlier distribution** at inference time, potentially using techniques such as transfer learning or meta-learning, is necessary to improve speed and scalability.  Finally, a thorough theoretical analysis exploring the reasons behind AdaptOD's success and its limitations would strengthen its foundational understanding. This could involve investigating the relationship between energy-based losses, outlier distribution adaptation, and OOD detection performance in long-tailed scenarios.  **Incorporating uncertainty quantification** would also enhance AdaptOD's robustness and applicability in real-world settings.
