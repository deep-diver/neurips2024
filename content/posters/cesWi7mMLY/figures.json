Left: Each test sample is assigned a global energy-based OOD score G(x) to adapt the outlier distribution Pout. DODA then uses the adapted outlier distribution Pout to calibrate the global energy score G(x), obtaining the calibrated global energy score GP(x) as the OOD score. Right: For each iteration, DNE first applies Batch Energy Normalization on logit output to obtain the normalized energy, and then utilizes this energy to optimize a dual energy loss function at both the class and sample levels.", "description": "This figure illustrates the AdaptOD architecture, which is composed of two main components: DODA and DNE.  The left side shows the DODA module, which dynamically adapts an outlier distribution to better reflect true OOD samples during inference.  The right side details the DNE module, which utilizes a dual-normalized energy loss function to learn a balanced energy distribution for improved OOD detection, especially in imbalanced datasets. The diagram highlights how a test image is processed, its energy score is calculated, and how the system determines whether it is an in-distribution (ID) or out-of-distribution (OOD) sample.", "section": "3 Approach"}, {"figure_path": "cesWi7mMLY/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The average performance over six OOD datasets on CIFAR100-LT with an increasing percentage of true OOD samples fed to TTA methods.", "description": "This figure shows the average AUC performance of three different Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods (AUTO, AdaOOD, and AdaptOD) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on the CIFAR100-LT dataset.
