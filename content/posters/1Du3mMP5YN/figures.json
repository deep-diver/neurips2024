The results show the FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate) and AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) for four different OOD datasets (SUN, Places, Textures, iNaturalist) and the average performance across these datasets.  Multiple methods are compared: KNN+, PALM, CIDER, and the proposed DRL method.  The figure visually demonstrates the superior performance of the DRL method compared to the other methods, especially in terms of FPR95 (lower is better).", "section": "5.1 Main results on CIFAR benchmarks"}, {"figure_path": "1Du3mMP5YN/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Ablation Study on the proposed DRL: (a) distribution of feature embeddings learned with unnormalized (left) and l2-normalzied (right) class prototypes; (b) the benefits of the proposed sequential sampling rearrange to OOD detection performance.", "description": "This figure presents an ablation study to support the claims made in the paper. The first sub-figure (a) compares the distribution of feature embeddings using unnormalized versus l2-normalized class prototypes.  It shows that unnormalized prototypes lead to better OOD detection performance. The second sub-figure (b) demonstrates the impact of the proposed sequential sampling rearrangement strategy on OOD detection performance. It highlights a significant performance drop when this strategy is not used, indicating its importance for consistent optimization.", "section": "5.3 Ablation study"}, {"figure_path": "1Du3mMP5YN/figures/figures_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Left: The actual value of our proposed approximation of log \u00cep(\u03b5); Right: The approximation error \u03b4(\u03b5) in computing Ip(\u00b7) between our proposed and the scipy implementation.", "description": "This figure shows the accuracy of the approximation used in the paper for the modified Bessel function of the first kind.  The left panel plots the actual value of the approximation (log \u00cep(\u03b5)) against the concentration parameter (\u03b5) for different values of p (the order of the Bessel function). The right panel shows the difference (\u03b4(\u03b5)) between the approximation and the exact value obtained using the scipy library, illustrating the approximation error.  The graphs demonstrate that the approximation becomes more accurate as p increases.", "section": "Ablation study"}]
