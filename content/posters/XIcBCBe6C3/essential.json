Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a potential solution, but existing methods struggle with the memory demands of backpropagation and the lack of normalization layer support on MCUs. This leads to either memory exhaustion or poor performance.\nTinyTTA addresses these limitations by introducing a novel self-ensemble early-exit strategy and a weight standardization technique. This method reduces memory usage significantly, enabling continuous adaptation with small batches.  The researchers also developed a dedicated MCU library, TinyTTA Engine, to facilitate on-device TTA implementation. Their experiments demonstrate that TinyTTA significantly improves TTA accuracy and efficiency on various devices, including resource-constrained MCUs.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XIcBCBe6C3/podcast.wav"}
