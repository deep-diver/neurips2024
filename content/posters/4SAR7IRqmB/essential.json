Traditional methods often require massive datasets, especially when teaching a group of learners with varying characteristics. This paper focuses on a specific type of learner called \"Behavior Cloning\" that learns by mimicking examples, and specifically explores linear BC learners. The challenge lies in finding the smallest possible dataset to teach a target policy to an entire class of these learners. \nThis research proposes a new algorithm called 'TIE' to solve this problem. TIE cleverly leverages the structure of the problem to construct a minimal teaching set.  The paper shows that this problem is computationally hard for complex scenarios, but TIE provides a good approximation with theoretical guarantees.  The effectiveness of TIE was demonstrated through experiments in several diverse environments.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4SAR7IRqmB/podcast.wav"}
