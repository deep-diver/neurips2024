Towards a unified generative model for varying-length time series, we propose in this work to transform sequences into images. By employing invertible transforms such as the delay embedding and the short-time Fourier transform, we unlock three main advantages: i) We can exploit advanced diffusion vision models; ii) We can remarkably process short- and long-range inputs within the same framework; and iii) We can harness recent and established tools proposed in the time series to image literature.

In this work, we focus on the setting of generative modeling (GM) of general time series information. There are several factors that govern the complexity required from sequential data generators including the sequence length, its number of features, the appearance of transient vs. long-range effects, and more. Existing generative models for time series are typically designed either for multivariate short-term sequences [44, 19] or univariate long-range data [103], often resulting in separate and completely different neural network frameworks. However, a natural question arises: Can one develop a unified framework equipped to handle both high-dimensional short sequences and low-dimensional long time series?

Particularly, RNNs suffer from the well-known vanishing and exploding gradient problem [9, 70] that prevents them from learning complex patterns and long-range dependencies. To address long-context modeling and memory retention, extensive research is devoted to approaches such as long short-term memory (LSTM) models [42], unitary evolution RNNs [5] and Lipschitz RNNs [24]. A different approach for processing sequential information is based on the Transformer [93], eliminating any recurrent connections. Recent remarkable results have been obtained with transformers on natural language processing [13] and time series forecasting [96, 104, 68] tasks. Alas, transformers are underexplored as generative models for long-range time series data. This may be in part due to their computational costs that scale quadratically as $\\bar{\\mathcal{O}}(L^{2})$ with the sequence length $L$ , and in part because transformer forecasters are inferior to linear tools [101].

Further, the deep linear recurrent unit (LRU) is inspired by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, and it demonstrated impressive performance in modeling long-range dependencies (LRD). Still, generative modeling of long-range sequential data via state space models remains largely underexplored. Recent work suggested LS4 [103], a latent time series generative model that builds upon linear state space equations. LS4 utilizes autoregressive dependencies to expressively model time series (potentially non-stationary) distributions. However, this model struggles with short-length sequences as we show in our study, potentially due to limited expressivity of linear SSMs. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To overcome gradient issues of recurrent backbones, temporal computational costs of transformers, and expressivity problems of SSMs, we represent time series information via small-sized images.

Moreover, a similar approach was employed to generative modeling of time series with generative adversarial networks (GANs) [12, 39]. However, unstable training dynamics and mode collapse negatively affect the performance of GAN-based tools [59]. In contrast, transforming time series to images is underexplored in the context of generative diffusion models. There are several fundamental advantages to our approach. First, there have been remarkable advancements in diffusion models for vision data that we can exploit [81, 40, 86, 45]. Second, using images instead of sequences elegantly avoids the challenges of long-term modeling. For instance, a moderately-sized $256\\times256$ image corresponds to a time series of length up to $65k$ , as we show in Sec. 3.

In speech analysis and processing, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) stands out as a widely used method [1, 2, 94, 26]. It tracks the changes in frequency components over time, making it essential for analyzing and understanding audio and speech data. Recent research [71, 17] has explored mel-spectrogram transforms within diffusion models, including integration with advanced latent diffusion spaces [58].

Marginal scores measure the absolute difference between the empirical probability density functions of two distributions. Classification scores use a sequence model to classify samples as real or generated; high scores indicate less distinguishable samples. Prediction scores utilize a train-on-synthetic-test-on-real sequence-to-sequence model to predict future steps; lower scores indicate higher predictability.

We focus on the imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) tasks, following the experimental setup in [75, 78]. Our approach can be adapted to solve these tasks via a simple modification. For instance, in the interpolation task, the goal is to generate the missing values. Thus, we apply our diffusion model only in the missing locations using a corresponding mask. The rest of the values are left unchanged. A similar mechanism can be applied to extrapolation. Generally, this approach is similar to image inpainting techniques [60]. In the interpolation task, we randomly mask $50\\%$ of the sequence values, whereas in the extrapolation challenge, we split the sequence in half, where the second half represents the target values. In this benchmark, we consider short, long, and ultra-long sequences.

The lack of a unified framework for varying lengths time series can be justified by the shortcomings of current available tools: gradient issues of recurrent networks, temporal computational costs of transformers, and limited expressiveness of state space models. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel generative model for time series based on signal-to-image invertible transforms and a vision diffusion backbone. The benefti of our approach is threefold: we exploit advanced diffusion models for vision, we seamlessly process short-to-ultra-long sequences, and we can utilize tools from the signal-toimage literature. We extensively evaluate our framework in the unconditional and conditional settings using short, long, and ultra-long sequences, considering multiple datasets, and in comparison to state-of-the-art models. Our experiments show the superiority of our framework, setting new SOTA results. Further, we demonstrate the robustness of our method through several ablation studies. Our approach requires slightly higher computational resources, which we leave for further consideration and future work.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
