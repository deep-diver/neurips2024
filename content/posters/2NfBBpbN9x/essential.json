This dichotomy is mainly due to gradient issues in recurrent networks, computational costs in transformers, and limited expressiveness in state space models.  The limitations of these existing methods hinder their ability to generate high-quality samples for time series data of various lengths.  A unified framework is needed to address this challenge and produce high-quality time series of varying lengths effectively. \nImagenTime tackles this problem by transforming time series data into images via invertible transforms (delay embedding and short-time Fourier transform). This image representation allows leveraging the power of advanced diffusion models designed for image data. The method demonstrates superior performance on various tasks, including unconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation, across multiple datasets with varying sequence lengths.  **This approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art results**, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in generative modeling of time series data.", "affiliation": "Ben-Gurion University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2NfBBpbN9x/podcast.wav"}
