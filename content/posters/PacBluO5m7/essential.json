This paper introduces KnowGPT, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to extract the most relevant information from a KG and a multi-armed bandit approach to construct optimal prompts for the LLM.  \nKnowGPT addresses the limitations of previous approaches by efficiently retrieving the most pertinent facts from the KG and automatically constructing effective prompts for the LLM. Experimental results show that KnowGPT outperforms current state-of-the-art KG-enhanced LLMs, achieving remarkable accuracy on several benchmark datasets, particularly exceeding human-level performance on one. This demonstrates the effectiveness of KnowGPT's approach in significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "PacBluO5m7/podcast.wav"}
