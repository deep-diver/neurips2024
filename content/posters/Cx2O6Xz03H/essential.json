Existing methods often concatenate various features (point flow, visibility, content), leading to cluttered models and reduced learning efficiency. TAPTR improved this by modeling each tracking point as a point query, simplifying the pipeline but still relying on cost volume, which can contaminate point query content. \nTAPTRv2 solves this by proposing an attention-based position update (APU).  Instead of using cost-volume, APU uses key-aware deformable attention to combine sampling positions, thereby predicting query position.  This not only eliminates extra cost-volume computation but also results in substantial performance improvements. APU effectively mitigates the domain gap, leading to better generalization across various datasets.  The experiments demonstrate TAPTRv2's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on multiple challenging datasets.", "affiliation": "South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "Cx2O6Xz03H/podcast.wav"}
