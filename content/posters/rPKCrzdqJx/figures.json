At time t \u2208 [T], (1.) the learner observes a point wt, (2.) the learner takes a guess gt, and (3.) the learner observes the true label yt. Given a regret minimizer for our setting, we show how to use it in a black-box way (by constructing functions h1, h2, h3) to achieve no-regret in the online linear thresholding problem.", "description": "This figure summarizes the reduction from the online linear thresholding problem to the contextual Stackelberg game setting.  It illustrates how a regret minimizer for the Stackelberg game with side information can be used as a black box to achieve no regret in the online linear thresholding problem.  The reduction involves three functions, h1, h2, and h3, that map between the inputs and outputs of the two problems.", "section": "3 On the impossibility of fully adversarial no-regret learning"}, {"figure_path": "rPKCrzdqJx/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Cumulative average reward of Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, and the algorithm of Balcan et al. [5] (which does not take side information into consideration) over five runs in a synthetic data setup. Shaded regions represent one standard deviation.", "description": "The figure shows the cumulative average reward of three algorithms over 50 time steps in three different settings.  Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 are the algorithms proposed in this paper that leverage side information, while the algorithm of Balcan et al. [5] serves as a baseline that does not use side information. The three settings vary the stochasticity of contexts and follower types: (a) non-stochastic contexts, stochastic followers; (b) stochastic contexts, non-stochastic followers; (c) stochastic contexts, stochastic followers. The shaded regions represent one standard deviation of the cumulative reward across the five runs, illustrating the variability of the algorithms' performance.", "section": "Simulations"}]
