### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Matroid optimization is a fundamental problem with applications in various fields, but querying complex models for precise information can be time-consuming. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a two-oracle model.  This model uses a fast, imprecise oracle to quickly obtain initial information, reducing reliance on a more accurate but slower clean oracle. The challenge is to design algorithms that efficiently leverage the imprecise oracle while still guaranteeing solution quality.

The paper presents novel algorithms for maximum-weight basis computation within the two-oracle model.  These algorithms are designed to minimize calls to the slow clean oracle, while still maintaining solution quality even if the imprecise oracle is inaccurate. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithms are near-optimal, and their performance smoothly degrades with the quality of the imprecise oracle.  **The paper expands on the framework of learning-augmented algorithms and offers extensions to other matroid oracle types, non-free dirty oracles, and various matroid problems.**

> This figure shows a matroid with 8 elements (e1 to e8) and an additional element e9,  ordered from left to right by decreasing weight.  The goal is to find a maximum-weight basis. The circles represent the elements, and those filled in represent the elements that form the maximum-weight basis of a dirty oracle (Ma). The figure illustrates that simply removing or adding elements from the dirty basis to obtain a clean basis may be insufficient for achieving a maximum-weight basis in the clean matroid (M). The difference between the clean and dirty bases highlights the challenges involved in efficiently finding a maximum-weight basis when using both a clean and dirty oracle.

> This algorithm takes a feasible solution X and two lists of false dirty queries F1 and F2 as inputs. It computes an augmenting path P in the exchange graph using the dirty oracles. If such a path does not exist, the algorithm returns X as optimal. If P is a valid augmenting path for both clean matroids, the solution is updated. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to identify an edge that violates the condition and adds the corresponding set to the lists of false queries to repeat the process. The algorithm is designed for partition matroids and ensures the feasibility of solutions by verifying augmenting paths using clean oracle calls.
