The goal is to find a maximum-weight basis. The circles represent the elements, and those filled in represent the elements that form the maximum-weight basis of a dirty oracle (Ma). The figure illustrates that simply removing or adding elements from the dirty basis to obtain a clean basis may be insufficient for achieving a maximum-weight basis in the clean matroid (M). The difference between the clean and dirty bases highlights the challenges involved in efficiently finding a maximum-weight basis when using both a clean and dirty oracle.", "section": "3 Computing a maximum-weight basis"}, {"figure_path": "0qb8KoPsej/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: A matroid with elements e\u2081,..., eg (displayed as circles) ordered left-to-right by non-increasing weight.
