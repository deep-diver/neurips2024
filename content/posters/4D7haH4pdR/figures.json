[{"figure_path": "4D7haH4pdR/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The three qualitatively different cases for detecting the level of bias, each illustrated within a simplex over three states where \u03bco is the prior belief. Each point in the simplex corresponds to an optimal action for the agent. Green curves indicate indifference between the default action a0 and another action under an unbiased belief. Orange curves are translated versions of these indifference curves; a posterior on these curves means the agent's biased belief (at bias level \u03c4) aligns with the green curves. From (a) to (c), \u03c4 increases, translating the orange curves further. In Figure 1a, \u03bco can be represented as a convex combination of points on the translated curves, allowing bias level detection with a single sample. In Figure 1b, only some signals are useful, requiring more than one sample in the worst case. In Figure 1c, the bias level cannot be tested against \u03c4.", "description": "This figure illustrates three scenarios for bias detection using a simplex representation of beliefs.  The scenarios differ based on the value of \u03c4 (bias threshold) and the prior belief (\u03bc0).  In (a), a single sample suffices for bias detection. In (b), multiple samples are needed. In (c), bias detection is impossible.", "section": "5 Geometric Characterization of the Testability of Bias"}]
