For that, we omitted, separately, the reward function $r_{\\varphi}$ and the $Q_{\\phi}$ function from Eq. 11, and plotted the success rate (with three different seeds) in Fig. 4a for the most challenging maze environment, PointSpiralMaze. The results indicate that the agent performs worse without the AIM reward function $r_{\\varphi}$ and fails to achieve the task without the $Q_{\\phi}$ function. The generated curriculum goals without the $r_{\\varphi}$ or $Q_{\\phi}$ function are shown in Fig. 4b and 4c, respectively. Fig. 4d, instead, illustrates the AIM reward value across different training episodes in a clockwise direction. Specifically, the first row and first column in Fig. 4d represent the reward values at the very beginning of training. As training progresses, the reward values shift towards the left corner of the maze environment (1st row, 2nd column). In the middle of training, the reward values are concentrated around the left corner of the maze environment (2nd row, 2nd column), and, by the end of training, the reward values converge to the desired goal area (2nd row, 1st column). This progression explains why the generated curriculum goals are not guiding the agent effectively but are instead distributed in the corner points shown in Fig. 4c. We have also demonstrated the behavior of the AIM reward function across different training episodes in our Supp. Mat. D for the PointUMaze environment. Additionally, we examined the impact of SAC with a fixed initial state $[0,0]$ and SAC with a random initial state. To do that, we removed the curriculum goal generation mechanism and assigned the desired goal, and then trained the agent using either SAC with a fixed initial state $[0,0]$ or SAC with a random initial state. For the random initial state, we sampled goals randomly in the environment. To avoid starting the agent inside the maze walls, we performed an infeasibility check, resampling the initial state until it was feasible.

The diffusion model is trained to minimize its loss function while simultaneously maximizing the expected value of $Q$ and the AIM reward function. The minimization of the diffusion loss helps capture the visited state distribution, while the maximization of $Q$ and AIM reward function helps generate goals at an appropriate difficulty level and at the same time guide the generated curriculum goals closer to the desired goal. Furthermore, the generated goals promote exploration due to the inherent noising and denoising mechanism of the diffusion model. Our proposed approach has two main limitations. First, while diffusion models excel at handling highdimensional data, such as images [53], incorporating the AIM reward into a combined loss function can hinder the curriculum goal generation in such settings as the AIM reward may underperform in higher dimensionalities. Secondly, we employ the Minimum Cost Maximum Flow algorithm to select the optimal curriculum goals from the set generated by the diffusion model. However, alternative selection strategies could potentially be more effective. Future work will aim to address these limitations and extend our approach to more complex environments.

We converted the HGG code from TensorFlow to PyTorch to integrate it with our diffusion model, which is based on PyTorch. We selected two robot manipulation tasks, FetchPush and FetchPickAndPlace, and increased the environment difficulty by expanding the desired goal area. This is shown in Fig. 16c and 16d, where the yellow area indicates the object sampling region and the blue area indicates the desired goal sampling region. The action space is four-dimensional, where three dimensions represent the Cartesian displacement of the end effector, and the last dimension controls the opening and closing of the gripper. The state space is 25-dimensional, including the end-effector position, position, and rotation of the object, the linear and angular velocity of the object, and the left and right gripper velocity. More detailed information regarding the action space and observation space of these robotic tasks can be found in the Gymnasium library documentation. For these additional experiments, we compared our method with HGG and HER using the DDPG algorithm, to ensure alignment with the baselines, using five different seeds. The results are shown in Fig. 16a and Fig. 16b, respectively for FetchPush and FetchPickAndPlace. Note that in this setting, all RL algorithms (including ours) use a binary reward (i.e., a sparse reward). However, since our curriculum goal generation algorithm is based on the AIM reward, we implemented the AIM reward function solely to generate curriculum goals while still using the sparse reward setting to train the DDPG algorithm using the diffusion model to generate curriculum goals.
