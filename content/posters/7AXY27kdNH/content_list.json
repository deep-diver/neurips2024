Causal induction (a.k.a. causal structure learning), the problem of finding causal relationships present in data, also falls under this paradigm when experiments in the form of interventions are permissible [52, 28]. Causal structure learning has gained increasing importance in empirical sciences, for example in single-cell biology, where perturbation experiments like gene knockouts can be carried out with high-precision [54]. Such interventions are not only more informative to infer the underlying causal graph than just observational data, but in certain cases essential to go beyond the Markov equivalence class [43], making the problem of design of interventions both relevant and important. For the problem of structure learning with interventions, however, inference and design both involve significant challenges. For instance, inference of the causal graph from data usually involves search over the space of graphs with a likelihood (usually weighted by a prior) or score function [4, 9, 27], which is slow and not robust to violations of data generation assumptions [41]. The design of informative interventions, on the other hand, utilizes the inferred causal graph from existing data to select promising designs and rank them according to a scoring criterion. This scoring criterion is usually based on an approximation of mutual information between the unknown causal graph and the interventional data [56, 55], which also involves the (interventional) data likelihood. In problems related to empirical sciences where causal structure learning is essential, like inferring a gene regulatory network with gene knockouts or knockdowns, the likelihood of the data is typically intractable. While progress has been made in terms of likelihood-free inference of causal graphs [38, 32], existing intervention design algorithms have been largely restricted to likelihood-based strategies.

This ensures that the history representation is permutation equivariant over both the axes [36].
