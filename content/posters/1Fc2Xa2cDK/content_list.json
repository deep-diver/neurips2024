Indeed, several authors trained classifiers to detect LLM lies based on their internal model activations. However, other researchers showed that these classifiers may fail to generalise, for example to negated statements. In this work, we aim to develop a robust method to detect when an LLM is lying. To this end, we make the following key contributions: (i) We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activation vectors of true and false statements can be separated. Notably, this finding is universal and holds for various LLMs, including Gemma-7B, LLaMA2- 13B, Mistral-7B and LLaMA3-8B.

This behaviour appears even in models trained to be honest. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Scheurer et al.

A method by Pacchiardi et al. [2023] relies purely on the outputs of the LLM, treating it as a black box. Other approaches leverage access to the internal activations of the LLM. Several researchers have trained classifiers on the internal activations to detect whether a given statement is true or false, using both supervised [Dombrowski and Corlouer, 2024, Azaria and Mitchell, 2023] and unsupervised techniques [Burns et al., 2023, Zou et al., 2023]. The supervised approach by Azaria and Mitchell [2023] involved training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the internal activations. To generate training data, they constructed datasets containing true and false statements about various topics and fed the LLM one statement at a time. While the LLM processed a given statement, they extracted the activation vector $\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at some internal layer with $d$ neurons. These activation vectors, along with the true/false labels, were then used to train the MLP. The resulting classifier achieved high accuracy in determining whether a given statement is true or false. This suggested that LLMs internally represent the truthfulness of statements. In fact, this internal representation might even be linear, as evidenced by the work of Burns et al. [2023], Zou et al. [2023], and Li et al. [2024], who constructed linear classifiers on these internal activations. This suggests the existence of a \"truth direction\", a direction within the activation space $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ of some layer, along which true and false statements separate. The possibility of a \"truth direction\" received further support in recent work on Superposition [Elhage et al., 2022] and Sparse Autoencoders [Bricken et al., 2023, Cunningham et al., 2023]. These works suggest that it is a general phenomenon in neural networks to encode concepts as linear combinations of neurons, i.e. as directions in activation space.

Affirmative statements stand in contrast to negated statements which contain a negation like the word \"not\". We define the polarity of a statement as the grammatical category indicating whether it is affirmative or negated. Levinstein and Herrmann [2024] demonstrated that the classifier of Azaria and Mitchell [2023] fails to generalise in a basic way, namely from affirmative to negated statements.

Expanding the scope to include both affirmative and negated statements reveals a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activations of true and false statements can be linearly separated.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
