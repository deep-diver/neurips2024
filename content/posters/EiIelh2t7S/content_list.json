The Transformer [4], based on the attention mechanism, has been the most popular backbone of LLMs due to its good performance and scaling properties [5]. One of the key component modules in the Transformer is position embedding, which is introduced to embed positional information that is vital for processing sequential data.

Based on the OOD theory, a recent study [15] finds that a smaller base can mitigate OOD and is beneficial for the model\u2019s ability to process long contexts, which inspires us to further study the relationship between the base of RoPE and the length of context the model can process.

Since its introduction, Transformer [4] has achieved remarkable results in the field of natural language processing. To make full use of the order of sequence, researchers have introduced position embedding. The earliest position embedding was based on sinusoidal functions [4] for absolute positions, learnable absolute position embedding [28] and many variants [29, 30] were proposed. Nevertheless, absolute position embedding has difficulties in extending directly to texts longer than the training length. Subsequently, researchers proposed relative position embedding methods [31, 32]. With the development of large language models, rotary position embedding and its variants [6, 23] has become widely used, such as Llama2 [7], Baichuan2 [8], Mistral-7B-[33].

Due to the squared complexity of the transformer model over time, a significant portion of the work focuses on improving the model structure [35, 35, 36, 37]. However, most of the work is still based on the transformer architecture. The other part of the work is aimed at reducing the computational complexity of attention itself, such as sparse attention [38] and group query attention [39]. In addition, there are also some optimizations in engineering efficiency, such as flash attention [40] and ring attention [41]. In the model inference stage, to save time and space, there are also some methods for accelerating long context, such as KV cache compression [42], etc. And the position embedding is important in extrapolation. In the process of fine-tuning, methods such as PI [12], NTK, and YARN [11] are used to change the original position embedding information.

Our experimental results validate that the base of RoPE bounds context length for not only fine-tuning but also the pre-training stage.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
