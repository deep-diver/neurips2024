Performance is evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID).  Higher PSNR and lower LPIPS indicate better image reconstruction quality, while lower FID suggests the generated samples from the learned diffusion model are closer to the true data distribution.
