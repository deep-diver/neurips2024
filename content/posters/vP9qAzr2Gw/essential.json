Existing methods often suffer from limitations such as oversquashing and under-reaching, especially when using fully-connected Graph Transformers (GT). These methods often fail to capture essential spatio-temporal information in the graph's structure and dynamics. This paper introduces SLATE, a novel approach that addresses these limitations. \nSLATE leverages the spectral properties of a supra-Laplacian matrix to represent the dynamic graph as a multi-layer structure. This unique representation allows for a unified spatio-temporal encoding that captures both spatial and temporal information effectively. Furthermore, SLATE incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to model pairwise relationships between nodes, providing an accurate representation of dynamic edges.  The experimental results show that SLATE significantly outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and scalability.", "affiliation": "Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "vP9qAzr2Gw/podcast.wav"}
