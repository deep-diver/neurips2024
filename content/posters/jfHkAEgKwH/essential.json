Contrastive pretraining methods offer a scalable alternative, but often overlook region-specific details within images.  Image captioning is an effective approach to visual pretraining, but existing methods often focus on holistic image understanding. \nLocCa addresses these issues by incorporating location-aware tasks into image captioning.  It uses a multi-task encoder-decoder architecture to predict bounding boxes and generate location-dependent captions. Experiments show LocCa significantly outperforms standard captioners on downstream localization tasks like referring expression comprehension, while maintaining comparable performance on holistic tasks. This work highlights the potential of location-aware natural language interfaces for more efficient and effective visual pretraining.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "jfHkAEgKwH/podcast.wav"}
