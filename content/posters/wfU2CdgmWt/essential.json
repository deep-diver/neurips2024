Existing methods, often based on iterative diffusion optimization (IDO), suffer from high error rates due to the non-convexity of the loss landscape and the difficulty of computing gradients through complex stochastic processes.  These limitations hinder accurate control of noisy dynamical systems across various applications.\nThis paper introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel IDO algorithm. **SOCM addresses the challenges** by learning the control function via a least squares problem, aiming to fit a matching vector field.  **A key innovation is the path-wise reparameterization trick**, efficiently estimating gradients without relying on computationally expensive adjoint methods.  **Experimental results demonstrate SOCM's superiority** over existing IDO techniques, achieving substantially lower errors in several control problems.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "wfU2CdgmWt/podcast.wav"}
