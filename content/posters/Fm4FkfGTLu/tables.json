The metrics reported are averaged over 100 test samples, with standard deviations shown across three consistent random seeds.  The table shows the impact of various hyperparameters on the model's performance (native sequence recovery, various self-consistency scores, and perplexity) and compares gRNAde to baseline methods (ground truth sequence prediction, random sequence prediction, and ViennaRNA 2D-only prediction).  The \"designability\" thresholds are also indicated for the 3D self-consistency scores.", "section": "D Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "Fm4FkfGTLu/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Full results for Figure 2 comparing gRNAde to Rosetta, FARNA and ViennaRNA for single-state design on 14 RNA structures of interest identified by Das et al.
