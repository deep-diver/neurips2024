It shows the acquisition time (time to compute the next design) and total time (time to complete 10 rounds of design) for various methods including GP-RS, GP-US, GP-DUS, T-EIG, D-EIG, and TNDP (the authors' method). The results highlight that TNDP, being fully amortized, requires significantly less time than other methods which depend on iterative optimization and/or GP updates.  The values reported are means and standard deviations across 10 independent runs.", "section": "D Computational cost analysis"}, {"figure_path": "zBG7WogAvm/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table A1: Comparison of computational costs across different methods.

The results highlight the significantly faster inference times of the proposed Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP) method due to its full amortization, unlike other methods that require extensive computation for each step.", "section": "D Computational cost analysis"}]
