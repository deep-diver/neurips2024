However, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions between subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and scalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from scratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an LLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency concepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to the ground truth. In contrast to standard syntax-based metrics, our metrics use deep learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs. Both our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM outperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate ontologies while maintaining structural integrity.

In this paper, we focus on the core building blocks of an ontology: concepts and taxonomic relations which represent is-a or is-subclass-of relationships between concepts. In some cases, the is-part-of relation is also considered a taxonomic relation. We treat such an ontology as a rooted labelled directed graph where nodes represent concepts, edges represent taxonomic relations and the root node is the special concept of all concepts. A strict ontology asserts that the taxonomic relation is asymmetric and thus the graph must be acyclic, though in practice some ontologies, such as the Wikipedia ontology studied in this paper, may contain cycles. We therefore do not assume that an ontology graph is necessarily acyclic.

For example, the pattern \u201c[noun phrase] such as [noun phrase]\u201d matches phrases like \u201cdogs such as chihuahuas\u201d, and thus can be processed by regular expressions to identify the relation $^{\\bullet\\bullet}\\mathrm{dog}\\rightarrow$ chihuahua\u201d.

The crux of the problem is that low-level relations are substantially more diverse than high-level ones: since we present both types of relations at the same rate to the model, it tends to overfit on high-level relations while underfitting on low-level ones. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a new training objective that randomly masks the loss contribution of frequently occurring relations. Suppose a relation $u\\rightarrow v$ is present $n$ times in the training set. During training, when $u\\rightarrow v$ appears in one of the relevant paths, we mask the loss contribution of the tokens for $v$ with probability $\\operatorname*{max}(1-M/n,0)$ , where $M$ is a constant for the average number of times a relation is present in the training set. Intuitively, this regulariser ensures that frequent relations are only seen $\\approx M$ times as targets throughout training, hence reducing overftiting as shown in Figure 4 (bottom).

Computationally, OLLM required 12 A100-hours for training and 7 A100-hours for inference to generate an ontology for Wikipedia. This is a modest cost in current standards, which demonstrates the scalability of OLLM for real-world problems. In terms of performance, OLLM produces the most semantically accurate ontology in comparison to our baselines as presented in Table 1. Across all of Fuzzy F1, Continuous F1 and Graph F1, we observe the trend that OLLM scores the best, followed by Finetune and Prompting, and lastly Hearst and REBEL. This is surprising, as it suggests that the combination of LLMs with our subgraph modelling framework is a sufficiently strong inductive bias for LLMs to outperform traditional methods even without finetuning. However, prompting alone is not sufficient to build high-quality ontologies. On the Motif Distance metric, prompting methods score poorly at 0.314\u20130.354 in comparison to 0.050 and 0.080 for Finetune and OLLM respectively. This shows that using LLMs out-of-the-box for subgraph modelling results in poor structural integrity, though this issue is solved by finetuning. Qualitatively, we observe that OLLM can adhere to the clear, explicit naming style of Wikipedia, even on unseen topics in the test set. For example, it generates \u201cMathematical categories\u201d and \u201cGroups (mathematics)\u201d under the parent concept \u201cMathematical structures\u201d to distinguish from the natural language sense of categories and groups (Figure 11c). Such style is not learned by the prompting baselines: Three-shot generated \u201cElections $\\rightarrow$ France\u201d, while it most likely meant \u201cElections $\\rightarrow$ Elections in France\u201d (Figure 18c). More sample outputs are shown in Appendix A.4.1. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "The arXiv task differs from the Wikipedia task as it has much fewer relations, and there is even less overlap between the train and test split. This imposes a great challenge on Finetune and OLLM as they need to generalise with a limited diversity of training samples. Despite such constraints, OLLM is substantially better than other methods in modelling the semantics of the test graph. On the Fuzzy F1, Continuous F1, and Graph F1 metrics, OLLM performs the best among all methods with 0.570, 0.357, and 0.633, significantly higher than the next-best of 0.460, 0.290 and 0.546 respectively. Inspecting the generated ontologies (Appendix A.4.2), we observe that prompting baselines tend to produce repetitive concepts such as \u201cMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\u201d and \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\u201d (Figure 27), while Hearst and REBEL put almost all concepts under the same parent concept(s) (Figures 23 and 24). We also found that OLLM\u2019s output for arXiv contains concepts from Wikipedia, but restructured in a way that ftis the arXiv ontology. For example, \u201cLife sciences\u201d and \u201cBiological evolution\u201d appear in the Wikipedia training set under the same parent category \u201cLife\u201d with no direct links between them. On the generated graph for arXiv, \u201cLife sciences\u201d is instead promoted to one of the top-level concepts with \u201cBiological Evolution\u201d as one of its children, which better fits the \u201cfields of science\u201d style of the arXiv ontology (Figure 20). This demonstrates that OLLM can adapt to produce a new type of ontology by restructuring its learned concepts, all using just a small number of training samples. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "In summary, OLLM scores the best or is competitive across all metrics in both tasks, with the notable exception of the Literal F1 metric. We attribute this to the fact that Literal F1 is sensitive to factors like casing and choice of words, and generally only measures syntactic similarity. For example, we see that a suboptimal baseline like Memorisation scores the best on this metric with 0.134 on the Wikipedia task.

On the Wikipedia task, Memorisation, despite being clearly the worst in Continuous F1 and Graph F1, performs the best on Literal F1 and the second-best on Motif Distance. This can be attributed to the fact that Literal F1 is sensitive to semantically insignificant syntactic differences such as casing and word form, and thus when the training and test set has non-trivial overlap (Figure 3), it is biased towards methods that overfit. Similarly, as per the method described in Section 4.1, the data splits are constructed with structural symmetry, hence we expect the train and test splits to have a similar graph structure even though the represented concepts are different. As a result, methods that tend to overfit, for example, Memorisation and Finetune, achieve the best scores on Motif Distance. This demonstrates that Literal F1 and Motif Distance only capture syntactic and structural similarity respectively, and thus should not be used as stand-alone metrics for evaluation.

In Figures 9 and 10, we visualise the ontology generated by OLLM and the ground truth and observe that semantically similar components in the two graphs indeed get matched. For example, the \u201cPhysics\u201d and \u201cMathematics\u201d clusters in the generated graph get matched with the \u201cMathematics\u201d cluster in the ground truth, \u201cData Analysis\u201d and \u201cInformation\u201d get matched with \u201cStatistics\u201d, \u201cEconomics\u201d with \u201cQuantitative Finance\u201d, and \u201cLife Sciences\u201d with \u201cQuantitative Biology\u201d. This suggests that our edge/node matching procedure is capturing a \u201csemantic graph isomorphism\u201d that allows one to compare similar components in the two graphs, even if they do not exactly share the same concepts.

A potential approach to extend OLLM to produce non-taxonomic relations is to add tags indicating the relation type to each edge when linearising the subgraphs for sequence modelling. New evaluation metrics might also be required to handle multiple types of relations. Another limitation is that the taxonomic relations in the generated ontologies are not necessarily transitive due to the existence of cycles. This is a general problem for many OL methods and there are existing works on cycle removal algorithms for cleaning hierarchies [43, 52]. We ablate this in Appendix A.2.1 and found that the generated ontology can be made consistent by removing a small number of edges. Furthermore, we were unable to fully control for data contamination as the pretraining dataset of Mistral 7B is not publically known. We do, however, observe that the generated ontologies are sufficiently different from the ground truth, indicating that OLLM is not directly remembering samples from its pretraining stage.

Using LLMs as the backbone for subgraph modelling opens up exciting avenues for future research. For example, one may generate ontologies from corpora with images using vision language models [11].
