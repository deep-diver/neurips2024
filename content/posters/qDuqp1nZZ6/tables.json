It shows the private upper bound on the sample complexity for different families of continuous distributions. These families include piecewise constant, piecewise degree-d, log-concave, k-mixtures of log-concave, t-model over [n], and MHR over [n]. The table lists the number of intervals required (t) for each family, and the corresponding private upper bound on the sample complexity in terms of t, k, \u03b1, and \u03b5. This table demonstrates the algorithm's versatility in handling various distributional structures and parameters.", "section": "4 Applications"}]
