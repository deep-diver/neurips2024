Our algorithm is a private version of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al [16].

Designing its private analogue poses two difficulties. First, our DP algorithm can not resample new datapoints as a change to a single datapoint may lead to a very large change in the descretization of the real line. In contrast, the (sorted) index of the discretization point changes only by 1 between neighboring instances, and so we use a novel algorithm that set the discretization points using random Bernoulli noise, resulting in only a few buckets being affected under the right coupling. Second, our algorithm, which doesn\u2019t resample data, requires we also revisit the utility analysis of the original algorithm and prove its correctness w.r.t. the original sorted data; a problem we tackle using sampling a subset of Poisson-drawn size from each discretized bin. Lastly, since any distribution can be reduced to a continuous distribution, our algorithm is successfully carried to multiple other families of distributions and thus has numerous applications.

This sharp contrast may seem striking at first, yet on second thought, it is known that any statistical inference task that only has two possible outputs (in our case - \u201caccept / identical\u201d vs \u201creject / far-apart\u201d) can easily be made private using the Subsample-and-Aggregate framework [26] \u2014 simply run ${\\cal O}(1/\\epsilon)$ -times the non-private equivalence tester of Diakonikolas et al [16] and return the most prevalent output using simple noisy count.

The difference that makes learning substantially more difficult from equivalence testing is that when having two distributions we are capable of \u201cpitting one against the other\u201d: roughly speaking, we can partition the real line into intervals based on points from one distribution and see whether this partition acts as a random partition for the batch of examples that come from the second distribution. This involves only sorting all $s$ points from our sample on the real line and dealing with the order statistics. Our algorithm is based on privatizing the equivalence tester of [16], which operates over the continuous real line. This algorithm works in two stages: In the first stage, it looks at autocorrelation statistics that involve all $(s-1)$ pairs of adjacent (post-sorting) data points. In the second stage, it equipartitions the data using into $m$ bins using a random draw of $m$ points and repeatedly runs the following operation: run a closeness $L_{2}$ -norm based tester on the discretized $m$ -bins distribution that draws $N$ new points, and should it not reject \u2013 merge every pair of adjacent bins to create a $m/2$ -bins discretization and continue. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our DP-version of this tester also works in similar stages. The first stage is almost trivially privatized (the statistics estimated in the first stage exhibits small global sensitivity) but numerous difficulties arise in the privatization of the second stage. Most notably \u2014 the fact we use datapoints to define a partition into bins. To that end, we replace it so that we use sorted-indices, implying that a bin is composed of all datapoints in sorted indices from index $\\pi_{i}$ to index $\\pi_{i+1}$ (not including). This asserts that any single bin changes by at most two datapoints between neighboring samples. Combining this with the fact that under the null-hypothesis the difference between the number of points from $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ in each bin is proportional to the square-root of the bin size, we can bound the sensitivity in a Propose-Test-Release fashion [20] for any single bin. However, the approach of fixing sorted indices raises two concerns. The first is that we have to revisit the utility analysis of [16] because we no longer use re-sample new points to estimate the $L_{2}$ -norm difference of the two discretized distributions but rather re-visit the same dataset from which the bin-defining datapoints are taken. We bypass this difficulty by sampling ourselves Poisson-drawn subsample of each bin, and by focusing our analysis on a single iteration that should cause us to reject. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second concern lies in the privacy analysis, and it is the observation that a change to a single bin isn\u2019t enough to bound the sensitivity of our statistical estimator. The algorithm computes an $L_{2}$ -approximation of the norm-difference using all bins, and in the extreme case of two neighboring datasets that differ on the very first (sorted) datapoint that ends up as the very last datapoint in the neighboring dataset we have that all bins shift. To that end we use the following novel idea: we add a $\\mathrm{Ber}\\!\\left({^1}\\!/{2}\\right)$ -random variable to each of the bin-defining indices. On the one hand, this possible shift by 1 changes very little in terms of the analysis; on the other hand, it allows us to argue that within $\\log_{4}(1/\\delta)$ random shifts we can correlate these Bernoulli random variables so that the bins identify.
