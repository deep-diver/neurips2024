Since the invention of the transformer, two of the most effective interventions discovered for reducing the size of the KV cache have been Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and its generalization, Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). MQA and GQA both modify the design of the attention block so that multiple query heads can share a single key/value head, reducing the number of distinct key/value heads by a large factor while only minimally degrading accuracy. In this paper, we show that it is possible to take Multi-Query Attention a step further by also sharing key and value heads between adjacent layers, yielding a new attention design we call Cross-Layer Attention (CLA). With CLA, we find that it is possible to reduce the size of the KV cache by another $2\\times$ while maintaining nearly the same accuracy as unmodified MQA. In experiments training 1B- and 3B-parameter models from scratch, we demonstrate that CLA provides a Pareto improvement over the memory/accuracy tradeoffs which are possible with traditional MQA, potentially enabling future models to operate at longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes than would otherwise be possible.

Many works have tried to compress LLMs through pruning, quantization, and sparsity (see Zhu et al. [2024] for a survey), and a subset of these focus on KV cache compression.

Work on sparsifying the KV cache includes H2O [Zhang et al., 2023], Scissorhands [Liu et al., 2023], and FastGen [Ge et al., 2024], all of which employ heuristics to select unimportant tokens to discard. PagedAttention [Kwon et al., 2023] decreases the memory footprint of the KV cache in batched inference settings by eliminating unnecessary padding and allowing for sharing of common prefixes.
