The network structure consists of a general image encoder and an MLP-based decoder.

It consists of an image encoder and an MLP-based decoder.  The training phase uses either random or uniform sampling to select query positions within the image.  At each query position, the model calculates the confidence score for each keypoint.  The testing phase offers two options for keypoint localization: standard coordinate decoding (using argmax directly) or progressive coordinate decoding (a more efficient coarse-to-fine approach).  The key innovation is the use of continuous heatmap regression, enabling prediction of heatmaps at arbitrary resolution during inference.", "section": "3 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "GgIJeoSLjQ/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of computational cost (left) and accuracy (right) at different heatmap resolutions.", "description": "This figure shows the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy when using different heatmap resolutions in the NerPE model. The left panel shows that computational cost (GFLOPS) increases significantly with higher resolution, while the right panel shows that accuracy (PCKh) improves marginally after a certain point.  NerPE-p, a progressive coordinate decoding method, is designed to improve efficiency by only calculating the necessary part of the high-resolution heatmap, achieving good accuracy with lower computational cost.
