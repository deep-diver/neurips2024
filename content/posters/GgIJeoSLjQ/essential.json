This problem is worse with smaller input images, reducing accuracy and making heatmap-based methods not significantly better than coordinate regression methods in such scenarios.  This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly with lower-resolution images.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces NerPE, a novel method that employs implicit neural representation to enable continuous heatmap regression.  This method regresses confidence scores for body joints directly at any position within the image. NerPE is significantly more accurate, especially with lower-resolution input.  The method also incorporates progressive coordinate decoding for higher efficiency.  Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate NerPE's superiority over existing methods, highlighting its ability to accurately estimate pose even from low-resolution inputs.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "GgIJeoSLjQ/podcast.wav"}
