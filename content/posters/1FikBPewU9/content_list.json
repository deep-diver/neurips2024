Traditional methods [4; 5; 6] rely on hand-crafted similarity metrics and regularizations to compute dense correspondences between the input images. These methods are prone to degradation in challenging scenarios, such as varying illumination, textureless regions, and occlusion regions. Recently, learning-based methods [7; 8; 9; 10; 11] directly learn discriminative features from the input images through neural networks such as CNN and Transformers. By sampling some possible depth hypothesis within a given depth range, they warp the features from the source images to the reference view (i.e., the plane sweep algorithm [12]) and compute the cost volume, which is then regularized also through the neural network to obtain the final depth maps. However, obtaining a suitable depth range is non-trivial when applied in real-world scenarios while these methods are generally sensitive to the depth range, which limits their application. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "To get rid of the dependence on depth range, some methods [13; 14; 15] transform the regression problem in the given depth space into a matching problem on the epipolar lines. Similar to optical flow [16] and feature matching [17; 18; 19; 20], these methods also adopt a pair-wise manner. For example, DispMVS [14] computes the depth map of the source image multiple times through pairs that contain different source images and computes the final depth map by weight of sum. However, the pair-wise manner neglects the inter-image correspondence between the source images and could lead to sub-optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although DispMVS mitigates the influence of depth priors on constructing the 3D cost volume, its initialization based on depth range can still lead to significant performance degradation when the depth range error is too large, as shown in Fig. 1.

Our ideas are inspired by the recent methods [21; 22] of optical flow which concurrently estimate optical flows for multiple frames by sufficiently exploiting temporal cues. However, we find these frameworks cannot be trivially applied in the task of multi-view stereo. The reasons are twofold. First, a strong cue in the multi-frame optical flow estimation is that the flow originating from the same pixel belongs to a continuous trajectory in the temporal dimension. Additionally, the frames are sequentially aligned along this temporal dimension. Such inductive bias makes it easy to learn. But in the context of multi-view stereo, the source images may be captured in no particular order, lacking a similar constraint of continuity. Unlike optical flow, the input images in multi-view stereo are unordered. These distinctions pose a significant challenge when attempting to adapt the multi-frame optical flow framework for use in multi-view stereo. Second, the arbitrary positions and viewing angles of the source images, coupled with potentially large temporal gaps between captures, exacerbate issues such as varying illumination, significant viewport differences, and occlusions which call for new designs.

Unlike some recent methods [13; 14; 15] that work in a pair-wise manner, the proposed method estimates the depth maps of a reference image by simultaneously considering all the source images. To address the first issue, we design careful injection of geometric information into disparity features using 3D pose embedding, followed by multi-frame information interaction through an attention module. Subsequently, we encode multi-view relative pose information and geometric relationships between specific sampled points into 3D pose embedding, which is subsequently transferred to the Multi-view Disparity Attention (MDA) module. This method efficiently incorporates the relationship between depth and pixels within the network, facilitating improved information integration across multiple frames. Second, to mitigate the challenge of fluctuating image quality stemming from occlusion and other factors, we maintain and update the disparity hidden features to reflect the depth uncertainty of the current sampling point for each iteration. We design the disparity feature encoding module to learn disparity features along the epipolar lines of multi-view frames. This approach enables us to explicitly characterize occlusion scenarios for each pixel across diverse source images and dynamically adapt them during epipolar disparity flow updates.

Limitations: The proposed method cannot run in real-time (i.e., 30 FPS), which could limit its application in mobile devices or other time-sensitive scenarios. Besides, our method shows a performance gap compared to SOTA costvolume-based methods on the mainstream benchmark, despite these methods relying on highly precise depth range priors.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
