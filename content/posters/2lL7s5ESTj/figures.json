It demonstrates how the measure of the Minkowski sum of enlarged partition members surpasses the measure of a larger bounding box by a significant factor. This leads to the conclusion that certain points must be covered by many members of the enlarged partition. This illustrates the core of the proof.", "section": "5.1 Proof Sketch of Theorem 3.1"}, {"figure_path": "2lL7s5ESTj/figures/figures_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) shows a (finite) coloring x of the unit cube [\u22121/2, 1/2]2 such that no color includes points on opposite edges. (b) shows the natural extension y of that coloring to [\u22121/2 \u2212 \u03b5, 1/2 + \u03b5]2. The extension is obtained by mapping each point y to the point y for which each coordinate value yi is restricted to be within [\u22121/2, 1/2], and then y is given whatever color y had. (c), (e), and (g) show three of the five colors and demonstrate that there is at least one quadrant of the \u03b5-ball that can be Minkowski summed with the color so that the sum remains a subset of the extended cube. For red it is the lower right quadrant, for purple it is the upper right, and for gray it could be the upper left (shown) or the upper right. (d), (f), and (h) show the resulting Minkowski sum for each color. Utilizing the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, this set will have substantially greater area\u2014by a factor of at least (1 + \u03b5)2.", "description": "This figure illustrates the proof of Theorem 3.4 (Neighborhood Sperner/KKM Lemma).  It shows how a coloring of a unit square is extended to a slightly larger square, and how Minkowski sums of the color sets with an epsilon-ball are used to find a point whose epsilon-ball contains many colors.", "section": "A.4 A Neighborhood Sperner/KKM Lemma: Theorem 3.4"}]
