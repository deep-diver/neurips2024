Existing methods lack a generalized way to assess these capabilities, hindering progress in creating computer vision systems that truly understand the physical world.  This makes it difficult to design models that accurately predict interactions between objects or respond to dynamic scenes. \nThis research introduces a general and efficient protocol to evaluate the models' understanding of 3D physical properties.  The method involves training classifiers on model features for different properties, allowing for a systematic and quantitative assessment.  The study finds that Stable Diffusion and DINOv2 models perform best for many properties, suggesting architectural choices leading to better 3D understanding.  The findings highlight opportunities for enhancing model design to improve 3D physical awareness, unlocking new applications for computer vision and beyond.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "0HRRNEAQFp/podcast.wav"}
