For each round t from 1 to T, it receives an estimator ft from Algoff. It calculates a version space Ft, which is the set of all f in F such that for all s from 1 to t, the sum of the distances D(fs(xs), f(xs)) is less than or equal to Boff. It then predicts ft by uniformly sampling from Ft and receives a covariate xt.", "section": "3.1 Minimax sample complexity for oracle-efficient algorithms"}, {"figure_path": "sks7x4I8Bh/tables/tables_38_1.jpg", "caption": "Algorithm 5 Reduction from delayed online learning to non-delayed online learning", "description": "This algorithm shows how to reduce delayed online learning to non-delayed online learning. It takes as input a delay parameter N and a base online learning algorithm AOL. It initializes N copies of AOL and feeds the delayed losses to the appropriate copy of AOL. Then, it returns the prediction distribution from the corresponding copy of AOL.", "section": "G.3.1 Supporting Lemmas"}, {"figure_path": "sks7x4I8Bh/tables/tables_41_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Oracle-Efficient Online Estimation (OEOE)", "description": "The table describes the Oracle-Efficient Online Estimation (OEOE) protocol which specifies how the learner interacts with the data stream indirectly through a sequence of offline estimators produced by a black-box algorithm operating on the stream.  It details the steps involved in the process, clarifying how the learner receives an offline estimator, produces its own estimator, and receives a covariate and outcome. The protocol highlights the indirect nature of data interaction for the learner, forming the core concept of the OEOE framework explored in the paper.", "section": "1.1 Our protocol: oracle-efficient online estimation"}]
