The x-axis represents the number of atoms in the molecule, grouped into bins.  The y-axis represents the RMSD value. Box plots show the distribution of RMSD values for molecules generated by LinkerNet and DualDiff for each atom count bin. The figure demonstrates that DualDiff tends to produce molecules with lower RMSDs, indicating better binding affinity and potentially fewer structural changes during binding to both target proteins.", "section": "4.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "Y79L45D5ts/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of our method for dual-target drug design.
