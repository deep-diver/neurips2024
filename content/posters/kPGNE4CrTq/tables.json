It shows the input dimension (d), output dimension (K), and the number of samples (n) for both the training and test sets for two datasets: EURLex-4K and Wiki10-31K.  Additionally, the average number of non-zero components for both input (d) and output (K) are provided for each set. This information is crucial for understanding the scale and characteristics of the data used in evaluating the proposed model and comparing it with existing baselines.", "section": "Additional Numerical Experiments on Real Data"}, {"figure_path": "kPGNE4CrTq/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Time Complexity Comparison for each prediction", "description": "This table compares the computational time of the proposed algorithm and four baseline methods (OMP, CD, Elastic Net, and FISTA) for prediction on synthetic and two real-world datasets (EURLex-4K and Wiki10-31K).
