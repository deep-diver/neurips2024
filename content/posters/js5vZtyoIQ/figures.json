We employ a coupled graph ODE framework with an event module for collision modeling. The coupled graph ODE structure naturally captures the continuous dynamics inherent in interacting systems. r and represents feature of mesh node and object node at time t, respectively. Complementarily, the event module is designed to effectively handle potential instantaneous changes, such as those arising from collisions. Moreover, the object-level dynamics is driven by local node information and global system states. To effectively capture the instantaneous collision, we introduce a learnable event module, which detects the potential collision time and updates the instantaneous change iteratively during ODE evolution. An overview of the proposed EGODE can be found in Figure 2 and the details are introduced below.", "description": "This figure provides a visual overview of the EGODE framework.
