The MSE is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values, so lower values indicate better performance.  The methods compared include SGNN, SEGNO, and the authors' proposed EGODE. The results are broken down by different scenarios within the Physion dataset: Dominoes, Collide, Roll, and Drape, showing the MSE for each method in each scenario.
