These methods also often ignore the complex, hierarchical structure of many physical systems.  This leads to inaccurate and inefficient simulations.\n\nThis paper introduces EGODE, a new framework that addresses these issues. **EGODE uses a coupled graph ODE to model continuous dynamics across hierarchical structures (mesh nodes and objects).** It also incorporates an event module to detect and respond to collisions in real-time.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGODE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.** This work is significant for its novel approach and significant improvements in rigid body dynamics modeling.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "js5vZtyoIQ/podcast.wav"}
