Existing methods mainly address this issue at a global image level, neglecting fine-grained details.  This limits their effectiveness in identifying and correcting the root causes of errors.  Additionally, many existing solutions are designed for unimodal settings, making them unsuitable for the complex nature of VLMs.\nThis paper introduces RAVL, a novel region-aware approach that tackles spurious correlations in fine-tuned VLMs from a fine-grained perspective.  RAVL first identifies spurious correlations by clustering local image features and assessing their contribution to classification errors.  Then, it mitigates these correlations using a region-aware loss function that encourages the VLM to focus on relevant regions and ignore spurious relationships during fine-tuning.  Extensive evaluation across numerous VLMs with various architectures, data domains, and spurious correlations demonstrates RAVL's superior accuracy in discovering and mitigating these correlations compared to state-of-the-art baselines, resulting in improved zero-shot performance.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "UFRZHFYW8e/podcast.wav"}
