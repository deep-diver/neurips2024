### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in embodied AI, yet effectively translating their linguistic capabilities into real-world actions remains a challenge.  The core problem lies in the mismatch between the model's natural language output and the often complex and continuous/discrete action spaces of robotic systems.  Existing methods lack a systematic comparison across various environments and action types. 

This research introduces a unified architecture using 'Action Space Adapters' (ASAs) to bridge this gap.  They systematically evaluate several ASA strategies across five different environments and 114 embodied tasks, exploring both continuous and discrete action spaces.  The key findings reveal that a learned tokenization is superior for continuous actions, while semantically aligning discrete actions with the LLM's native token space yields the best results.  These insights provide practical guidelines for designing more effective embodied AI systems.

The results highlight that the benefits of RVQ are specific to MLLMs, improving performance significantly in those models, but causing a decrease in performance for the other, less-complex, architectures.  The improvements shown are in terms of the success rate on the CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Habitat Pick tasks.

### In-depth insights


#### Multimodal grounding
Multimodal grounding, in the context of large language models (LLMs), focuses on **bridging the gap between an LLM's understanding of the world (represented in text and images) and physical actions in the real world.**  It tackles the challenge of translating the rich semantic information within multimodal data into effective control signals for robots or other embodied agents.  This involves addressing several key aspects, including: **action space adaptation**, which focuses on mapping the LLM's output to the specific actions possible by the agent; **representation learning**,  where suitable representations for actions (continuous vs. discrete) are learned and encoded; and **policy learning**, aiming to train effective policies that direct the agent's behavior using the LLM's multimodal understanding. Effective multimodal grounding requires **careful consideration of the environment and its dynamics**, including the agent's capabilities and limitations.  Ultimately, success in multimodal grounding enables LLMs to transition from passively processing information to actively interacting with the environment, opening possibilities for a wide range of applications in robotics, virtual reality, and more. The research in this area centers on developing efficient and robust methods for translating high-level multimodal input into low-level control, and the development of benchmarks to evaluate the success of these methods.

#### Action space adaptors
Action space adaptors represent a crucial bridge between the high-level reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and the low-level control requirements of embodied agents.  The core challenge lies in translating the MLLM's natural language output into actions that are both precise and meaningful for a specific environment.  The paper explores various adaptor strategies for both continuous (e.g., robot arm movements) and discrete (e.g., picking up an object) action spaces.  **Learned tokenization emerges as a superior method for continuous actions**, providing a more nuanced control than direct regression. For discrete actions, **semantic alignment between MLLM tokens and action semantics proves most effective**, enabling better performance and sample efficiency.  The unified architectural framework presented facilitates a comprehensive comparative analysis of different adaptor types, thereby offering valuable insights into the design principles of efficient and effective grounding mechanisms for MLLMs in embodied AI applications.  **Choosing the right adaptor is shown to significantly impact downstream task performance**, highlighting the importance of careful consideration for the specific action space and environment.

#### Tokenization methods
The effectiveness of grounding multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in action hinges significantly on the choice of tokenization method for representing actions.  **For continuous action spaces**, the paper champions a **learned tokenization**, particularly **residual vector quantization (RVQ)**, which outperforms direct regression and uniform binning. RVQ's strength lies in its ability to model fine-grained action nuances through a hierarchical tokenization, capturing both global action trends and subtle variations.  **In contrast, for discrete actions**, the best approach centers on **semantic alignment**, where actions are mapped to semantically related tokens within the MLLM's vocabulary. This ensures a smooth transition between the inherent language representation of the MLLM and the robot's control commands, improving performance. The comparative analysis highlights the importance of aligning tokenization strategies to the nature of the action space, underscoring the need for tailored approaches to maximize the MLLM's capabilities in embodied AI tasks.

#### Empirical comparison
An empirical comparison section in a research paper is crucial for establishing the validity and significance of the findings.  It involves a systematic comparison of the proposed method or model against existing state-of-the-art approaches. A strong empirical comparison should focus on relevant benchmarks and datasets, providing detailed results with clear error metrics.  **The choice of baselines is vital**, ensuring that the comparison is fair and meaningful, highlighting the strengths of the proposed work.  **Statistical significance testing** is essential to demonstrate the reliability of the observed improvements, particularly when dealing with noisy or limited data.  Ideally, the comparison would show consistent improvements across diverse settings, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Finally, **thorough analysis of the results** and a discussion of any limitations are necessary to provide a complete and unbiased perspective of the empirical findings. The section should present a balanced and nuanced comparison, providing evidence to support the claims made while also acknowledging potential limitations or alternative interpretations. A strong empirical comparison establishes the novelty and value of a research paper in the field.

#### Future work
The paper's discussion on "Future Work" highlights several promising avenues.  **Extending the research to encompass a wider array of MLLMs** is crucial for generalizing findings beyond LLaVA.  **Exploring different training regimes**, such as full LLM finetuning, is key to understanding the impact on ASA performance.  **Improving the real-world applicability of these methods** is paramount, addressing the performance gap between simulated and real-robot deployments.  **Investigating alternative learning paradigms**, such as off-policy or offline RL, could enhance the efficiency and adaptability of the presented ASAs.  Furthermore, a thorough examination of how different action space characteristics influence the optimal ASA design and the **exploration of more sophisticated tokenization strategies**, potentially involving hierarchical representations, is warranted.  Finally, delving deeper into the interplay between tokenization, model architecture, and action space dimensionality would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of grounded MLLM capabilities.

> üîº This figure illustrates the general architecture used to adapt Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for action-specific decision-making.  The architecture comprises several key components:  1. **Input:** The MLLM receives embeddings of the task instruction, a prompt, and visual tokens.  The visual tokens are processed by a visual encoder and then downsampled to reduce dimensionality before being fed to the MLLM. 2. **MLLM Processing:** The MLLM processes these embeddings autoregressively to predict a sequence of *m* action tokens. 3. **Action Space Adapter (ASA):**  An ASA (the focus of the paper) is employed, consisting of an adapter head, an adapter embedding, and an adapter decoder. The adapter head processes the MLLM's final hidden state, which are then embedded and passed autoregressively through the MLLM to further refine the action tokens. 4. **Action Decoding:** Finally, the adapter decoder transforms the sequence of action tokens into an action that can be executed within a specific environment.
