The tasks assess the ability to decode various aspects of visual information from EEG data, including the fine-grained concept of video clips, coarser concepts, main object color, dynamic characteristics (Fast/Slow), number of main objects, presence of humans, and presence of human faces.  Chance level accuracies are included for each task, and statistically significant results above chance are marked with an asterisk.", "section": "5.1 EEG-VP Benchmark"}, {"figure_path": "RfsfRn9OFd/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Average classification accuracy (%) and std across all subjects with different EEG classifiers on different tasks.
