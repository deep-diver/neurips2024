It showcases UniIF's superior performance, particularly in time-split evaluations where it surpasses even ESM2-based methods, highlighting its generalizability.  Ablation studies analyze the effects of removing key components of the UniIF model (geometric dot product, gated edge attention, and virtual frames).", "section": "4.1 Protein Design (T1)"}, {"figure_path": "clqX9cVDKV/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: The recovery of RNA design.

The recovery rate, which represents the percentage of correctly predicted residues in the RNA sequences, is reported for short, medium, long, and all lengths of RNA sequences.  The results are shown as median and standard deviation over three independent runs.

It compares the recovery rate (Rec % \u2191) achieved by UniIF against several baseline methods including GCN, PMLP, GraphSAGE, GAT, GraphUNet, GIN, and EdgeCNN.  The table also shows ablation studies for UniIF, specifically removing the learned frame and using quaternions instead of the learned frame for orientation representation, highlighting the importance of the proposed frame-based block representation and the learned frame for optimal performance.", "section": "4.3 Material Design (T3)"}]
