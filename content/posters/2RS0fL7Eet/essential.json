Existing approaches often rely on two-stage estimation or reformulate the problem as minimax optimization, both of which are inefficient and introduce approximation errors.  This introduces bias and slows down the convergence of algorithms. \nThis paper tackles these limitations by directly solving IVR as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, proposing novel streaming algorithms. These algorithms leverage unbiased stochastic gradient estimators, eliminating the need for matrix inversions or mini-batches, resulting in efficient online IVR with improved convergence rates. The paper showcases the benefit of its approach over recent methods by avoiding the need to explicitly model and estimate the relationship between independent and instrumental variables.  Numerical experiments are performed to confirm this.", "affiliation": "UC Davis", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "2RS0fL7Eet/podcast.wav"}
