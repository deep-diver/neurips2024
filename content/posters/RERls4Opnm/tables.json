[{"figure_path": "RERls4Opnm/tables/tables_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Regret performance of invariant UCB and MVR algorithms across 3 different tasks; lower is better. Non-invariant kernels (blue) are outperformed by the full group invariant kernel (red) as well as partially specified (subgroup-invariant) kernels (green and yellow). For the permutation invariant function, the search space of standard BO can be constrained by the fundamental domain of the group (purple), but this performs worse than the invariant kernel. Mean \u00b1 s.d., 32 seeds.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of UCB and MVR algorithms using standard kernels, invariant kernels, and partially invariant kernels on three synthetic optimization tasks with different types of invariances. It shows that using invariant kernels significantly improves performance, requiring fewer samples to reach the optimum.  The results also demonstrate that even incorporating partial invariance can significantly boost performance, with a computational trade-off.", "section": "4.1 Synthetic experiments"}]
