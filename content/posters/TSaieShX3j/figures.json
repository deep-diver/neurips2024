Left: Determinant of M.

The left panel illustrates how the determinant remains constant under gradient flow but decays to zero under stochastic gradient flow, highlighting a key difference between the two methods. The right panel displays the trajectories of the top 5 singular values.  It shows how under stochasticity, the smaller singular values tend towards zero, indicating a rank deficiency that does not occur under gradient flow. This visualization supports the paper's central claim about the impact of stochasticity on the rank of the parameter matrices.", "section": "Experimental evidence"}, {"figure_path": "TSaieShX3j/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Evolution of the top-5 singular values of W1 for SGD with small and large stepsizes \u03b7.

The left panel shows results for a linear regression task with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. The middle panel presents results for a linear classification task with logistic loss. The right panel shows results for a two-layer ReLU network with MSE loss.  The plots illustrate how different step sizes and task types affect the singular value evolution, showcasing the impact of SGD on the network's structure and the low-rank phenomenon discussed in the paper.", "section": "7 Experimental evidence"}]
