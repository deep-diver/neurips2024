Existing workarounds, like frequency truncation, limit accuracy and make it hard to find the optimal parameters. This is a significant limitation for many important applications.\nThis paper proposes AM-FNOs, a novel approach that uses an amortized neural parameterization to handle many frequency modes with a fixed number of parameters.  They provide two versions of AM-FNOs, one using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and one using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The method shows improved accuracy on diverse PDE benchmark datasets, reaching up to a 31% improvement over existing methods.  The authors also demonstrate the AM-FNO\u2019s ability to perform well on zero-shot super-resolution tasks.", "affiliation": "Qing Yuan Research Institute, SEIEE, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "a6em980M9x/podcast.wav"}
