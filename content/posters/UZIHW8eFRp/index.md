### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to train RL agents using only pre-collected data, without further interactions with the environment. A popular approach involves fitting the data to a sequence model and then using that model to generate actions that lead to a high expected return. However, these methods often suffer from "inference-time suboptimality," meaning that while the model accurately represents the data, it struggles to effectively utilize this knowledge to choose good actions during evaluation. This is partly due to the inherent stochasticity in the data and the environment.

This paper introduces Trifle, a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses this issue by using "Tractable Probabilistic Models" (TPMs). TPMs are a class of generative models that allow for efficient and exact computation of various probabilistic queries. By leveraging TPMs, Trifle bridges the gap between accurate sequence models and high expected returns during evaluation.  The empirical results on various benchmark tasks show that Trifle outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with stochastic environments or constraints on actions (safe RL). This demonstrates the significant impact of tractability on offline RL.

### In-depth insights


#### Tractable Offline RL
Tractable Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tackles the challenge of learning effective policies from a fixed dataset of past experiences, without the ability to interact with the environment.  **A key limitation of existing offline RL methods is their inability to efficiently and accurately estimate expected returns**, often leading to suboptimal policy performance.  This is because many common approaches rely on expressive but intractable sequence models.  Tractable Offline RL addresses this problem by leveraging tractable probabilistic models, which allow for **exact and efficient computation of relevant probabilistic queries, including expected returns**. This approach bridges the gap between expressive sequence modeling and high expected return at evaluation time, significantly boosting performance, particularly in stochastic environments.  **The use of tractable models enhances inference-time optimality, leading to more effective action selection** and improved overall results.

#### Trifle Algorithm
The Trifle algorithm, designed for offline reinforcement learning, tackles the limitations of existing methods by emphasizing **tractability**. Unlike approaches that solely focus on expressive sequence modeling, Trifle leverages tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) like probabilistic circuits to **efficiently compute marginal probabilities and answer various queries**. This allows Trifle to accurately estimate expected returns and sample high-rewarding actions during evaluation, addressing the common underperformance of RvS algorithms.  By combining this tractable inference with a beam search, Trifle significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in stochastic environments. The algorithm's ability to handle constraints makes it applicable to safe RL tasks.  **Trifle's key innovation is its integration of TPMs**; this facilitates exact calculations, mitigating the approximations inherent in many RvS approaches. The empirical results demonstrate Trifle's state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across diverse benchmarks.

#### Inference Optimality
The concept of "Inference Optimality" in offline reinforcement learning (RL) centers on how effectively a learned model translates its training-acquired knowledge into optimal action selection during evaluation.  **High inference optimality implies that the model accurately identifies and selects high-reward actions**, even in unseen states, while low optimality indicates a disconnect between the model's capabilities and its performance on new data. This discrepancy arises due to various factors such as the stochasticity of the environment, imperfect reward modeling, and limitations of the employed sequence models, which may not be adept at handling complex conditional probability queries needed for optimal decision-making in offline RL.  **Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) are proposed to enhance inference optimality** by enabling the exact and efficient computation of such queries. The use of TPMs bridges the gap between the expressive power of sequence models, which are trained to recognize high-reward action sequences, and the algorithm's ability to effectively utilize this information for optimal decision-making at evaluation time.  **The key benefit is that TPMs facilitate accurate expected return estimation** given uncertain dynamics and allow the agents to generate actions that yield significantly higher returns, overcoming limitations observed in previous methods.

#### Stochasticity Effects
The presence of stochasticity, or randomness, significantly impacts offline reinforcement learning.  **Stochastic environments** introduce variability in transitions and rewards, making it difficult for models to accurately learn optimal policies from offline data alone.  **Model inaccuracies** stemming from stochasticity can lead to suboptimal action selection during evaluation. **Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs)** are presented as a solution because of their ability to handle uncertainty inherent in stochastic systems, offering a potential advantage over traditional approaches that struggle with these complexities.  **Approximation errors**, inherent in many offline RL methods, are exacerbated by stochasticity. The paper emphasizes the need to move beyond simply expressive sequence modeling and embrace models that can efficiently and accurately address probabilistic queries, leading to improved robustness and performance in the face of environmental uncertainty.

#### Safe RL Tasks
In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), ensuring safety is paramount, especially when deploying agents in real-world scenarios.  **Safe RL tasks** address this by incorporating constraints or penalties that prevent the agent from taking actions that could lead to undesirable outcomes, such as physical damage or system failures.  These constraints could be explicitly defined (e.g., limiting the maximum torque applied to a robotic joint) or implicitly incentivized (e.g., rewarding the agent for remaining within a safe operational space).  The challenge lies in balancing safety with performance: overly restrictive constraints could hinder the agent's ability to learn optimal policies, while overly permissive constraints could lead to unsafe behavior.  **Successful safe RL approaches** often involve careful design of reward functions and constraint satisfaction methods.  They might utilize techniques such as constrained optimization, penalty methods, or barrier functions to guide the agent towards safe and effective behavior.  **The evaluation of safe RL algorithms** requires careful consideration of safety metrics beyond standard RL performance measures.  These could include metrics that quantify the frequency and severity of safety violations, the robustness of the policy to unexpected disturbances, and the overall reliability of the system.  **Future research** in this field should focus on developing more robust and efficient methods for incorporating safety constraints, expanding the range of environments in which safe RL can be effectively applied, and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of safe RL agents.
