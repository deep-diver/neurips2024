These attacks are typically classified based on the adversary\u2019s level of access to the model [16]: white-box and black-box settings.

Compared to score-based attacks, a more practical and stringent type of attack is decision-based or label-only MIAs [7, 31], which operate under the constraint of having access only to the final decision labels. Several label-only attacks have been proposed. For example, inspired by the transferability of adversarial examples, transfer attacks [31] explore the transferability of membership information. They use a shadow dataset labeled by the target model to train a shadow model and perform a score-based attack on the shadow model, expecting that the differences between members and non-members in the target model will reflect similarly in the shadow model. Data augmentation attacks [7] exploit the robustness of samples to data augmentation transformations to differentiate members from non-members, with higher robustness indicating membership. Similarly, state-of-the-art label-only MIAs, known as boundary attacks [31, 7], use the robustness of samples to strategic input perturbations as label-only proxies for the model\u2019s confidence, where higher robustness implies a higher confidence score. Boundary attacks have different methods for adding perturbations. For example, Gaussian noise is one method where the attacker continuously adds Gaussian noise until the label changes.

Moreover, the precision of these attacks is not just a concern for individual privacy; it also lays the groundwork for more advanced extraction attacks [37], making the pursuit of high precision in MIAs a critical focus for attackers.

Previous label-only MIAs [6, 7] have exploited the former observation, but this has led to high false positive rates and low precision. Our OSLO is based on the latter.
