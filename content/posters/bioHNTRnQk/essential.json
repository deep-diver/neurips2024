This practice can lead to a phenomenon called \"model collapse,\" where the model's performance drastically degrades, resulting in nonsensical outputs. This paper investigates model collapse in high-dimensional regression using Gaussian data.  The researchers found that training a model on data from multiple generations of AI-generated data causes the model's performance to worsen linearly with the number of iterations. \nThe researchers use a linear regression setting with Gaussian data to study model collapse. They derive analytical formulas that quantify how the test error increases with iterations of AI-generated data, considering various factors like covariance spectrum, regularization, noise level, and dataset size. They find that even with no noise, catastrophic model collapse can occur.  They propose a simple regularization strategy to lessen the effects of model collapse. Their theoretical findings are validated with experiments, showing the impact of retraining on model performance and offering practical solutions for mitigating model collapse.", "affiliation": "Meta", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "bioHNTRnQk/podcast.wav"}
