Cycle 5 and 6 are included.", "description": "The figure shows the impact of varying the number of channels within the Schur layer on model performance.  It reveals that increasing the number of channels initially improves performance, but that after a certain point (around 4-6 channels), there are diminishing returns and even a slight performance decrease, potentially due to overfitting or the limited number of distinct eigenvalues for the selected cycles (5 and 6).  The experiment uses cycles of size 5 and 6, suggesting that model behavior may differ with other cycle lengths.", "section": "G Ways to Use Schur Neuron"}]
