Existing methods lack a clear theoretical understanding of how hyperparameters impact feature learning dynamics, leading to suboptimal training outcomes. This research addresses these limitations.\nThis paper introduces a novel 'Feature Speed Formula' that accurately predicts feature update magnitudes using a simple geometric interpretation: the angle between feature updates and the backward pass.  This formula provides a flexible approach to scale hyperparameters, offering practical rules for adjusting learning rates and initialization scales to optimize feature learning and loss decay behaviors.  The paper validates this approach through theoretical analysis of ReLU MLPs and ResNets, revealing critical insights into existing and novel hyperparameter scaling strategies.", "affiliation": "Institute of Mathematics, EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wsHMb4J2o9/podcast.wav"}
