### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many scientific applications rely on Bayesian inference with latent variable models.  However, obtaining sufficient clean data to effectively train prior distributions, such as diffusion models, can be extremely difficult.  Existing methods for training diffusion models typically require large amounts of high-quality data, limiting their applicability in many real-world situations where data is scarce or noisy.

This paper introduces a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to effectively train diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations. Unlike previous methods, this approach generates proper diffusion models crucial for downstream applications.  Additionally, the paper proposes an improved posterior sampling method, enhancing the accuracy of inference results. Through experiments using various datasets, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing its ability to generate high-quality results even with limited and noisy data.  **The core contribution is a practical and efficient method to train diffusion models in data-scarce environments.**

### In-depth insights


#### Diffusion Priors
Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for Bayesian inverse problems, offering a flexible and data-efficient approach.  However, **training these models effectively often requires substantial amounts of clean, labeled data**, which may be scarce in many real-world applications.  This limitation necessitates innovative training methods capable of leveraging incomplete or noisy data.  The core idea revolves around the use of diffusion processes to model complex probability distributions, effectively capturing uncertainty and enabling efficient inference.  **Expectation-Maximization (EM) emerges as a suitable algorithm**, allowing iterative refinement of the diffusion model parameters based on noisy observations. By alternating between generating posterior samples and updating the diffusion model, this approach overcomes the challenge of data scarcity and makes diffusion models suitable priors in scenarios with limited or noisy datasets.  **The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated empirically across various inverse problems**, validating its practical value and highlighting its potential to enhance the accuracy and robustness of Bayesian inference in data-constrained settings.

#### EM for DMs
The application of Expectation-Maximization (EM) to Diffusion Models (DMs) for Bayesian inverse problems presents a novel approach to training DMs with limited data.  **EM's iterative nature elegantly addresses the challenge of obtaining latent variable samples, crucial for DM training, from incomplete or noisy observations.**  The algorithm alternates between generating samples from a posterior distribution (using a modified posterior sampling scheme to improve stability and accuracy) and updating the DM's parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This process overcomes the limitations of typical DM training procedures that require vast quantities of clean data. The core innovation lies in the **efficient posterior sampling technique**, which leverages the properties of DMs to avoid the computational expense of traditional MCMC or importance sampling approaches.  **The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated empirically**, showcasing improvements over previous approaches on low-dimensional, corrupted CIFAR-10, and accelerated MRI datasets.

#### MMPS Sampling
The proposed Moment Matching Posterior Sampling (MMPS) method offers a significant advancement in posterior sampling for diffusion models, particularly within Bayesian inverse problems.  **MMPS directly addresses the limitations of previous methods** by explicitly incorporating the covariance of the posterior distribution, leading to more accurate and stable sample generation.  Unlike previous approaches that rely on heuristics or approximations for the covariance, MMPS leverages Tweedie's formula for a precise estimate. While computationally more demanding, the use of conjugate gradient methods mitigates this, making MMPS feasible for high-dimensional applications.  **The improved accuracy and stability of MMPS translate to higher-quality posterior samples**, crucial for successful Bayesian inference and other downstream tasks. **This method proves highly effective in scenarios with strong local covariances**, outperforming existing techniques and demonstrating superior convergence in the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm used for training diffusion models from limited or noisy data.

#### Empirical Bayes
The concept of Empirical Bayes is crucial to this research, offering a solution to the challenge of specifying informative priors in Bayesian inference problems where obtaining sufficient latent variable data is difficult.  **The core idea is to estimate the prior distribution from the observed data itself**, rather than relying on pre-existing assumptions or extensive data. The paper leverages the strength of diffusion models for the prior and uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to refine this prior based on observations, leading to improved posterior sampling quality.  **This approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional EB methods**, particularly concerning high-dimensional latent spaces and complex data structures for which simpler prior models fail. While the focus is on linear Gaussian forward models, **the EM framework offers a potential path towards handling more complex scenarios**. The inherent flexibility and high-quality sample generation capabilities of diffusion models are integral to the success of this innovative EB approach.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising directions.  **Extending the methodology to non-linear forward models** is crucial for broader applicability, particularly in scientific domains where linear approximations are insufficient.  Investigating the **impact of different posterior sampling techniques** and their computational efficiency would help optimize the EM algorithm's performance.  **Exploring the use of alternative prior models**, such as normalizing flows, warrants consideration to assess their potential advantages and limitations compared to diffusion models.  Finally, a **rigorous theoretical analysis** of the proposed EM algorithm's convergence properties and the quality of the learned prior distribution is needed to provide a stronger foundation for the method.  Addressing these points will enhance the robustness and impact of this research.
