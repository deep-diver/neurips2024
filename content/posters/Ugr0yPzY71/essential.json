Existing methods for generating these adversarial examples are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, as they treat each example independently. This is inefficient because regularities exist across the generated examples.\nThis paper introduces a novel method to overcome this inefficiency. It leverages the observation that adversarial examples commonly perturb the same set of features.  By identifying these features, the researchers develop two algorithms that significantly accelerate the process.  Their approach demonstrates substantial speed improvements, making the generation of adversarial examples faster and more scalable.", "affiliation": "KU Leuven", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "Ugr0yPzY71/podcast.wav"}
