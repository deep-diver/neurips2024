The ELBO approach is shown to exhibit label switching, where the entries of Z appear in different order across replicates.", "section": "5.2 Label Switching in Amortized Clustering"}, {"figure_path": "8x48XFLvyd/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Average \u21131 distance ||Z\u02c6 \u2212 Z||1 (and std. deviations) across one hundred replicates.", "description": "This table presents the average L1 distance and standard deviation between the estimated cluster centers (Z\u02c6) and the true cluster centers (Z) across 100 experimental replications.  The results are shown for both ELBO-based and LP-based optimization methods, with two different parameterizations of the Gaussian variational distribution (Mean and Natural).  The L1 distance measures how different the estimated centers are from the true centers.  Lower values indicate better performance.", "section": "5.2 Label Switching in Amortized Clustering"}]
