### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Variational inference (VI) is a powerful technique for approximating complex probability distributions, commonly used in machine learning.  However, a major drawback of standard VI methods is their tendency to get stuck in suboptimal solutions (local optima), making it difficult to guarantee finding the best approximation. The most common approach uses the evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the objective function, but this function often has many local minima and thus, global convergence is not guaranteed.

This paper presents a novel VI method that overcomes this limitation. By using a different objective function (expected forward KL divergence) and leveraging the neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework, the authors prove that their method achieves global convergence under certain conditions.  This result is significant because **it provides a strong theoretical foundation for VI**, ensuring that it reliably produces high-quality approximations without getting trapped in poor solutions.  Their empirical studies support this and show their method outperforms ELBO-based approaches in several applications.

### In-depth insights


#### Global VI Convergence
The concept of "Global VI Convergence" signifies a significant advancement in variational inference (VI).  Traditional VI methods, using the evidence lower bound (ELBO), often suffer from convergence to suboptimal local optima, hindering their effectiveness.  This research explores a novel approach that achieves global convergence, **guaranteeing convergence to the true global optimum** under specific conditions. This is achieved by minimizing the expected forward KL divergence instead of the ELBO. The key innovation involves leveraging the neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework to analyze gradient dynamics in function space.  **The NTK analysis helps establish a unique global solution** and proves convergence to this solution under the asymptotic regime of infinite width networks.  While the theoretical results hold for specific network architectures and conditions, **the experimental validation demonstrates promising generalization**, even in scenarios with finite-width networks and relaxed conditions. **This breakthrough addresses the long-standing challenge of local optima in VI** opening up opportunities for broader applications and more reliable inference across diverse tasks.

#### Forward KL Analysis
Forward KL divergence, unlike the commonly used ELBO in variational inference, offers a unique perspective by minimizing the expected KL divergence between the true posterior and the variational approximation. This approach, **analyzed in the context of neural networks**, presents several advantages. Firstly, it provides a direct measure of the discrepancy between the learned and true posteriors, unlike the ELBO which only provides a lower bound. Secondly, minimizing the forward KL can lead to **better approximations of the posterior, particularly when dealing with complex, multimodal distributions**. The analysis often involves studying the gradient dynamics in function space, sometimes using the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to characterize these dynamics, particularly in the asymptotic regime of infinitely wide networks.  This functional approach helps to establish **global convergence guarantees**, which is a significant advantage over ELBO-based methods that often suffer from local optima. However, this approach usually requires strong assumptions (e.g., positive definiteness of the NTK), making the practical applicability dependent on the model and network architecture chosen.  Further research needs to focus on relaxing these assumptions to improve the applicability and robustness of this promising technique.

#### NTK and Global Optima
The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) plays a crucial role in establishing global convergence results for variational inference.  **The NTK, in the infinite-width limit, essentially linearizes the neural network's behavior**, allowing for the analysis of gradient dynamics in function space.  This linearization transforms the non-convex optimization problem into a convex one, under specific conditions such as the positive definiteness of the NTK.  The core idea is that by leveraging the NTK's properties, particularly its connection to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, the authors are able to demonstrate the existence of a unique global optimum for the variational objective. Consequently, gradient descent dynamics, analyzed through the lens of the NTK, are shown to converge to this unique global optimum.**  However, it's **important to note that these results are asymptotic**, holding strictly in the infinite-width limit. Finite-width networks, while exhibiting similar behavior in practice, do not offer the same theoretical guarantees. The authors provide experimental results to show that even in practice, the behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions, suggesting the potential for weaker conditions to achieve similar global convergence.

#### Amortized Inference
Amortized inference is a crucial technique in variational inference (VI) that significantly enhances efficiency by learning a single, shared function (encoder) to approximate the posterior distribution for all data points.  This contrasts with non-amortized methods where a separate optimization process is needed for each data point.  The key advantage is computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. **The amortized approach learns a general mapping from the input data to the parameters of the approximate posterior, making inference much faster during test time.** However, this efficiency comes at the cost of potential loss in accuracy. The shared encoder might not capture the nuances of the posterior for all data points equally well, resulting in an overall less precise approximation compared to non-amortized methods.  Therefore, **the choice between amortized and non-amortized inference involves a trade-off between computational efficiency and approximation accuracy.** The effectiveness of amortized inference heavily relies on the expressiveness of the learned encoder. If the encoder is not sufficiently flexible, its capacity to model the diverse posterior distributions across different data points will be limited, resulting in poor performance.  **Neural networks are commonly employed as encoders in amortized inference due to their flexibility and capacity to learn complex mappings.** This aspect of the method is crucial to its practical applicability and effectiveness.  Further research should explore novel encoder architectures and training strategies to improve the performance of amortized inference and balance the trade-off with accuracy.

#### Limitations and Future
The research makes significant strides in establishing global convergence for variational inference, but several limitations exist.  **The theoretical results rely heavily on asymptotic analyses**, particularly the infinite-width neural network assumption.  The practical implications for finite-width networks, commonly used in practice, remain to be fully explored.  **The reliance on specific neural network architectures and activation functions** also restricts the generalizability of the findings.  Further research is needed to investigate the impact of different architectures, activation functions, and loss functions on the global convergence property.  Addressing scenarios where the neural tangent kernel is not positive-definite or where the assumptions of strict convexity on the objective function are not fully satisfied, could broaden the applicability of the method.  Future work should also focus on extending these results to more complex models and settings such as hierarchical models or those involving intractable likelihoods. **Empirical evaluations on a wider range of tasks** beyond the provided examples would further demonstrate the practical effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.  Exploring the trade-offs between global convergence and computational cost will also be crucial for real-world applications.

Different initializations of the rotation angle converge to different local optima. This is in contrast to the expected forward KL approach which consistently converges to the global optimum (shown in Figure 5).
