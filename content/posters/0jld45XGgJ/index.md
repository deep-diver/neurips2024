### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep neural networks often exhibit a phenomenon called neural collapse, where the final layer's structure simplifies during training.  Recent research has investigated whether this "collapse" extends to earlier layers (deep neural collapse), and under what conditions it represents an optimal solution. However, existing work often simplifies the problem, considering linear models or only two layers. This paper investigates the general case of non-linear models with many layers and classes.

This study reveals a surprising result: **deep neural collapse is not optimal in the general case**.  The authors demonstrate this by identifying a "low-rank bias" in multi-layer regularization, which favors solutions with even lower rank than those produced by neural collapse. They support their theoretical analysis with experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets, showing that low-rank structures emerge in solutions found by gradient descent.  This work significantly advances our understanding of deep neural network training and learned representations, suggesting that the search for optimal structures is more complex than previously thought.

### In-depth insights


#### Deep DNC Limits
The heading 'Deep DNC Limits' suggests an exploration of the boundaries and constraints of Deep Neural Collapse (DNC).  A thoughtful analysis would likely investigate scenarios where DNC's optimality breaks down. This could involve exploring the impact of network architecture (**depth, width, type of layers**), data characteristics (**number of classes, dimensionality, data distribution**), and optimization methods (**choice of optimizer, learning rate, regularization**).  **High-dimensional datasets** or **complex architectures** might reveal limitations in DNC's ability to achieve global optimality. The analysis might also explore the emergence of low-rank solutions and their relationship to DNC, potentially showing that low-rank solutions can outperform DNC under specific circumstances.  **The role of regularization** would be crucial, examining how different regularization schemes bias the network towards or away from DNC. Ultimately, a comprehensive study of 'Deep DNC Limits' would provide a nuanced understanding of when and why DNC is (or is not) a beneficial phenomenon, enhancing our theoretical understanding of deep learning convergence.

#### Low-Rank Bias
The concept of 'Low-Rank Bias' in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a crucial observation.  It highlights that the optimization process, particularly gradient descent, inherently favors solutions with lower rank than what might be expected. This is not simply a consequence of regularization, but a deeper characteristic of the training dynamics. The paper demonstrates that this bias can lead to solutions with ranks significantly lower than those predicted by neural collapse (NC) theory, especially in models with multiple layers and classes. **The low-rank bias is attributed to the representation cost of DNNs**, where the complexity is related to the rank of feature matrices. This implies that simpler, lower-rank representations are preferred during optimization even if they don't fully satisfy the conditions of neural collapse. The emergence of the low-rank bias challenges the assumption of optimality of neural collapse in practical DNN training, and reveals that the observed properties of NC might be a consequence of this implicit bias rather than a fundamental characteristic of optimal solutions.

#### SRG Solutions
The section on 'SRG Solutions' presents a novel, low-rank alternative to Deep Neural Collapse (DNC) for deep neural networks.  **The core idea is to leverage the structure of strongly regular graphs (SRGs) to construct weight matrices and feature representations with significantly lower rank than those found in DNC**. This low-rank property is key to outperforming DNC in terms of the objective function, specifically when dealing with many classes or layers.  The authors provide an explicit combinatorial construction of such low-rank solutions, demonstrating that these solutions have a rank of Œò(‚àöK) compared to DNC's rank of K (K being the number of classes).  **This lower rank is achieved by carefully controlling the structure of the class-mean matrices**, ensuring they satisfy certain orthogonality and symmetry conditions. The effectiveness of this method is supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results, showing that gradient descent can indeed discover these low-rank solutions under specific conditions.  The success of the SRG approach challenges the notion of DNC as the optimal solution, highlighting the influence of low-rank bias in the training process.  **The findings suggest that commonly observed low-rank phenomena in DNNs may not be simply explained by DNC**, but rather are driven by more fundamental optimization biases in multi-layer models.  Further research is needed to determine the full implications of these discoveries for our understanding of DNN behavior.

#### DNC1 Optimality
The paper investigates the optimality of Deep Neural Collapse (DNC), specifically focusing on DNC1, which is the phenomenon where feature vectors of the same class collapse to their class mean.  While previous research established DNC optimality in simplified settings (e.g., linear models, binary classification), this work demonstrates that **DNC1 optimality doesn't extend to the general multi-class, non-linear, deep learning setting.** The authors find that multi-layer regularization schemes introduce a low-rank bias, leading to solutions of even lower rank than those predicted by DNC1.  This suggests that **DNC1, although empirically observed, is not necessarily the globally optimal solution** in complex DNNs.  The study highlights the importance of considering low-rank bias when analyzing the geometric structure of learned representations in deep networks.  **The authors' theoretical findings are supported by experiments** on both synthetic (DUFM) and real datasets, showing that low-rank solutions consistently outperform DNC, particularly as the number of classes and layers increase.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the theoretical analysis to other loss functions**, beyond MSE, is crucial to understand the generality of the low-rank bias phenomenon and its interaction with neural collapse.  **Investigating the impact of different network architectures** is also important, as the current analysis focuses primarily on a specific model.  **Exploring the relationship between low-rank bias, optimization algorithms, and generalization capabilities** offers significant potential for advancing our understanding of deep learning. **Empirical studies with a wider range of datasets and hyperparameter settings** could further validate and refine the theoretical findings.  Finally, **developing practical methods to leverage the low-rank bias for improved model efficiency and performance** would be a highly valuable contribution.
