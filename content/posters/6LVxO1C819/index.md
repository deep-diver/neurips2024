### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated learning (FL) faces challenges from data heterogeneity and model poisoning attacks.  Knowledge distillation (KD), a common technique to address heterogeneity, unfortunately amplifies the effects of poisoning attacks, reducing global model accuracy. This is because KD aligns benign local models with a poisoned global model. 



The paper introduces HYDRA-FL, a hybrid KD approach that addresses this issue. HYDRA-FL reduces attack amplification by applying KD loss at both a shallow layer (via an auxiliary classifier) and the final layer, decreasing the negative effect of the poisoned global model. Evaluation demonstrates that HYDRA-FL significantly improves accuracy in attack scenarios while maintaining comparable performance to existing methods in benign settings, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the robustness of FL.

### In-depth insights


#### Attack Amplification
The research reveals a critical vulnerability in knowledge distillation (KD)-based federated learning (FL) systems, specifically **attack amplification**.  KD techniques, while improving accuracy under high data heterogeneity, inadvertently amplify the impact of model poisoning attacks.  This occurs because KD aligns benign local models with a poisoned global model, effectively reducing the diversity that might otherwise mitigate malicious influence.  The analysis focuses on two KD-based FL algorithms, FedNTD and MOON, demonstrating that increased KD strength (higher loss coefficients) correlates with improved benign accuracy but significantly worsened performance under attack.  **This counterintuitive tradeoff highlights a fundamental risk of relying solely on KD for robustness in FL**. The core finding motivates the development of HYDRA-FL, a hybrid approach aiming to mitigate attack amplification while preserving the benefits of KD in benign scenarios.

#### HYDRA-FL Design
The HYDRA-FL design cleverly addresses the vulnerability of knowledge distillation (KD) in federated learning (FL) to model poisoning attacks.  **Its core innovation is a hybrid approach**, combining traditional KD at the final layer with a novel shallow KD mechanism utilizing an auxiliary classifier. This hybrid strategy mitigates the amplification of poisoning attacks by offloading some of the KD loss to a shallow layer, where it's less susceptible to manipulation by malicious clients. By **reducing the reliance on final layer alignment**, HYDRA-FL prevents benign clients from inadvertently aligning with poisoned global models.  The framework's adaptability is highlighted by its generic loss function, easily integrated into existing KD-based FL algorithms like FedNTD and MOON, **enhancing robustness** without sacrificing accuracy in benign settings.  **The use of an auxiliary classifier** is critical, acting as a filter against poisoned information, and the introduction of a diminishing factor further balances the contributions of the KD loss components. This sophisticated design ensures improved security and accuracy in diverse and challenging FL scenarios.

#### Heterogeneity Impact
The impact of data heterogeneity on federated learning (FL) is a critical aspect explored in the research.  **Non-IID data distributions across clients lead to significant performance degradation** because local models trained on diverse datasets may diverge substantially.  This divergence hinders the effectiveness of model aggregation, resulting in a global model that struggles to generalize well. The paper investigates how knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, while improving accuracy in homogeneous settings, **exacerbate the negative effects of heterogeneity under attack**.  Specifically, KD's inherent tendency to align local models with the global model inadvertently aligns benign models with poisoned ones during malicious attacks, reducing the overall robustness. This phenomenon, termed 'attack amplification', demonstrates the **tradeoff between improving accuracy in benign scenarios and increasing vulnerability in adversarial ones**.  The study therefore emphasizes the need for robust FL techniques that can mitigate this amplification, particularly when confronted with heterogeneous data and malicious actors. The research highlights the **critical vulnerability of using KD in FL without adequate safeguards** and underscores the importance of developing strategies that enhance both accuracy and security in real-world, diverse FL environments.

#### Future Work
The authors acknowledge the limitations of their current work, particularly the exploration of a limited subset of FL settings and adversarial scenarios. **Future research should broaden the scope to encompass a wider range of aggregation rules, attacks, defenses, datasets, and data modalities, including multimodal data.**  The current study's reliance on image datasets is a limitation, and expanding to other modalities, like language or combined modalities, would enhance generalizability.  **Extending the HYDRA-FL framework to other state-of-the-art KD techniques beyond FedNTD and MOON is also vital for validating the framework's adaptability and effectiveness.**  Investigating the impact of model heterogeneity, both in benign and adversarial settings, warrants further attention, potentially uncovering more nuanced interactions.  Finally, a deeper theoretical understanding of the attack amplification phenomenon in KD-based FL is needed to develop more robust and targeted mitigation techniques. **A thorough analysis comparing the performance of HYDRA-FL against other robust FL defenses, under various attack scenarios, is essential to establish its overall efficacy and identify its specific strengths and weaknesses.**

#### Limitations
The research paper acknowledges inherent limitations within the scope of its investigation.  **Data heterogeneity** in federated learning presents a considerable challenge, and the study's focus on specific KD-based algorithms (FedNTD and MOON) might not fully generalize to all FL techniques. The empirical analysis, while comprehensive, is restricted to a specific set of datasets and attack settings, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings.  **Adversarial scenarios** were simulated, but the complexity of real-world attacks is not fully captured.  Furthermore, the **scalability and computational cost** of the proposed HYDRA-FL technique across diverse datasets and architectures remains unexplored.  Therefore, while the findings are valuable, they should be viewed within the context of these limitations and further research is needed to expand the understanding of HYDRA-FL's efficacy and adaptability.

The results show the tradeoff between accuracy in benign settings and robustness to attacks.  FedNTD and MOON initially exhibit higher accuracy than FedAvg under benign conditions, particularly at lower Œ± values (higher heterogeneity). However, in the presence of attacks, their performance degrades significantly more than FedAvg.  The higher the heterogeneity (lower Œ±), the more the accuracy drops under attacks for both FedNTD and MOON, highlighting the vulnerability of these KD-based FL techniques to model poisoning attacks when heterogeneity is high.

> üîº This figure illustrates the effect of knowledge distillation (KD) on federated learning (FL) models under benign and malicious (attack) conditions.  In the benign setting (Figure 1a), KD successfully reduces the differences between the local models trained on diverse data and the global model, thus improving model performance.  In contrast, in the malicious setting (Figure 1b), where some malicious local models are introduced, KD causes the benign local models to align with the poisoned global model (the poisoned global model is not depicted explicitly in the figure). This phenomenon, known as 'attack amplification', results in a significant performance degradation.  The figure highlights the vulnerability of KD-based FL techniques to model poisoning attacks.

This highlights the effectiveness of HYDRA-FL's approach in mitigating the attack amplification problem caused by over-reliance on final-layer alignment in knowledge distillation.
