A recent optimization method called Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown promise in enhancing generalization, but it suffers from high computational costs due to sequential gradient calculations. This slows down the training process and limits its applicability.\n\nThe paper introduces SAMPa, a novel modification of SAM that addresses its limitations. By cleverly parallelizing the two gradient computations required in SAM, SAMPa accelerates the training process without sacrificing generalization performance.  In fact, it consistently outperforms SAM across various machine learning tasks. The authors also provide theoretical guarantees for convergence, even when using a fixed perturbation size which is a notable improvement over existing methods.  These improvements make SAMPa a more practical and effective optimization technique for training deep learning models.", "affiliation": "EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "IGn0ktYDwV/podcast.wav"}
