It demonstrates the relationship between the number of samples required by the Common-Points-Picking algorithm and the number of players, under conditions of strict convexity and its absence. The LHS shows results for games with a strict convexity constant of 0.1/n, while the RHS shows results for games without strict convexity (s=0). The purpose is to empirically validate the algorithm's efficiency and robustness in learning the expected core, comparing its performance against the theoretical upper bounds.", "section": "Experiment"}]
