This poses a challenge to cooperative game theory, as many solutions require complete knowledge of reward functions. Learning the core, which represents the set of stable allocations, is crucial, but existing methods struggle in the face of uncertainty and bandit feedback, where agents only observe the reward of their own actions. \nThis paper tackles this challenge by focusing on learning the 'expected core', a solution concept robust to uncertainty. The researchers propose a new algorithm, Common-Points-Picking, specifically designed for strictly convex games. **This algorithm efficiently estimates the expected core by querying the rewards of specific coalitions**, leveraging the game's structure and employing a novel extension of the hyperplane separation theorem.  The algorithm is proven to converge with high probability using a polynomial number of samples, offering a practical and theoretically sound solution for scenarios where reward distributions are unknown.", "affiliation": "University of Warwick", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ZRYFftR4xn/podcast.wav"}
