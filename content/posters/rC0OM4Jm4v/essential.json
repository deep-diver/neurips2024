Data augmentation techniques, such as simple transformations, try to address this issue but have limited success.  Generative models have shown promise in generating more realistic augmentations, but existing methods often ignore the influence of other classes, limiting their effectiveness. This paper tackles this challenge.\nThe paper introduces GeNIe, a novel augmentation method that uses a latent diffusion model. GeNIe combines source images and target class text prompts to generate hard negative samples.  To enhance GeNIe's effectiveness, the authors also propose GeNIe-Ada, which automatically adjusts the noise level for better augmentation. Experiments in few-shot and long-tail scenarios demonstrate that GeNIe and GeNIe-Ada significantly improve classification accuracy, outperforming existing techniques.  **The adaptive noise selection in GeNIe-Ada is a key innovation, leading to superior results.**", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "rC0OM4Jm4v/podcast.wav"}
