Existing methods often struggle with the computational complexity of large-scale networks, thus limiting their effectiveness.  In particular, cutting-plane methods, while effective, often rely on external solvers which do not scale well to larger networks.\n\nThis paper introduces BICCOS, a novel approach to neural network verification that addresses these limitations.  BICCOS leverages the logical relationships between neurons within a branch-and-bound search tree to generate efficient cutting planes directly, without relying on external solvers.  **It significantly improves verification efficiency and scalability**, especially for large networks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art verifiers on a range of benchmarks.  **The improved performance is achieved by using a multi-tree search to generate more effective cuts, strengthening cuts to increase their effectiveness, and applying a breadth-first search strategy**.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "FwhM1Zpyft/podcast.wav"}
