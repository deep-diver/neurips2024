The left panel shows the sample complexity as a function of the uncertainty level (\u03c3) for sa-rectangular and s-rectangular RMDPs, comparing the results with previous work using L1 norm (total variation distance). The right panel shows the instance-dependent sample complexity for s-rectangular RMDPs, illustrating the upper bound for general Lp norms and a lower bound for L\u221e norm. Overall, the figure demonstrates the near-optimal sample complexity results obtained in this paper and the relationships between sa-rectangular and s-rectangular RMDPs.", "section": "4 Theoretical guarantees"}]
