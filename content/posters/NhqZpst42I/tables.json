Some super-classes such as birds, reptiles, dogs & other mammals form well-defined, tight clusters, suggesting that features belonging to them are close in the feature space. Others, such as device, clothes appear more dispersed. By comparing this figure with Figure 2, we can identify which meta-features are \"pure\" (belonging to a single super-class) and which are \"impure\" (spanning multiple super-classes). Interestingly, the \"impurity\" region seems to cover low-complexity and mid-complexity concepts such that Grass, Waves, Trees, Low-pixel quality detectors which are not class-specific.", "description": "This figure visualizes the relationship between feature similarity and their super-classes using a UMAP projection. Each point represents a feature, colored by its associated superclass. The figure shows that some superclasses form tight clusters, suggesting that features belonging to those classes are close in feature space, while others are more dispersed. The \"impurity\" of features spanning multiple superclasses is also highlighted.", "section": "H Features Clustering"}]
