Simpler features often bypass the visual hierarchy through residual connections.", "Complex features tend to be less important for driving model decisions. Surprisingly, important features become accessible at earlier layers during training, simplifying over time."], "tldr": "Deep learning models often prioritize simpler features, potentially leading to shortcut learning and poor generalization.  This hinders the development of robust and interpretable AI systems.  Existing methods for assessing feature complexity are limited and lack a computational perspective.\nThis work presents a novel V-information-based metric to quantify feature complexity, analyzing features extracted from a ResNet50 model trained on ImageNet. The study investigates the relationship between feature complexity, their learning timing, location within the network, and their importance in driving model predictions.  It finds that simpler features are learned early and tend to use residual connections, while more complex features emerge later but are less influential in decision-making.  Importantly, the model simplifies its most important features over time.  This research provides crucial insights into feature learning dynamics and challenges assumptions about the role of complex features in model performance.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "NhqZpst42I/podcast.wav"}
