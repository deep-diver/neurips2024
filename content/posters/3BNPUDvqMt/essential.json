{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in machine learning and data science due to its focus on **improving the performance of both deep learning models and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) on tabular data** without extensive hyperparameter tuning.  It provides **well-tuned default parameters** that save significant time and effort, thereby enhancing the usability of these models for a wider range of applications and practitioners.", "summary": "Strong pre-tuned MLPs and meta-tuned default parameters for GBDTs and MLPs improve tabular data classification and regression.", "takeaways": ["RealMLP, an improved multilayer perceptron (MLP), offers a favorable time-accuracy tradeoff compared to other neural networks and is competitive with GBDTs.", "Strong meta-tuned default parameters for both GBDTs and RealMLP are introduced, achieving excellent results without hyperparameter tuning.", "The combination of RealMLP and GBDTs with improved default parameters achieves excellent results without hyperparameter tuning."], "tldr": "The dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for classification and regression on tabular data is challenged by deep learning methods, often hampered by slow training and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This research introduces RealMLP, an enhanced MLP, and provides well-tuned default parameters for both RealMLP and GBDTs.  This addresses the discrepancy between deep learning and traditional methods in terms of speed and ease of use.\nThe proposed RealMLP model, along with the new default parameters, demonstrates favorable time-accuracy tradeoffs.  The meta-tuned parameters show that RealMLP and GBDTs,  can achieve excellent results without any hyperparameter optimization, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and time for practitioners and researchers.  The improved default parameters also enhance the performance of existing TabR models.", "affiliation": "Inria Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3BNPUDvqMt/podcast.wav"}
