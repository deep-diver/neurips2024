### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging aims to reconstruct hidden scenes using light reflected from an intermediary surface. Current methods often require dense, regularly sampled data from this surface, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with complex surfaces. This constraint is addressed in this paper. 

The paper introduces a novel unsupervised learning-based framework that leverages irregularly undersampled transients.  **It employs a virtual scanning process to address the inherent ambiguity in reconstructing the albedo volume and uses a SURE-based denoiser for robustness to noise.** This method significantly improves reconstruction quality and speed while greatly reducing the need for large, precisely-aligned datasets.  Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate its superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing techniques.

> The figure illustrates an active confocal NLOS (non-line-of-sight) imaging system with an irregular relay surface.  A laser and detector are focused on a relay surface, pulses emitted by the laser reflect off the surface to illuminate a hidden scene. The detector captures photons bouncing back from the scene towards the relay surface, as transients.  The yellow points on the relay surface indicate scannable points used to collect the transient data. Blue points indicate unscannable areas on the irregular surface.  An example of undersampled transient data is also displayed (left).

> This table compares the inference time of different NLOS reconstruction methods (LCT, FK, RSD, NeTF, USM, CC-SOCR, and the proposed method) using both CPU and GPU.  The inference time is averaged across 16 irregularly undersampled transients (IUT) with a size of 128x128x256.

### In-depth insights


#### NLOS Imaging IUT
NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight) imaging aims to reconstruct hidden scenes by using indirect measurements.  The IUT (Irregularly Undersampled Transients) approach presents a significant challenge to traditional NLOS methods, which typically assume dense and regularly sampled data. **IUT leads to significant ill-posedness**, making accurate reconstruction difficult.  This necessitates novel techniques that can handle incomplete and irregularly distributed data, which is a major advance in the field.  Existing supervised learning-based solutions require substantial paired datasets of ground truth and measurements, which are expensive and difficult to obtain.  **Unsupervised learning offers a compelling alternative**, as it can learn implicit priors directly from the data without the need for explicit ground truth.  However, unsupervised methods face ambiguity in inferring albedo volumes.  **Advanced techniques like virtual scanning are needed to overcome such ambiguity and improve reconstruction quality.**  Overall, IUT is a crucial and challenging area in NLOS imaging, requiring innovative methodologies, especially in the context of unsupervised learning.

#### Virtual Scan Method
The core idea behind the virtual scan method is to **mitigate the limitations of traditional NLOS imaging**, which often requires dense and regular scans across a large relay surface.  This method cleverly addresses the challenges of irregularly undersampled transients (IUT) by **virtually simulating scans** on a complete relay surface, even when only sparse real measurements are available. This virtual process leverages a neural network trained on complete data, allowing the network to learn both range and null space components, which are crucial for high-quality reconstruction in NLOS imaging. In essence, the virtual scan method **acts as a powerful regularization technique** to overcome ill-posedness and ensure accurate albedo reconstruction from limited measurements. It is a significant step towards more robust and practical NLOS imaging in real-world settings, enabling applications where acquiring dense data is difficult or impossible.

#### SURE Denoising
The SURE (Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator) denoising technique offers a powerful approach to noise reduction in low-light imaging scenarios, particularly valuable in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging where photon counts are often limited.  **It leverages a data-driven approach, learning implicit priors from the noisy data itself without requiring paired clean/noisy data**, a significant advantage when such pairs are difficult to acquire. By minimizing the SURE loss function, the denoiser enhances the robustness of the NLOS reconstruction process.  **Crucially, SURE denoising incorporates a physics-guided component**, modeling the low-photon time-resolved detector's characteristics, resulting in improved noise reduction in the presence of Poisson noise and dark counts commonly found in such systems. This results in cleaner, higher fidelity reconstructions, improving the overall quality of the NLOS image and reducing artifacts resulting from noise.

#### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning in the context of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses the challenge of reconstructing hidden scenes from limited and noisy data without relying on paired training data.  **This is crucial because obtaining perfectly aligned ground truth albedo volumes for training is often difficult and expensive.**  The approach leverages the inherent structure in the NLOS measurement process to learn implicit priors. By training on irregularly undersampled transients, the model learns to reconstruct 3D albedo volumes using a virtual scanning technique, effectively learning from both range and null spaces.  **This allows for reconstruction of high-quality images even with incomplete data, while addressing the limitations of supervised methods reliant on large paired datasets.** This unsupervised technique demonstrates impressive robustness and generalizability across various relay surfaces and real-world scenarios.  **The incorporation of a physics-guided denoiser further enhances robustness to noise common in low-photon imaging.** Overall, the approach offers a promising avenue for more practical and scalable NLOS imaging systems by drastically reducing the dependence on painstaking data acquisition and annotation.

#### Future NLOS Research
Future research in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging should prioritize addressing the limitations of current techniques.  **Improving robustness to noise and variations in real-world environments** is crucial, particularly in low-light conditions.  This could involve developing more sophisticated denoising algorithms or exploring alternative sensing modalities.  **Addressing the computational cost** of existing methods is also critical for practical applications.  This might be accomplished by developing faster inference algorithms or leveraging more efficient hardware.  **Extending NLOS imaging to more complex scenarios**, such as imaging through scattering media or dynamic environments, is another significant area for future work.  Furthermore, the development of **unsupervised or weakly-supervised learning approaches** would significantly reduce the reliance on large, labeled datasets which are currently difficult and expensive to obtain.  Finally, exploring new applications and **integrating NLOS imaging with other sensing modalities** (such as LiDAR or radar) could open up many new opportunities and capabilities.
