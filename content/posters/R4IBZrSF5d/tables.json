The inference time is averaged across 16 irregularly undersampled transients (IUT) with a size of 128x128x256.  The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly faster inference time compared to other methods, particularly CC-SOCR which requires significantly longer time.", "section": "5.3 Inference time"}, {"figure_path": "R4IBZrSF5d/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Effect of the hyperparameters \u025b on the denoising performance in terms of PSNR (mean value and variance).", "description": "This table shows the results of an ablation study on the hyperparameter epsilon (\u025b) used in the SURE-based denoiser.

The performance metric used is the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), calculated as the average and standard deviation across multiple trials. The table shows that using a wider range of intervals ([4, 8, 12, 16, 20]) during training leads to better reconstruction performance (higher average PSNR) compared to using smaller or fewer intervals.", "section": "5.4 Ablation study"}, {"figure_path": "R4IBZrSF5d/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 6: Effect of the rotations of relay surfaces for training on the reconstruction performance in terms of PSNR (mean value and variance).", "description": "This table shows the results of an ablation study on the impact of the number of rotations of relay surfaces during training on the reconstruction performance, measured by PSNR.
