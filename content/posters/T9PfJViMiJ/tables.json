The comparison is based on three metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for derivative prediction, Valid Prediction Time (VPT) indicating the duration of accurate trajectory prediction, and Mean Negative Log Likelihood (MNLL) representing prediction uncertainty.  The results are averaged over multiple independent experiments, showcasing the robustness and superior performance of the proposed models.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "T9PfJViMiJ/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of our models to baselines.
