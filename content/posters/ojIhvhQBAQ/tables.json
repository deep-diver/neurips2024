It compares the time complexity of TDS learning algorithms for two concept classes: degree-2 polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) and constant-depth circuits, highlighting exponential improvements compared to prior work which utilized L2 sandwiching.  The table shows that the L1 sandwiching approach provides more efficient TDS learners, particularly for constant-depth circuits, where it achieves exponential improvements over previous methods.", "section": "Classes with Low Sandwiching Degree"}, {"figure_path": "ojIhvhQBAQ/tables/tables_30_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: New results for TDS learning through L\u2081 sandwiching.

It shows significant improvements in runtime compared to previous work that used L2 sandwiching, particularly for constant-depth circuits.  The table compares the training time and prior work for degree-2 polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) and circuits of size 's' and depth 't'. Noteworthy is that the exponential runtime improvement for constant-depth circuits and the first TDS learning results for degree-2 PTFs are highlighted.", "section": "Classes with Low Sandwiching Degree"}]
