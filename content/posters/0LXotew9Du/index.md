### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications needing long context windows, but this leads to a major memory bottleneck in inference due to the size of KV cache activations.  Existing quantization methods struggle to compress these activations accurately at low precision. 



KVQuant tackles this problem by introducing several novel methods: **per-channel key quantization** to better match data distribution, **pre-RoPE key quantization** to mitigate the impact of rotary positional embeddings, **non-uniform KV cache quantization** for improved accuracy, and **per-vector dense-and-sparse quantization** for handling outliers.  Experimental results using various LLMs and datasets demonstrate significant perplexity improvements with 3-bit quantization, outperforming previous methods and enabling substantially longer context lengths with significant memory savings and speedups.

### In-depth insights


#### KV Cache Quantization
The core of this research paper revolves around **efficiently handling the memory bottleneck** imposed by large language models (LLMs) during inference.  This bottleneck primarily stems from the KV cache's significant memory footprint when dealing with long context lengths. The proposed solution, KV cache quantization, tackles this problem by **compressing the KV cache activations**, thereby substantially reducing memory consumption.  The method goes beyond existing quantization techniques by incorporating several innovative strategies: **per-channel key quantization**, **pre-RoPE key quantization**, and **non-uniform quantization**.  These approaches, combined with a novel per-vector dense-and-sparse quantization strategy, achieve **significant accuracy improvements with 3-bit quantization**, outperforming existing methods.  The integration of custom CUDA kernels further enhances the computational efficiency, resulting in **speedups compared to the baseline fp16 implementation.**  This combined approach facilitates substantial reductions in memory usage, enabling the inference of extremely long context lengths (up to 10 million tokens) on relatively modest GPU setups.

#### Per-Channel Quantization
Per-channel quantization, a technique explored in the context of Key-Value cache compression for LLMs, offers a compelling approach to improve efficiency and accuracy.  Instead of applying the same quantization parameters across all tokens within a Key matrix, this method **adapts the quantization per channel**. This is particularly beneficial because channels within the Key matrix exhibit varied distributions, with some showing a greater presence of outliers than others.  **By independently quantizing each channel**, the method effectively mitigates the distorting effect these outliers have on the overall quantization, leading to improved precision and accuracy.  The key insight is recognizing the inherent heterogeneity of the data within the Key matrix, and **tailoring the quantization process to better fit each channel's unique statistical properties**.  While this granularity adds complexity, experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing techniques when integrated into a larger quantization pipeline, suggesting that per-channel quantization can offer a significant advantage for large language model inference.

#### Non-uniform Quantization
Non-uniform quantization is a crucial technique for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of large language model (LLM) inference, especially when dealing with the inherent non-uniformity of key and value activations in the KV cache. Unlike uniform quantization, which assigns equal intervals to all values, **non-uniform quantization dynamically adjusts quantization steps based on the data distribution**. This allows for finer granularity in representing frequent values while tolerating some loss in infrequent, extreme values, resulting in better accuracy for a given bit-width.  The paper explores the benefits of non-uniform quantization techniques by carefully considering the dynamic range and distribution of KV cache activations. They demonstrate how sensitivity-weighted non-uniform quantization, determined offline using calibration data and techniques like k-means clustering, significantly improves performance compared to both uniform and other non-uniform quantization methods.  **Offline calibration is key** here because it avoids expensive online computations during inference, balancing accuracy and speed.  Moreover, by combining non-uniform quantization with per-vector dense-and-sparse quantization, the method further refines accuracy and memory efficiency. The **per-vector approach addresses outlier values** in specific channels or tokens, leading to more effective quantization ranges. Overall, the exploration of non-uniform quantization in this paper is highly insightful, demonstrating its potential for optimizing LLM inference while maintaining model accuracy.

#### Long-Context Inference
Long-context inference in LLMs presents significant challenges due to the quadratic increase in computational and memory costs with sequence length.  **Existing methods struggle to maintain accuracy at lower bit precisions**, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper tackles this problem through **KV cache quantization**, focusing on the Key and Value activations which dominate memory consumption during inference.  The approach employs a multi-pronged strategy: **per-channel Key quantization** to better manage channel-wise outlier distributions; **Pre-RoPE Key quantization** to minimize the impact of rotary positional embeddings on quantization; **non-uniform quantization** to optimally allocate bits; and **per-vector dense-and-sparse quantization** to efficiently handle outliers.  **Custom CUDA kernels** further enhance speed. The result is remarkably high-accuracy quantization, enabling inference with vastly increased context windows, showcasing the efficacy of this tailored approach for addressing memory limitations inherent to long-context LLMs.  The improved efficiency allows for **scaling up context length to millions of tokens**.

#### Future Work
The authors outline several avenues for future research.  **Improving the efficiency of online scaling factor and outlier threshold computations** is a key priority, potentially leveraging more sophisticated techniques than the k-means approach. **Extending the approach to other LLM architectures and tasks** beyond those tested is crucial to validate the generalizability of their findings.  Addressing limitations in memory allocation during the sparse matrix updates is another important goal; they suggest **exploring blocked allocation** to mitigate overhead. Lastly, they acknowledge the need for more extensive research into training long-context length LLMs, as this is currently a separate research challenge, to truly optimize the potential of their method.

The key observation is the different outlier patterns in Keys: before RoPE, distinct outliers are present in specific channels; after RoPE, this pattern is less structured.  Values, however, show no consistent outlier pattern across channels and tokens. This analysis is crucial to the paper's approach of quantizing Keys before RoPE to improve accuracy in low-precision quantization.

> <details>
> <summary>read the caption</summary>
> Figure 5: One typically achieves better performance when the scaling factor/zero point are computed online. However, this is quite challenging to do for per-channel quantization, as these factors will not only need to be recomputed for every new Key appended to the Key cache, but also all the prior cached Keys will need to be updated. As such, we use a calibration set to compute per-channel scaling factors offline. A similar challenge exists for per-token quantization, but online calibration for this does not require updating prior cached Values. In Section 3.6 and Appendix L, we discuss how we are able to efficiently compute outlier thresholds / scaling factors for per-token calibration, thereby enabling online computation.

> 🔼 This table presents a comparison of the proposed KVQuant method against various baseline and state-of-the-art quantization techniques on the Wikitext-2 dataset.  The comparison is performed across multiple LLMs (LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral) and various bit precisions (4-bit, 3-bit, 2-bit).  The table shows perplexity scores and estimated KV cache sizes for each model and method, demonstrating the performance and memory efficiency gains of KVQuant.

> Table 1: Evaluation of our method for different models using the perplexity (PPL) on Wikitext-2. KVQuant results are using pre-RoPE per-channel quantization for Keys. KV cache sizes are estimated assuming a sequence length of 128K (ignoring context length limits for the models). Note that ATOM and FlexGen use 4-bit quantization with group sizes of 128 and 64 with uniform quantization, respectively, and we extend their methods to 3-bit and 2-bit quantization. We leverage Attention Sink-Aware quantization for all bit widths. We used post-RoPE quantization for all baseline methods since it achieves higher accuracy when quantizing Keys per-token as shown in Appendix P. Table 18 in Appendix O demonstrates a full evaluation on all LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models.

> 🔼 This table presents a comparison of the proposed KVQuant method against various baseline and state-of-the-art quantization techniques (intX, nfX, ATOM, FlexGen) for different LLMs (LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA-30B, LLaMA-65B).  The evaluation is performed on the Wikitext-2 dataset using perplexity (PPL) as the metric.  The table shows perplexity results for 4-bit, 3-bit, and 2-bit quantization methods. It highlights the achieved perplexity with and without 1% outlier removal and the estimated size of the KV cache in gigabytes (GB).  The context length is fixed at 128k tokens for all models.  Pre-RoPE quantization is used for Keys in KVQuant, with post-RoPE used for the baseline.  Attention Sink-Aware Quantization is used across all methods and bit widths.  The table indicates significant improvements for KVQuant particularly at lower bit precisions.

> 🔼 This table compares the perplexity results of using pre-RoPE and post-RoPE quantization for Key with per-token quantization for LLaMA-7B model at different bit-widths (4-bit and 3-bit).  The results show that when using per-token quantization, post-RoPE quantization gives better results than pre-RoPE quantization. This is attributed to the fact that when rotating an outlier channel with another channel using RoPE, at some positions in the sequence, the impact of the outlier channel on the quantization range is reduced due to the magnitude from outlier channel being partially shifted to the smaller channel. Therefore, post-RoPE per-token Key quantization is chosen as a stronger baseline for comparison.

Our experiments demonstrate that post-RoPE quantization is superior when using per-token Key quantization. Therefore, we decided to use these results for baseline comparison with per-token quantization.

> 🔼 This table presents the perplexity scores achieved by different quantization methods (4-bit, 3-bit, and 2-bit with 1% sparsity) on two datasets: Wikitext-2 and C4.  It demonstrates the robustness of the calibration process by showing that models calibrated on one dataset (Wikitext-2) perform similarly well when evaluated on the other dataset (C4), and vice-versa.  This highlights the generalizability of the calibration and quantization methods.
