Forecasting and data assimilation are crucial tasks, but existing numerical and machine learning methods often fall short, particularly when integrating sparse observations.  This necessitates more robust and accurate models, capable of handling both prediction and assimilation. Diffusion models, known for their conditional generation capabilities, show promise for overcoming these challenges.\nThis research enhances score-based diffusion models to better suit forecasting and assimilation.  **Three key innovations** are introduced: 1) an autoregressive sampling method that drastically improves forecasting accuracy; 2) a novel training technique resulting in more robust and stable performance over different history lengths; and 3) a hybrid model that combines pre-training on initial conditions with post-training conditioning, making it highly flexible in handling various data assimilation scenarios.  Empirical evaluations show that these improvements are crucial for tackling combined forecasting and data assimilation, common in real-world applications.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "nQl8EjyMzh/podcast.wav"}
