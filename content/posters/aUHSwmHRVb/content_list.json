The key idea is that a neural network trained for motion-free reconstruction has a small loss if there is no motion, thus optimizing over motion parameters passed through the reconstruction network enables accurate estimation of motion. The estimated motion parameters enable to correct for the motion and to reconstruct accurate motion-corrected images. Our method uses 2D reconstruction networks to estimate rigid motion in 3D, and constitutes the first deep learning based method for 3D rigid motion estimation towards 3D-motion-corrected MRI.

Figure 4 shows that for no motion, U-net based reconstruction (KnownMotion-U-net-DCLayer) outperforms L1-based reconstruction (KnownMotion- $.L I$ ), as expected, but for larger levels of motion severity L1-based reconstruction performs slightly better. A likely reason for this is a distribution shift, which is known to result in worse performance [8]: Acquiring MRI measurements under motion typically leads to some parts of the $\\mathbf{k}$ -space being sampled more than once, while parts that would be sampled if there were no motion are not sampled. This results in a change of effective undersampling mask and a motion-specific increase of the effective undersampling factor, which suggests why the reconstruction quality decays for all methods with increasing levels of motion even if motion parameters are known. This problem, illustrated in Figure 2, is well known [45, 12]. However, L1-based reconstruction is not as sensitive to changes in the mask as the U-net based reconstruction, which is trained with a fixed mask.
