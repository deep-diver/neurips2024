Correcting for this motion is crucial but challenging, particularly in 3D MRI where existing methods are slow and often inaccurate.  Current approaches often rely on simulated motion data for training, which limits their generalizability.  Deep learning methods offer speed improvements but most focus only on 2D in-plane motion correction. \nMotionTTT addresses these issues with a novel test-time training (TTT) method.  It uses a 2D reconstruction network trained on motion-free data, cleverly leveraging the network's properties to estimate motion parameters directly from the motion-corrupted 3D data.  The estimated parameters enable accurate motion correction. The method proves effective for both simulated and real motion-corrupted data, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed, particularly in cases of severe motion.  It's the first deep learning-based method for 3D rigid motion estimation tailored to MRI.", "affiliation": "Technical University of Munich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "aUHSwmHRVb/podcast.wav"}
