The comparison is based on three metrics: Chamfer Distance (CD), Volume Intersection over Union (IoU), and F-Score. Lower CD values indicate better geometry alignment, while higher IoU and F-Score values suggest improved reconstruction quality. The results demonstrate that LAM3D achieves superior performance compared to the baselines across all three metrics, showcasing its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity 3D meshes from single images.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "7s53dAJlwz/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparisons of different representations.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the Chamfer Distance (CD) achieved by different latent space representations for 3D reconstruction.  It shows that using a latent tri-plane representation with a latent SDF loss significantly improves the reconstruction quality compared to using a simple vector or a tri-plane without the SDF loss. The results highlight the importance of using a 3D-aware latent representation in achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "7s53dAJlwz/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative comparison between parallel diffusion UNet and single UNet.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the Chamfer Distance (CD) metric between two different approaches for image-point-cloud alignment: using a single diffusion U-Net and using three parallel diffusion U-Nets.
