The left plot shows that with a fixed number of samples per task (n=10), the error decreases as the number of tasks increases. The middle plot shows the error decreasing as the number of samples increases while fixing the number of tasks (m=1000). The rightmost plot shows that when the number of tasks and samples increase proportionally, the error decreases.  Overall, the figure visually supports the authors' theoretical findings on generalization performance.", "section": "A Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "J8rOw29df2/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Error plots as a function of: (left) the number of tasks m for fixed n = 10; (middle) the number of training samples n on a test task for fixed m = 1K; (right) both m and n.", "description": "This figure displays the empirical results of the meta-learning algorithm on a synthetic sine wave regression task. The plots show how the empirical multi-task risk, the transfer risk, and the generalization gap change with different numbers of tasks (m) and training samples (n). The left plot fixes the number of samples (n) and varies the number of tasks (m). The middle plot fixes the number of tasks (m) and varies the number of samples (n). The right plot scales both the number of tasks and samples simultaneously.  The dotted lines represent the theoretical generalization bounds derived in the paper. The results show that the generalization gap decreases with increasing m and/or n, and matches the theoretical bounds.", "section": "A Experiments"}]
