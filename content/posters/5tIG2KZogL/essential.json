Traditional methods like Nadaraya-Watson (NW) regression and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) have O(n) and O(n\u00b3) time complexities respectively, where n is the number of data points.  These complexities hinder their applicability to large datasets. \nThis work introduces the Supervised Kernel Thinning (KT) algorithm to address this issue.  KT cleverly compresses data to create smaller, representative subsets (coresets) while preserving essential information for accurate regression. By integrating KT with NW and KRR, the authors achieve significant speed-ups, reducing the time complexities to O(n log\u00b3 n) for training and O(\u221an) for inference in NW regression, and O(n\u00b3/2) training time and O(\u221an) inference time for KRR.  The effectiveness of KT-based estimators is validated on both simulated and real-world datasets.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "5tIG2KZogL/podcast.wav"}
