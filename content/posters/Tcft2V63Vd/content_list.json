Despite the research on over-parameterization [24, 23] and empirical evidence [37, 15, 31, 41] showing that the wider network leads to better performance, there are few works about how we allocate the computational resources across the layers. On understanding the layer width requirement in a deep neural network, [20] theoretically proves the lower bound of layer width for the model to approximate any Lebesgue-integrable function while [4] improves the width lower bound with dynamic systems.

A simple observation is that largerweight channels would have a larger gradient.

It motivates us to investigate the weight norm variance across the channels in each layer during training.

As we change the layer width, we show that narrow layers show a decrease until the saturate (DS) pattern, such that the weight norm variance first increases and then decreases. For wider layers, the weight norm variance keeps increasing until saturate (IS). We conjecture that, for sufficiently wide (or over-parameterized) layers, channels with a small weight norm would always be surpassed by similar channels with larger weights, and therefore, the variance keeps increasing until convergence.

In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics from the weight norm variance perspective and show that the training of neural networks could be summarized into three stages in general.

Generally, we find that the first several layers follow the IS pattern while the layers in the middle follow the DS pattern, and the layers at last follow the IS pattern again. It reflects the intrinsic nature of the neural network training such that layers in the middle learn orthogonal neurons. One may naturally associate this phenomenon with the results that intrinsic dimension firstly increases then decreases and reaches a high point in the middle [2]. Intrinsic dimension describes the minimum dimension needed to solve a certain problem to a certain precision level. We conjecture that intrinsic dimension is a possible explanation for the two different kinds of layers where high intrinsic dimension leads to orthogonal weights. For more results, please refer to Appendix A. It further indicates that the conventional layer width setting for CNNs might not be optimal. In the conventional setting (such as in VGGs and ResNets) the layer width increases through the first several layers and then stays large through the following layers. Since the layers in the middle could use more width and the layers in the front and back could use less width, a better setting might be that the width first increase and then decrease across the layers with the widest layer in the middle just like a streamline.

We provide our explanations of the three stages with corresponding empirical evidence (Sec. 4). Using the identified pattern as an indicator, in Sec. 5, we propose to adjust the conventional layer width setting of VGG and ResNet to reduce the number of parameters and boost the performance. The main limitation of the width adjustment is that we manually adjust the layer width to control the FLOPs of the adjusted model. Another limitation is that we can not determine which pattern (IS or DS) the layer follows until convergence. A more automatic and efficient width adjustment method could be proposed regarding the new weight norm variance perspective, which we leave for future works. In assessing the potential broader impact, this work provides a new perspective to evaluate the layer width setting of deep neural networks, which have the potential to advance the neural network architecture design.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
