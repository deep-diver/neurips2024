The time complexity is expressed in Big O notation as a function of the number of nodes (n), number of edges (m), dimension of attributes (f), and dimension of hidden layers (d). The table shows that GOUDA has a lower time complexity than the other three models, making it more efficient for large graphs.", "section": "3.5 Complexity Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "jgkKroLxeC/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Accuracy in percentage (mean\u00b1std) over ten trials of node classification across seven graphs.
