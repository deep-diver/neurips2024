It shows four types of augmentations (node, edge, attribute, and subgraph) applied to a sample graph from both spatial and message-passing perspectives. The spatial perspective highlights the global changes to the graph structure, while the message-passing perspective reveals the localized effect of these augmentations on node attributes.  The key takeaway is that despite their apparent differences in the spatial domain, these augmentations all produce local attribute modifications when viewed from the message-passing perspective. This insight is crucial for developing a unified approach to GA in GCLs.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "jgkKroLxeC/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of the proposed unified module UGA and generalized framework GOUDA.
