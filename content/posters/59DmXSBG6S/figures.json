It shows how the DND's operation can be decomposed into three key steps, which are common to many associative memory models. First, the input query (\"q\") is compared to a set of stored keys (\"K\") using a similarity function, which calculates the distance between the query and each key. Then, the separation function selects a subset of the keys based on their similarity to the query (using k-nearest neighbors), effectively filtering out less relevant information. Finally, the selected information is projected into the output space (\"z\") using a projection matrix (\"V\"), yielding the final retrieved result. This figure highlights the mathematical connection between DND and UHN, demonstrating that DND can be viewed as a specific instance of a broader class of associative memory models.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "59DmXSBG6S/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Example reconstructions of noisy MNIST digits by DND.
