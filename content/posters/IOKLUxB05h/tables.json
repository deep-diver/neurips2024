It compares the performance of the proposed LE-SINR model against several baselines, including a constant prediction and model mean.  The LE-SINR model is tested with and without environmental features and with and without access to training data for the evaluation species.  The results show that the LE-SINR method significantly outperforms the baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of zero-shot range estimation using textual descriptions.  Additionally, using text from both habitat and range descriptions leads to improved performance.", "section": "4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "IOKLUxB05h/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: LE-SINR Ablations.

It investigates the effects of using different types of species descriptions (range, habitat, vs. taxonomy from LD-SDM), different location encoders (Spherical Harmonics, GeoCLIP), and different loss functions (SatCLIP vs. the authors' method). The results show the relative contribution of each design choice to the overall performance of the LE-SINR model in a zero-shot range estimation setting.
