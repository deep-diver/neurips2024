The accuracy is shown for different values of epsilon (\u03b5), representing the privacy level, for both the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.  Higher accuracy values indicate better model performance, while higher epsilon values represent a weaker privacy guarantee. The data in this table is used for comparison with results obtained using worst-case initial parameters.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "cCDMXXiamP/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Accuracy of models for average-case initial model parameters (\u03b80).", "description": "This table shows the accuracy achieved by models using average-case initial model parameters (\u03b80) for different privacy levels (\u03b5) on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.  The accuracy represents the percentage of correctly classified images in the test set.  The table highlights the trade-off between privacy and accuracy, showing that higher privacy levels (lower \u03b5) generally lead to lower accuracy.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
