These GNNs generate embeddings representing each patient from two different perspectives.\n3.  **Cross-view Contrastive Knowledge Distillation:** This component integrates knowledge from the two separate GNNs.  It leverages information from the biological view to improve the accuracy of the phenotype imputation using a contrastive knowledge distillation strategy.", "section": "4 The Proposed Method"}]
