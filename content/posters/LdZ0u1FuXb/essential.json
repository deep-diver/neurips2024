This paper focuses on distillation-based collaborative learning (DCL), a promising alternative that leverages publicly available unlabeled data for model training without direct data or model exchange.  However, existing DCL algorithms are unsatisfactory and lack theoretical backing. \nThis research rigorously analyzes a DCL algorithm (FedMD) using a non-parametric approach.  They prove its near-minimax optimality for massively distributed heterogeneous data, a significant theoretical breakthrough.  Inspired by these results, a practical DCL algorithm for neural networks (DCL-NN) is introduced, addressing heterogeneous architectures via feature kernel matching.  Extensive experiments showcase DCL-NN\u2019s improved performance over existing methods, demonstrating its value for practical application.", "affiliation": "Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LdZ0u1FuXb/podcast.wav"}
