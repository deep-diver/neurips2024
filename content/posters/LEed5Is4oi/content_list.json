Some recent work investigates how to learn robot policies from only a single/few expert video demonstrations. For example, reward labeling via Optimal Transport (OT) has been shown to be an effective strategy to generate a proxy reward by measuring the alignment between the robot trajectory and the expert demonstrations. However, previous work mostly overlooks that the OT reward is invariant to temporal order information, which could bring extra noise to the reward signal. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the Temporal Optimal Transport (TemporalOT) reward to incorporate temporal order information for learning a more accurate OT-based proxy reward.

A large body of work has been developed to address this issue from different aspects [52], i.e., using curiosity-based intrinsic reward to encourage exploration [2, 47], leveraging better representation pretrained on large scale robotics datasets [33, 38], incorporating external knowledge from the Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [13, 32], and imitating the behaviors from pre-collected expert demonstrations [50, 62].

A well-designed reward function can guide the agent towards desirable behaviors more efficiently, while a poorly designed one could lead to sub-optimal behaviors [25]. However, designing a good reward function is a nontrivial task [11], which requires related expert domain knowledge and (or) time-consuming hand reward engineering [48].

Unlike the original ADS experiments which use a fixed goal in each task, we adopt a more challenging setting where the goal position changes for each episode. Moreover, we only provide two expert video demonstrations to the RL agent. For the experiment results, we evaluate the RL agent for 100 trajectories every 20000 steps. We report the mean and standard deviation of the evaluation success rate across 5 random seeds. We define one trajectory to be successful if the RL agent solves the task at the last step.

Experiment results are shown in Table 1. We can observe that TemporalOT generally outperforms the other baselines without using the task rewards. Moreover, the TaskReward baseline only shows good performance on the Door-lock and Window-open tasks. The main reason is that the RL agent fails to collect the first successful trajectory. For example, the goal of the Basketball task as shown in Figure 1 is to pick up the basketball and move to a target position above the rim. With the oracle sparse task reward, the RL agent only receives a nonzero reward until it first successfully solves the task. Under such circumstances, it is particularly challenging to collect the first successful trajectory with only zero task rewards and random action explorations. On the other hand, we can observe that the two IL baselines, BC and GAIfO [53], perform much worse than other OT-reward based baselines. This is because we only provide two expert video demonstrations with a few hundred samples, where the IL-based methods suffer from an over-ftiting issue. We further compare two OT agent baselines, where $\\mathrm{OT0.99}$ uses $\\gamma=0.99$ , and $\\mathrm{OT0.9}$ uses $\\gamma=0.9$ . We have a similar conclusion as in ADS that using a smaller discount factor is helpful to learn early behaviors in some tasks that strongly rely on the progress dependency, i.e., Basketball.

However, the amount of demonstrations required for a high-quality pre-training is typically large.

Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) [30] uses a similar OT-based approach for reward calculation.

Moreover, the performance of the proposed method relies on the quality of the pretrained visual encoder. If the pretrained visual encoder fails to capture some key information in the pixel observation, then our method will also fail to take such key details into consideration.

We generate an N times faster expert demonstration by sampling the original expert trajectory every N steps. Table 3 shows the results of using expert demo with different speed. We can observe that as the discrepancy between the expert-agent movement speed increases, the final success rate decreases. Using a double speed demonstration in the Basketball task and Door-open task achieves a slightly worse performance than the original demonstration. However, using a three times faster or four times faster expert demonstration performs quite badly. This is because a faster expert trajectory corresponds to a shorter sequence of demonstration frames, where it is more likely that the important information is dropped.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
