Molecular graphs serve as a natural and expressive representation of molecules, effectively capturing the structural information. Graph neural networks [19, 20, 21, 22] are commonly utilized architectures for molecular graph representations. To learn graph neural networks with the limited molecular graph data [23], self-supervised learning has been explored. For example, various approaches [24, 25] have been developed to capture multi-level features of molecular graphs, such as node-level masked atom modeling [24], motif-based self-supervised learning [25, 26], and graph-level contrastive learning [27, 28]. With the advance of multi-modal large language models, molecule-language tasks such as molecule-text retrieval [8] or molecule captioning [29] have recently drawn significant attention. Recent works [3, 4, 30] have attempted to enable language models to understand molecular graphs. [30] treated nodes of molecular graphs as tokens of language models. Some works have adopted GNN-based encoders, either by propagating their outputs to language models through MLP [4] or employing cross-modal projectors [3]. However, these methods fail to consider molecular graphs at multiple levels and are hindered by inherent limitations of graph encoders, such as the over-smoothing problem [31].

Consequently, previous studies [2, 3] have adopted the task of predicting IUPAC names from SMILES representations to evaluate the chemical understanding capability of molecular language models. We also follow this approach in our research. To assess the performance of LLaMo and baseline models, we use the PubChem324k dataset [3] again. The test split of PubChem324k offers curated high-quality samples of 2,000 molecules, each with corresponding SMILES representations and IUPAC names.

In chemical and biological domains, particularly in drug discovery, exploring chemical compounds that satisfy specific chemical properties is crucial. Therefore, the ability to estimate the chemical and physical properties is essential for chemical foundation models. Additionally, leveraging machine learning-based approaches for predicting molecular properties has proven to be much more efficient than traditional approaches in computational chemistry. Inspired by these facts, property prediction with LLMs has recently drawn attention from researchers [2, 69, 70, 71]. So, we also assess the property QA performance of LLaMo and baselines using the dataset introduced by [48]. This dataset is a subset of QM9 dataset from MoleculeNet [64], a widely used benchmark for various chemistry machine learning tasks. The original QM9 dataset contains numerical values for 19 chemical properties per molecule, but [48] focuses on three properties related to molecular orbital energy: HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy, LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy, and the HOMO-LUMO gap (in Hartree units). [48] also created distinct question-form instructions for each property to make language models understand the task and accurately generate continuous values. Consequently, using the given instruction for each molecule in the 2,000 test samples and its SMILES representation as input, we have LLaMo and baseline generalist models predict the properties of the given molecules.

Understanding chemical reactions is crucial for advancing various chemical and biological fields, including pharmaceuticals, materials science, and environmental technology. This understanding enables researchers to design efficient synthesis pathways and develop new chemical compounds. Therefore, if a molecular model can effectively comprehend these chemical reactions, it can serve as a powerful assistant in the research and development process. This concept has emerged through the task of forward reaction prediction, and several prior models [48, 54] have conducted experiments to address this task. This task focuses on the proactive determination of potential products resulting from a chemical reaction based on given reactants and reagents. This approach is also significant from the perspectives of efficiency and environmental sustainability, as it reduces the need for experimental trial and error in chemical development and research by using these models to virtually conduct simulated experiments. We utilize the forward reaction prediction segment of Mol-Instructions [48], based on the USPTO [74] database, to assess the performance of LLaMo and other models.

This is particularly important in various chemical applications, such as drug discovery, where identifying chemically valid and economical processes for synthesizing target drug molecules is essential. As a result, several previous studies [48, 54] have adopted this task to analyze the capability to deeply understand chemical knowledge and take advantage of this knowledge to specify the chemical reactants of a given product.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
