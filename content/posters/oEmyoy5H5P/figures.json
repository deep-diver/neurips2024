It starts with the initial search across three databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and SCOPUS), resulting in 3092 records. After removing duplicates and irrelevant records, a snowballing method was employed to expand the search. The diagram visually details each stage of the process, including the number of records at each step and the reasons for exclusion, ultimately leading to 127 publications included in the review. This methodology ensures the reproducibility of the literature review process.", "section": "3 Methods"}]
