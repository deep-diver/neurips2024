{"importance": "This paper is crucial because it **highlights the disconnect between current algorithmic recourse (AR) research and real-world application needs.** By systematically reviewing the literature and identifying practical challenges, it provides valuable recommendations to make AR research more impactful.  This is relevant given the increasing use of AI in high-stakes domains. It **opens new avenues for research** in more realistic socio-technical contexts.", "summary": "Algorithmic recourse research lacks real-world grounding; this review reveals the gap and proposes recommendations for more practical, impactful AR.", "takeaways": ["Current algorithmic recourse research is largely theoretical and lacks practical grounding.", "Real-world AR implementation involves various stakeholders and complex socio-technical factors.", "Recommendations are provided to bridge the gap between theory and practice in AR research."], "tldr": "Many algorithmic decision-making systems lack transparency, potentially harming individuals. Algorithmic recourse (AR) aims to address this by providing actionable recommendations to those affected, enabling them to improve outcomes.  However, existing AR research primarily focuses on theoretical frameworks rather than practical applications.  This paper addresses this gap.\nThis paper systematically reviews 127 AR publications, identifying real-world considerations and highlighting a significant disconnect between existing research and practical needs. It examines various aspects such as actionability, stakeholder involvement, and the availability of practitioner-friendly tools.  The authors also offer recommendations to improve future AR research, emphasizing the importance of real-world grounding and validation.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "oEmyoy5H5P/podcast.wav"}
