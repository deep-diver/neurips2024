Existing methods often require additional training data or significant computational resources.  **Fine-tuning can weaken the safety guardrails of LLMs, even if the training data does not explicitly contain malicious content.**\n\nThis research introduces Safe LoRA, a simple and effective method to mitigate these risks.  **Safe LoRA is a 'one-liner patch' to the existing LoRA algorithm**, projecting LLM parameter updates onto a 'safety-aligned subspace' to preserve safety during fine-tuning.  **It's training-free and data-free, making it readily applicable to various LLMs.**  Experiments show Safe LoRA successfully retains utility while mitigating the negative impact of malicious data during fine-tuning, outperforming existing safety-enhancing techniques.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "HcifdQZFZV/podcast.wav"}
