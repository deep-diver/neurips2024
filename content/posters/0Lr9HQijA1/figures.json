We use an example dataset of 4 training instances and 3 classes. (a) Full label, the annotation is a single true label; (b) Partial label, the annotation is a label candidate set containing true label; (c) Semi-supervised, only part of the dataset is labeled, and the others are unlabeled; (d) Noisy label, the annotation is mislabeled.", "description": "This figure illustrates four different label configurations used in machine learning: (a) Full Label: Each data point has one correct label; (b) Partial Label: Each data point is associated with a set of candidate labels containing the true label; (c) Semi-Supervised: The dataset is comprised of labeled and unlabeled instances; (d) Noisy Label: The labels are corrupted or inaccurate.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
