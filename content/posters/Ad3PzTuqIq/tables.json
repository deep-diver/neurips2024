The metrics are averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds.", "description": "This table presents the quantitative evaluation results of SpelsNet and several baseline methods on two datasets: ABCParts-VEF and CC3D-VEF.  The evaluation focuses on face type classification and segmentation, reporting mean Intersection over Union (IoU) scores for both type ('tIoU') and segmentation ('sIoU').  Results are shown with and without test-time augmentation (w/o aug and w/ aug respectively) to demonstrate robustness to real-world data variations.  Higher scores indicate better performance.", "section": "5.2 Classification and Segmentation Evaluation"}]
