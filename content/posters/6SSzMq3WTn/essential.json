Existing methods like Thompson Sampling and Perturbed-History Exploration have shown strong theoretical guarantees, but linear ensemble sampling has lagged behind with suboptimal regret bounds and an impractical linear ensemble size. This has hindered its broader adoption despite empirical success.\nThis paper bridges this gap by proving that linear ensemble sampling achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound of \u00d5(d\u00b3/\u00b2\u221aT) with a logarithmic ensemble size, matching results for top-performing randomized methods. It introduces a generalized regret analysis framework and reveals a critical relationship between linear ensemble sampling and LinPHE, which allows for deriving a new, improved regret bound for LinPHE as well. These results significantly advance our theoretical understanding of ensemble sampling and provide a more efficient algorithm for practical applications.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6SSzMq3WTn/podcast.wav"}
