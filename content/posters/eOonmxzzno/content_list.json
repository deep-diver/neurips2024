The traditional paradigm for TSG generally assumes that relevant segments always exist within a given video. However, this assumption is restrictive and unrealistic in real-world applications where the existence of a query-related segment is uncertain, easily resulting in erroneous grounding. Motivated by the research gap and practical application, this paper introduces a new task, named Temporal Sentence Grounding with Relevance Feedback (TSG-RF) in videos, which accommodates the possibility that a video may or may not include a segment related to the query. This task entails localizing precise video segments that semantically align with the query text when such content is present, while delivering definitive feedback on the non-existence of related segments when absent. Moreover, we propose a novel Relation-aware Temporal Sentence Grounding (RaTSG) network for addressing this challenging task. This network first reformulates the TSG-RF task as a foreground-background detection problem by investigating whether the query-related semantics exist in both frame and video levels. Then, a multi-granularity relevance discriminator is exploited to produce precise video-query relevance feedback and a relation-aware segment grounding module is employed to selectively conduct the grounding process, dynamically adapting to the presence or absence of query-related segments in videos. To validate our RaTSG network, we reconstruct two popular TSG datasets, establishing a rigorous benchmark for TSG-RF.

We argue the essential issue of previous TSG methods is their inability to discern whether grounding results are warranted based on the presence or absence of relevant segments. To alleviate this issue, a straightforward approach to address the TSG-RF task involves a two-stage process: Firstly, a relevance discriminator is trained separately to assess the relevance between the query text and the video, providing relevant feedback. Then, query-video samples identified as relevant by the discriminator are processed using models designed for the TSG task to predict the target segment. Despite the structural simplicity of this integrated approach, it requires training two distinct models, leading to the redundant consumption of computational resources, increased storage demands, and suboptimal overall inference efficiency. Therefore, how to design an end-to-end relevance-aware TSG-RF method is an emerging problem. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Based on the above considerations, we propose to address the TSG-RF task by developing a multitask learning model, i.e, the Relation-aware Temporal Sentence Grounding (RaTSG) network. This model promotes mutual enhancement between relevance discrimination and video segment grounding through shared knowledge, thus facilitating a unified and efficient approach to both tasks. As the essence of relevance discrimination lies in accurately measuring the semantic partial relevance between the query text and the video, we propose to first explore the measurement of partial semantic relevance between text and video at two different granularities: fine-grained and coarse-grained. Specifically, to capture fine-grained partial relevance, we adopt the concept of multiple instance learning [17\u201319], treating the entire video as a bag with each frame as an instance. Following [20], a video is considered partially related to the text if it contains at least one foreground frame; if all frames are background and irrelevant, the video is deemed unrelated to the text. Considering the semantic incompleteness of individual video frames, a coarse-grained perspective is also adopted to learn the relevance between the global video-level semantics and the full query text. Then, a multi-granularity relevance discriminator is designed to integrate the discriminative capabilities of both granularities to predict the final relevance score. As for the selective grounding process based on the relevance score, existing segment grounding heads always make grounding for any query-video input, even when no relevant segments are present in the video, which is not suitable for the TSG-RF task. Therefore, we design a relation-aware segment grounding module that takes the previously predicted relevance information of each query-video pair as prior knowledge, and selectively conducts grounding.

Recent efforts for TSG can be typically grouped into proposal-based and proposal-free methods. Proposal-based methods [22, 24\u201339] follow a two-stage paradigm: generating proposals by dividing the video into clips and then aligning textual semantics with visual features. Proposal-free methods [40\u201344, 10, 13, 45] offer an end-to-end paradigm, predicting target segments without proposals, enhancing computational efficiency. Although efficient, these methods struggled with segment-level feature capture. To combine strengths, Xiao et al. [45] used an anchor-free approach to generate candidates, then matched them with query statements using anchor-based methods.

For instance, Moment-DETR [46] introduce a transformer-based approach that simplifies highlight detection by treating it as a set prediction task, eliminating traditional proposal steps. QD-DETR [48] enhances video-text understanding with cross-attention and negative pairs to improve relevance predictions. UniVTG [49] unifies diverse temporal annotations and enables large-scale pretraining to improve generalization across video grounding tasks.

[50] respectively represent text and video into a feature vector, and compute their similarity via cosine similarity metric. Croitoru et al. [52] use distillation techniques to combine knowledge from multiple pretrained models, enhancing cross-modal similarity learning. Current mainstream methods involve learning multiple shared spaces, with relevance computed as a weighted sum of similarities across these spaces. Li et al.

While these techniques assess the whole text-video similarity, TSG-RF requires learning partial relevance, where the text relates to only some frames within the video.

Otherwise, the grounding results are ignored.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
