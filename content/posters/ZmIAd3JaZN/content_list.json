In this case, data providers (agents) may be disinclined to reveal their data truthfully, potentially jeopardizing the accuracy of model estimation.

In detail, [37] can only guarantee Random Joint Differential Privacy (RJDP) where on all but a small proportion of unlikely dataset pairs, pure $\\varepsilon$ -JDP holds, while in this paper we can guarantee approximate JDP, which is more widely used in the DP literature. The main reason is that [37] used the output perturbation-based method to ensure DP.

The majority of this work operates in a model where agents cannot fabricate their private information; their only recourse is either to withhold it or, at most, misrepresent their costs related to privacy. A related thread [22, 34, 10] explores cost models based on the notion of differential privacy [17]. However, most of the aforementioned work only considers the mean estimation problem and does not consider advanced statistical models [18, 19, 13]. Thus, these methods cannot be applied to linear models. [14] and [37] represent the closest work to ours, as they investigate the challenge of estimating (generalized) linear models from self-interested agents that have privacy concerns. However, as we mentioned above, they only consider the low dimensional case and their methods cannot be applied to the high dimensional sparse setting, see Section C for details.

These approaches typically involve adding noise to the output of optimization methods, privatizing the objective function, or injecting noise into the gradients during optimization. However, the truthful data acquisition process follows a single-round interactive procedure between the analyst and the agents, in contrast to the multi-round interactions typically encountered in these approaches, indicating these methods cannot be applied to our problem. The closed-form expression of our estimator ensures that this requirement is satisfied. We believe that our method is non-trivial and it has the potential to extend to other related scenarios. Recently, [61] proposed a closed-form private estimator for sparse linear regression. However, as we discussed in Section 3.1, their estimator cannot be directly applied to our problem due to inherent limitations, such as challenges associated with the invertibility of the covariance matrix. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Recently, there has been also some worth-noting literature on estimating linear regression from strategic agents (without privacy consideration). [25] and [6] have investigated regressing a linear model using data from strategic agents who can manipulate their associated costs but not the data. [29] explored a setting without direct payments, in which agents receive a utility that serves as a measure of estimation accuracy. [11] studied the case where agents may intentionally introduce errors to maximize their own benefits and proposed several group-strategyproof linear regression mechanisms. Additionally, [16] and [35] considered an analyst who aims to derive a \"consensus\" model from data provided by multiple strategic agents. In this setting, agents seek a consensus value that minimizes their individual data loss, and the authors demonstrated that empirical risk minimization is groupstrategyproof.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u00b7 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
