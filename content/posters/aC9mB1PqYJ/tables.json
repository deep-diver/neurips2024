The second column shows the number of estimated components where the actual number of components in the mixture is 6. The third and fourth columns show the Jaccard Similarity of the identified intervention target of Mixture-UTIGSP and oracle versions of the UT-IGSP algorithm. The fourth and last column shows the SHD between the estimated and true causal graphs for both methods respectively. Overall we observe that at a lower cutoff threshold Mixture-UTIGSP is able to perform as well as the oracle UT-IGSP algorithm on all the metrics. See \u00a7B.2 for detailed discussion.", "description": "This table presents the results of applying Algorithm 1 (Mixture-UTIGSP) to the protein signaling dataset. It shows how the performance of the algorithm varies with different cutoff ratios used for selecting the number of mixture components.  The metrics used for evaluation include the number of estimated components (compared to the actual number, which is 6), Jaccard Similarity (JS) for intervention targets (comparing Mixture-UTIGSP to an oracle UT-IGSP), and Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) between estimated and true causal graphs. The results indicate that Mixture-UTIGSP performs comparably to the oracle method at lower cutoff ratios.", "section": "6.2 Experiment on Biological Dataset"}]
