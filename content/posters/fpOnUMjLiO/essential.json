Understanding the curvature of this landscape is crucial for designing effective optimization algorithms. The Hessian matrix, while informative, is computationally expensive to calculate.  The Gauss-Newton (GN) matrix offers a computationally cheaper approximation, but its properties in deep networks remain not fully understood. \nThis paper addresses this gap by providing a theoretical analysis of the GN matrix in deep neural networks. The authors derive tight bounds on the condition number of the GN matrix for deep linear networks and extend this analysis to two-layer ReLU networks, also examining the impact of residual connections.  Their theoretical findings are validated empirically, providing valuable insights into how architectural design influences the conditioning of the GN matrix and consequently, the optimization process.", "affiliation": "University of Basel", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "fpOnUMjLiO/podcast.wav"}
