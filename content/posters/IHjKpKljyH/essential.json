Many existing SBI methods struggle with the speed and scalability needed for realistic high-dimensional systems and may not generalize well to problems involving low-dimensional parameters. This problem limits the application of SBI to many realistic situations where fast and accurate inference is critical. \nThis paper introduces Consistency Model Posterior Estimation (CMPE), a novel conditional sampler for SBI that addresses these limitations. CMPE leverages the advantages of consistency models and unconstrained architectures to enable fast few-shot inference, providing a robust and adaptable solution across dimensions.  Empirical results show that CMPE outperforms existing methods on low-dimensional problems and achieves competitive performance on high-dimensional benchmarks, making it an attractive tool for SBI. **CMPE's unique architecture and approach addresses speed and scalability challenges, paving the way for broader applications of SBI in various scientific and engineering fields.**", "affiliation": "University of Stuttgart", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "IHjKpKljyH/podcast.wav"}
