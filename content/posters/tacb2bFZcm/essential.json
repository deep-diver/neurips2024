This coupling limits performance and introduces co-adaptation issues.  The computational cost of similarity modeling in these methods also increases quadratically with image size, hindering efficiency.\nThe paper introduces Unified Projection Sharing (UPS), a novel algorithm that addresses these issues by decoupling feature extraction and similarity modeling. UPS establishes a unified projection space, enabling layer-specific feature extraction optimization while calculating similarity in the shared space.  This approach significantly improves efficiency and robustness.  Extensive experiments demonstrate UPS achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks and shows promising results on unseen data and different image restoration tasks.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "tacb2bFZcm/podcast.wav"}
