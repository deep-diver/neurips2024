The results are shown in Figure 5. The choice of different $\\lambda$ does not seem to have a significant effect on mitigating attacks, indicating the robustness of our IBProtector. Note that the ASR significantly when $\\alpha$ is large, a.k.a, when the compactness term dominates, this is because the information about Y\u02c6 cannot be accurately predicted, and thus the BAR also decreases dramatically. Furthermore, the sparsity parameter $r$ casts a strong effect on the performance. When $r$ decreases, generated masks are sparser and more tokens are replaced by the meaningless $\\mu$ , resulting in a decrease in both ASR and BAR.

Although IBProtector operates as an extractor and is not confined to a specific task, our experiments predominantly focus on protecting the target model from jailbreaking attempts. The role of IBProtector is to merely highlight the more harmful and informative parts, serving as explanations within harmful instances, while the primary defense relies on the target large model itself. Consequently, a well-aligned LLM with better performance may be better equipped to recognize these highlighted explanation parts. Furthermore, extracted sub-prompts merely act as intermediate results lacking fluency and coherence, and there is no guarantee that their integration into responses would be in context, i.e., perturbations in filling may result in other target LLMs being out-of-distribution. Thus the corresponding protector is the best, if the target LLM is a black-box, see the solution given in Section 6. Finally, high dimensionality challenges, such as images and toxic documents, have not been validated due to our lack of benchmarks, which can be left in the future.

The development of robust countermeasures against the malicious exploitation of LLMs is of paramount importance for the human community and society at large. As these models become increasingly integral to a wide range of applications, the potential for them to be used in ways that deviate from human ethical standards grows. Efforts to adapt LLMs to reduce the spread of toxic content are critical. This underscores the need for a robust framework that LLMs align with societal values and operate within ethical boundaries, fostering trust and safety. Moreover, our efforts contribute to the responsible advancement of technology, preventing the erosion of social norms, and offering highlighted phrases as an explanation of harmful information.

We further give a solution for which gradient search is not available in IBProtector. Relevant comparative studies confirm that IBProtector surpasses existing defense methods without substantially affecting the LLM\u2019s ability to reply and reasoning speed. A potential issue is that extracted information only highlights the most harmful parts as intermediate results that are difficult for humans to understand.

However, the model\u2019s response is not a direct fulfillment of the user\u2019s intent and is not as severe as the most inappropriate response of Score 5.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
