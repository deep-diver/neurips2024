[{"figure_path": "w3JCTBRduf/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Plot of the distortion obtained through optimization over 5000 iterations vs the average distortion using a random Gaussian matrix (left plot), and the progression of variance over the same number of iterations (right plot). To calculate the distortions' progression with our method, we sample from the updated mean matrix and variance at each iteration and compute the distortion. We remark that the distortion plotted is a proxy for our objective in Equation 4. We observe that our optimization-based approach converges to a deterministic solution sampler. By using the mean matrix M, we achieve nearly optimal distortion, where ||Mx|| \u2248 ||x||.", "description": "This figure shows the results of a simulation comparing the performance of the proposed optimization-based method for finding Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings against a standard randomized approach using Gaussian matrices. The left plot shows the maximum distortion over iterations, comparing the optimization method (black line) with the average and minimum distortions obtained using random matrices (red and dashed red lines). The right plot shows the decrease in variance of the Gaussian sampler across the iterations of the optimization process. The optimization method demonstrates that it is able to achieve near-optimal distortion as the variance tends to zero and converges to a deterministic solution.", "section": "Simulations"}]
