The results show that EASI consistently outperforms other methods in achieving higher rewards in these target environments, highlighting the effectiveness of EASI in adapting policies to the reality gap.", "section": "5.1 Sim-to-Sim Policy Transfer"}, {"figure_path": "DqiggGDOmA/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Policy performance in reality", "description": "This table presents the performance comparison of two algorithms, UDR and EASI, in terms of their ability to control a real-world Cartpole. The performance is measured by two metrics: angle error of the pole and velocity of the cart. Lower values indicate better performance. EASI demonstrates superior performance over UDR in both metrics, achieving significantly lower angle error and cart velocity.", "section": "5.2 Sim-to-Real Policy Transfer"}, {"figure_path": "DqiggGDOmA/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Performance in target environments with varying numbers of reference trajectories", "description": "This table presents the performance of the EASI algorithm in four different sim-to-sim tasks (Cartpole, Ant, Ballbalance, and Go2) with varying amounts of real-world data used for training.
