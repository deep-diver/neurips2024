### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but it's unclear whether LLMs accurately learn the underlying human preferences. This paper introduces a novel method to measure and interpret the divergence between learned feedback patterns (LFPs) in LLMs and actual human preferences.  The core issue is that existing high-dimensional activation spaces and limited model interpretability hinder understanding the relationship between human-interpretable features and model outputs.

To address these issues, the researchers train probes to estimate feedback signals from LLM activations. These probes use condensed and interpretable representations of LLM activations, making it easier to correlate input features with probe predictions. They also use GPT-4 to validate their findings by comparing the features their probes correlate with positive feedback against features GPT-4 describes as related to LFPs.  Their results demonstrate a method to quantify the accuracy of LFPs and identify features associated with implicit feedback signals in LLMs.

> This figure illustrates the four main steps of the experimental pipeline used in the paper to investigate Learned Feedback Patterns (LFPs) in Large Language Models (LLMs).  First, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Second, a condensed representation of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) activations is obtained using sparse autoencoders. This simplifies the high-dimensional activation space for easier analysis. Third, probes (linear regression models) are trained to predict feedback signals implicit in the condensed MLP activations. These probes identify correlations between activation patterns and the feedback received during training. Finally, the probes are validated by comparing the features they identify as being relevant to positive feedback against the features described by GPT-4 (a large language model) as being related to LFPs. This validation step ensures the reliability and interpretability of the probes‚Äô findings.

> This table compares the sentiment scores predicted by the GPT-Neo-125m language model for eleven randomly selected tokens against their true sentiment scores from the VADER lexicon. The VADER lexicon scores were used to determine the reward during reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) fine-tuning of the language model.  The comparison shows the model's accuracy in capturing the sentiment expressed in the tokens used for training.





### In-depth insights


#### RLHF's Accuracy
RLHF, or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, aims to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.  However, a critical question arises: **how accurately do LLMs learn and reflect these preferences?** This paper investigates the divergence between the patterns LLMs learn during RLHF (Learned Feedback Patterns or LFPs) and the actual underlying human preferences.  The core issue is whether the LLM's internal representations accurately capture the nuances of human feedback, or if there are systematic discrepancies. The authors propose a method to measure this divergence by training probes to predict the implicit feedback signal within an LLM's activations. By comparing probe predictions to the actual feedback, they assess the accuracy of the LFPs.  This approach also allows for analysis of which features within the LLM's activation space correlate most strongly with positive feedback, providing insights into **what aspects of the input the LLM considers most relevant** in relation to human preferences.  Crucially, they validate their findings by comparing their results with the features GPT-4 identifies as associated with successful RLHF. The findings highlight the potential for misalignment between LLM behavior and training objectives. This work is significant because understanding LFPs is **essential for the safety and reliable deployment of LLMs**, helping to ensure that these powerful models align with human values and intentions.

#### LFP Probe Training
The section on "LFP Probe Training" is crucial for bridging the gap between the learned feedback patterns (LFPs) within a language model and the actual human feedback intended during fine-tuning.  The core idea is to **train probes (typically simple machine learning models) to predict the implicit reward signal** embedded within the model's activations.  This requires a well-structured dataset of model activations paired with corresponding feedback labels (positive, negative, or neutral). The probes are trained on a **condensed representation of the model's activations**, often achieved through dimensionality reduction techniques like sparse autoencoders. This condensation aims to improve interpretability and reduce feature superposition, making it easier to understand which activation patterns correlate with specific feedback signals.  The accuracy of the probe in predicting the reward signal directly reflects how well-aligned the model's LFPs are with the intended feedback, revealing potential misalignments or areas needing refinement. **Validation involves comparing the probe's identified features with those described by a more advanced model (e.g. GPT-4)**, helping to assess both the probe's accuracy and the interpretability of the LFPs themselves.  In essence, probe training offers a crucial pathway to understanding and mitigating discrepancies between what a large language model actually learns during reinforcement learning from human feedback and the intended goal of that training.

#### GPT-4 Feature Check
A hypothetical 'GPT-4 Feature Check' section in a research paper investigating LLMs' learned feedback patterns would likely involve using GPT-4's capabilities for **interpretability and validation**.  The researchers could feed GPT-4 with a representation of the LLM's internal states (e.g., activations from specific layers) and ask it to identify features correlated with positive feedback. This provides a human-interpretable assessment, bridging the gap between complex neural representations and human understanding.  **GPT-4's judgments would then be compared** to the findings from probes trained to predict feedback signals directly from these activations.  **Agreement between GPT-4's analysis and the probe predictions would strengthen the validity of the discovered learned feedback patterns.** Discrepancies, however, could highlight limitations of the probes or the inherent challenges in interpreting high-dimensional neural data, prompting a deeper investigation into the nature of learned preferences in LLMs.  The section should clearly define the methodology for providing inputs to GPT-4, the criteria for feature evaluation, and a comprehensive analysis of both agreements and disagreements between GPT-4 and the probes to obtain a robust evaluation of the LLM's learned patterns. The results are critical in assessing the accuracy and reliability of the model's learning process, potentially revealing biases or misalignments with intended training objectives.

#### Autoencoder Analysis
Autoencoder analysis plays a crucial role in this research by providing a mechanism for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction from high-dimensional LLM activations.  **By training sparse autoencoders, the researchers obtain a condensed, interpretable representation of the LLM's internal state.** This is particularly important given the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional data directly. The sparse nature of the autoencoders helps mitigate feature superposition, a phenomenon where multiple features are encoded within a single neuron, making interpretation more straightforward.  The choice to use sparse autoencoders is motivated by the desire for improved interpretability, enabling easier correlation between specific features and the implicit feedback signals.  **The autoencoder outputs serve as input for subsequent probe training**, allowing for a more focused investigation of the learned feedback patterns (LFPs). The effectiveness of this approach is validated through comparison with GPT-4's feature analysis, demonstrating alignment between features identified by both methods. This integration significantly strengthens the reliability and interpretability of the results, highlighting the importance of autoencoder analysis as a key component of the overall research methodology.

#### Future of LLMs
The future of LLMs is bright but complex.  **Improved safety and alignment** are paramount, requiring deeper understanding of learned feedback patterns (LFPs) and methods to minimize discrepancies between model behavior and training objectives.  **Enhanced interpretability** is crucial, moving beyond simply predicting feedback signals to explaining the underlying reasoning of LLM decisions. This necessitates developing new techniques to disentangle superimposed features and enhance the interpretability of high-dimensional activation spaces.  **Addressing biases and promoting fairness** remain ongoing challenges that demand innovative mitigation strategies.  Beyond these immediate concerns, we anticipate advancements in **efficiency, model scaling, and specialized LLMs** for niche tasks.  The development of more robust and efficient training methodologies, including potentially moving beyond RLHF, will be key.  Ultimately, the future of LLMs hinges on responsible development and deployment, balancing technological progress with ethical considerations and societal impact.
