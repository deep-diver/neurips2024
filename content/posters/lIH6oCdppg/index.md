### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models rely heavily on transformers, whose core mechanism, self-attention, suffers from a critical issue: rank collapse, meaning model representations become homogeneous as the model's depth increases. This phenomenon limits the expressivity and potential of deep models. Previous research mostly overlooked the role of other transformer components like attention masks and LayerNorm in addressing this. 

This paper presents a rigorous analysis of rank collapse under self-attention, considering the impact of both attention masks and LayerNorm. **The researchers found that while masked self-attention still exhibits rank collapse, sparse or local attention can slow down the collapse rate.**  Furthermore, **they refuted the widely held belief that LayerNorm plays no role in rank collapse.**  Their experiments revealed that with LayerNorm and careful selection of value matrices, the self-attention dynamics can sustain a diverse set of equilibria (states) with varying ranks, actively avoiding complete collapse to a low-rank solution for a wide range of input sequences.

> üîº This figure illustrates the long-term behavior of two tokens (N=2) in a two-dimensional space (d=2) under self-attention dynamics, with and without Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). The left panel shows that without LayerNorm, both tokens collapse to the same point, indicating rank collapse. In contrast, the right panel demonstrates that with LayerNorm, the tokens can maintain full rank and converge to different points.  The behavior with LayerNorm depends on the initial positions of the tokens; the second token will converge to either point A or point B depending on its initial location in the plane.

### In-depth insights


#### Attn Mask Effects
The effects of attention masks on the behavior of transformer models are multifaceted and significant.  **Studies show that fully bidirectional attention, without masking, leads to exponential rank collapse**, where token representations converge to a homogeneous state, limiting model expressivity as depth increases. However, **the introduction of attention masks, particularly causal or sparse masks, can mitigate this collapse**.  Causal masking, where tokens only attend to preceding tokens, demonstrably slows down the rate of rank collapse. Sparse attention mechanisms further limit the connections between tokens, resulting in even more controlled dynamics and potentially preventing oversmoothing.  **The choice of masking strategy thus presents a crucial design consideration**, affecting not only computational efficiency but also the model's ability to capture and maintain the richness of information in input sequences.  Further research should investigate the optimal balance between expressivity and efficiency offered by different attention mask designs, which is crucial for advancing the capabilities of larger transformer models.

#### LayerNorm's Role
The role of LayerNorm in Transformers, specifically concerning its impact on the self-attention mechanism and the issue of rank collapse, is a complex and nuanced topic.  While previous hypotheses suggested LayerNorm played a negligible role, this paper **challenges that assumption**.  The authors demonstrate that, contrary to earlier findings, LayerNorm's influence is significant and not easily characterized. In cases with orthogonal value matrices, LayerNorm can still contribute to the exponential convergence of token representations to a common point. However, the paper's crucial contribution lies in showcasing that **with appropriate value matrices, LayerNorm allows for a richer equilibrium landscape**,  preventing complete rank collapse and enabling a wider range of possible ranks.  This means that the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm are far more expressive and versatile than previously thought, which is of paramount theoretical and practical importance for the development of powerful deep learning models.  **The discrete-time dynamical system analysis** employed in this research also contrasts with previous continuous-time approaches, offering a closer representation of the actual transformer architecture.

#### Rank Collapse Rate
The concept of 'Rank Collapse Rate' in the context of transformer models refers to the speed at which the representational capacity of the model diminishes as the number of layers increases.  **A high rank collapse rate indicates a rapid loss of expressiveness**, meaning that deeper networks do not necessarily lead to improved performance. This phenomenon is detrimental because it limits the model's ability to capture complex relationships and nuances in the data. Several factors contribute to the rank collapse rate, including the nature of the attention mechanism itself, the type of attention masking employed (e.g., causal vs. bidirectional), and the presence or absence of normalization techniques such as LayerNorm.  **Understanding and mitigating the rank collapse rate is crucial** for designing efficient and powerful transformer-based models.  **Strategies to reduce the rank collapse rate** include incorporating sparse or local attention mechanisms and carefully considering the role of LayerNorm. While LayerNorm's impact is complex and not fully understood, this research suggests that it has a more significant role than previously believed in maintaining the expressiveness of deep self-attention.

#### Equilibria Diversity
The concept of 'Equilibria Diversity' in the context of a research paper likely refers to the variety of stable states or outcomes a system can reach.  In the specific case of attention mechanisms within transformers, this would relate to the range of possible final token representations after multiple layers of processing. A high diversity of equilibria implies a richer representational capacity; **the network is not confined to a few dominant states**.  Low diversity, conversely, suggests a system susceptible to oversmoothing or rank collapse, limiting the expressiveness and capacity for capturing complex information. Exploring equilibria diversity involves analyzing the effects of architectural elements such as attention masks, LayerNorm, and value matrix choices on the self-attention dynamics.  **Understanding how these factors affect the equilibrium landscape is crucial for designing powerful transformers.**  The ideal scenario is a system capable of reaching a wide array of stable equilibria, allowing it to capture nuanced and multifaceted data representations effectively.  **A theoretical analysis might quantify the number and types of equilibria, linking these metrics to the network‚Äôs capabilities**. Empirical investigation would involve testing the system's behavior on different datasets and tasks, looking for evidence of a rich equilibrium space or signs of restricted dynamics.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore the **impact of different attention mask designs** on mitigating rank collapse, going beyond the causal and local masks analyzed.  Investigating the **interaction between LayerNorm and other normalization techniques**, such as weight normalization, could reveal further insights into their combined effects on self-attention dynamics.  A deeper theoretical investigation is needed to fully understand the **role of LayerNorm in preventing collapse** under more general conditions and value matrix properties, extending beyond orthogonal matrices.  Exploring the connections between the **anisotropy of token representations** and the expressiveness of the self-attention model with LayerNorm warrants further study.  Finally, empirical studies could focus on **developing more robust methods for training** deep transformer models, incorporating insights from the theoretical findings to address the rank collapse phenomenon more effectively.  This may involve new training techniques, architectural modifications, or regularizations that target the specific challenges uncovered by this work.

The results reveal that the models effectively maintain full rank (close to 100%), showcasing the ability of LayerNorm to prevent rank collapse.  However, the minimum singular value decreases with depth, and the average absolute cosine similarity increases, indicating an anisotropic representation where tokens cluster in a narrow region, aligning with empirical observations of token embeddings generated by transformers.
