### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Time series forecasting is vital across many fields but struggles with real-world data's noise and anomalies. Existing methods primarily focus on local patterns, neglecting timestamps' potential for robust global guidance. This leads to inaccurate predictions, particularly when data quality is low.

The proposed GLAFF framework directly addresses this issue by individually modeling timestamps to capture global dependencies. It seamlessly integrates with any existing forecasting model as a "plug-and-play" module, dynamically weighting global and local information for optimal performance.  GLAFF significantly improves average forecasting accuracy (12.5%), exceeding state-of-the-art methods (5.5%) across diverse real-world datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### Timestamp Fusion
Timestamp fusion in time series forecasting is a crucial technique that leverages the inherent temporal information encoded in timestamps to improve prediction accuracy.  **Effective fusion strategies combine timestamp features with other time series data** to capture both global temporal patterns and local trends. This approach addresses limitations of methods solely relying on local patterns, especially for datasets with noise or anomalies.  There are various timestamp fusion methods such as concatenation, summation, or attention-based mechanisms.  **The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the time series data and the forecasting model.** A well-designed fusion strategy should handle irregular or missing timestamps, and should adapt to variations in data distribution.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the robustness and accuracy of time series forecasts by providing a comprehensive view of temporal information. **Successfully integrating timestamps can significantly boost performance, especially in challenging scenarios.**

#### GLAFF Framework
The GLAFF framework presents a novel approach to robust time series forecasting by fusing global and local information.  **Its core innovation lies in explicitly leveraging timestamps**, often underutilized, to provide robust global guidance. Unlike methods that simply embed timestamps, GLAFF models them individually to capture global dependencies, acting as a plugin adaptable to various forecasting backbones.  **The framework's adaptive mechanism seamlessly combines global and local information**, adjusting weights dynamically based on data characteristics. This adaptability makes GLAFF particularly effective when dealing with real-world data, which often contains anomalies.  **Through attention-based mapping and robust denormalization**, it handles data drift and anomalies effectively.  Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates significant performance gains across diverse datasets, highlighting GLAFF's robustness and generalizability.

#### Robust Forecasting
Robust forecasting methods are crucial for reliable predictions, especially when dealing with noisy or incomplete data.  Traditional forecasting techniques often struggle in such scenarios, leading to inaccurate or unstable results.  **Robust approaches aim to minimize the impact of outliers and anomalies**, ensuring that predictions remain reliable even in the presence of unexpected events. This often involves using statistical methods that are less sensitive to extreme values or employing machine learning models that are specifically trained to handle uncertainty and noise.  **A key aspect of robust forecasting is model selection and validation.** Choosing an appropriate model that is well-suited to the specific characteristics of the data is critical. This includes careful consideration of the data's underlying distribution and the presence of any seasonality or trends.  **Effective evaluation metrics are essential** for assessing the performance of robust forecasting methods, and these metrics must account for the potential presence of outliers and anomalies.  **Combining multiple forecasting methods** can also enhance robustness by providing a more comprehensive and reliable prediction.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically evaluates the contribution of individual components within a machine learning model.  **By removing or deactivating one part at a time and observing the impact on overall performance, researchers gain insights into the relative importance of each component.** This helps determine which parts are essential for achieving high accuracy and efficiency, and whether simplifying the model by removing less crucial parts is possible without significantly compromising the results.  In the context of time series forecasting, an ablation study might involve removing timestamp embeddings, specific attention mechanisms, or data normalization techniques to assess their individual impact on forecasting accuracy.  The results highlight the importance of **carefully selecting and designing model components**, since a poorly chosen component can significantly reduce the model's predictive capabilities.  **The findings guide future model development and optimization by indicating which aspects are core to the model's success** and which ones are expendable, leading to more efficient and robust forecasting models.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending GLAFF's applicability to other time series forecasting backbones** beyond the five currently tested is crucial to solidify its model-agnostic nature.  **Investigating alternative mechanisms for global information fusion**, potentially incorporating more sophisticated methods beyond attention mechanisms or exploring hybrid approaches, warrants investigation.  The current robust denormalization strategy could benefit from **comparative studies against other anomaly handling techniques**.  Finally, a thorough **empirical evaluation on a broader range of real-world datasets** with diverse characteristics and noise profiles would strengthen the findings. This comprehensive evaluation should focus on datasets with longer temporal dependencies and scenarios involving substantial data drift.

> üîº The figure illustrates the overall architecture of the Global-Local Adaptive Fusion Framework (GLAFF).  GLAFF is a plug-and-play module that works with any time series forecasting backbone. It consists of three main parts:  1. **Attention-based Mapper:** This component processes the timestamps (S and T) to generate global information in the form of initial mappings (X and Y). It uses an attention mechanism to capture dependencies between timestamps. 2. **Robust Denormalizer:** This component adjusts the initial mappings (X and Y ) to account for data drift by inverse normalizing them to X and Y using quantile deviation. 3. **Adaptive Combiner:** This component dynamically combines the global information (Y) and the local prediction from the backbone model (Y) to produce the final prediction (Y). The weight of the combination is adjusted based on the difference between the final mapping (X) and the actual observations (X) in the history window.  The inputs are the history observations (X), history timestamps (S), future timestamps (T). The output is the prediction (Y).
