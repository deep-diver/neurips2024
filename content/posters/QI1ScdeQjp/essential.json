However, this approach is inefficient due to varying information density across different axes in medical images like CT and MRI. This disparity leads to underutilization of axial-slice plane features compared to time-axial features.\n\nTo tackle this issue, the researchers proposed a novel U-shaped Connection (uC) that leverages simplified 2D U-Nets to enhance axial-slice plane feature extraction.  They integrated uC into a 3D U-Net backbone to create uC 3DU-Net.  **Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrated that uC 3DU-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters and lower computational cost.** The study highlights the potential of combining 2D and 3D convolutions to address limitations of traditional volumetric segmentation methods.", "affiliation": "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "QI1ScdeQjp/podcast.wav"}
