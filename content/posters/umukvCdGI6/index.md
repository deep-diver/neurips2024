### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have struggled to match the performance of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs) on tabular data. This is partly due to the difficulty of incorporating the inherent sparsity of tree-based models into the DNN architecture, which usually involves a dense selection of features.  This research introduces a novel DNN architecture, namely DOFEN, which aims to improve performance by achieving on-off sparse selection of columns, a technique that helps mitigate overfitting and improve the diversity of features used in each 'tree' within the ensemble. 

DOFEN uses a two-step process to achieve this: first, it generates a large pool of differentiable 'relaxed Oblivious Decision Trees' (rODTs) that capture sparse column selections. Second, it uses a two-level ensemble strategy to aggregate the predictions from the rODTs and learn their weights.  The two-level ensemble not only improves performance, but also improves the model's robustness. Experiments on the Tabular Benchmark demonstrate that DOFEN surpasses other DNNs and approaches the performance of GBDTs, particularly on datasets with exclusively numerical features. **The findings suggest that DOFEN's unique architecture addresses a critical limitation of existing tabular DNNs and offers a potentially transformative approach to improve performance in this critical domain.**

### In-depth insights


#### Tabular DNNs
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet their performance on tabular data lags behind traditional tree-based models like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs).  **Tabular DNNs**, designed to address this limitation, represent a significant area of research.  However, challenges remain. Many tabular DNNs, while showing promise, require significantly more computational resources than GBDTs.  Furthermore, they often fail to effectively incorporate the inherent sparsity found in tree-based methods.  **Sparsity**, which refers to the selection of only a subset of features in each tree, is a crucial aspect of tree-based methods' performance and robustness, mitigating overfitting and improving generalization.  **Innovative architectures** that effectively mimic this sparsity, without sacrificing differentiability critical for DNN training, are actively being investigated.  Ultimately, the goal is to create tabular DNNs that achieve comparable accuracy to GBDTs while maintaining or improving efficiency.  **Novel approaches** integrating tree-inspired components or utilizing attention mechanisms with sparsity-inducing techniques are crucial steps to bridge the performance gap and achieve this goal.

#### DOFEN Design
The DOFEN design is a novel deep neural network architecture inspired by oblivious decision trees.  **Its core innovation lies in its ability to achieve on-off sparse column selection**, a characteristic typically associated with tree-based models but largely absent in DNNs for tabular data. This sparsity is crucial for improving performance and mitigating overfitting. DOFEN cleverly addresses the non-differentiability of traditional ODTs by employing a two-step process. First, it generates a pool of differentiable relaxed ODTs (rODTs) by randomly selecting features and using a sigmoid subnetwork to produce soft conditions. Secondly, it uses a two-level ensemble: an importance weighting scheme applied to a subset of rODTs forming individual forests, followed by aggregation of these forests using a second level ensemble.  This unique architecture combines the strengths of both tree-based methods and DNNs, resulting in a model that surpasses other DNNs on tabular data while achieving competitive results against GBDTs.  **The random selection process ensures diversity and helps avoid overfitting**, although the authors acknowledge that this randomness impacts convergence speed, requiring more epochs to reach optimal performance.

#### Relaxed ODT
The concept of "Relaxed ODT" presented in the paper is crucial for bridging the gap between the efficiency of oblivious decision trees (ODTs) and the differentiability required for deep learning integration.  **Traditional ODTs rely on non-differentiable operations**, such as the Heaviside step function and entropy-based column selection, hindering their direct use in gradient-based optimization. The innovation lies in the relaxation of these constraints.  The paper replaces the Heaviside function with a differentiable approximation using a neural network (sub-network Œî1), thereby introducing **soft conditions** instead of hard decisions. This allows for a smooth, differentiable transition between ODT nodes, crucial for effective backpropagation.  Furthermore, the **column selection process**, instead of being a predefined, non-differentiable criterion, becomes a learnable parameter integrated within the neural network architecture, allowing the model to dynamically adjust column weights according to the data. This relaxation technique is essential for training an ODT-based deep learning model using standard backpropagation algorithms, enabling DOFEN to achieve state-of-the-art performance on tabular datasets. The key contribution is the **seamless integration of the inherently non-differentiable nature of ODTs within a differentiable deep learning framework**.

#### Two-Level Ensemble
The two-level ensemble method is a crucial innovation in the DOFEN architecture, designed to address the challenge of effectively combining multiple relaxed oblivious decision trees (rODTs).  A single large ensemble of rODTs risks overfitting, hence, DOFEN employs a two-stage approach. The **first level** involves randomly selecting a subset of rODTs and combining them into individual forests.  This introduces diversity and prevents overfitting. The **second level** then combines these individual forests through another ensemble step, much like a standard ensemble method. This two-level strategy combines the advantages of both single forest methods and multiple forest ensembles; namely, the effectiveness of the individual forest in mitigating overfitting and the enhanced performance of the multi-forest ensemble.  This hierarchical arrangement not only **improves predictive performance** but also **enhances model stability** and robustness, ultimately contributing to DOFEN's superior performance on tabular datasets.

#### DOFEN Limits
Analyzing potential limitations of a hypothetical "DOFEN Limits" section in a research paper, we might expect discussion on computational cost.  **DOFEN, being a deep learning model, likely demands significant computational resources for training and inference**, especially when dealing with large datasets, a common issue in deep learning applications.  Another potential limitation could be **data dependency**. The performance of DNNs is heavily influenced by the characteristics of the training data; if the test data differs significantly from the training data, DOFEN's generalization ability could be compromised.  **Interpretability** presents a persistent challenge for deep learning models. Although the paper might incorporate methods to enhance DOFEN's interpretability,  fully understanding its decision-making process can be difficult. Finally, a comprehensive "DOFEN Limits" section would likely explore potential **scalability issues**. While the architecture might work well for medium-sized datasets, scaling to extremely large datasets or high-dimensional data could pose significant challenges in terms of memory usage, training time, and overall performance.

> This figure illustrates the three main modules of the DOFEN model: Condition Generation, Relaxed ODT Construction, and Forest Construction.  The Condition Generation module uses sub-networks (Œî1i) to generate conditions for each column (xi) of the input data, resulting in a matrix M. The Relaxed ODT Construction module shuffles and reshapes this matrix M into a matrix O representing NrODT relaxed oblivious decision trees (rODTs), each with depth d. Finally, the Forest Construction module uses sub-networks (Œî2i) to calculate weights (wi) for each rODT, paired with embedding vectors (ei), which are then aggregated to form w and E respectively. This process creates differentiable counterparts to ODTs which are then combined into a final model.

The table shows that pruning a small portion of rODTs (with lower standard deviation weights) doesn't hurt the performance and may even improve it slightly. However, when pruning rODTs with higher standard deviation weights, the performance decreases as the pruning ratio increases.
