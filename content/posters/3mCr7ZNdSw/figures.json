The x-axis represents the privacy budget (epsilon), and the y-axis represents the accuracy of a classifier trained on synthetic data generated from a source domain (MNIST or USPS) and tested on the target domain (USPS or MNIST respectively).  The figure demonstrates the performance of both algorithms across different privacy budgets and indicates that the proposed algorithm generally achieves higher accuracy.", "section": "Domain Adaptation"}, {"figure_path": "3mCr7ZNdSw/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Unsupervised domain adaptation between from MNIST to USPS and vice versa.", "description": "This figure shows the results of unsupervised domain adaptation experiments using two different methods (Algorithm 1 and SliceWass) and varying privacy budgets (epsilon).  The accuracy of a classifier trained on a source domain (MNIST or USPS) and tested on a target domain (USPS or MNIST, respectively) is plotted for different epsilon values. This demonstrates the performance of the proposed methods in adapting to new data distributions while maintaining privacy.", "section": "4.3 Domain Adaptation"}]
