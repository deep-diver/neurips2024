This paper introduces 'globality degree' to measure task difficulty and shows that high globality hinders efficient learning.  However, using 'inductive scratchpads' significantly improves learning and out-of-distribution generalization, particularly for tasks with inductive structures.", "takeaways": ["High globality of a task's distribution makes it difficult for standard Transformers to learn efficiently.", "Inductive scratchpad methods, which break down complex tasks into simpler steps, significantly improve learning and generalization.", "The notion of globality degree provides a valuable new measure for analyzing the difficulty of reasoning tasks for Transformers and other models."], "tldr": "Current Transformer models struggle with complex reasoning tasks involving multiple steps, such as composing syllogisms or solving problems requiring global reasoning.  This limitation, often referred to as a 'globality barrier', arises because these models struggle to capture long-range dependencies and correlations within the data.  Existing measures of complexity do not fully address this learnability issue. \nThis paper addresses this issue by introducing the concept of 'globality degree', a measure that quantifies how many tokens a model must attend to in order to efficiently learn a task. The researchers demonstrate a 'globality barrier' for high-globality tasks. To overcome this barrier, they propose novel 'scratchpad' techniques.  These techniques involve providing the model with intermediate reasoning steps or an 'inductive scratchpad' allowing more efficient composition of prior information.  The authors demonstrate that these improved scratchpad techniques can effectively break through the globality barrier, significantly enhancing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, particularly for tasks that admit an inductive decomposition.
