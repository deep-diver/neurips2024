The latent dimension (d) for each dataset, obtained from Pope et al. (2021), is included as it significantly influences the required nta.  Datasets with higher latent dimensions require more target samples for comparable performance to the pre-trained models.", "section": "4 Few-shot Diffusion Models Enjoy Better Approximation Error Bound"}]
