Finally, part (c) depicts atoms positioned on the faces of the unit cell.  The figure highlights how atoms at the boundaries of the unit cell are also considered to be part of neighboring unit cells because of the periodic boundary conditions.", "section": "3 Loss and metrics"}, {"figure_path": "I3kIEjoON6/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: a) Formation of conditions using formation energy, space group, and elemental representation, and b)Schematic depiction of the model architecture", "description": "This figure shows the architecture of the model used in the paper.
