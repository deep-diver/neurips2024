This is problematic because it creates distribution shifts between the models used for data collection and the models being aligned, resulting in suboptimal alignment.  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) uses online feedback, but it's inefficient and costly.  Prior work on using AI feedback for LLM alignment still suffers from off-policy issues. \nThis paper introduces Online AI Feedback (OAIF), a novel method that uses an LLM as an annotator to provide online feedback during training.  OAIF effectively addresses the offline feedback problem and distribution shifts by sampling two responses from the current model and having the LLM annotator choose the preferred one.  Experiments demonstrate that OAIF surpasses both offline DAP methods and RLHF in multiple alignment tasks, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability. Furthermore, OAIF's feedback is easily controllable through instruction prompts to the LLM annotator, providing more flexibility.", "affiliation": "OpenAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "zFHJUSTZka/podcast.wav"}
