### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current research on large language models (LLMs) often assumes that these models possess human-like causal reasoning capabilities. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support this claim.  Many studies show that LLMs mainly perform basic level-1 causal reasoning, heavily relying on information from their training data. This raises concerns about the true nature of causal reasoning in LLMs and their potential for making sound decisions in complex, real-world scenarios.

To investigate this issue, the authors introduce CausalProbe-2024, a novel benchmark dataset designed to assess the genuine causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.  They also propose a new method called G2-Reasoner, which enhances LLMs' causal reasoning by incorporating general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts. The results demonstrate that G2-Reasoner significantly enhances the performance of LLMs in handling novel and counterfactual situations, thus bringing LLMs closer to achieving human-like causal reasoning. This research highlights the importance of carefully evaluating LLM capabilities and exploring methods for improving their ability to perform genuine causal reasoning.

> This table presents the exact match scores achieved by four different large language models (LLMs) on four causal question answering benchmarks.  The LLMs are evaluated using three different methods: vanilla (direct inference), chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval augmented generation. The benchmarks include established datasets (COPA, e-CARE, CausalNet) and a newly introduced dataset (CausalProbe 2024), which is further divided into easier and harder sub-tasks (C-E and C-H).  The results highlight the performance differences between the LLMs and across different reasoning methods, showing how performance varies across different levels of causal reasoning complexity and how a new reasoning strategy might help enhance the performance.





### In-depth insights


#### Causal Reasoning
The concept of causal reasoning within the context of large language models (LLMs) is a complex one, marked by both promising capabilities and significant limitations.  While LLMs demonstrate proficiency in handling common, well-documented causal scenarios, **their performance degrades considerably when presented with novel, less frequently encountered instances**, suggesting a reliance on pattern recognition rather than true causal understanding.  This highlights a critical distinction between superficial, surface-level causal reasoning (level-1) that LLMs excel at, and the deeper, more nuanced, human-like causal reasoning (level-2) that remains largely elusive to current models.  Bridging this gap requires moving beyond the autoregressive mechanisms that currently underpin LLMs, and towards incorporating broader knowledge resources, goal-oriented prompts, and potentially more sophisticated model architectures that enable counterfactual thinking and genuine causal inference.

#### LLM Limitations
Large Language Models (LLMs), while demonstrating impressive capabilities, are not without limitations.  A crucial limitation is their reliance on **shallow, correlation-based reasoning**, rather than true causal understanding. This means LLMs excel at tasks involving readily available information but struggle with nuanced scenarios requiring counterfactual thinking or inferring causal relationships from limited data.  **Autoregressive architectures**, while efficient for text generation, inherently lack the capacity to model true causal structures, hindering deeper reasoning abilities. Moreover, the extent to which LLMs exhibit genuine causal understanding remains unclear. While their outputs might appear causally sound, they often merely reflect patterns learned from the training data, rather than true inferential capacity.  Therefore, **developing genuine causal reasoning in LLMs requires moving beyond simple pattern recognition to build models that can explicitly represent and reason about causal links.**  This is a significant challenge requiring both methodological innovations and advancements in the underlying theoretical frameworks of causality.  Addressing these limitations is key to unlocking the full potential of LLMs and advancing them toward more human-like intelligence.

#### G2-Reasoner
The proposed G2-Reasoner framework represents a novel approach to enhancing causal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs).  Its core innovation lies in incorporating **general knowledge** and **goal-oriented prompts** to guide the LLM's reasoning process, thereby moving beyond the limitations of existing methods.  This is a significant departure from current autoregressive LLMs which tend to rely on surface-level correlations and memorized patterns in the training data. The integration of external knowledge, potentially through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, allows the model to draw on broader contextual information and avoid spurious associations.  The goal-oriented prompts act as a powerful steering mechanism, ensuring the LLM stays focused on the core causal question rather than getting sidetracked by tangential issues.  While the empirical results might show moderate improvements in this initial presentation, the framework's potential to unlock genuine level-2 causal reasoning, akin to human-level cognition, is promising.  **Further research** and larger-scale experiments are needed to fully assess its effectiveness and potential limitations.

#### CausalProbe-2024
The proposed benchmark, **CausalProbe-2024**, aims to rigorously evaluate large language models' (LLMs) genuine causal reasoning capabilities.  Unlike previous benchmarks, CausalProbe-2024's datasets are made public *after* the training cutoff dates of several prominent LLMs, ensuring the evaluation data is genuinely novel for the models, thus reducing reliance on memorized patterns. This methodology allows for a more accurate assessment of LLMs' capacity to perform truly **novel causal reasoning**, going beyond simple association learning (level-1 reasoning) and potentially reaching a level of genuine causal understanding that mirrors human cognition (level-2 reasoning). The creation of CausalProbe-2024, with its multiple-choice and varying-difficulty question formats, provides a more nuanced and robust assessment of this crucial capability. The findings from using this benchmark are expected to help steer research towards advancing LLMs' genuine causal reasoning abilities.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore several key areas.  **Expanding the G2-Reasoner framework** is crucial, particularly by incorporating larger and more diverse knowledge bases, potentially using external APIs, to enhance the model's ability to reason with comprehensive, real-world information.  Further investigation into the limitations of autoregressive models in handling causal reasoning could lead to **developing alternative architectures** better suited for this task.  **Creating more sophisticated causal reasoning benchmarks** is also vital, moving beyond simplistic cause-and-effect scenarios and into complex, multi-causal scenarios.  This would require carefully designed datasets that address bias and ensure freshness, to accurately assess model performance in genuine, real-world causal understanding. Finally, **bridging the gap between level-1 and level-2 causal reasoning** remains a critical challenge.   This could involve investigating novel prompting strategies, developing hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods, or exploring new training methodologies specifically aimed at fostering genuine causal understanding in LLMs.

> This figure illustrates the difference between the actual causal relationship and the sequential causal relationship captured by autoregression in LLMs.  Panel (a) shows the ground truth causal relationship: rain causes school closure, which in turn causes Jack to learn at home. Panel (b) shows how autoregression might represent this: The model sees a sequence of events (rain, school closure, learn at home) and creates a shallow, sequential relationship.  It fails to properly model the actual causal links and might mistakenly infer causation where none exists, or miss crucial causal links present in the real-world scenario.
