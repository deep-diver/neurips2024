Existing metrics either focus solely on textual similarity, ignoring clinical aspects or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect (the pathology), neglecting other vital factors, leading to an inaccurate assessment. This often results in a mismatch between automated evaluation and the clinical judgment of radiologists. These limitations hinder the progress in developing robust and reliable AI-powered systems for medical report generation. \nThis paper proposes VLScore, a novel image-aware evaluation metric. **VLScore measures the similarity between radiology reports by considering the corresponding image.** The metric is shown to achieve strong alignment with radiologists' judgments and surpasses traditional methods in accuracy. The paper further introduces a new dataset with targeted perturbations to highlight existing metric weaknesses and provide a clear framework for analysis. The findings demonstrate that VLScore provides a more comprehensive and clinically relevant assessment of generated reports. **The enhanced accuracy and insights provided by VLScore will significantly advance the field**, enabling more robust evaluation of medical report generation models and ultimately improving AI-powered healthcare.", "affiliation": "Technion - Israel Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Summarization"}, "podcast_path": "ecPIg6o84Z/podcast.wav"}
