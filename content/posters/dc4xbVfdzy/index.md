### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces challenges with handling out-of-distribution data and noisy labels, especially when using transformer-based models. Existing approaches struggle to fully utilize historical temporal information and intra-step relationships among states, actions, and rewards. They also tend to overfit suboptimal trajectories with noisy labels. 

To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces Decision Mamba (DM), a multi-grained SSM with a self-evolving policy learning strategy.  DM models historical hidden states using a mamba architecture to capture temporal information and employs a fine-grained SSM module to capture intra-step relationships. A self-evolving policy, using progressive regularization, enhances robustness to noise.  Empirical results on benchmark tasks showcase DM's substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### Offline RL via SSM
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents unique challenges due to the absence of an interactive environment.  **State Space Models (SSMs)** offer a compelling alternative to traditional methods by explicitly modeling the system's hidden state and dynamics.  This approach allows for efficient representation of temporal dependencies in offline data, which is crucial for accurate policy learning.  **SSMs excel at handling long-range dependencies and complex sequential patterns** often found in offline RL datasets, enabling better generalization and robustness.  However, effectively leveraging SSMs in offline RL requires careful consideration of model design and training strategies to overcome challenges such as noisy data and overfitting.  **Addressing issues like model complexity and computational efficiency** will further unlock the potential of SSMs to advance the state-of-the-art in offline RL.

#### Multi-grained Mamba
The proposed "Multi-grained Mamba" architecture represents a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning by integrating both coarse-grained and fine-grained state space models (SSMs).  This dual-level approach is designed to effectively capture both the global temporal dynamics of a trajectory (coarse-grained) and the intricate local relationships among states, actions, and rewards within each time step (fine-grained). The **coarse-grained SSM** leverages the historical temporal information to effectively extract the sequential patterns, while the **fine-grained SSM** focuses on uncovering the intricate causal relationships at the intra-step level. This integration of different SSM scales allows the model to learn more comprehensive trajectory representations, potentially improving the robustness of decision-making in offline settings, especially when facing noisy or incomplete data. By **combining these aspects**, the model is able to gain a more detailed representation of both global trajectory patterns and local dynamics, allowing it to generate better decision outcomes. The integration within the Mamba architecture further enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of this multi-scale modeling technique.

#### Self-evolving Policy
A self-evolving policy is a machine learning model that iteratively improves its own decision-making process.  **Instead of relying solely on a fixed set of training data**, it uses its past experience and performance to refine its strategies over time. This approach offers several advantages, such as **enhanced robustness to noisy or incomplete data**,  **adaptive learning in dynamic environments**, and **better generalization to unseen situations**. A key aspect of a self-evolving policy is the mechanism by which it updates its internal representation. This often involves reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the model to learn from its successes and failures. However, designing an effective self-evolution mechanism requires careful consideration of several factors, including the model's architecture, the learning rate, and the balance between exploration and exploitation.  **Overfitting is a significant risk**, therefore regularization techniques are crucial to ensure that the model doesn't become overly specialized to its past experiences.  Overall, the use of self-evolving policies offers a powerful new paradigm for creating AI systems that can continuously learn and adapt.

#### Empirical Evaluation
A robust empirical evaluation section should meticulously detail the experimental setup, including datasets used, metrics for assessment, and baseline algorithms compared against.  **Clear descriptions of the model's hyperparameters and training procedures** are essential for reproducibility. The results should be presented systematically, possibly using tables and graphs for easy interpretation, and statistical significance should be rigorously addressed to avoid spurious conclusions.  **Comparing the proposed method against multiple established baselines**, rather than just one or two, strengthens the evaluation.  The analysis of the results should extend beyond simply reporting performance metrics; it should also explore the model's behavior under various conditions and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses. A thoughtful discussion of unexpected results and limitations is also crucial for demonstrating a thorough and insightful empirical evaluation.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this Decision Mamba model could involve several key areas.  **Extending the model to handle continuous action spaces** would broaden its applicability to a wider range of real-world problems.  Currently, the model is tailored for discrete actions; continuous adaptation would significantly enhance its practical use.  **Investigating more sophisticated regularization techniques** beyond the progressive self-evolution method could further improve robustness and mitigate overfitting on noisy data. Exploring alternative regularization methods, or combining them with the current approach, is worth investigating.  **Incorporating uncertainty estimation** into the model's predictions would be valuable, allowing for more informed decision-making in situations with inherent stochasticity.  This could involve Bayesian methods or other approaches to quantify uncertainty.  Finally, **evaluating the model's performance on more complex and diverse tasks** beyond those in the benchmark datasets is crucial for assessing its true capabilities and generalizability.

> üîº This figure illustrates the Progressive Self-Evolution Regularization (PSER) process.  It shows three steps: 1) The previous step's policy (k-1) generates action labels. 2) These labels are refined by combining them with the current policy's predictions (k), using a weighted average controlled by Œ≤k. The weighting emphasizes the current step's prediction when Œ≤k is closer to 0 and the previous step's prediction when Œ≤k is close to 1. 3) The refined labels are then used to compute a loss function (LPSE,k), guiding the training process to focus more on clean data while mitigating the effects of noisy data points (represented by the red circle).
