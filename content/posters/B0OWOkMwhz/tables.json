The baseline is the original MVSplat model, and the other rows show variations in which specific components are added or modified.  These components include the use of a Stable Video Diffusion model (+SVD), incorporating cross attention across views (+ctx-attn), and the use of Gaussian Splat features (+GS-feat) that are fed into the SVD.

The metrics used for evaluation are SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), DISTS (Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity), and FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance).  The results show that incorporating the SVD (Stable Video Diffusion) model, cross-attention mechanisms, and the rendering of 3D Gaussian splatting features significantly improves the performance.  The number of input views also impacts performance, with better scores obtained using 6 or 7 views compared to using only 3 or 4 views.
