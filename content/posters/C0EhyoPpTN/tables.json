Lower values of  *D<sub>stsp</sub>* and *D<sub>H</sub>* indicate better reconstruction quality, while 'dim' represents the dimensionality of the latent dynamical system and |\u03b8| represents the number of trainable parameters. The results show that the SMC method achieves similar reconstruction accuracy to GTF but with significantly lower dimensionality (3 vs 16).", "section": "3.2 Stochasticity allows recovering low-dimensional latents underlying EEG data"}, {"figure_path": "C0EhyoPpTN/tables/tables_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Lower dimensional latent dynamics than SOTA at same sample quality.
