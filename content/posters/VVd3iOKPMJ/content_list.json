But adapting these models for a specific task is a resource-intensive process [35]. The cost of fine-tuning large foundation models today is already prohibitive to most individuals and organizations. As they continue to grow in size, the rising costs of foundation models risk excluding all but the wealthiest organizations. To mitigate this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have been proposed. These methods incorporate rank-deficient [18] and simple affine modules [31] or learnable prompt parameters injected at the input stage [20]. Their core principle is to limit the number of parameters that need to be trained. We extend this principle to its logical conclusion by introducing no intermediate parameters or prompts, and investigate whether it is possible to completely separate the foundation model from the training process.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
