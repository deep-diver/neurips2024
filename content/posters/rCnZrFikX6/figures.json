It starts with a time series of point clouds representing collective behavior.  Each point cloud is processed using persistent homology to generate a persistence diagram, which summarizes the topological features of the point cloud. These diagrams are then vectorized into a numerical representation. The NPD framework then models the dynamics of these vectorized persistence diagrams using a latent ordinary differential equation (ODE).  Finally, a regression model is used to predict the parameters of the governing equations that describe the collective behavior based on the latent ODE's output.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "rCnZrFikX6/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Conceptual overview of Neural Persistence Dynamics.

These features are vectorized and input to a latent ODE, a type of neural network that models continuous changes over time.  The model's latent path is then used to predict parameters of a governing equation for collective behavior, such as flocking or swarming.

The distribution is concentrated in a triangular region, indicating a positive correlation between birth and death rates.
