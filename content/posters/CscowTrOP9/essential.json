Existing methods, including those based on implicit neural representations (INR), often struggle with preserving high-frequency details and achieving global perceptual consistency.  This leads to suboptimal fusion results with loss of important information.\n\nTo address these issues, the researchers introduce FeINFN.  This innovative framework leverages **Fourier analysis to capture and enhance high-frequency information** and a novel spatial-frequency interactive decoder to combine information effectively.  The results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in objective metrics and visual quality on benchmark datasets, proving the effectiveness of their proposed approach. **The theoretical proof of the Gabor wavelet activation's time-frequency tightness property** further strengthens the method's foundation.", "affiliation": "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "CscowTrOP9/podcast.wav"}
