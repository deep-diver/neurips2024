As indicated by the path example on the left, which is also a tree, the worst-case resilience of any tree is r = O(log d), but for bounded-depth trees, r = O(1).", "description": "This figure shows three different graph structures (path, tree, and grid) commonly found in real-world data.  Each graph represents a different type of structured data: sequential (path), hierarchical (tree), and spatial (grid).  The figure highlights how the *graph resilience* (a novel quantity introduced in the paper) differs for each structure and how this resilience impacts the sample complexity of density estimation.  Lower resilience leads to lower sample complexity and a mitigation of the curse of dimensionality. The path graph has a resilience of O(log d), the tree graph has a resilience of O(1), and the grid graph has a resilience of o(d).", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "dWwin2uGYE/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Heatmaps of the magnitude of the correlation between red pixel and every other pixel, using the CIFAR-10 training set. The left image shows the correlation without conditioning, the right image shows correlation conditioned on the green pixels. We see that the modeling the image as a Markov random grid is valid.", "description": "The figure shows two heatmaps illustrating the correlation between a red pixel and all other pixels in an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The left heatmap displays the correlation without any conditioning, while the right heatmap shows the correlation conditioned on a set of green pixels.  The comparison highlights how conditioning on neighboring pixels significantly reduces the correlation with distant pixels, supporting the validity of modeling images as Markov random grids.", "section": "3 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "dWwin2uGYE/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Comparison of L3\u00d73 (left) and L3\u00d73 (right).", "description": "This figure shows two different graph structures, L3x3 and L3x3, which represent a 3x3 grid graph and its power graph, respectively.  The power graph L3x3 includes edges connecting vertices that are at most a distance of 1 away from each other in the original L3x3 grid. This demonstrates how the concept of a power graph, used in the context of graph resilience, can create significant differences in connectivity and complexity that directly affect the speed of density estimation.", "section": "4 Graph Resilience Examples"}, {"figure_path": "dWwin2uGYE/figures/figures_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Comparison of L3\u00d73 (left) and L3\u00d73 (right).", "description": "This figure compares two grid graphs: L3x3 which is a 3x3 grid where each node connects to its horizontal and vertical neighbors and L3x3 which is the power graph of L3x3 with power 1.
