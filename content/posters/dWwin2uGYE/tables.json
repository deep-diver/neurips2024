Resilience, a novel graphical parameter introduced in the paper, quantifies the connectivity of a graph and determines the sample complexity of estimating a density that is Markov to that graph. The table shows that the sample complexity scales with resilience r rather than the ambient dimension d, highlighting the potential for significant improvements in density estimation for structured data.  It demonstrates how different graph structures lead to different resilience values (e.g., constant resilience for bounded depth trees, logarithmic resilience for general trees and paths, and sublinear resilience for grid graphs), resulting in varying degrees of improvement in sample complexity compared to the standard nonparametric rate.", "section": "4.2 Example Graph Resiliences"}]
