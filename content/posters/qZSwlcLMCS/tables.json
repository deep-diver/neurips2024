FID-50K, Precision, and Recall are evaluated on 50K samples, while MSS and Vendi scores assess diversity on 1K \u00d7 10 samples.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed Kaleido Diffusion model against a standard Diffusion Model (MDM) and MDM with CADS (Condition Annealed Diffusion Sampler) on the ImageNet dataset.  It evaluates the models across several metrics: FID-50K (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), Precision, Recall, MSS (Mean Similarity Score), and Vendi score. FID-50K measures the overall quality and diversity of generated images, while Precision and Recall specifically focus on the diversity. MSS and Vendi scores provide additional quantitative measures of image diversity, computed using features extracted from two different pre-trained models (SSCD and DiNOv2).  Lower FID, higher Precision and Recall, and lower MSS and higher Vendi scores indicate better performance.", "section": "4.2 Quantitative Results"}]
