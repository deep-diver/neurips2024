This makes it difficult to create robust and generalizable models that perform well across different datasets.  Additionally, existing methods often output a specific format (pre-defined joints, keypoints, or meshes), limiting flexibility for downstream applications. \nThe proposed Neural Localizer Fields (NLF) method addresses these challenges by learning a continuous field of point localizer functions. This allows the model to query any arbitrary point within the human volume and obtain its estimated location in 3D.  NLF outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks by efficiently unifying diverse data sources and easily handling various annotation formats, including meshes, 2D/3D skeletons, and dense pose, demonstrating the model's scalability and versatility.", "affiliation": "University of T\u00fcbingen", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "RrTjcbcHEH/podcast.wav"}
