This limits their ability to accurately predict protein functions, which are intricately linked to 3D structure. Existing structure-aware PLMs have limitations in representing local structural details and explicitly modeling the relationship between protein sequences and structures.\nProSST solves this by introducing a structure quantization module that converts 3D protein structures into a sequence of discrete tokens, capturing fine-grained structural details.  **It uses a Transformer architecture with disentangled attention to explicitly model the interplay between protein sequences and structures.**  Extensive pre-training on millions of protein structures enables ProSST to learn rich contextual representations.  The model achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot mutation prediction and several downstream tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of its novel approach.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4Z7RZixpJQ/podcast.wav"}
