It shows the forward and reverse diffusion processes graphically, using the task of sorting three MNIST 4-digit images as an example. The forward process adds noise to an ordered list of images (a permutation), while the reverse process uses a neural network to learn the transitions and recover the original ordering. The figure depicts the marginal distribution of ranked image lists at each timestep and a randomly drawn image list at the end.", "section": "3 Learning Diffusion Models on Finite Symmetric Groups"}, {"figure_path": "7Su7gAei1l/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: This figure illustrates our discrete diffusion model on finite symmetric groups.

The model decomposes the complicated task of learning a distribution over the symmetric group into a sequence of simpler problems, namely learning individual transitions of the reverse diffusion process.", "section": "3 Learning Diffusion Models on Finite Symmetric Groups"}]
