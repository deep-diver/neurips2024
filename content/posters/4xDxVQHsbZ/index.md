### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally expensive, making inference on CPUs challenging due to the large number of multiply-add (MAD) operations in attention mechanisms.  Existing methods struggle to handle the quadratic computational complexity of attention, and simply relying on GPUs is costly and limits accessibility.  This paper aims to improve this situation.

The paper introduces NOMAD-Attention, a novel method that replaces MAD operations with in-register lookups using SIMD registers on CPUs. This is accomplished via Product Quantization (PQ) to estimate dot products, compressing lookup tables into SIMD registers, and reorganizing the key cache layout for parallel processing.  Experimental results show that NoMAD-Attention achieves up to 2x speedup on a 4-bit quantized LLaMA-7B model while maintaining performance.

### In-depth insights


#### CPU-LLM Inference
CPU-based inference for large language models (LLMs) presents a significant challenge due to the computational demands of the attention mechanism.  Traditional attention mechanisms rely heavily on multiply-accumulate (MAD) operations, which are computationally expensive on CPUs.  **The core bottleneck lies in the quadratic complexity of attention, making it particularly inefficient for longer sequences.**  However, modern CPUs possess Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) registers capable of ultra-low latency lookups.  **Efficient algorithms can leverage these registers to replace MAD operations with fast in-register lookups, significantly improving performance.**  This approach, as demonstrated in research, enables faster inference without sacrificing model quality by cleverly transforming dot-product computations into memory lookups through techniques like product quantization and optimizing data layout within the SIMD registers for efficient batch processing. **The potential for improved efficiency is substantial, enabling the deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained devices such as CPUs while retaining accuracy and performance.**

#### NoMAD-Attention
NoMAD-Attention, as presented in the research paper, proposes a novel approach to significantly enhance the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference on CPUs.  The core innovation lies in replacing computationally expensive multiply-add (MAD) operations, typically dominating attention mechanisms, with ultra-fast in-register lookups.  **This is achieved by leveraging Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) registers**, a commonly available feature in modern CPUs, to store and access pre-computed dot-product lookup tables (LUTs).  The method employs product quantization to approximate attention scores, enabling efficient lookup-based computation.  **NoMAD-Attention demonstrates hardware-aware algorithmic designs** to overcome the limitations of SIMD register size, cleverly compressing and reorganizing the data layout for optimal performance.  **The technique is demonstrated to be compatible with pre-trained models**, requiring no fine-tuning, resulting in substantial speed improvements (up to 2x) without compromising LLM quality, particularly with quantized models and longer context lengths. The research highlights the effectiveness of exploiting underutilized CPU capabilities for efficient LLM inference.

#### SIMD Register Use
The effective utilization of SIMD registers is a **central theme** in this research, revolving around the core idea of replacing computationally expensive multiply-add operations with faster in-register lookups.  The paper highlights the **unique potential** of SIMD registers for ultra-low-latency data access, especially within the context of CPU-based LLM inference.  **Product quantization** plays a crucial role, enabling the transformation of dot product computations into efficient table lookups stored within the SIMD registers. This approach is further enhanced by a **hardware-aware algorithmic design** that cleverly optimizes memory layout and data access patterns to maximize SIMD parallelism.  However, the limited capacity of SIMD registers presents a challenge, necessitating techniques such as **8-bit quantization of dot products** to effectively fit lookup tables into these limited resources.  The success of this method rests heavily on the careful balancing of accuracy and speed, a key focus of the experimental evaluation.

#### Quantization Methods
Effective quantization methods are crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices.  **Post-training quantization**, applied after model training, is particularly attractive due to its simplicity.  However, it can lead to accuracy degradation.  This necessitates exploring advanced quantization techniques that minimize information loss.  **Product quantization (PQ)**, a vector quantization method, emerges as a promising approach for efficient compression and approximation of dot products. This method transforms computationally expensive operations into fast lookups, which is particularly advantageous for CPU-based inference. The choice of **bit-depth (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit)** significantly impacts the trade-off between model size, speed, and accuracy.  Furthermore, dynamic quantization, adapting the quantization parameters per query, can further improve accuracy.  **Fisher information matrix (FIM)-informed quantization** is another advanced strategy to guide the quantization process based on the importance of different parts of the model, maintaining accuracy even with aggressive compression levels. The selection of optimal quantization methods and bit-depths depends on several factors, including the specific LLM architecture, hardware constraints, and acceptable accuracy loss.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from the NoMAD-Attention paper could explore **extending its applicability to diverse LLM architectures** beyond the tested decoder-only models.  Investigating its performance with **encoder-decoder models** and those using different attention mechanisms (e.g., Longformer, Performer) would broaden its impact.  **Optimizing the product quantization technique** itself is key; exploring alternative quantization methods or adaptive quantization strategies based on token importance could improve accuracy and speed.  Furthermore,  **exploring hardware-specific optimizations** tailored to specific CPU instruction sets and memory hierarchies beyond AVX-2 would yield even greater efficiency gains. A crucial area of future work involves **thorough analysis of the trade-offs between speed and accuracy** for different quantization levels, providing concrete guidelines for selecting optimal parameters based on specific application needs.  Finally, researching the potential of **integrating NoMAD-Attention with other CPU-oriented optimization strategies** (e.g., sparsity techniques) to achieve further efficiency improvements presents a promising avenue.

The results show that NoMAD-Attention consistently achieves a significant speedup, particularly noticeable at longer prompt lengths (1.63-1.79x speedup for 16K tokens).  Both 4-bit and 16-bit quantized weight versions of the model are shown.

> This figure breaks down the latency of decoding for a 4-bit CodeLlama-7b model, comparing the standard Attention mechanism with the proposed NOMAD-Attention method for different levels of sub-quantization (dsub). It visually represents the time spent on various components of the decoding process:  - Others (other operations) - Key Caching - Query x Key (Q x K) dot products - Attention Scores x Value (Attention Score x V) multiplication - Attention Linears - MLP Linears The figure demonstrates that NOMAD-Attention significantly reduces the latency of computing the query-key dot products compared to the traditional Attention mechanism. This reduction becomes more significant with higher levels of sub-quantization.

> This figure illustrates how a key vector (k<sup>t</sup>) is processed in the NOMAD-Attention method.  First, the key vector is split into sub-vectors using the function œÄ<sub>s</sub>, one for each sub-quantizer (s = 1...S). Each sub-vector is then mapped to its nearest centroid (b<sub>s</sub>) within the corresponding codebook. The index of the closest centroid (c<sup>t</sup><sub>s</sub>) is then stored in the key cache (K<sup>t</sup><sub>cache</sub>), which is used for fast lookups later in the process. This product quantization technique converts the computationally expensive dot-product calculation into a simple lookup operation.

> This figure illustrates the process of Product Quantization (PQ) for query vectors.  The query vector is split into sub-vectors, and each sub-vector's distance to 16 centroids (cluster centers) in a codebook is calculated. These distances are quantized to 8-bit codes and stored in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient retrieval during the attention computation.  The LUT contains pre-computed dot products, allowing for a faster lookup than traditional multiply-add operations. This method is crucial for NoMAD-Attention's efficiency.

The key observation is that NoMAD-Attention significantly reduces the latency associated with computing query-key dot products, leading to a substantial overall reduction in decoding latency.  The reduction factor varies depending on the value of `dsub` in the NoMAD-Attention algorithm.
