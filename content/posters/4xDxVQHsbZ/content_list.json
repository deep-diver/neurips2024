Hardware-aware attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention [12] propose to mitigate the IO bottleneck in GPUs. In large language models, multiple approaches [60, 28, 58] have been proposed to reduce the high memory overhead of the KV cache.

We give full details of lines 5 to 11 in Algorithm 2 in Algorithm 3. Keys are stored in blocks of 32, in which keys are stored in an alternating order (see Figure 1 for an illustration). After a LUT is loaded into registers, the row of key codes in the block corresponding to the sub-quantizer is used to perform shuffle. First, each byte in the row is bit-shifted to the right by 4 bits via a SIMD instruction, which produces the codes of the first 16 keys in the block. The codes are fed to shuffle to retrieve the quantized dot products of the first 16 keys from the LUT. Then, the first 4 bits of each byte in the row are masked out via a SIMD instruction, which produces the code of the last 16 keys in the block. They are similarly used to retrieve the quantized dot products from the LUT. The retrieved quantized dot products of 32 keys are accumulated in the accumulator. Since quantized dot products are 8 bits wide, accumulating them in 8-bit accumulators easily results in overflows. Therefore, 16-bit accumulators are used to accumulate quantized dot products.
