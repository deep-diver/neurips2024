It consists of four subplots: training loss, test accuracy, signal learning, and noise memorization.  Each subplot displays the performance of both methods across 200 epochs. The results show that multi-modal contrastive learning generally achieves lower training loss and higher test accuracy, indicating better generalization.  The signal learning curve suggests that multi-modal learning focuses more on learning signal information, while single-modal learning might concentrate on memorizing noise.", "section": "Experiments"}]
