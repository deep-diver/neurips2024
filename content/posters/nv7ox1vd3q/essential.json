Classical approaches use non-smooth penalties, leading to computational challenges. Recent works employ Hadamard over-parameterization for smooth, non-convex formulations, improving numerical stability and convergence. However, theoretical understanding of their convergence remains limited.  This research focuses on the challenges of existing approaches in handling high-dimensional datasets, especially when the underlying signals are sparse or exhibit group sparsity.  Many existing analyses only provide convergence guarantees or focus on worst-case scenarios, without characterizing the statistical properties of the solutions. \nThis paper presents a unified asymptotic analysis for a family of algorithms including iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), and linear recursive feature machines (lin-RFM). The analysis operates in a batched setting with i.i.d. Gaussian covariates, showing that with appropriate reweighting, these algorithms can achieve favorable performance in just a few iterations.  Furthermore, the study extends to group-sparse recovery, proving that group-sparse reweighting significantly improves accuracy. The results are validated through simulations, showcasing strong alignment between theoretical predictions and empirical observations.  The work provides a rigorous understanding of the behavior of the algorithms, revealing insights into their convergence and sample complexity.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "nv7ox1vd3q/podcast.wav"}
