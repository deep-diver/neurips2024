Current approaches often rely on global protein representations which may overlook crucial local micro-environmental details that significantly impact mutation effects.  This limitation hinders their predictive accuracy and robustness. \n\nThis research introduces a novel retrieval-augmented framework that addresses this by creating a database of local structure motif embeddings from a pre-trained protein structure encoder. This allows for efficient retrieval of similar local structure motifs during mutation effect prediction, effectively capturing crucial co-evolutionary information. The new method significantly enhances accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets, offering a scalable solution for studying mutation effects.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LgeHswiWef/podcast.wav"}
