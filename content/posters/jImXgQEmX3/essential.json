{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working with large language models (LLMs) and aiming to build more adaptable and human-aligned AI agents.  It introduces a novel framework, **AMOR**, that tackles the limitations of existing methods by using a **finite state machine** for reasoning and **process feedback** for adaptation.  This significantly improves performance, offers greater explainability and human control, and opens avenues for future research in LLM-based agent development.", "summary": "AMOR: Adaptable Modular knowledge agent using LLMs, excels with FSM-based reasoning and process feedback, enabling human supervision and domain adaptation.", "takeaways": ["AMOR uses a finite state machine (FSM) for structured reasoning, improving adaptability and human supervision.", "Process feedback is significantly more effective than outcome feedback in improving LLM agent reasoning.", "AMOR demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing methods across multiple domains."], "tldr": "Current LLM-based agents struggle with complex reasoning, lack adaptability, and are difficult to align with human intent.  Existing methods often rely on outcome feedback, which is insufficient to improve intermediate steps.  They also suffer from uncontrollable reasoning logic or static model capabilities. \nThe paper presents AMOR, a novel framework addressing these limitations. AMOR leverages open-source LLMs and uses a finite state machine (FSM) for structured reasoning and process feedback.  The FSM allows for human supervision at each module, while the process feedback enables effective adaptation to new domains.  Extensive experiments show significant performance gains compared to baselines, highlighting the advantages of this approach.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "jImXgQEmX3/podcast.wav"}
