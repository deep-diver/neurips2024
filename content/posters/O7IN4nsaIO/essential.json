Traditional methods, however, often struggle with convergence due to inconsistencies in locally computed adaptive stepsizes. This inconsistency arises from the lack of coordination in stepsizes among different nodes in the distributed system, leading to non-convergence or significantly slower convergence speeds.\nThe paper proposes D-AdaST, a novel Distributed Adaptive minimax method with Stepsize Tracking. D-AdaST employs an innovative stepsize tracking protocol involving the transmission of only two extra scalar variables. This protocol maintains stepsize consistency, addressing the challenges of existing methods.  Theoretically, the authors prove that D-AdaST achieves a near-optimal convergence rate under specific assumptions, matching the performance of centralized methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of D-AdaST over existing methods in various real-world applications.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "O7IN4nsaIO/podcast.wav"}
