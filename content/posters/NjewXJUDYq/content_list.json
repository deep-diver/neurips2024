We consider three additional pretraining schemes. Setup 1 uses an interleaved unit-text sequence without a correspondence relationship, relying solely on continuation, similar to previous works [44, 56]. Setup 2 utilizes data that maintains only a correspondence relationship, as seen in Zhang et al. [25]. Setup 3 is similar to our fine-tuning approach, interleaving speech with its transcript and subsequent text and speech, as proposed in Nachmani et al. [57].

We then calculate the average PPL for all combinations by taking the logarithm of each subsequent modality\u2019s PPL within each sequence type, averaging these logarithmic values, and then applying the exponential function.

We also show in Table 3 that our speech-text model is beneficial to spoken dialog modeling, as evidenced by the WER, METEOR, and ROUGE-L scores.

We calculate the probability that each token in the generated response attends to each token in the input unit sequence and corresponding transcript by averaging the probabilities across all heads of the attention modules for each layer. Subsequently, we aggregate these probabilities for input unit tokens to compute a cumulative probability for the speech input, and similarly for text tokens relative to the transcript.

We showed that USDM outperforms the baselines regarding content, prosody, and naturalness as a spoken response for the DailyTalk dataset. Additionally, we demonstrated that our pretraining and fine-tuning scheme beneftis the USDM in modeling spoken dialog through ablation studies.

Firstly, the exploration of datasets and models used for pretraining is limited. Further investigation is necessary to determine which data are crucial for our pretraining scheme and to explore whether our pretraining scheme could be effective with other LLMs beyond Mistral-7B. Secondly, building a spoken dialog model capable of directly generating spoken responses from input spoken dialog without the need for cross-modal chaining can be a promising direction. Next, the current pretraining scheme is based on tens of thousands of hours of English data, and it has limitations when applied to other languages with relatively smaller amounts of speech data compared to English. We plan to expand our model to a variety of languages in addition to English. Lastly, we also plan to investigate whether our pretraining approach is beneficial for other speech-text tasks beyond spoken dialog modeling.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
