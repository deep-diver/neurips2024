Current approaches often treat temporal graphs as sequences of static snapshots, neglecting the continuous evolution of the underlying graph structure.  This can result in inefficient modeling and suboptimal performance. \n\nThis paper proposes GRAPHSSM, a novel framework that uses state space models (SSMs) to directly model the continuous-time dynamics of temporal graphs. By integrating structural information via Laplacian regularization, it overcomes the limitations of sequence-based models.  GRAPHSSM shows improved performance compared to existing approaches across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies and handling large-scale graphs efficiently.", "affiliation": "Sun Yat-sen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "UaJErAOssN/podcast.wav"}
