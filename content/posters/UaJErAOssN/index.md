### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Temporal graph learning is crucial but faces challenges with existing methods like RNNs (long-range dependencies) and Transformers (high complexity).  Current approaches often treat temporal graphs as sequences of static snapshots, neglecting the continuous evolution of the underlying graph structure.  This can result in inefficient modeling and suboptimal performance. 



This paper proposes GRAPHSSM, a novel framework that uses state space models (SSMs) to directly model the continuous-time dynamics of temporal graphs. By integrating structural information via Laplacian regularization, it overcomes the limitations of sequence-based models.  GRAPHSSM shows improved performance compared to existing approaches across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies and handling large-scale graphs efficiently.

### In-depth insights


#### Temporal Graph SSMs
Temporal Graph State Space Models (SSMs) represent a powerful advancement in handling dynamic graph data.  **Traditional sequence models like RNNs and Transformers struggle with the complexities of temporal dependencies and computational costs associated with large graphs.**  SSMs offer an elegant solution by framing the temporal graph as a discretized representation of an underlying continuous-time system. This approach allows for efficient modeling of long-range dependencies, which are often problematic for other methods.  **The key challenge lies in incorporating the inherent structural information of the graph into the SSM framework.**  This typically involves integrating graph-specific operators (like Laplacian regularization) into the model's objective function, which necessitates novel algorithmic solutions for efficient online approximation and discretization.  **The resulting models are often piecewise linear, reflecting the dynamic nature of edge additions and deletions.**  This piecewise property introduces additional complexities in the discretization process, necessitating methods to handle unobserved mutations.  Overall, Temporal Graph SSMs present a promising research direction offering efficiency and scalability advantages over existing methods, though careful consideration of discretization and handling of unobserved changes remains crucial for robust performance.

#### GHIPPO Abstraction
The GHIPPO abstraction, a core contribution of the paper, extends the HIPPO framework to temporal graphs.  **It frames the problem of continuous-time dynamic modeling as an online function approximation task**, moving beyond independent sequence modeling to integrate the evolving graph structure.  This is achieved by incorporating a Laplacian regularization term into the objective function, **encouraging smoothness of memory compression across interconnected nodes**. The resulting dynamical system is piecewise linear, capturing both feature dynamics and topological changes, but this piecewise nature introduces subsequent algorithmic challenges for discretization.  **The key innovation lies in effectively compressing both feature and structural information simultaneously**, unlike prior SSM approaches that primarily focus on individual sequences, representing a significant step toward truly understanding temporal graph dynamics.  The Laplacian regularization elegantly incorporates the graph structure, making GHIPPO a principled approach for temporal graph modeling.

#### GRAPHSSM Framework
The GRAPHSSM framework, a novel approach for modeling temporal graph dynamics, integrates state-space models (SSMs) with graph neural networks (GNNs).  **Its core innovation lies in the GHIPPO abstraction**, which efficiently compresses historical information from temporal graphs through a Laplacian regularized online function approximation. Unlike traditional SSMs primarily designed for independent sequences, GRAPHSSM directly incorporates the graph's evolving structure.  The framework introduces a piecewise dynamical system, efficiently addressing the challenges of unobserved graph mutations using a **mixed discretization strategy**, combining GNNs with novel node feature and representation mixing mechanisms.  GRAPHSSM's design enables **scalable and efficient handling of long temporal sequences** with impressive empirical results surpassing existing baselines on various benchmarks.  The framework is highly flexible, accommodating different SSM architectures (S4, S5, S6) with choices for mixing strategies and initialization techniques to optimize performance for different datasets.

#### Mixed Discretization
The core challenge addressed by 'Mixed Discretization' is how to effectively handle unobserved graph mutations when discretizing the continuous-time dynamics of temporal graphs.  Standard discretization methods fail because they assume continuous observations, while in reality, the underlying graph structure changes between observed snapshots. The solution proposed involves a **mixed discretization strategy** that combines two approaches: **inter-node mixing** (approximating diffusion among nodes using graph neural networks) and **intra-node mixing** (combining features from consecutive snapshots). This approach cleverly addresses the lack of observed graph mutations by leveraging the relational structure inherent in temporal graphs. The inter-node mixing step incorporates connectivity information to approximate the continuous evolution while intra-node mixing uses a learned mechanism to blend information from adjacent snapshots.  This approach's effectiveness is supported by empirical results showing enhanced performance, making it a significant contribution to the field. The piecewise continuous time nature of the underlying dynamics poses a challenge, but mixed discretization effectively bridges the gap between continuous theory and discrete observations.

#### Future Extensions
The research paper's 'Future Extensions' section could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the GHIPPO framework to handle continuous-time temporal graphs (CTTGs)** is crucial, as current methods struggle with the inherent continuous nature of many real-world networks. This would require addressing the challenges of unobserved mutations and developing robust discretization techniques beyond piecewise linear approximations.  **Investigating alternative memory compression schemes** that facilitate smoother dynamical systems, possibly through modified Laplacian regularizations or objective functions, is another key area.  Furthermore, **research into more sophisticated mixing mechanisms** to better approximate unobserved dynamics between discrete snapshots would significantly improve accuracy.  Finally, **exploring the applicability of GRAPHSSM to different types of graph neural networks (GNNs)** and evaluating its performance on a wider range of benchmarks would enhance the framework's generalizability and establish its practical effectiveness.

> üîº This figure illustrates the problem of unobserved graph mutations in temporal graphs.  The underlying graph changes at times t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, t‚ÇÑ, and t‚ÇÖ, but these changes are not observed directly. Instead, only snapshots of the graph are observed at times œÑ‚ÇÅ, œÑ‚ÇÇ, and œÑ‚ÇÉ.  These unobserved mutations make it difficult to model the continuous-time evolution of the graph using standard ODE discretization methods.

In this example, the underlying graph is observed at time points œÑ‚ÇÅ, œÑ‚ÇÇ, œÑ‚ÇÉ with two unobserved mutations between [œÑ‚ÇÅ, œÑ‚ÇÇ) and one between [œÑ‚ÇÇ, œÑ‚ÇÉ). These unobserved mutations result in temporal dynamics that are inconsistent across the observed intervals, thereby complicating direct applications of ODE discretization methods such as the Euler method or the zero-order hold (ZOH) method.
