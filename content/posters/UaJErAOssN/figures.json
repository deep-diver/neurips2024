The framework consists of multiple blocks, each containing a graph convolution layer, an SSM layer, and a residual connection.

In this example, the underlying graph is observed at time points \u03c4\u2081, \u03c4\u2082, \u03c4\u2083 with two unobserved mutations between [\u03c4\u2081, \u03c4\u2082) and one between [\u03c4\u2082, \u03c4\u2083). These unobserved mutations result in temporal dynamics that are inconsistent across the observed intervals, thereby complicating direct applications of ODE discretization methods such as the Euler method or the zero-order hold (ZOH) method.", "description": "This figure illustrates the problem of unobserved graph mutations in temporal graphs.  The underlying graph changes at times t\u2081, t\u2082, t\u2084, and t\u2085, but these changes are not observed directly. Instead, only snapshots of the graph are observed at times \u03c4\u2081, \u03c4\u2082, and \u03c4\u2083.  These unobserved mutations make it difficult to model the continuous-time evolution of the graph using standard ODE discretization methods.", "section": "3.2 Unobserved graph mutations and mixed discretization"}, {"figure_path": "UaJErAOssN/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of GRAPHSSM with different initialization strategies.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of GRAPHSSM using three different initialization strategies for the A matrix: HIPPO, Random, and Constant. The results are shown for four different datasets: DBLP-3, Brain, Reddit, and DBLP-10.  The y-axis represents the Micro-F1 score (%), a measure of the model's performance. The figure illustrates that the HIPPO initialization strategy consistently outperforms the other two, suggesting it is a more effective approach for this task.", "section": "Experiments"}]
