Ambiguity measures the proportion of samples with conflicting decisions. Discrepancy represents the maximum number of decisions that could change by switching models within the Rashomon set. Disagreement calculates the probability of conflicting predictions for a given sample.", "section": "B.2 More on predictive multiplicity and the empirical Rashomon sets"}, {"figure_path": "zpw6NmhvKU/tables/tables_18_2.jpg", "caption": "Table B.2: Score-based predictive multiplicity metrics.", "description": "This table presents a summary of score-based predictive multiplicity metrics.  These metrics focus on the spread or variability of predicted scores (rather than the final classification decisions) across multiple models within the Rashomon set. It includes mathematical definitions for standard deviation/variance, viable prediction range (VPR), and Rashomon capacity (RC). Each metric offers a different perspective on the extent of score variability and the degree to which model predictions diverge.", "section": "B.2 More on predictive multiplicity and the empirical Rashomon sets"}, {"figure_path": "zpw6NmhvKU/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table D.3: Tabular dataset descriptions.", "description": "This table lists 18 tabular datasets used in the paper's experiments.
