This is particularly problematic in gradient boosting, a powerful but complex algorithm widely used in various applications. The Rashomon effect makes it hard to trust AI decisions and causes significant challenges in building fair and robust AI systems.\nThis research introduces RashomonGB, a new method to efficiently find and analyze these conflicting models. RashomonGB systematically analyzes the Rashomon effect in gradient boosting, providing theoretical derivations and an information-theoretic characterization.  Empirically evaluated on various datasets, RashomonGB significantly improves the accuracy of predictive multiplicity estimates and facilitates better model selection under fairness constraints. Additionally, the study proposes effective techniques for mitigating predictive multiplicity, boosting the reliability and trustworthiness of gradient boosting models.", "affiliation": "JPMorgan Chase Global Technology Applied Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "zpw6NmhvKU/podcast.wav"}
