The left panel shows the graph generated by the GraphMaker method (a fairness-agnostic approach), while the right panel shows the graph generated by the FairWire method (a fairness-aware approach).  The visualization highlights the difference in edge distribution between the two methods.  GraphMaker shows a higher density of intra-edges indicating a bias towards connections within the same sensitive group, while FairWire demonstrates a more balanced distribution, suggesting a reduction in bias and improved fairness. This visual comparison supports the paper's findings regarding the effectiveness of FairWire in mitigating structural bias in graph generation.", "section": "6.4 Visualization of Synthetic Graphs"}]
