Existing graph structures can amplify biases, leading to unfair outcomes in applications like social recommendations.  Current synthetic graph generation methods also don't sufficiently address this issue, hindering responsible AI development. This poses challenges for deploying graph machine learning in real-world systems where fairness is crucial.\nThe paper introduces FairWire, a framework that uses a novel fairness regularizer to mitigate structural bias.  This regularizer is theoretically grounded and empirically shown to be effective. FairWire is applied in a diffusion-based graph generation model, producing fair synthetic graphs suitable for various tasks.  Experiments validate that FairWire effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing model performance, making a significant step towards equitable AI applications.", "affiliation": "UC Irvine", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "V0JvwCQlJe/podcast.wav"}
