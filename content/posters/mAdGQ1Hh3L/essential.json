Existing DG methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) suffer from limited receptive fields and overfitting. Transformer-based methods have high computational costs.  State Space Models (SSMs) offer a potential solution, but their input-dependent matrices can amplify domain-specific features. \nThis paper proposes START, a novel SSM-based architecture that uses a saliency-driven token-aware transformation to address this issue.  START selectively perturbs domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, significantly improving generalization performance.  Extensive experiments show START outperforms existing methods on five benchmark datasets with efficient linear complexity, offering a competitive alternative to CNNs and Vision Transformers.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Domain Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "mAdGQ1Hh3L/podcast.wav"}
