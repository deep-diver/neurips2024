Existing parameter-efficient methods mainly focus on mitigating forgetting but often neglect knowledge transfer. This limits their ability to effectively learn new tasks and generalize well.\n\nThis paper introduces LB-CL, a novel parameter-efficient approach. LB-CL cleverly injects knowledge from previous tasks by analyzing low-rank matrix parameters' sensitivity and injecting the knowledge into new tasks. To prevent forgetting, it maintains the orthogonality of each task's low-rank subspace using gradient projection.  Experiments show LB-CL significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in both knowledge transfer and mitigating forgetting. **This provides a significant advance in parameter-efficient continual learning for LLMs.**", "affiliation": "Pennsylvania State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ZxtaNh5UYB/podcast.wav"}
