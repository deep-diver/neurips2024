It compares the regret bounds obtained in this work to those previously reported in the literature and also provides lower bounds on the regret for each feedback setting. The asterisk indicates that the lower bound for the bandit feedback holds specifically for the Last Accepted Bid (LAB) pricing rule.", "section": "Contribution"}]
