These firms either maintain dedicated infrastructure optimized for inference workloads, or act as intermediaries that facilitate access to such resources. To address the tension between performance and computational costs, such firms typically have multiple service options, each offering a different trade-off between model quality and cost [1, 7, 36, 37].

Under the pay-per-token pricing scheme, the healthcare provider agrees in advance to pay the firm a fixed amount for each token generated. However, it is not hard to imagine that the firm may attempt to increase profti margins by routing some of the summarization requests to cheaper language models, instead of the most advanced one, without taking into account their purpose, and knowing that any lower-quality results would be attributed to the stochastic nature of LLM inference.

When designed correctly, contracts incentivize rational agents to invest more effort, thus providing a way to align incentives. Interaction around contracts is modeled as a principal-agent game, where the principal commits to a payment scheme, and the agent responds by rationally selecting a utility-maximizing action. Within this framework, the principal seeks to design a contract which satisfies some notion of optimality, such as requiring the least amount of expected pay (\u201cmin-pay contract\u201d), or the lowest budget (\u201cmin-budget contract\u201d).

The choice of evaluator can be tailored to the task: optimal pricing schemes in code generation tasks, for example, would rely on a pass/fail code evaluator [11, 4], whereas evaluation of linguistic tasks can be achieved using an \u201cLLM-as-a-judge\u201d approach [41, 28, 25].

This significantly generalizes a recent result by Saig et al. [31] to arbitrary action spaces and multiple optimality objectives. The statistical connection provides intuition and interpretation for numerical results, and the applicability to multiple objectives allows system designers to accommodate different business requirements. Intriguingly, the relation between the optimal contract and the optimal statistical risk have the same functional form in both objectives (min-budget and min-pay).

In the second experiment, we compute multi-outcome contracts for an intricate conversational task evaluated via LLM-as-a-judge. Numerical results show that the optimal monotone cost-robust pricing scheme has an intuitive 3-level structure: pay nothing if the quality is poor, pay extra if it is exceptional, and pay a fixed baseline otherwise.

As a possible alternative to a contract-design approach, the LLM content detection literature develops tools which attempt to detect machine-generated text, and distinguish between different text generators [38, 26, 40, 39]. Using such tools, a principal could deploy an LLM content detector and penalize firms who are not labeled as using target text generator. From this perspective, contract design is a complementary approach which provides guidelines for positive incentives in case a generated text gets accepted, an approach considered more effective at encouraging participation. Additionally, our pay-for-performance framework supports richer outcomes spaces beyond binary pass/fail, enabling more granular, and thus more efficient, control of incentives.
