The Macro-F1 score is a metric that considers both precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of the algorithm's performance across different classes.  The results show KFNN's performance relative to other methods, highlighting its effectiveness.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "wnPlJNiqfA/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: The Macro-F1 score (%) comparisons using Wilcoxon tests for KFNN versus its comparison algorithms.", "description": "This table presents the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing KFNN's performance against other state-of-the-art label integration algorithms.  The '+' symbol indicates that KFNN significantly outperforms the algorithm in the column, 'o' indicates the opposite, and a blank indicates no significant difference.  The significance levels are \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b1 = 0.1 for the lower and upper diagonals, respectively.

For each dataset, it shows the number of instances, the number of attributes, the number of classes, whether the dataset contains missing values, and the type of attributes (nominal, numeric, hybrid).  These datasets represent various crowdsourcing scenarios and are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed KFNN algorithm against existing methods.", "section": "5.1 Experimental setup"}]
