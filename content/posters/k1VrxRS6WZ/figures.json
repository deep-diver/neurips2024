Among the set of relevant labels, \"cloud\", \"car\", \"ship\", \"building\", \"tree\" and \"sky\" are known labels seen in the training set, while \"sea\", \"mountain\" and \"trestle bridge\" are unknown labels emerging in the testing phase.", "description": "This figure shows an example image and its associated labels to illustrate the concept of multi-label open set recognition (MLOSR). Some labels are known from the training data, while others are unknown and only appear during the testing phase. This highlights the challenge of MLOSR, where the model needs to identify both known and unknown labels.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "k1VrxRS6WZ/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance of SLAN with varying value of trade-off parameters on enron.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of the SLAN algorithm with varying values for its five trade-off parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03bc\u2081, \u03c4) on the enron dataset.  Each subplot displays the results for a different parameter, showing how changes to that parameter affect the performance metrics: Ranking loss, One-error, Coverage, Average precision, Macro-averaging AUC, and F-measure. The x-axis represents the logarithm of the parameter value, and the y-axis represents the metric's value.  The plots help to determine a stable parameter setting for the algorithm.", "section": "Parameter Sensitivity Analysis"}]
