Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks.

For instance, if provided with a photo of your cat, current diffusion models are unable to generate an image of your cat situated in the castle of your childhood dreams. This challenge necessitates a deep understanding of subject identity. Consequently, subject-driven text-to-image generation has attracted considerable interest within the community. Chen et al.

These text-based methods require 30 to 70 minutes to fine-tune their models, which is not scalable for real applications. SuTI [7] proposes an in-context learning method for subject-driven tasks. However, SuTI demands half a million expert models for each different subject, making it prohibitively expensive. Although SuTI can perform in-context learning during inference, the setup of expert models remains costly. DreamBooth [23] provides a simpler method for handling subject-driven tasks. Nevertheless, DreamBooth requires approximately 1000 negative samples and 1000 gradient steps, and also needs fine-tuning of the text encoder to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore more efficient training methods: the setup should be as simple as possible. First, training should not include multiple optimization phases.

We use a quantitative evaluation to compare RPO with other existing methods on three metrics (DINO, CLIP-I, CLIP-T) in DreamBench to validate the effectiveness of RPO. The experimental results on DreamBench is shown in Table 1. We observe that RPO can perform better or on par with existing works on all three metrics. Compared to DreamBooth, RPO only requires $3\\%$ of the negative samples, but RPO can outperform DreamBooth on the CLIP-I and CLIP-T scores by $3\\%$ given the same backbone. Our method outperforms all baseline algorithms in the CLIP-T score, establishing a new SOTA result. This demonstrates that RPO, by solely optimizing UNet through preference labels from the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward function, can generate images that are faithful to the input prompts. Similarly, our CLIP-I score is also the highest, which indicates that RPO can generate images that preserve the subject\u2019s visual features. In terms of the DINO score, our method is almost the same as DreamBooth when using the same backbone. We conjecture that the reason RPO achieves higher CLIP scores and lower DINO score is that the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward function prefers to select images that are semantically similar to the textual prompt, which may result in the loss of some unique features in the pixel space. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Qualitative Results. We use the same prompt as SuTI [7], and the generated images are shown in Figure 3. RPO generates images that are faithful to both reference images and textual prompts. We noticed a semantic mistake in the first prompt used by SuTI [7]; it should be A dog eating a cherry from a bowl. Furthermore, each reference bowl image contains blueberries, and the ambiguous prompt caused the RPO-trained model to become confused during the inference phase. However, RPO still preserves the unique appearance of the bowl. For instance, while the text on the bowl is incorrect or blurred in the SuTI and DreamBooth results, RPO accurately retains the words Bon Appetit from the reference bowl images. Although existing methods can produce images highly faithful to the reference images, they may not align as well with the textual prompts. We also provide an example in Appendix A.3 that shows how RPO can handle the failure case observed in DreamBooth and SuTI. Additionally, we find that the RPO model can generate reasonable images even for highly imaginative prompts, as shown in Appendix A.7 (Figure 16 and Figure 17). These images demonstrate that the RPO-trained model does not overfit the training data. Instead, the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic function provides a method for selecting a model capable of text-to-image alignment, even when the textual prompts are highly imaginative.

Specifically, the 0.3-Harmonic only shows a marginal improvement of 0.003 over pure $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{sim}}$ and 0.001 over early stopping without $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{pref}}$ . The early stopping facilitated by the $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}$ -Harmonic reward function plays a crucial role in counteracting overfitting, helping the diffusion models retain the ability to generate high-quality images aligned with textual prompts. To provide a deeper understanding of the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward validation, we present two examples from during training in Figure 4, covering both objects and live subjects. We found that the model tends to overfit at a very early stage, i.e., within 200 gradient steps, where $\\lambda$ -Harmonic can provide correct reward signals for the generated images. For the backpack subject, the generated image receives a low reward at gradient step 80 due to its lack of fidelity to the reference images. However, at gradient step 400, the image is overftited to the reference images, and the model fails to align well with the input text, resulting in another low reward. $\\lambda$ -Harmonic assigns a high reward to images that are faithful to both the reference image and textual prompts.

We examine the third question by selecting different $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}$ values from the set $\\{0.3,0.5,0.7\\}$ as the validation parameters for the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward. According to Equation 5, we believe that as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}$ increases, the $\\lambda$ -Harmonic reward function will give higher weight to the image-to-image similarity score. This will make the generated images more closely resemble the reference images, however, there is also a risk of overfitting. Table 3 shows the results of three different $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}$ values on DreamBench. As we expected, a larger $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}$ makes the images better preserve the characteristics of the reference images, but it also reduces the text-to-image alignment score. Figure 5 shows us an example. In this example, different $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}$ values lead to different outcomes due to varying strengths of regularization. A smaller $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}=0.3$ can generate more varied results, but seems somewhat off from the reference images. $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}=0.5$ preserves some characteristics beyond the original subject, such as the sofa, but also maintains alignment between text and image. However, when $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{val}}=0.7$ is chosen as an excessively large value, the model actually overfits to the reference images, ignoring the prompts.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
