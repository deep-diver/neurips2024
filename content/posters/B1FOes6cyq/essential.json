This is due in part to the models learning spurious correlations from the training data, rather than true underlying patterns.  Existing methods often focus on modifying model architectures or loss functions to improve this issue.  \nThis paper introduces a new regularization technique called Learning from Teaching (LOT). **LOT enhances generalization by using auxiliary student models that attempt to learn the same correlations as a main teacher model**. The student models' success at imitating the teacher's performance is used as a feedback mechanism to refine the teacher's learned correlations, helping it to focus on more generalizable features and discard noise.  Experiments across multiple domains showed significant improvements in generalization performance, highlighting LOT's efficiency and potential to improve state-of-the-art models.", "affiliation": "Rutgers University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "B1FOes6cyq/podcast.wav"}
