Existing algorithms produce randomized predictors, raising the question of derandomization.  This poses challenges as deterministic predictors are preferred for their simplicity and guarantees. The paper investigates the computational complexity of this task.\nThe paper proves derandomizing multi-distribution learning is computationally hard in general, even when the empirical risk minimization (ERM) is efficient.  However, it also identifies a crucial structural condition (label-consistent distributions) that allows for efficient derandomization.  A novel algorithm is presented, demonstrating a near-optimal sample complexity for deterministic multi-distribution learning under this condition using a black box reduction.", "affiliation": "Aarhus University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "twYE75Mnkt/podcast.wav"}
