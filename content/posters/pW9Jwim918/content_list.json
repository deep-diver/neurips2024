In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of recent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to generate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs are trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher estimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are easily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human preference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training schemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely (i) continual preference fine-tuning to make the reward model prefer aligned LGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a rephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a median preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the decision boundary better.

There are several approaches to detecting text generated by LLMs, mainly categorized in two: (i) training supervised detectors and (ii) zero-shot detection methods. The first category aims to train a binary classifier (or detector) that classifies LLM-generated texts (LGTs) and human-written texts. While effective, these methods can suffer from overfitting bias, where the detector performs well on the training data but fails to generalize detection on other LGTs [11]. It is worth noting that such overfitting issues are also raised in other detection fields, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection [33, 37]. To address this, zero-shot detection methods have emerged as an alternative. These methods define a detection score on a pre-trained LLM, eliminating the need for fine-tuning and thus avoiding overfitting. For instance, using log-likelihood or entropy of the output prediction of the pre-trained LLMs to detect LGTs [20]. More recently, several works have employed input text perturbation to measure prediction consistency, significantly improving the detection performance, e.g., DetectGPT [11], log-rank perturbation (NPR) [21], and Fast-DetectGPT [13]. While effective, however, prior works have primarily focused on detecting non-aligned LLMs, while recent LLMs are designed to be aligned with human preferences for practical use. In this paper, we demonstrate that the reward model [27] can effectively distinguish between LLM-generated text and human-written text in a zero-shot setting. Based on this, we additionally consider supervised detector training of the reward model while mitigating overfitting biases through the replay technique [31].

Additionally, a potential limitation of ReMoDetect is the somewhat lack of accessibility of reward models. While there are some open-source reward models available (that we have used throughout the paper), their number is still limited compared to open-source LLMs. We believe that as the open-source community grows and more pre-trained reward models (or human preference datasets) become available, ReMoDetect will be improved further.

In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n\u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
