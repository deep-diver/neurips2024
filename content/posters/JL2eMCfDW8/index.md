### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated learning (FL) faces challenges with non-identical and independently distributed (non-IID) data across clients, hindering effective model training.  Existing methods struggle to balance global model performance with personalized client-specific accuracy.  This often leads to slower convergence and suboptimal results. 



This work proposes FLOCO, which uses a **solution simplex** representing a linearly connected low-loss region in parameter space.  Clients are assigned subregions based on gradient signals, allowing for model personalization within these subregions while training a shared global model.  **Experiments demonstrate FLOCO's improved speed and accuracy** compared to state-of-the-art methods in cross-silo settings, with minimal computational overhead.

> This figure illustrates the core concept of Federated Learning over Connected Modes (FLOCO). It shows how client gradient signals are projected onto a simplex, grouping similar clients together.  Each client then samples models from its assigned subregion of the simplex and collaboratively trains the global simplex. The resulting test loss shows good performance for both the global distribution and individual clients' local distributions.

### In-depth insights


#### Connected Modes FL
Federated learning (FL) faces challenges with non-IID data, hindering efficient global model training.  **Connected Modes FL** addresses this by leveraging the concept of mode connectivity, identifying low-loss regions (solution simplex) within the model's parameter space.  Clients are assigned subregions of this simplex based on their gradient signals, enabling personalized model updates while maintaining global convergence. **This approach allows for personalization adapted to local data distributions, and by creating a shared solution simplex, it homogenizes update signals, accelerating the training and improving overall accuracy.** Unlike traditional methods, which focus on either global or personalized models, Connected Modes FL aims to find a balance, achieving improved local accuracy without sacrificing global performance.  The technique uses a novel projection method to map clients to the simplex, and carefully manages subregion assignment for effective collaboration. This method promises to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federated learning, particularly in situations with significant statistical heterogeneity.

#### Simplex Training
Simplex training, in the context of federated learning, presents a novel approach to address the challenges of statistical heterogeneity across distributed clients.  Instead of directly optimizing individual client models, **it focuses on collaboratively training a low-loss region in the model's parameter space, the solution simplex**. This simplex is defined by its vertices, which are collaboratively updated by the clients.  **Clients are assigned subregions within this simplex based on their gradient signals**, allowing for personalization while maintaining a shared global solution.  **The simplex structure promotes mode connectivity**, ensuring that client models remain connected via low-loss paths, thus facilitating efficient collaboration and preventing the conflicting gradient issues common in traditional federated learning. The method offers a balance between global model performance and client-specific personalization.  However, further investigation is needed to fully understand its scalability and applicability across diverse datasets and client distributions.

#### FLOCO Algorithm
The FLOCO algorithm, proposed for federated learning, tackles the challenges of statistical heterogeneity by leveraging mode connectivity. **It identifies a linearly connected low-loss region (solution simplex) in the parameter space of neural networks.** Clients are assigned subregions within this simplex based on their gradient signals, enabling personalized model training while maintaining a shared global solution.  **This approach achieves personalization by allowing clients to adapt within their subregions, and simultaneously promotes global convergence by homogenizing update signals.**  FLOCO's key innovation lies in its strategic subregion assignment and collaborative training mechanism across connected modes, leading to accelerated global training and improved local accuracy.  **The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to balance personalization and global model convergence, ultimately outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.**  Further research could explore the algorithm's scalability and robustness in diverse settings and investigate its potential limitations.

#### Non-IID Data
In federated learning, **Non-IID (non-identically and independently distributed) data** poses a significant challenge because client datasets exhibit varying distributions. This heterogeneity hinders the training of effective global models, as conflicting gradient signals from clients with differing data characteristics can slow down convergence or lead to suboptimal solutions.  **Personalized FL methods** attempt to address this by training individual models for each client, but this can sacrifice global performance and increase communication overhead.  **Clustering techniques** group clients with similar data distributions to mitigate some of the issues, but finding effective clusters can be complex.  **Robust aggregation** aims to minimize the impact of outliers or conflicting updates.  Advanced techniques leverage concepts like **mode connectivity** to find low-loss paths in parameter space, allowing for better collaboration across clients with diverse data.  These methods try to improve both the global and local accuracy of the models trained, while managing the complexities brought on by Non-IID data.

#### Future of FLOCO
The future of FLOCO (Federated Learning Over Connected Modes) appears bright, given its strong performance in addressing the challenges of statistical heterogeneity in federated learning.  **Future research could focus on enhancing FLOCO's scalability** to handle a significantly larger number of clients and datasets, a critical factor for real-world applications.  **Investigating the impact of different simplex structures and projection methods** would improve the algorithm's robustness and adaptability to various data distributions.  **Theoretical analysis to provide stronger convergence guarantees** would enhance the algorithm's reliability.   Furthermore, exploring FLOCO's applicability in diverse applications beyond image classification, such as natural language processing and time-series analysis, would broaden its impact.  **Incorporating advanced techniques like differential privacy** would ensure compliance with data protection regulations, improving trustworthiness and expanding potential use cases. Finally, developing user-friendly implementations and tools to facilitate wider adoption among researchers and practitioners would further solidify FLOCO's place in the federated learning landscape.

> This figure displays the global and average local test accuracy for the CifarCNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a 5-fold split.  The left panel shows the global test accuracy, the middle panel shows the average local test accuracy across all clients, and the right panel shows the total variance of the gradients (a measure of how consistent the gradient updates are across clients). A key observation is the noticeable jump in average local test accuracy for the FLOCO method around communication round 250, attributed to the subregion assignment.  The plot also highlights that FLOCO leads to lower variance in gradients compared to other methods.
