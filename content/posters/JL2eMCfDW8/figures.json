In each communication round, each client uniformly samples points in the neighborhood of their projected point (top-right plot), and jointly train the solution simplex. The lower row shows the resulting test loss on the solution simplex, where the loss for the global distribution (left) is uniformly small, while the losses for individual local distributions (center for client 1 and right for client 2) are small around their projected points.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core concept of Federated Learning over Connected Modes (FLOCO). It shows how client gradient signals are projected onto a simplex, grouping similar clients together.  Each client then samples models from its assigned subregion of the simplex and collaboratively trains the global simplex. The resulting test loss shows good performance for both the global distribution and individual clients' local distributions.", "section": "3 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "JL2eMCfDW8/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Global (left) and average local (center) test accuracy for CifarCNN on CIFAR-10, 5-Fold.

The left panel shows the global test accuracy, the middle panel shows the average local test accuracy across all clients, and the right panel shows the total variance of the gradients (a measure of how consistent the gradient updates are across clients). A key observation is the noticeable jump in average local test accuracy for the FLOCO method around communication round 250, attributed to the subregion assignment.  The plot also highlights that FLOCO leads to lower variance in gradients compared to other methods.", "section": "4.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "JL2eMCfDW8/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Global (left) and average local (center) test accuracy for CifarCNN on CIFAR-10, 5-Fold.

The left heatmap displays the average local client test accuracy, while the right heatmap shows the global test accuracy.  Different colors represent different accuracy levels, with warmer colors indicating higher accuracy.  The results indicate that earlier subregion assignments (smaller \u03c4) and smaller subregion radiuses (smaller \u03c1) generally lead to better local accuracy, but the impact on global accuracy is less pronounced.", "section": "4.3 Analysis and Discussion"}]
