Existing research often uses simplifying assumptions, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. This work aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of this process, devoid of such assumptions. \nThe researchers use gradient flow analysis of a simplified transformer model consisting of three attention matrices and a linear MLP layer. They demonstrate that the training process naturally divides into two phases. **Phase 1** involves the MLP quickly aligning with target signals for accurate classification, while **Phase 2** sees the attention matrices and MLP jointly refining to enhance classification margin and achieve near-minimum loss.  The study also introduces a novel concept of 'automatic balancing of gradients', showcasing how different samples' loss decreases at nearly the same rate, ultimately contributing to the proof of the near-minimum training loss.  Experimental results support the theoretical findings.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "w6q46IslSR/podcast.wav"}
