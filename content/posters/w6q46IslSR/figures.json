The detailed experiment setup can be found in Appendix A.", "description": "This figure visualizes the results of synthetic experiments designed to validate the paper's theoretical findings on the two-phase training dynamics of transformers.  Panel (a) shows the attention score correlation (inner product of query and key vectors) between different word embeddings (\u03bc1, \u03bc2, \u03bc3) over the training process.  The vertical red line separates the two phases.  Phase 1 shows little change in attention scores, whereas Phase 2 shows a clear divergence, emphasizing the alignment of the linear MLP and the evolution of attention matrices to increase classification margin. Panel (b) illustrates the training loss over time, with different colored lines representing various data sample types (combinations of \u03bc1, \u03bc2, \u03bc3). The training loss decreases rapidly in Phase 1 as the linear MLP classifies samples correctly, then continues dropping more gradually in Phase 2 as the model jointly refines attention matrices and the linear MLP to reduce the loss to near zero.", "section": "Synthetic Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "w6q46IslSR/figures/figures_5_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Synthetic experiments with illustration of two training phases. The detailed experiment setup can be found in Appendix A.", "description": "The figure contains two subfigures. Subfigure (a) shows the attention score correlation between different pairs of tokens (\u03bc1, \u03bc2, \u03bc3) during training.  It illustrates the two phases of training. In Phase 1, these correlations remain largely unchanged, while in Phase 2, the correlation between \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 increases, and the correlation between \u03bc1 (or \u03bc2) and \u03bc3 decreases. Subfigure (b) shows the training loss curves for different sample types. The loss curve for samples containing both \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 decreases rapidly in Phase 1 and continues to decrease in Phase 2.  Losses for other sample types show more complex behavior, initially increasing before decreasing in Phase 2.  This behavior aligns with the theoretical results suggesting a two-phase training process.", "section": "Synthetic Experiment"}]
