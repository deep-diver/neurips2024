### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research delves into the training dynamics of transformers, focusing on how these models learn to recognize word co-occurrences, a critical ability for many natural language processing tasks.  Existing research often uses simplifying assumptions, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. This work aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of this process, devoid of such assumptions. 

The researchers use gradient flow analysis of a simplified transformer model consisting of three attention matrices and a linear MLP layer. They demonstrate that the training process naturally divides into two phases. **Phase 1** involves the MLP quickly aligning with target signals for accurate classification, while **Phase 2** sees the attention matrices and MLP jointly refining to enhance classification margin and achieve near-minimum loss.  The study also introduces a novel concept of 'automatic balancing of gradients', showcasing how different samples' loss decreases at nearly the same rate, ultimately contributing to the proof of the near-minimum training loss.  Experimental results support the theoretical findings.

> This figure visualizes the results of synthetic experiments designed to validate the paper's theoretical findings on the two-phase training dynamics of transformers.  Panel (a) shows the attention score correlation (inner product of query and key vectors) between different word embeddings (Œº1, Œº2, Œº3) over the training process.  The vertical red line separates the two phases.  Phase 1 shows little change in attention scores, whereas Phase 2 shows a clear divergence, emphasizing the alignment of the linear MLP and the evolution of attention matrices to increase classification margin. Panel (b) illustrates the training loss over time, with different colored lines representing various data sample types (combinations of Œº1, Œº2, Œº3). The training loss decreases rapidly in Phase 1 as the linear MLP classifies samples correctly, then continues dropping more gradually in Phase 2 as the model jointly refines attention matrices and the linear MLP to reduce the loss to near zero.
