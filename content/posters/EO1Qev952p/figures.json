It compares the performance of the authors' bicriteria algorithm for socially fair low-rank approximation against a standard low-rank approximation algorithm (SVD).  Subfigure (a) shows the ratio of costs (bicriteria/SVD) for various numbers of sampled observations, demonstrating the superior performance of the bicriteria approach. Subfigure (b) illustrates the cost ratio for different ranks (k) of the SVD algorithm, further highlighting the benefits of the bicriteria method. Finally, subfigure (c) compares the runtimes of both algorithms, breaking down the runtime of the bicriteria algorithm into the generation of Gaussian matrices/Lewis weight sampling ('bicrit1') and the extraction of factors ('bicrit2').  This demonstrates that the factor extraction in the bicriteria algorithm is faster than SVD.", "section": "5 Empirical Evaluations"}]
