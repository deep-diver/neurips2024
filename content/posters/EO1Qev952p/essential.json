However, these algorithms can exhibit bias, leading to unfair outcomes for different groups. This paper investigates the challenge of creating \"socially fair\" versions of these algorithms, where the goal is to minimize the maximum loss across all sub-populations.  The authors discovered that achieving perfect fairness is computationally very difficult. \nThis research provides algorithmic solutions to address the difficulty of achieving fairness.  They develop efficient approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time, providing a good balance between fairness and efficiency.  These algorithms are evaluated empirically, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world applications.  The work contributes to the development of more equitable machine learning techniques, addressing a critical issue of algorithmic fairness.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "EO1Qev952p/podcast.wav"}
