It highlights the gaps in existing work, where some methods lack a complete pipeline, specifically addressing fusion and rectangling simultaneously. The table then outlines the baselines used for comparison in the paper's experiments, combining existing methods for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.", "section": "4.1 Experimental setup"}, {"figure_path": "ZViYPzh9Wq/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative results. The best and second-best results are highlighted by red and blue. * refers to the inference results of this method are not affected by seed. \u2020 means the inference results of this method are affected by the seed.

The results are evaluated using three metrics: HIQA, CLIPIQA, and CCS. HIQA and CLIPIQA are no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics, while CCS is a content consistency score.  The table shows the mean and standard deviation of each metric across five runs with different random seeds.  The best and second-best results for each metric are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.  The '*' and '\u2020' symbols indicate whether the results are affected by the random seed.", "section": "4.1 Experimental setup"}]
