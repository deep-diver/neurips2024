Neural operators, while powerful, are often constrained by discretization and domain geometry. Neural fields, while flexible, struggle with modeling spatial information and local dynamics effectively; existing transformer architectures are computationally expensive.  This research addresses these challenges. \nThe paper introduces AROMA, a novel framework that leverages attention blocks and neural fields for PDE modeling.  **AROMA uses a flexible encoder-decoder architecture to create smooth latent representations of spatial fields from various data types**, eliminating the need for patching.  Its sequential latent representation allows for spatial interpretation, enabling the use of a conditional transformer to model temporal dynamics. **A diffusion-based formulation enhances stability and allows for longer-term predictions**.  Experimental results demonstrate AROMA's superior performance compared to conventional methods.", "affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Aj8RKCGwjE/podcast.wav"}
