{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working with large multimodal models (LMMs) and in-context learning (ICL).  It addresses the significant computational cost and sensitivity to demonstration selection inherent in ICL for LMMs. By introducing LIVE, a novel learnable approach, this research offers a more efficient and robust method for improving ICL in complex multimodal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), opening new avenues for research in this rapidly developing field.  **The efficiency gains and improved accuracy demonstrated by LIVE hold significant practical implications.**", "summary": "LIVE, a novel learnable in-context vector, significantly improves visual question answering by reducing computational costs and enhancing accuracy compared to traditional ICL methods.", "takeaways": ["LIVE significantly reduces computational costs while improving accuracy in visual question answering.", "LIVE is more robust to the selection of in-context demonstrations compared to traditional ICL methods.", "LIVE's learnable approach outperforms non-learnable methods for complex multimodal tasks."], "tldr": "In-context learning (ICL) has shown promise in improving large language and multimodal models, but it faces challenges: high computational cost when using many demonstrations and sensitivity to the quality of demonstrations. These challenges are particularly acute in multimodal tasks like visual question answering (VQA). Current approaches try to extract the most informative features from demonstrations into non-learnable vectors; however, these methods fail to work well for complex multimodal tasks. \nThis study proposes LIVE (Learnable In-Context Vector) to address these issues. LIVE learns to extract essential information from demonstrations improving ICL performance. Experiments show that LIVE significantly reduces computational costs and enhances the accuracy of VQA compared to existing methods.  **The learnable nature of LIVE allows it to effectively capture the essence of demonstrations, outperforming non-learnable methods in complex multimodal tasks and achieving improved efficiency.**", "affiliation": "Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "QhRemVrZbG/podcast.wav"}
