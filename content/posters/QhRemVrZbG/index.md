### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

In-context learning (ICL) has shown promise in improving large language and multimodal models, but it faces challenges: high computational cost when using many demonstrations and sensitivity to the quality of demonstrations. These challenges are particularly acute in multimodal tasks like visual question answering (VQA). Current approaches try to extract the most informative features from demonstrations into non-learnable vectors; however, these methods fail to work well for complex multimodal tasks. 

This study proposes LIVE (Learnable In-Context Vector) to address these issues. LIVE learns to extract essential information from demonstrations improving ICL performance. Experiments show that LIVE significantly reduces computational costs and enhances the accuracy of VQA compared to existing methods.  **The learnable nature of LIVE allows it to effectively capture the essence of demonstrations, outperforming non-learnable methods in complex multimodal tasks and achieving improved efficiency.**

> This figure compares the conventional In-Context Learning (ICL) method with the proposed Learnable In-Context Vector (LIVE) method.  Panel (a) shows that conventional ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of in-context demonstrations (ICDs), requiring more ICDs for high performance which in turn increases inference time and the number of FLOPs. Panel (b) demonstrates that LIVE, by inputting a shift vector derived from demonstrations, significantly reduces inference time and the number of FLOPs while maintaining comparable accuracy, making it more robust to ICD selection.

### In-depth insights


#### LIVE: Learnable ICV
The proposed "LIVE: Learnable ICV" method presents a novel approach to improve in-context learning (ICL) in large multimodal models (LMMs).  Traditional ICL methods suffer from high computational costs and sensitivity to the selection of in-context demonstrations.  LIVE aims to overcome these limitations by **learning a compact vector representation** of essential task information from demonstrations. This learnable in-context vector (LIV) is then used to efficiently guide the LMM during inference, thereby **significantly reducing computational cost** and improving accuracy.  **Unlike non-learnable ICV methods**, LIVE learns a task-specific shift direction, enabling better adaptation to complex multimodal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments showing improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to traditional ICL and other non-learnable ICV techniques. The **learnable nature** of LIVE offers greater flexibility and robustness compared to methods that rely on statically extracted representations of demonstrations.

#### ICL Efficiency Gains
In the realm of large language models (LLMs), In-Context Learning (ICL) presents a powerful paradigm for adapting models to new tasks without explicit retraining.  However, ICL's efficiency can be significantly hampered by the increased computational cost associated with processing numerous in-context demonstrations (ICDs).  **This paper explores strategies for enhancing the efficiency of ICL, focusing on reducing inference time and the sensitivity of performance to ICD selection.** A key aspect is the introduction of Learnable In-Context Vectors (LIVE), which aim to distill essential task information from the ICDs into a compact representation that significantly reduces computational load while preserving accuracy.  **LIVE's effectiveness is particularly highlighted in complex multimodal tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), where the benefits of reduced computational cost and improved robustness are even more pronounced.**  The results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains compared to traditional ICL and other non-learnable ICV methods, making LIVE a promising approach for optimizing ICL performance in demanding applications.

#### VQA Task Distillation
VQA task distillation is a promising approach to improve efficiency and robustness in visual question answering (VQA).  The core idea revolves around **distilling the knowledge and task-specific information inherent in a large set of VQA demonstrations into a compact, learnable representation**, such as an In-Context Vector (ICV).  This contrasts with traditional In-Context Learning (ICL), which relies on feeding numerous demonstrations directly to the model, leading to increased computational cost and sensitivity to demonstration selection.  **Effective task distillation methods learn a vector that captures the essence of the task, enabling accurate VQA responses without the overhead of numerous samples.**  This approach offers significant advantages, including reduced inference time and improved performance, especially when handling complex, multimodal inputs.  The critical challenge lies in designing a distillation method that effectively captures the relevant aspects of the task while discarding irrelevant details from the training data.  **Learnable methods, unlike their non-learnable counterparts, show significant promise in effectively capturing the complex relationships and nuances present in VQA tasks.**  Further research should focus on developing more sophisticated distillation methods to further enhance the performance and reduce the reliance on computationally expensive ICL.

#### Multimodal ICL Limits
Multimodal In-Context Learning (ICL) holds immense promise but faces significant hurdles.  **Computational cost explodes** as the number of in-context demonstrations increases, hindering real-world applications.  **Performance is highly sensitive** to the quality and selection of these demonstrations, creating an optimization challenge.  The inherent complexity of multimodal data exacerbates these issues, as the interaction between different modalities (image, text, etc.) becomes difficult to manage effectively. **Existing non-learnable methods for distilling task information** from demonstrations often fail to capture the nuanced nature of complex multimodal tasks.  Therefore, developing efficient and robust strategies for demonstration selection, feature extraction, and model adaptation is crucial to unlock the full potential of multimodal ICL.

#### Future Research: LIVE
Future research directions for LIVE could explore its **generalizability across diverse LMM architectures and multimodal tasks**, going beyond VQA.  Investigating the **impact of different demonstration selection strategies** and their effect on LIVE's performance is crucial.  Furthermore, research should focus on **improving LIVE's efficiency** by optimizing the training process and potentially exploring alternative methods for distilling task information.  A **deeper analysis of the interplay between LIVE and different layers of the LLM** is needed to understand how LIVE interacts with the LLM's internal mechanisms.  Finally, exploring the **potential for incorporating external knowledge** into LIVE to enhance its performance on tasks requiring world knowledge is a promising avenue.  **Addressing potential biases and ethical considerations** related to the training data and applications of LIVE is also vital for responsible development.
