This limitation is critical for mobility-impaired individual motion prediction models, as gait patterns may change as mobility-impaired individuals adapt to generated motion. This adaptation could result in improved compensatory motions and gait normalization. In contrast, an able-bodied model trained on a wide array of motion scenarios from various individuals may be more adaptable to evolving mobility-impaired individual gait patterns while accommodating the predicted joint motion required for prosthetic walking.

This discrepancy arises because neighbor search finds the closest match from available data points, introducing variability based on the dataset, while network inversion uses gradient-based optimization to iteratively minimize error, leading to different solutions.

Our findings indicate that the proposed input refurbishing strategy offers a sample-efficient mechanism for adapting pretrained models to new scenarios. The proposed model reprogramming approach for adaptive motion forecasting has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals with mobility impairments. By leveraging well-trained models from able-bodied data, this method can efficiently predict joint motions for mobility-impaired individuals, aiding in the development of more responsive and accurate assistive devices such as prostheses and orthoses. This approach minimizes the need for extensive retraining, making it both cost-effective and accessible for personalized healthcare applications.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
