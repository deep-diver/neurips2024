A similar gap also exists between the subspace of different languages in multilingual LLMs [10], which enables approximating language translation with geometric translation between these subspaces. Recent work has shown that changes in the intrinsic dimension of the representations is related to different stages of information processing in LLMs, linking the rise of abstract semantic content to layers characterized by geometric compression [34] and the transition from surface-level to syntactic and semantic processing to layers of high dimension [35].

These include the format of the prompts in ICL [36, 37], the amount of training data used for fine-tuning [38, 39], and the size of models being compared [40].

This reduction happens because the model needs to identify the answer from four options at the output, causing points related to the same answer to cluster around the same unembedding vector. In addition, when the model is uncertain about its predictions, some output embeddings tend to lie close to the decision boundaries of the last hidden representation, resulting in a flatter density distribution with fewer peaks. Even when the model is highly accurate, the linear separability of the answers does not guarantee distinct density peaks because the embeddings may still be near the decision boundary as long as they are on the correct side. However, more pronounced density peaks emerge as the model confidence grows and the data moves away from the decision boundaries. This section shows that SFT sharpens these density peaks in the later layers more than ICL. However, as model size and accuracy increase, the representation landscapes of ICL and SFT become more similar.

In these clusters, the most common letter represents over $90\\%$ of the point in Llama3-8b, over $70\\%$ in Llama3-70b, and over $90\\%$ in Mistral. As a result, the ARI (see purple profiles in Fig. 5) rises sharply in the middle of the network, reaching approximately 0.25 in Llama3-8b, 0.45 in Llama3-70b, and 0.2 in Mistral.

Interestingly, in Llama3-70b (and to a lesser extent in Llama2-70b, see Fig. A8-right), the representation landscape of ICL starts to resemble that of the fine-tuned models. Between layers 40 and 77, about $80\\%$ of the dataset forms five large peaks, and in four of them, the fraction of the most common letter is above 0.9, similar to fine-tuned models.

We identified two phases in the model\u2019s internal processing, which are separated by significant changes in the geometry of the middle layers. The transition is marked by a peak in the ID and a sharp decrease in the number and separation of the probability modes. Notably, few-shot learning and fine-tuning display complementary behavior with respect to this transition. When examples are included in the prompt, the early layers of LLMs exhibit a welldefined hierarchical organization of the density peaks that recovers semantic relationships among questions\u2019 subjects. Conversely, fine-tuning primarily modifies the representations to encode the answers after the transition in the middle of the network. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Advantages of the density-based clustering approach. Our research highlights how variations in density within the hidden layers relate to the emergence of different levels of semantic abstraction, a concept previously explored by Doimo et al. [56] in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for classification. In CNNs, the probability landscape remains unimodal until the last handful of layers, where multiple probability modes emerge according to a hierarchical structure that mirrors the similarity of the categories. In decoder-only LLMs solving a semantically rich question-answering task, these hierarchically organized density peaks appear in the early layers of the models, especially when they learn in context. Our methodology also extends the work of Park et al. [29], enabling the discovery of meaningful hierarchies of concepts beyond the final hidden layer of LLMs, where the data representation can be non-linear [30]. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Moreover, unlike previous studies that utilized $k$ -means to identify clusters within hidden representations [9, 13, 57], the density peak method does not assume a convex cluster shape or impose a priori the number of clusters. Instead, clusters emerge naturally once a specific $Z$ value is set (see Sec. 3.2). This allows for the automatic discovery of potentially meaningful data categorizations based on the structure of the representation landscape without specifying external linguistic labels and without introducing additional probing parameters. In this respect, an approach is similar to that of Michael et al. [58], who used a weakly supervised method relying on pairs of positive/negative samples to uncover latent ontologies within representations.

As discussed in section 4.1, a peak in intrinsic dimension separates two groups of layers serving different functions and being distinctly influenced by in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Other studies have also highlighted the crucial role of ID peaks in marking blocks of layers dedicated to different stages of information processing within deep neural networks. For example, Ansuini et al. [12] observed a peak of the ID in the intermediate layers of CNNs, separating layers that remove low-level image features like brightness from those that focus on extracting abstract concepts necessary for classification. In transformers trained to generate images, Valeriani et al. [34] identified two intermediate peaks delimiting layers rich in semantic features of the data characterized by geometric compression. In LLMs, Cheng et al. [35] showed that an ID peak marks a transition from representation that encodes surface-level linguistic properties to one rich in syntactic and semantic information. These studies suggest that ID peaks consistently indicate transitions between different stages of information processing within the hidden layers.

Our analysis of the similarity between fine-tuned and pre-trained layers (see Fig. 6) reveals that later layers are most impacted by fine-tuning, indicating that these layers should be assigned ranks.

Estimating the density reliably requires a good sampling of the probability landscape. This can be a delicate condition if the intrinsic dimension is high, as often happens in neural network hidden layers. The ID values we report in this work lie between 4 and 22, with most of the layers having an ID below 16. Rodriguez et al. [62] showed that the density can be estimated reliably up to 15-20 dimensional spaces. Still, the upper bounds are problem-specific and depend on the density estimator used, the nature of the data, and the dataset size. In this work, we analyzed MMLU, which has a semantically rich set of topics characterized by good enough sampling. In the Appendix, in Sec. D, we show that our results extend to another dataset mixture with a subject partition similar to MMLU. However, the analysis of other QA datasets and generic textual sources would make our observations more general. The prompt structure can also be made more general. In the current study, we studied ICL framed as few-shot learning but further investigations on more differentiated contexts would strengthen our findings. Finally, the description of the transition observed in the proximity of half of the network can be analyzed more in detail, for instance, by providing an interpretation of the mechanism [63] underlying the information flow from the context to the last token position [64].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
