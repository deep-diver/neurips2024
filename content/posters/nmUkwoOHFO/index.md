### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are often improved using in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but it's unclear if they create similar internal representations.  Prior research mainly compared performance; this study delves into the internal representation differences. This paper investigates this through analyzing probability landscapes of hidden representations in LLMs performing question-answering tasks. It finds that ICL and SFT lead to drastically different internal structures within the LLMs.

The research used a density-based approach to analyze the probability landscape of hidden representations in LLMs solving a question-answering task.  They found a clear division within network layers between those encoding semantic content and those related to final answers.  ICL produced hierarchically organized representations in the first half, while SFT showed fuzzier, semantically mixed representations.  Fine-tuned models displayed clearer answer encoding in the second half, unlike ICL models. This research reveals that different computational strategies are employed by LLMs for ICL and SFT.

> This table presents the zero-shot and five-shot accuracies for different large language models on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) test set.  The accuracies are given as both macro and micro averages. Macro average is the arithmetic mean of the accuracies per subject, while the micro average is the total number of correct answers divided by the total number of questions. The difference between these reflects the class imbalance in the dataset.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM Representation
**LLM internal representations** are a crucial, yet poorly understood aspect of large language model (LLM) function.  This research paper investigates how different training paradigms, specifically in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), shape these internal representations.  The study uses a density-based approach to analyze the probability landscape of hidden layer activations, revealing a **two-phased behavior** across the network. Early layers in ICL develop semantically organized representations while SFT results in fuzzier, less interpretable structures in these early layers.  Conversely, fine-tuning leads to the emergence of sharply defined probability modes in later layers, better reflecting the identity of the answers compared to ICL.  **This reveals distinct computational strategies** used by LLMs, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of these internal mechanisms to optimize LLM performance and information extraction.

#### ICL vs. SFT
The core of the study lies in contrasting In-context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), two prominent large language model (LLM) training methodologies.  While both boost LLM performance on specific tasks, **their impact on internal representations differs significantly.** ICL, which involves providing a few examples within the prompt, shapes representations hierarchically and semantically in the initial network layers. In contrast, SFT, which modifies model parameters using labeled examples, leads to fuzzier, semantically mixed representations in these early layers.  **A key observation is the sharp transition in representation patterns midway through the network**, with fine-tuned models showing clearer separation of answer identities in later layers compared to ICL. This suggests that while achieving similar accuracy, ICL and SFT employ fundamentally distinct computational strategies.  **The geometry of the LLMs' internal representations reveals a two-phased approach to problem-solving.** Understanding this contrast could lead to more efficient methods for information extraction and better LLM design.

#### Density Peaks
The concept of Density Peaks in the context of analyzing LLMs' internal representations offers a unique perspective on understanding how these models solve tasks.  **Instead of relying on dimensionality reduction techniques, this approach directly analyzes the probability density of hidden layer embeddings.** This allows the identification of probability modes or "peaks" which, in the case of few-shot learning, seem to cluster semantically, reflecting the hierarchical organization of information. In contrast, fine-tuning leads to fuzzier, less interpretable probability landscapes.  **The transition between these distinct representation styles is especially noteworthy, occurring mid-network.** This transition might correspond to a shift from semantically rich representations to those focused on answer identity.  **This method provides a novel way to understand LLMs' diverse computational strategies,** revealing how different learning paradigms impact internal model structures, going beyond simple performance comparisons.

#### Two-Phased Geom
The concept of "Two-Phased Geom" suggests a significant shift in the geometric properties of internal representations within a neural network model, likely a Large Language Model (LLM).  **This transition is not gradual but rather abrupt**, occurring around the midpoint of the network's layers. The first phase might be characterized by a focus on semantic organization, with hidden representations clustering according to the semantic content of the input.  **The second phase, however, prioritizes task-specific output**, potentially reflecting a shift towards encoding aspects crucial for generating the final answer.  This two-phased nature highlights diverse computational strategies within the LLM, suggesting different processing priorities depending on the network's depth. Investigating this phenomenon provides insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and could inform the development of more effective methods for information extraction or model optimization.  **The analysis of this transition, particularly its sharpness and location, could reveal fundamental aspects of LLM architecture and information processing**.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore several avenues.  **Extending the density-based approach** to other LLMs and tasks is crucial for validating the generalizability of the findings.  Investigating the influence of different prompting techniques and dataset characteristics on the representation landscape would provide valuable insights.  **A deeper investigation** into the computational mechanisms underlying the two-phased behavior and the transition point between layers is also needed.  Furthermore, research should focus on leveraging the distinct geometrical properties of ICL and SFT representations to **develop improved methods for knowledge extraction and efficient fine-tuning**.  This could involve creating new algorithms that specifically target the geometrical structures identified in this study, resulting in improved performance and efficiency for various downstream tasks.  Finally, exploring the **practical implications** of these findings for developing adaptive low-rank fine-tuning techniques could yield significant advancements in the field of efficient language model adaptation.
