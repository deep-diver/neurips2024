It refines feature representations to Ft(x, \u03b8) to reflect the statistical changes of external inputs. The feedforward connections are updated following the Hebbian learning rule, and they are strengthened at locations where stimuli are presented excessively, inducing location-specific changes in feature representations. C. Task-based learning. Using convolutional layers and global max pooling, it integrates the task-relevant information from feature representations Ft(x, \u03b8) to make the decision z*.
