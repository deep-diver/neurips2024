We include the theoretical results and the results by GPRS (Flamich, 2024) for reference. We repeat each setting 5 times and report the mean and std. *: represents the average KL divergence between target Q and the search heuristic P'. We estimate it by MC estimator and average across all test images. We empirically find \u2248 14 when using 2 blocks and \u2248 7 when using 4 blocks. \u2020: Given that is relatively small, we can employ more than [2] samples to further reduce the bias. We hence report the results achieved by [2+2] samples, which remains manageable in both cases.", "description": "This table presents the results of lossless compression experiments on the MNIST dataset using different relative entropy coding (REC) settings.  It compares the bitrate and runtime of the proposed space partitioning method against standard methods, including a theoretical optimum and GPRS.  The table shows the impact of the number of blocks and samples per block on performance, and notes the estimation of KL divergence and resulting bias.", "section": "Lossless Compression on MNIST with VAE"}]
