Traditional methods struggle with precision, generality, and computational cost, while current deep learning approaches fall short. This paper introduces the Geometric Diffusion Bridge (GDB), a novel generative modeling framework designed to accurately bridge initial and target geometric states.  GDB tackles the inherent challenges by using a probabilistic approach that respects the system's symmetries and leverages existing trajectory data.\n\nGDB's core innovation lies in using a modified version of Doob's h-transform to derive an equivariant diffusion bridge.  This tailored diffusion process accurately models the evolution dynamics while preserving joint distributions and inherent symmetries. The framework seamlessly integrates trajectory data, enhancing accuracy and detail.  Extensive experiments across various real-world scenarios demonstrate GDB's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, marking a significant advancement in modeling complex systems.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "zcEPOB9rCR/podcast.wav"}
