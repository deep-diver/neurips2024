### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Visual reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with high-dimensional state spaces, leading to issues in exploration and exploitation. While consistency models have shown promise in online state-based RL, their application to visual RL remains unexplored, and existing methods are unstable, especially with high-dimensional spaces and actor-critic frameworks.  The non-stationary nature of online RL data also poses a significant challenge for the application of consistency models.



To address these issues, this paper proposes CP3ER, a novel consistency policy that incorporates prioritized proximal experience regularization and sample-based entropy regularization. This approach effectively stabilizes training and improves sample efficiency by creating an appropriate proxy policy for regularization and uses weighted sampling. CP3ER achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple visual RL benchmark tasks.  **This is the first work to successfully extend consistency models to visual RL**, demonstrating their potential for addressing the key challenges in this field.

The dormant ratio is a metric that reflects the network's expressive ability; higher ratios indicate more inactive neurons and thus reduced expressiveness.  The graph shows the dormant ratio plotted against the number of gradient steps in the training process.  Separate lines are shown for online and offline training, with shaded regions representing the standard deviation across four different random seeds. This visualizes the impact of non-stationary data distribution (in online RL) on the stability and expressiveness of the consistency policy network, showing whether the non-stationary data significantly affects training.

### In-depth insights


#### Visual RL Stability
Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces significant challenges due to high-dimensional state spaces inherent in visual data.  This dimensionality leads to instability in training, making it difficult to achieve both effective exploration and exploitation.  **Sample inefficiency** is a major concern as vast amounts of data are required to train effective policies.  The non-stationarity of the data distribution further exacerbates these issues, as the policy and environment dynamics change over time.  Addressing these challenges requires techniques to improve training stability, enhancing the robustness of learning algorithms to high-dimensional inputs and non-stationary data, and boosting sample efficiency. **Prioritized experience replay**, **entropy regularization**, and carefully designed policy architectures are crucial aspects of enhancing stability.

#### CP3ER Framework
The CP3ER framework, designed for visual reinforcement learning, tackles the instability and inefficiency inherent in high-dimensional state spaces.  It builds upon consistency models, offering a **time-efficient** alternative to traditional diffusion models.  The core innovation lies in incorporating **prioritized proximal experience regularization (PPER)** to stabilize training and improve sample efficiency. Unlike previous methods that directly apply the Q-loss within an actor-critic framework, CP3ER introduces **sample-based entropy regularization** to mitigate the issues caused by Q-loss, preventing the policy network from prematurely collapsing into local optima.  **PPER**, by using weighted sampling from the replay buffer, further refines sample efficiency, focusing on data points relevant to the current policy. The integration of a **mixture of Gaussian (MoG)** for value estimation improves accuracy and robustness. Overall, CP3ER presents a sophisticated approach combining the benefits of consistency models with effective regularization strategies to improve sample efficiency and stability, paving the way for more reliable performance in complex visual RL environments.

#### Policy Regularization
Policy regularization, in the context of reinforcement learning, addresses the challenge of unstable or inefficient policy learning, particularly in high-dimensional state spaces.  **It aims to stabilize the training process by constraining or regularizing the policy's behavior**, preventing it from converging to suboptimal local optima or exhibiting erratic exploration.  Several techniques are employed, such as **entropy regularization**, which encourages exploration by maximizing policy entropy, and **proximal policy optimization (PPO)**, which limits the policy update at each step to ensure stability.  **Prioritized proximal experience regularization** further refines this, weighting samples in the training process to prioritize those closer to the current policy, improving sample efficiency.  The choice of regularization technique and its parameters significantly impact the learning process. The effectiveness of policy regularization is particularly apparent in visual reinforcement learning where high dimensionality poses substantial hurdles, making it a crucial aspect for achieving both stable and efficient policy learning.

#### High-Dim State Space
The challenges posed by high-dimensional state spaces in reinforcement learning (RL), especially in visual RL, are significant.  **High dimensionality drastically increases the complexity of both exploration and exploitation**, demanding far greater computational resources and potentially leading to unstable training.  Traditional methods, often relying on simplistic policy representations like Gaussian distributions, struggle to capture the nuances of complex behaviors in such spaces, resulting in **poor sample efficiency and suboptimal policies**. The paper addresses this by exploring consistency models and suggests a sample-based entropy regularization technique, showing promising results in stabilizing training. **The use of prioritized proximal experience regularization further improves sample efficiency**, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced techniques in dealing with high-dimensional state spaces.  The high dimensionality of visual data is a key factor in this challenge; it underscores the need for novel solutions beyond simple parametric approximations.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on generalizing consistency policies to visual reinforcement learning (RL) could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the exploration capabilities** of consistency-based policies is crucial, potentially through incorporating techniques like entropy regularization or more sophisticated exploration strategies.  Investigating the **impact of different architectural choices** on policy stability and performance is another key area.  A more in-depth understanding of the **interaction between the actor-critic framework and consistency models** is needed to address the observed instability and potentially develop more robust training methods.  Finally, **applying the approach to more complex and diverse visual RL tasks** such as robotics and navigation, while carefully considering factors like real-world data limitations, would be valuable. Thorough theoretical analysis of the method's convergence and generalization properties would bolster its scientific rigor.

The three policies compared are MaxEnt GP (maximum entropy Gaussian policy), Consistency-AC (consistency policy trained with the actor-critic framework and Q-loss), and MaxEnt CP (maximum entropy consistency policy). The left panel shows that MaxEnt GP maintains a relatively broad action distribution, reflecting good exploration. Consistency-AC shows a sharp peak at the optimal action, indicating quick convergence to a local optimum with limited exploration. MaxEnt CP, with policy regularization, shows a broader distribution than Consistency-AC while still centering around the optimal action, achieving a better balance between exploration and exploitation. The right panel shows that MaxEnt GP explores more widely, initially having lower returns but eventually reaching a higher level than Consistency-AC, which quickly converges to a local optimum but remains at a lower return level. MaxEnt CP performs similarly to MaxEnt GP, showing a slower rise but eventually achieving comparable performance. The figure highlights the effect of policy regularization in stabilizing and improving the performance of the consistency policy.
