This limits their applicability and efficiency.  Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches typically modify the 3DGS optimization process, adding to computational costs.  Moreover, they often rely on video segmentation models, limiting their flexibility. \nGaussianCut addresses these issues by proposing a novel interactive 3D segmentation technique.  It directly operates on the 3D Gaussian splatting representation, simplifying object selection using intuitive user input.  By utilizing a graph-cut algorithm and a novel energy function, GaussianCut efficiently partitions Gaussians into foreground and background, providing high-fidelity segmentation without requiring additional training.  Its adaptability across different scene types and competitive performance demonstrate its significant contribution to the field.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "Ns0LQokxa5/podcast.wav"}
