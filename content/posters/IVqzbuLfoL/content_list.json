Despite advances in Gaussian pruning techniques that aim to remove individual 3D Gaussian primitives, the significant reduction in primitives often fails to translate into commensurate increases in rendering speed, impeding efficiency and practical deployment. We identify that this discrepancy arises due to the overlooked impact of fragment count per Gaussian (i.e., the number of pixels each Gaussian is projected onto). To bridge this gap and meet the growing demands for efficient on-device 3D Gaussian rendering, we propose fragment pruning, an orthogonal enhancement to existing pruning methods that can significantly accelerate rendering by selectively pruning fragments within each Gaussian. Our pruning framework dynamically optimizes the pruning threshold for each Gaussian, markedly improving rendering speed and quality. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamic scenes validate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, by integrating our fragment pruning technique with state-of-the-art Gaussian pruning methods, we achieve up to a $1.71\\times$ speedup on an edge GPU device, the Jetson Orin NX, and enhance rendering quality by an average of 0.16 PSNR on the Tanks&Temples dataset.

In recent years, Neural Radiance Field [4] (NeRF) and its variants [5, 6, 7] have shown promise in delivering high-quality rendering. However, the volume rendering approach [8] adopted in NeRF requires expensive sampling (e.g., more than 100 times neural network inference per emitted ray [4]) in 3D space, leading to slow rendering speeds. To mitigate this problem, subsequent works have attempted to enhance rendering performance by: (1) storing radiance in explicit 3D representations such as voxel grids [9, 10, 11], octrees [12], and hash grids [13]; and (2) converting pre-trained NeRFs into meshes [14, 15]. However, these methods still rely on the aforementioned costly volume rendering and often lead to increased storage consumption and decreased rendering fidelity. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting [16], which adopts a rasterization-based rendering pipeline to avoid the costly point sampling required in volume rendering, has emerged as a promising solution for achieving a superior trade-off between rendering speed and quality.

Our further analysis of the rendering process statistics reveals that these existing efforts overlook a critical opportunity, fragment pruning, which operates at the fragment, i.e., pixel, granularity.

Novel view synthesis aims to render photorealistic images from novel viewpoints, given a set of sparsely sampled images of a specific scene.

More recently, the adoption of deep learning methods has significantly enhanced rendering quality [22, 23, 24, 25]. Specifically, NeRF [4] has emerged as a standout among these deep learning-based novel view synthesis techniques. It models the radiance field of the target scene using implicit neural representations (i.e., multi-layer perceptrons) and achieves unprecedented rendering fidelity. However, NeRF relies on volume rendering [8] with costly sampling of its implicit neural representation along each emitted ray, resulting in slow rendering speeds. To enhance the rendering speeds of NeRF, subsequent research has incorporated explicit geometric structures or more efficient positional encodings to reduce the capacity of the multi-layer perceptron [12, 10, 11, 13], or even eliminated neural networks entirely [9].

In addition to improvements in rendering speed, the use of continuous and anisotropic Gaussian primitives also enables faster convergence and higher reconstruction fidelity compared to the aforementioned NeRF-based methods.

Despite the impressive rendering quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting [16], high redundancy in the reconstructed 3D Gaussian models adversely affects rendering speeds, as identified by [31, 18]. To further boost rendering speeds by compressing this identified redundancy, various techniques have been proposed to prune the redundant Gaussian primitives, drawing parallels to prior deep neural network pruning efforts [32, 33]. For example, Compact 3D Gaussian [31] learns a binary mask to remove unnecessary Gaussians. LightGaussian [34] introduces an importance measure to eliminate insignificant Gaussians below a certain threshold. Mini-Splatting [18] uses importance-based sampling rather than a strict pruning threshold to mitigate excessive culling in local regions. Similarly, [35] proposes a redundancy-based sampling method for Gaussian removal. However, all the aforementioned 3D Gaussian Splatting pruning techniques only address pruning at the granularity of individual Gaussian primitives, neglecting the impact of the number of fragments, produced after projecting 3D Gaussians onto the 2D image plane, on rendering speeds.

In contrast, the proposed fragment pruning approach better preserves the rendering quality in such areas while achieving similar or better rendering efficiency.

Building on this finding, we suggest an algorithm that learns the truncation threshold for each Gaussian instead of using a predetermined heuristic threshold, which allows to truncate Gaussians in a more aggressive manner and thereby reduce the number of fragments. As a result, our method has achieved significant rendering speed improvements over the original 3D Gaussian model with negligible deterioration or even an improvement of quality. While our algorithm alone demonstrates superior performance gains over SOTA Gaussian primitive pruning techniques, it can be used in conjunction with SOTA primitive pruning algorithms to further boost the rendering speed of 3D Gaussian models.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
