### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

3D Gaussian splatting, while promising for novel view synthesis, suffers from slow rendering speed due to the massive number of primitives needed to represent a scene. Existing Gaussian pruning techniques fail to translate primitive reduction into commensurate speed improvements because they overlook the impact of the fragment count per Gaussian (number of pixels each Gaussian is projected onto). This paper introduces **fragment pruning**, an orthogonal enhancement that selectively prunes fragments within each Gaussian. This is achieved by dynamically optimizing a pruning threshold for each Gaussian using a differentiable fine-tuning pipeline. This approach leads to a significant speedup (**up to 1.71x speedup on Jetson Orin NX**) and improved image quality(**0.16 PSNR improvement**) compared to prior techniques. The effectiveness is validated across static and dynamic scenes. This new method complements existing Gaussian pruning methods, resulting in additional speed gains while preserving or improving image quality.

### In-depth insights


#### Learned Fragment Pruning
The proposed "Learned Fragment Pruning" technique presents a novel approach to optimize 3D Gaussian splatting rendering.  Instead of solely pruning entire Gaussian primitives, this method intelligently prunes individual fragments (pixels) within each Gaussian. This is achieved by learning a unique truncation threshold for each Gaussian, **dynamically adjusting the number of fragments rendered per pixel**. This approach addresses the inefficiency of existing Gaussian pruning techniques which don't always translate reduced primitive count into commensurate speed improvements. By learning these thresholds through a differentiable pipeline, **the framework ensures compatibility with existing pre-trained models**, enhancing both rendering speed and image quality. The results demonstrate significant speedups and improved PSNR, showcasing the effectiveness of this orthogonal approach to existing pruning methods. **Adaptive thresholding is crucial** for handling varying Gaussian sizes and spatial distributions, thereby preventing over-pruning or insufficient pruning, making it more efficient than uniform approaches.

#### 3D Gaussian Bottleneck
The concept of a "3D Gaussian Bottleneck" in novel view synthesis highlights the computational limitations of using 3D Gaussian splatting for efficient rendering.  While 3D Gaussian splatting offers advantages in speed and quality over traditional volume rendering, its reliance on millions of Gaussian primitives for scene reconstruction creates a performance bottleneck, particularly during the rasterization stage.  This bottleneck arises because the number of fragments (pixels a Gaussian affects) often significantly exceeds the number of Gaussians, negating the benefits of reduced primitive counts achieved through Gaussian pruning techniques. **The core issue is the disproportionate computational cost of fragment processing versus Gaussian processing.**  This inefficiency makes real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices challenging.  Addressing this bottleneck requires innovative approaches that move beyond simply reducing Gaussian primitives, focusing instead on efficient fragment management and reduction.  This may involve techniques that selectively prune low-impact fragments, or optimize the rasterization process itself to handle high fragment counts more efficiently. **Solutions exploring these avenues are critical for unlocking the full potential of 3D Gaussian splatting and enabling its widespread use in real-time applications.**

#### Adaptive Thresholding
Adaptive thresholding, in the context of image processing and computer vision, is a technique that dynamically adjusts the threshold value used to segment an image, unlike global thresholding which uses a single fixed value.  This adaptability is crucial because images often exhibit varying illumination levels and contrast across different regions. **Adaptive methods offer significant advantages by handling these variations effectively, leading to more accurate and robust segmentation results.** Several algorithms achieve this by calculating local thresholds based on small neighborhoods or regions of interest.  Common strategies involve calculating the mean or median intensity within a window, adapting to local contrast changes. **The size and shape of the window itself can be a parameter, influencing the sensitivity and detail of the resulting segmentation.** Therefore, optimizing the window size is important for balancing noise reduction with preserving fine details.  **The performance of adaptive thresholding techniques heavily depends on the characteristics of the input image and the choice of algorithm.** Selecting an appropriate method requires careful consideration of factors such as noise level, texture, and object shape within the image.

#### Edge Device Speedup
The research paper explores accelerating 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel view synthesis technique, on edge devices.  A key finding is that while existing Gaussian pruning methods reduce the number of primitives, they don't proportionally improve rendering speed due to the overlooked impact of fragment count per Gaussian.  **The paper introduces fragment pruning**, an orthogonal approach that dynamically optimizes pruning thresholds for each Gaussian, leading to significant speed gains.  Experimental results demonstrate **substantial speedups on an edge GPU (Jetson Orin NX)**, surpassing existing state-of-the-art Gaussian pruning techniques. **The combination of fragment and Gaussian pruning yields up to 1.71x speedup**, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel approach for efficient on-device rendering of complex 3D scenes.  This efficiency enhancement is particularly crucial for resource-constrained applications like AR/VR.  The improvements in rendering speed are achieved without a significant loss of visual quality; in fact, **quality is even enhanced in some cases, with an average PSNR improvement of 0.16.**

#### Future Research
The 'Future Research' section of this paper presents exciting avenues for extending the work on fragment pruning in 3D Gaussian splatting.  **One key area is integrating threshold learning directly into the original pre-training process**, eliminating the need for a separate, time-consuming fine-tuning step. This would significantly streamline the workflow and potentially improve efficiency.  Another promising direction is applying this fragment pruning technique to other related tasks, such as **3D content generation and dynamic scene reconstruction**. The authors mention that their method could be applied to the aforementioned using 4D Gaussian features, creating a path towards more efficient, high-quality dynamic scene rendering. Finally, exploring the **application of fragment pruning in conjunction with other advanced Gaussian splatting techniques**, such as those focusing on model compression or improved rendering quality, could lead to substantial improvements in rendering speed and visual fidelity.  Investigating these possibilities holds immense potential for advancing the field of 3D Gaussian splatting and its various applications.

> This figure illustrates the proposed fragment pruning framework. It shows how a learnable truncation threshold is applied to each Gaussian primitive to reduce the number of pixels it projects onto.  The process starts with an original Gaussian with a fixed truncation threshold, then uses a sigmoid function with a learnable threshold to approximate the non-differentiable truncation function.  This allows for each Gaussian to learn its own optimal threshold, thereby reducing fragment count and improving rendering efficiency. The figure includes visual representations of the Gaussians at different stages of this process, demonstrating the effect of the learnable threshold on truncation.
