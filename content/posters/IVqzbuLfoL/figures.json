Subfigure (b) provides a comparison of rendering speed (FPS) and image quality (PSNR) for various methods, including the proposed approach, demonstrating the efficiency gains achieved with fragment pruning.

We apply a learnable truncation threshold for each Gaussian to reduce the number of pixels (i.e., fragments) covered by each Gaussian primitive.", "description": "This figure illustrates the proposed fragment pruning framework. It shows how a learnable truncation threshold is applied to each Gaussian primitive to reduce the number of pixels it projects onto.  The process starts with an original Gaussian with a fixed truncation threshold, then uses a sigmoid function with a learnable threshold to approximate the non-differentiable truncation function.  This allows for each Gaussian to learn its own optimal threshold, thereby reducing fragment count and improving rendering efficiency. The figure includes visual representations of the Gaussians at different stages of this process, demonstrating the effect of the learnable threshold on truncation.", "section": "5 The Proposed Fragment Pruning Framework"}, {"figure_path": "IVqzbuLfoL/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Qualitative comparison of 3D Gaussian Splatting and different Gaussian pruning methods.
