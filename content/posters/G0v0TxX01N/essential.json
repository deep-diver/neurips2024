Diffusion models offer potential advantages but have not been extensively explored for reasoning tasks.  Prior work primarily uses autoregressive models that process information sequentially, potentially limiting efficiency and self-correction capabilities. \nThis paper proposes Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel method integrating diffusion models with chain-of-thought reasoning. DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time in parallel, providing more flexibility in computational performance. Experimental results demonstrate DoT's effectiveness in various reasoning tasks, surpassing larger autoregressive models in both efficiency and accuracy. DoT also showcases promising self-correction abilities, indicating significant potential for advancing complex reasoning in LLMs.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "G0v0TxX01N/podcast.wav"}
