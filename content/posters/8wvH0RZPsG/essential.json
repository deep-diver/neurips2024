{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on multiple hypothesis testing and selective inference.  It provides **a novel framework for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)** after data-dependent selection, addressing a critical limitation in existing methods. The unified theoretical framework is applicable in various complex scenarios. This work opens **new avenues for improving the accuracy and reliability** of multiple testing in complex settings, particularly in machine learning and predictive modeling where data-dependent selection is common.", "summary": "This paper introduces Selective Conformal P-Value (SCPV), a novel method for controlling FDR in conformalized multiple testing after data-dependent selection, offering a unified theoretical framework for various selection scenarios.", "takeaways": ["The proposed SCPV method effectively controls the false discovery rate (FDR) after data-dependent selection.", "SCPV offers a unified theoretical framework applicable to various complex scenarios, including those with strong and weak selection stability.", "Extensive experiments demonstrate SCPV's effectiveness and validity across various settings, outperforming existing methods."], "tldr": "Many real-world applications involve selecting specific subsets from a larger dataset before performing multiple hypothesis testing.  This often leads to issues with controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) because standard methods don't account for the selection process. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a method that accurately captures the distorted distribution of test statistics after selection and successfully controls the FDR.  \nThe researchers achieve this by leveraging a holdout labeled dataset to construct valid test statistics.  They propose an adaptive strategy for picking labeled data based on the stability of the selection rule. This method, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, controls FDR over the selected subset. A unified theoretical framework ensures the method's validity even with the randomness of the selected subset and the dependence among the test statistics.", "affiliation": "Nankai University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "8wvH0RZPsG/podcast.wav"}
