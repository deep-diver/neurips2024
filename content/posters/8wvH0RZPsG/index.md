### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications involve selecting specific subsets from a larger dataset before performing multiple hypothesis testing.  This often leads to issues with controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) because standard methods don't account for the selection process. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a method that accurately captures the distorted distribution of test statistics after selection and successfully controls the FDR.  

The researchers achieve this by leveraging a holdout labeled dataset to construct valid test statistics.  They propose an adaptive strategy for picking labeled data based on the stability of the selection rule. This method, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, controls FDR over the selected subset. A unified theoretical framework ensures the method's validity even with the randomness of the selected subset and the dependence among the test statistics.

### In-depth insights


#### Selective Conformal
Selective conformal methods aim to address the challenges of applying conformal prediction techniques to datasets where a selection process has already been applied.  This selection, often data-dependent, distorts the distribution of the data, impacting the validity of standard conformal inference. **The core idea is to create a calibration set that reflects the distribution of the selected data**, mitigating the bias introduced by the prior selection. This might involve using a holdout set or adaptively selecting data from a labeled set based on the stability of the selection process to ensure exchangeability between calibration and test data. This sophisticated approach enables the construction of valid p-values, even after data-dependent selection, preserving the crucial property of conformal inference while applying multiple testing procedures. **This addresses the critical problem of selective inference**, ensuring the integrity of results when dealing with subsets of data chosen non-randomly. A key aspect of this research is developing a theoretical framework and algorithms for various selection rules, enhancing the robustness and reliability of conformalized multiple testing in realistic scenarios.

#### Adaptive Calibration
Adaptive calibration, in the context of selective conformal inference, addresses the challenge of **maintaining valid p-values** after a data-dependent selection process.  Standard conformal methods assume exchangeability between calibration and test sets, an assumption violated by selection. Adaptive calibration dynamically adjusts the calibration set based on the stability of the selection rule, aiming to **re-establish exchangeability** between the chosen calibration subset and the selected test data. This is crucial for ensuring that the resulting p-values accurately reflect uncertainty, leading to **valid FDR control**. The adaptive nature allows the method to handle a wider range of selection procedures, including those with varying levels of stability, and to improve the efficiency and power of the approach in more complex scenarios. The **key insight** is the balance between preserving the validity of the inference and maintaining sufficient power to detect signals of interest.

#### FDR Control
The research paper focuses on controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in the context of conformalized multiple testing, particularly after data-dependent selection.  **A key challenge addressed is the distortion of the test statistic distribution caused by the selection process**.  The authors propose using a holdout labeled dataset to construct valid conformal p-values, which accurately reflect the distribution of the selected test units.  **Their approach involves adaptively choosing data for calibration based on the selection rule's stability**, ensuring exchangeability between calibration and test data.  Implementing the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, **they demonstrate theoretical FDR control under specific selection rules (joint-exchangeable and top-K), extending to a weaker stability condition via an adaptive strategy**. The effectiveness and validity are empirically validated across diverse scenarios, highlighting the method's resilience and improved power compared to existing alternatives.

#### Stability Analysis
A stability analysis in the context of a machine learning model assesses how robust its performance is to various perturbations.  In the case of selective conformal inference, **stability is crucial** because the selection process introduces randomness into the model's input. A stable selection rule produces consistent results even when small changes are made to the data. The analysis would delve into how the choice of selection criteria, data-dependent thresholding methods, and specific algorithms used impact the overall stability.  **Evaluating stability often involves metrics** that measure the consistency of the selected subset across various iterations of the selection process. **Theoretical guarantees of stability** are desirable, especially when dealing with specific classes of selection rules. The goal is to determine conditions that ensure the FDR control holds under perturbations, demonstrating the reliability and applicability of the conformalized multiple testing procedure in diverse settings.  The analysis might also investigate the relationship between selection stability and the power of the test, examining whether more stable selections lead to a greater number of true discoveries while maintaining the FDR control.

#### Future Extensions
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **relaxing the strong stability assumptions** on selection rules, thereby broadening applicability to more complex, real-world scenarios. Investigating **alternative calibration set selection strategies** beyond the adaptive approach presented would enhance robustness and efficiency.  Exploring **extensions to more general model settings** beyond regression and classification, such as survival analysis or time series data, is crucial for practical impact.  A key focus should be on developing **more powerful and efficient multiple testing procedures** that account for the complexities introduced by data-dependent selection. This could involve leveraging recent advances in selective inference or other theoretical frameworks.  Finally, extensive **empirical evaluation** on diverse real-world datasets with various selection mechanisms would solidify the practical utility and limitations of the proposed methods.
