The x-axis represents the noise strength in the data, and the y-axis represents either FDR or power. The black dashed line in the FDR plots indicates the target FDR level of 10%.  The figure showcases the performance of the proposed Selective Conformal P-value (SCPV) method in comparison to other benchmark methods (Ordinary Multiple Testing, Adjusted Multiple Testing with Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli procedures, and Selection Conditional Conformal Prediction).", "section": "4 Numerical studies"}, {"figure_path": "8wvH0RZPsG/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Empirical FDR (left) and Power (right) of five methods under different scenarios and selection rules.
