The table also lists the research papers that proposed each hypothesis, providing a valuable resource for further investigation into this topic.  The hypotheses range from issues related to the quality and quantity of information available in the neighborhood of low-degree nodes to the influence of high-degree nodes during training and even purely test-time effects.", "section": "A.1 Hypotheses for Degree Bias"}, {"figure_path": "1mAaewThcz/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: A taxonomy of GNN degree bias papers based on whether they theoretically analyze the origins of degree bias, explicitly linking a node's degree to its test and training error.", "description": "This table categorizes papers on GNN degree bias based on whether they provide a theoretical analysis that explicitly links a node's degree to its test and training error.
