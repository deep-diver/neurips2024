We report the accuracy and the fraction of the budget spent for examination and labeling. RANDOM and Naive-BALD spend most of the budget on examination and few labels is acquired. e-BALD acquires the most labels but many of them are not informative due to the noisy estimation of e(x). Joint-BALD-UCB and Joint-BALD-TS balance the examination and labeling budget automatically and achieve the best accuracy.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different active learning methods on synthetic data, focusing on accuracy and resource allocation (examination vs. labeling).  It highlights the trade-offs between different approaches, especially regarding the efficiency of label acquisition and the overall model accuracy achieved.", "section": "5.1 Synthetic Data"}]
