The methods compared are PointUVDiff (using UV-mapping and point-cloud textures), DiffusionNet, and the proposed UV3-TeD method.  The comparison is based on three metrics: Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Lower FID and KID scores indicate better image quality, while a higher LPIPS score indicates greater perceptual similarity to real images. The results show that UV3-TeD outperforms the other methods in terms of image quality and perceptual similarity, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality textures.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Cb1Md0RvqF/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation studies on our UV3-TeD on ABO.

Several components of the model were removed or replaced, and the impact on performance is measured using three metrics: FID, KID, and LPIPS.  Lower FID and KID scores indicate better model performance, while a higher LPIPS score indicates greater diversity in the generated textures.", "section": "Ablation Studies"}]
