However, current methods face challenges in scalability and computational efficiency, particularly for large molecules.  Many existing approaches rely on discrete representations (point clouds or voxel grids), limiting their expressiveness and hindering their ability to handle complex structures.  The message passing mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs) used in some approaches also limits their expressiveness and scalability.\nThis paper introduces FuncMol, a novel generative model that uses continuous neural fields to represent 3D molecules. FuncMol uses a conditional neural field to encode molecular fields into latent codes. It then employs a score-based neural empirical Bayes approach and Langevin MCMC to generate new molecules.  The method outperforms existing techniques in terms of speed and scalability, particularly with large molecules. FuncMol achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macrocyclic peptides, demonstrating its potential for various applications in life science research.", "affiliation": "Prescient Design", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "9lGJrkqJUw/podcast.wav"}
