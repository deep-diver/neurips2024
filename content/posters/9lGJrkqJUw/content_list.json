We handle these fields as such, by parameterizing the molecular occupancy field with a neural network1, shared among all molecules, and modulation codes, specific to each molecule. The former models common molecular structures (e.g., bonds, angles, valencies, symmetries) while the later encodes variations that make each molecule unique. Given a modulation code, we decode the molecular field by predicting the occupancy of each atom at given 3D coordinates (see Figure 1(a)).

Neural fields, also referred to as implicit neural representations (INRs), are coordinate-based neural networks that map coordinates (e.g., pixels on an image or coordinates in 3D Euclidean space) to features (e.g., RGB values or atomic occupancies). The idea of representing data points implicitly as neural networks dates back to the work of [14]. Recently, these representations have been successfully applied to model continuous signals, e.g., 2D images [15, 16, 17], 3D shapes [18, 19, 20, 21], 3D scenes [22, 23], videos [24, 25], physics [26, 27], due to their appealing properties. Recently, two concurrent seminal work lead to a fast progress of neural fields by overcoming the spectral bias of coordinate-based neural networks [28]. Sitzmann et al. [29] propose SIREN, a neural network that uses periodic activation functions, while Tancik et al. [30] considers a positional encoding based on Fourier features. Built on top of those architectures, multiplicative filter networks (MFNs) [31] represent fields as a simple linear combination over an exponential number of basis functions (e.g. Fourier or Gabor basis).

Diffusion models [35] have also been applied to learn the distribution of neural fields [36, 37, 38, 39]. Some work [37, 40] parameterize the neural field with the vector of all the corresponding weights. However, when the signal is complex and the neural fields have large number of parameters (e.g., in the order of millions), it is preferable to parameterize the field with a latent code with much lower dimension [36, 41, 42, 43]. Dupont et al. [36] fit the whole dataset with a shared coordinate-based network and learn a latent modulation code for each field with gradient-based meta learning [44]. Similarly to them, we parameterize neural fields with latent modulation codes. However, instead of applying meta learning, we learn the latent codes through stochastic optimization, either following the \u201cauto-encoding\u201d [19] or the \u201cauto-decoding\u201d [20] framework.

This contribution is orthogonal to ours and can potentially be incorporated into our generative model. Other approaches [57, 58] map atomic densities on discrete 3D regular grids and leverage computer vision techniques for generation. Recently, VoxMol [5] (and its latent version [59]), a score-based generative model based on neural empirical Bayes [1], shows that voxel-based representations can achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D drug-like molecule generation.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
