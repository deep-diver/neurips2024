Recent advancements in AI [14, 44, 42, 48] have paved the way for motion generation, allowing for various control signals including textual descriptions, music pieces, and human poses. A significant shortcoming of most existing works is their focus on single-modality control signals, overlooking the potential for multimodal information integration. More importantly, the comprehension and generation of motions are predominantly studied in isolation. In reality, human motion cognition and communication indispensably require seamless transitions between any motion-relevant modalities. Therefore, it is vital to develop a unified framework for motion comprehension and generation that can efficiently utilize multiple signals simultaneously.

Despite their promising performance in motion generation, these approaches often fall short in comprehending motion. MotionGPT [21], a recent innovation, constructs a unified motion-language model to generate plausible human motions and natural language descriptions through prompt instructions. However, MotionGPT focuses solely on a single non-motion modality, i.e., text.

Inspired by these efforts [21, 54], we view both motion and music as distinct forms of language, facilitating better associations with text via LLMs. Specifically, akin to language, we compress raw motion and music into a sequence of discrete semantic tokens. By encoding motion, music, and language within a single vocabulary, we can build a unified representation space across these different modalities.

Specifically, to better learn the complex music-to-dance task where both input and output modalities are unfamiliar to LLMs, we introduce two auxiliary tasks: musicto-text and text-to-dance, aimed at aligning music and dance modalities with the structured text embedding space.

Many existing works focus on studying human appearance, pose, detection, attribute, part parsing and so on [61, 19, 45, 40, 23, 17]. This work focuses on studying human motion, including motion comprehension and motion generation. Motion comprehension involves two core tasks: motion-to-text and dance-to-music. Motion-to-text aims to describe human motion with natural language [37]. For example, recurrent networks have been used in [37] to accomplish this task. Dance-to-music involves creating a piece of music from a given dance [20, 27, 64]. For example, Zhun et al. [64] utilizes a generative adversarial network to generate music from dance videos. On the other hand, motion generation involves generating diverse human motions using multimodal inputs, such as text [44, 56, 15, 5, 57], music [27, 18, 52, 42] and incomplete motion [31, 1, 3]. Text-to-motion is one of the most important motion generation tasks. Recent works typically map text to motion using different architectures: diffusion model [57] and autoregressive transformer model [15]. Music-to-dance focuses on generating dance movements from music. For example, [42] predicts discrete token sequences conditioned on music, which are then used to regenerate the dance sequence. Motion Completion generates motion conditioning on partial motions, such as motion prediction [31, 1] and motion-in-between [34, 43]. Although these methods have shown promising results in various human motion tasks, most are limited to handling a single task. Until recently, some works [12, 21, 60, 62] attempt to integrate two or more tasks into a unified model, as shown in Tab. 1. However, these works either lack the ability of motion comprehension [62, 60] or fail to handle music modality [12, 21].

Researchers have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs to handle multimodal tasks, expanding them to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). For example, AnyGPT [53] employs LLaMA-2 [47] to construct an any-to-any multimodal language model. NExT-GPT [50] employs Vicuna [6] with multimodal adaptors and diffusion decoders to perform tasks across arbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio. Recently, the works [21, 60] attempt to use LLMs for motion-related tasks. [60] uses LLaMA [46] to build a general-purpose motion generator, which, however, lacks the ability to comprehend motion.

We use a large-scale text-to-motion dataset: Motion-X [29], and two music-to-dance datasets: $\\mathrm{AlST++}$ [24] and FineDance [25]. Notably, the 3D pose annotations differ among these datasets, therefore, we standardize their processing for uniform usage. Specifically, we select 22 joints common to these datasets and preprocess the motion samples following [13], resulting in motion sequences with identical representation. Further details on datasets and preprocessing are provided in Appendix B.1. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Evaluation Metrics. Different tasks employ distinct evaluation metrics. We use the most common evaluation metrics to assess the performance of $\\mathrm{M^{3}G P T}$ for each task. (1) Text-to-Motion. Following [21, 12], we use Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity $(D i\\nu)$ , $R$ -Precition that calculates the top-1 motion-to-text retrieval accuracy (R TOP1). (2) Motion-to-Text. Following [21], we use linguistic metrics like BLEU, CIDEr, along with $R$ -Precision for evaluating motion-to-text alignment. (3) Music-to-Dance. Following [26, 52], we use $F I D$ , Diversity and Beat Align Score (BAS) on kinetic features [22] (denoted as $\"k\"$ ) to evaluate the dance generation quality. Notably, as noted in [48], the geometric features [33] are unreliable as a measure of dance generation quality. So we only use the kinetic features for evaluation. (4) Dance-to-Music. Following [52], we use Beats Coverage Scores (BCS), Beats Hit Scores (BHS), and $F l$ score to evaluate music generation quality. (5) Motion Prediction and In-Between. Following [21], we use $F I D$ and Diversity to measure the consistency between the provided pose conditions and generated motion.

For motion tokenizer, we set the codebook size to 512. As for music tokenizer, we use the pre-trained VQ-VAE from Jukebox with a codebook size of 2048.

For training the motion tokenizer, we use Adam as the optimizer with a batch size of 1000 and an initial learning rate of $10^{-4}$ . To train the language model backbone, we employ the Adafactor_dev optimizer and use CosineAnnealingLR as the learning rate scheduler.

For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
