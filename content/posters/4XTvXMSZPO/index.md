### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with decision-centric tasks like controlling real-world devices due to a lack of relevant training data and the inherent stochasticity of real-world interactions.  Static demonstrations are insufficient for training such agents.  This paper addresses these limitations.

DigiRL, a two-stage approach (offline RL followed by offline-to-online RL), effectively addresses these issues.  By combining offline RL for initialization with online RL for continuous adaptation, DigiRL enables the training of highly robust and effective in-the-wild device control agents. The Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) dataset showcases DigiRL's superior performance, achieving a substantial improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. This novel approach significantly advances the field of autonomous RL for digital agents.

> This figure provides a high-level overview of the DigiRL approach.  It starts by describing the use of a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) as the foundation. The first stage involves offline reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune the VLM using existing trajectory data. This helps the model learn initial goal-oriented behavior. Then, the second stage introduces online RL where the agent interacts with real-world GUIs. The agent's performance is continuously improved by the online RL process, guided by an automated evaluation system that provides rewards based on the agent's performance.

### In-depth insights


#### DigiRL Framework
The DigiRL framework presents a novel approach to training in-the-wild device-control agents by leveraging autonomous reinforcement learning.  Its core innovation lies in a two-stage training process: **offline RL** for model initialization using existing data and **offline-to-online RL** for continuous adaptation and refinement via real-world interactions.  This addresses the limitations of traditional approaches that struggle with real-world stochasticity and non-stationarity.  DigiRL incorporates several key enhancements to standard RL techniques, including **advantage-weighted RL** with improved estimators to account for stochasticity, and an **automatic curriculum** based on an instruction-level value function for efficient learning signal extraction.  The framework also includes a **scalable and parallelizable Android learning environment** and a robust VLM-based evaluator, enabling real-time online learning and performance assessment.  By combining offline pre-training with online autonomous RL, DigiRL achieves state-of-the-art results in in-the-wild device control, significantly surpassing both supervised fine-tuning methods and existing autonomous RL approaches.

#### RL for VLMs
Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a powerful paradigm for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs).  Traditional VLM training primarily relies on supervised methods using large-scale datasets, often lacking the decision-centric data crucial for complex tasks. **RL offers a compelling solution by directly optimizing VLM behavior for specific goals**, allowing them to learn complex decision-making policies through interaction with an environment.  This approach can address the limitations of static demonstrations, **enabling VLMs to adapt to dynamic and stochastic environments**, such as real-world GUI interactions, and generalize better to unseen situations.  **Offline RL methods are particularly useful to leverage existing data for pre-training**, but **online RL is essential for adapting to the real-world's non-stationary nature**.  The combination of offline and online RL techniques offers a promising avenue to train robust and adaptive VLMs for real-world applications.  **However, challenges remain**, including the need for efficient RL algorithms that can handle the high-dimensionality of VLM actions and states, the difficulty in designing effective reward functions that accurately reflect task success, and the computational cost of online RL. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to unleash the full potential of RL for training advanced, adaptable VLMs.

#### Stochasticity
The concept of stochasticity is central to the DigiRL paper, highlighting the **unpredictability inherent in real-world environments**.  Unlike simulated settings, real-world device control via GUIs involves numerous sources of randomness.  Website layouts change, pop-up ads appear unexpectedly, network latency fluctuates, and even the device itself may behave unexpectedly.  The authors emphasize how these stochastic elements make static demonstration data inadequate for training robust agents, as such data fails to capture the dynamism of real-world interactions.  DigiRL's success stems directly from its ability to learn *in situ*, constantly adapting to these unforeseen variations.  **Online RL**, integrated with mechanisms for filtering out incorrect actions and automatically curating the learning signal, is key to mastering this challenge.  **The paper's experiments showcase how a continuously updated model significantly outperforms those trained solely on static demonstrations, underscoring the critical role of handling stochasticity for achieving robust, generalizable performance in real-world scenarios.** This highlights the need for RL methods capable of directly handling real-world noise and unpredictability in training data rather than relying on pre-trained models fine-tuned with static data.

#### Offline-to-Online RL
Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) represents a powerful paradigm for training agents in complex, real-world environments.  **It leverages the benefits of both offline and online RL**, combining the sample efficiency of offline learning with the adaptability of online learning.  The offline phase uses pre-collected data to pre-train the agent, initializing its policy and providing a foundation for subsequent online learning. This is particularly beneficial when online data collection is costly or dangerous, as it allows the agent to begin with some level of competence before interacting with the environment. **The online phase then refines the pre-trained policy through continuous interaction with the environment**, allowing the agent to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and dynamic changes. This approach is especially advantageous in scenarios with non-stationary environments, such as controlling real-world devices through GUIs. The effectiveness of offline-to-online RL hinges on several factors: the quality and representativeness of the offline data, the choice of RL algorithm and its hyperparameters, and the design of the online learning process. By strategically combining offline and online learning phases, this approach allows for efficient and robust agent training in scenarios where purely online methods might be impractical or inefficient. **The approach is especially crucial for real-world applications like in-the-wild device control** where the environment is inherently complex and unpredictable.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending DigiRL to other device types and operating systems** beyond Android would significantly broaden its applicability. This could involve adapting the Android learning environment and the VLM-based evaluator to handle the unique characteristics of different interfaces and operating systems. **Improving the robustness of DigiRL to handle even greater levels of real-world stochasticity** and non-stationarity is also crucial.  This could involve designing more sophisticated RL algorithms that are inherently more resilient to unexpected changes in the environment, as well as developing more effective curriculum learning strategies.  **Investigating more advanced RL techniques**, such as model-based RL or hierarchical RL, could further enhance the efficiency and performance of DigiRL.  Model-based RL could potentially reduce the amount of real-world interaction needed for training, while hierarchical RL could enable the agent to solve more complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller subtasks. **Exploring the use of larger and more powerful VLMs** would likely improve the generalization capabilities of DigiRL, allowing it to handle a wider range of instructions and tasks. Finally, **developing more sophisticated methods for evaluating the performance of in-the-wild device control agents** remains an important open problem. This includes developing more robust and comprehensive evaluation metrics, as well as developing methods for analyzing the failure modes of such agents to identify areas for improvement.
