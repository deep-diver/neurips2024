The first row represents a sentence with several words. Each row in the matrix Dc shows a subset of the words that are masked (value 0) and unmasked (value 1). The final column shows the output of the model based on which words were masked in that row. By cleverly designing the masking patterns using group testing techniques, it is possible to quickly identify which word (in this case, \u201cnever\u201d) corresponds to the singleton in the M\u00f6bius transform, even with high-dimensional input. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of identifying non-zero interactions by utilizing group testing for efficient sparse M\u00f6bius transform computation.
