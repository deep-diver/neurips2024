Existing methods, like Shapley values, often struggle to capture higher-order interactions between inputs, limiting their explanatory power.  Moreover, computing these measures can be computationally expensive, hindering their applicability to large models.  This research addresses this challenge by focusing on the M\u00f6bius transform, a powerful mathematical tool that directly represents the importance of input sets.\nThe proposed algorithm significantly reduces the computational cost of computing the M\u00f6bius transform by exploiting sparsity and low-degree properties often observed in real-world models.  It uses advanced group-testing techniques, leading to a non-adaptive algorithm with sub-linear sample complexity and robustness to noise. This is a major advancement because it allows efficient model interpretation even for large datasets and noisy environments. The study also provides rigorous theoretical guarantees and supports these claims with extensive simulations on real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency compared to standard approaches.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "glGeXu1zG4/podcast.wav"}
