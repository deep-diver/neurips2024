Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module.

Historically, models such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were standard in forecasting, noted for their simplicity and effectiveness in certain contexts [2]. However, the emergence of deep learning models, particularly those exploiting structures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [14, 3, 29] and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [1, 8], has shifted the paradigm towards more complex models capable of understanding intricate patterns in time series data.

Consequently, some studies adopted a channel-independence strategy and achieved favorable results [28, 23, 34]. Yet, these methods overlooked the correlation between channels, thereby hindering further improvements in model performance. Subsequent studies captured this correlation information through mechanisms such as attention, achieving better outcomes, and demonstrating the necessity of information transfer between channels [47, 33, 26]. However, these approaches either employed attention mechanisms with high complexity [26] or struggled to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance [7].

This centralized interaction not only reduces the comparison complexity but also takes advantage of both channel independence and aggregated information from all the channels that can help improve the local ones [40]. Our empirical results show that our SOFTS method achieves better results against current state-of-the-art methods with lower computation resources. Besides, SOFTS can scale to time series with a large number of channels or time steps, which is difficult for many methods based on Transformer without specific modification.

Time series forecasting is a critical area of research that finds applications in both industry and academia. With the powerful representation capability of neural networks, deep forecasting models have undergone a rapid development [22, 38, 37, 4, 5]. Two widely used methods for time series forecasting are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). RNNs model successive time points based on the Markov assumption [14, 3, 29], while CNNs extract variation information along the temporal dimension using techniques such as temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) [1, 8]. However, due to the Markov assumption in RNN and the local reception property in TCN, both of the two models are unable to capture the long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Besides, such a distributed structure may lack robustness when there are abnormal channels for the reason that they rely on the extract correlation between channels. Existing research on channel independence has already proved the untrustworthy correlations on non-stationary time series [45, 11]. To this end, we propose the STAR module to solve the inefficiency of the distributed interaction modules. This module is inspired by the star-shaped centralized system in software engineering, where instead of letting the clients communicate with each other, there is a server center to aggregate and exchange the information [30, 10], whose advantage is efficient and reliable.
