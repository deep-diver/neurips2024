[2022] (MHS), ILP, and WPMAX-SAT to solve one graph versus (a) the number of vertices in the graph and (b) the number of districts of S.", "description": "This figure compares the average runtime of three algorithms for solving the minimum-cost intervention problem: the algorithm from Akbari et al. [2022] (MHS), an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation, and a Weighted Partially Max-SAT (WPMAX-SAT) formulation.  Part (a) shows the runtime scaling with the number of vertices in the graph for a single district (S), while part (b) illustrates the runtime scaling with the number of districts for graphs with 20 vertices.  The results demonstrate the significantly improved efficiency of the ILP and WPMAX-SAT methods compared to the MHS approach, particularly as the problem size increases.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
