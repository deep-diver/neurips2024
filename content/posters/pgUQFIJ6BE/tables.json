The complexities are broken down into communication rounds (the number of times nodes communicate), communication complexity (total amount of data transmitted), and local gradient complexity (total number of local gradient computations).  The methods compared include Extra-Gradient (EG), Star Min-Max Data Similarity (SMMDS), Extra-Gradient Sliding (EGS), and the proposed Stochastic Variance-Reduced Optimistic Gradient Sliding (SVOGS).
