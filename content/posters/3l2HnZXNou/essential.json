Existing methods often struggle because agents make decisions simultaneously, leading to conflicts.  Asynchronous approaches, where agents act in a predetermined order, improve the situation but may not be optimal.  Also, most current methods rely solely on communicating information about observations, not actual actions. \nSeqComm addresses these issues with a two-phase approach.  In the **negotiation phase**, agents communicate hidden information to establish a priority order.  Then in the **launching phase**, high-priority agents act first and communicate their actions to lower-priority agents. This method ensures that actions are not made in conflicting ways. The paper proves that SeqComm monotonically improves and converges, and shows empirically that it outperforms existing methods on various tasks.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3l2HnZXNou/podcast.wav"}
