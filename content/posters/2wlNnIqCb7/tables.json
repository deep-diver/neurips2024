Compl. and \u0394LexSize are the absolute value of the differences between the complexity or lexicon size of the emergent system and English. NID measures the misalignment between the emergent system and English. For all three measures, lower values reflect a better fit to the human data. Utility and MSE correspond to the agent\u2019s pragmatic competence and reconstruction error, respectively. Each cell shows the mean value across three random seeds \u00b1 SEM.", "description": "This table compares the performance of four different models in terms of complexity, lexicon size, normalized information distance (NID), utility, and mean squared error (MSE). The models differ in the weighting of utility, informativeness, and complexity in their objective functions. The model with the best alignment to English is highlighted, showing a good balance between these three factors. Baseline models show the effects of prioritizing only one of the three factors.", "section": "5 Results"}]
