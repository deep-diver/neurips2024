We conducted experiments to understand the impact of Fourier components by varying the percentages of Fourier prompts in VFPT. As shown in Fig. 2, we observed distinct preferences across the VTAB-1k benchmark, which comprises three groups with varying data disparities (see $\\S4.1)$ . Specifically, the Natural group, which has a data distribution similar to the pretrained task (low disparity), shows peak performance when half of the visual prompts are transformed into Fourier prompts, as indicated by the accuracy curves in Fig. 2(a). This suggests that transfer learning is less challenging in this group. Conversely, for the Specialized and Structured groups, which have data distributions significantly different from the pretrained task (high disparity), the accuracy curves in Fig. 2(b-c) demonstrate that higher classification performance is achieved with an increased percentage of Fourier components. These observations are consistent with our expectations, demonstrating the effectiveness of Fourier prompts in VFPT, especially for tasks with large data disparities. In other words, our approach can be viewed as a generalization of VPT, where the Fourier components learn effective representations from the frequency domain that complement the knowledge from the spatial domain.

Although the Fourier basis\u2019s orthogonal and expressive advantages reduce the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning, the inverse transform applied to the spectral matrix discards frequency information, ultimately considering only traditional spatial domain features. The parameter-efficient use of the Fourier transform in this study is orthogonal to our method, where both spatial and frequency domain information are integrated (see $\\S3$ ) for enhanced generality (see $\\S4.2\\rangle$ ) and interpretability (see $\\S4.4\\rangle$ ).
