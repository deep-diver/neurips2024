A natural question then arises (paraphrased from [Sch90]\u2019s abstract): can one convert such mediocre learning rules into one that performs extremely well?

In their absence, bounds on absolute error are unachievable, e.g., when labels are uniformly random irrespective of features, no classifier can achieve accuracy better than half. Instead, in agnostic learning, the goal of the learner is to output a hypothesis with small excess error with respect to the best in-class classifier.

In the next step, however, because $H_{1}$ through relabelling of new samples determines the weak hypothesis, these samples are no longer IID with respect to the weak hypothesis or $-\\,\\mathrm{sign}(H_{1})$ , since they have already played a demonstrable part in determining it. This effects occur and compound at all time steps, not just the first.

To circumvent this, we give a branching criteria to decide which component to add to the present mixture, based on the performance of the weak hypothesis, the only component whose performance is estimable with bounded generalization error, alone on the reused data. Concretely, we introduce a threshold $\\tau$ to choose the weak hypothesis, if it makes at least $\\tau$ progress, and otherwise, choose $-\\,\\mathrm{sign}(H_{t})$ even if in truth it is worse than the weak hypothesis.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
