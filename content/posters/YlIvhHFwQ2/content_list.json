A question then remains: what about lifting complete multi-object dynamic scenes? There are two challenges in this direction: First, rendering error gradients are often insufficient to recover fast object motion, and second, view predictive generative models work much better for objects than whole scenes, so, score distillation objectives cannot currently be applied at the scene level directly. We present DreamScene4D, the first approach to generate 3D dynamic scenes of multiple objects from monocular videos via $360^{\\circ}$ novel view synthesis. Our key insight is a \u201cdecompose-recompose\u201d approach that factorizes the video scene into the background and object tracks, while also factorizing object motion into 3 components: object-centric deformation, object-to-world-frame transformation, and camera motion. Such decomposition permits rendering error gradients and object view-predictive models to recover object 3D completions and deformations while bounding box tracks guide the large object movements in the scene. We show extensive results on challenging DAVIS, Kubric, and self-captured videos with quantitative comparisons and a user preference study. Besides 4D scene generation, DreamScene4D obtains accurate 2D persistent point track by projecting the inferred 3D trajectories to 2D.

What about the unobserved views of the dynamic 3D scene? Existing 4D generation works utilize generative models to constrain the appearance of objects in unseen views through score distillation losses. Text-to-4D [46, 2, 53, 24, 1] or image-to-4D [64, 43, 58, 66] setups take a single text prompt or image as input to create a 4D object. Several works [17, 14, 43, 32, 61, 62] explore the video-to-4D setup, but these methods predominantly focus on videos containing a single object with minor 3D deformations, where the object deforms in place without large motion in the 3D scene. This focus arises because current generative models perform significantly better at predicting novel views of individual objects [26] than multi-object scenes. Consequently, score distillation objectives for 3D object lifting are difficult to apply directly at a scene level. Also, optimization difficulty arises when neural fields or 3D Gaussians are trained to model large temporal deformations directly.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
