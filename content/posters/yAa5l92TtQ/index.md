### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current automated theorem proving methods often rely on short-sighted heuristics, leading to suboptimal or distracting subgoals and hindering the discovery of longer proofs.  This limits their ability to solve complex mathematical problems effectively.  The search-based approaches often get stuck in exploring a detailed proof of meaningless intermediate conjecture and wastes time.

To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces POETRY (PrOvE Theorems RecursivelY), a novel recursive approach.  POETRY tackles theorems level-by-level, initially searching for a verifiable proof sketch at each level, replacing detailed proofs of intermediate conjectures with placeholders.  This incremental approach allows for efficient exploration of the proof space and significant performance gains are observed. The experiments demonstrate that POETRY achieves a 5.1% improvement in the average proving success rate and increases the maximum proof length substantially.

> This figure compares two different approaches for proving theorems: step-by-step and recursive.  The step-by-step method (a) treats the proof as a linear sequence of steps, only verifiable upon completion. The recursive method (b), in contrast, breaks down the proof into smaller, independently verifiable 'proof sketches'. Each sketch proves a sub-goal, temporarily replacing the detailed proof of intermediate conjectures with placeholders ('sorry'). This allows for incremental verification and potentially discovering longer proofs.

> This table compares the performance of POETRY against several baseline methods (Thor w/o sledgehammer, GPT-f Baseline with sampling decoding, and GPT-f Baseline with beam search decoding) and shows the pass@1 success rate for each method on three different datasets: miniF2F-valid, miniF2F-test, and PISA (split into single-level and multi-level subsets).  The highest success rate for each dataset is highlighted in bold, indicating POETRY's superior performance.





### In-depth insights


#### Recursive Proof
The concept of "Recursive Proof" in the context of automated theorem proving offers a novel approach to tackling complex mathematical problems.  Instead of a linear, step-by-step approach, a recursive method breaks down the proof into a hierarchy of smaller, more manageable sub-proofs.  **Each sub-proof addresses a specific part of the overall theorem**, with placeholders used for intermediate conjectures that are proven recursively at deeper levels. This incremental strategy contrasts with existing methods that often get trapped in local optima or distracted by seemingly promising but ultimately unhelpful subgoals.  The **recursive nature allows for a more holistic and structured exploration of the search space**, potentially uncovering longer, more intricate proofs than previously possible.  **Verification is enhanced by checking the validity of each proof sketch at each level**, before proceeding to subsequent levels.  This contrasts with the step-by-step approach which only allows for verification once the whole proof is complete.  This recursive approach is analogous to how humans often solve complex problems, decomposing them into simpler sub-problems and solving them individually before assembling the final solution.

#### Isabelle/POETRY
Isabelle/POETRY represents a novel approach to automated theorem proving, integrating the Isabelle theorem prover with a recursive proof generation technique.  **Isabelle provides the formal mathematical environment**, facilitating rigorous verification of proof steps. POETRY's core innovation lies in its **recursive, level-by-level approach**, tackling complex theorems by first generating a verifiable proof sketch at each level, temporarily replacing detailed subproofs with placeholders.  This incremental strategy avoids the pitfalls of short-sighted heuristics, which often lead to suboptimal or distracting subgoals in traditional step-by-step methods.  By focusing on verifiable proof outlines, and then recursively proving the intermediate conjectures, **POETRY efficiently manages the search space and increases the likelihood of finding longer, more complex proofs.** The combination of Isabelle's formal rigor and POETRY's recursive strategy makes for a powerful and efficient system, showcasing promising advancements in automated theorem proving.

#### Recursive BFS
The proposed recursive best-first search (BFS) algorithm represents a **novel approach** to neural theorem proving.  Instead of a linear, step-by-step search, it **iteratively explores proof sketches**, focusing on the current level's conjecture or subgoal.  This incremental approach tackles the theorem hierarchically by deferring proofs of intermediate conjectures (using placeholders like 'sorry') to subsequent levels, enabling the algorithm to handle more complex proofs, resulting in **longer maximum proof lengths**.  This recursive strategy contrasts with traditional step-by-step methods, which are prone to getting trapped in less relevant subproblems due to myopic heuristics.  The 'sorry' tactic is crucial; it allows for verifiable proof outlines at each level. Importantly, the algorithm includes mechanisms for backtracking and status updates (OPEN, FAILED, HALF-PROVED, PROVED), reflecting the dynamic progress across various proof levels, demonstrating a **robust and adaptable search strategy**. The recursive BFS algorithm thus demonstrates a significant improvement in successfully finding longer proofs compared to traditional step-by-step approaches.

#### Experimental Setup
A robust experimental setup is crucial for validating the claims of a research paper.  In this context, a well-defined setup would begin by specifying the baselines used for comparison. **Clearly identifying the baseline methods**, such as previous state-of-the-art models or simpler approaches, allows for a fair evaluation of the proposed method's performance. The choice of baseline methods should be justified, highlighting their relevance and ensuring they represent the current state-of-the-art.  Details on data preprocessing, including any data cleaning, augmentation, or transformation techniques, should be meticulously documented.  **Hyperparameter settings** should also be transparently reported, explaining the methods used to select them (e.g., grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization). The evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and justified, ensuring their appropriateness for the specific research question.  Finally, specifying the computational resources, including hardware and software configurations, ensures the reproducibility of the results by others.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this paper could involve several key areas.  **Extending POETRY to other theorem provers** like Lean or Coq would broaden its applicability and impact.  This would require adapting the framework to handle the nuances of different proof languages and environments.  A second crucial area is **improving the recursive best-first search algorithm**. While the current approach shows promise, enhancements focusing on more sophisticated heuristics, or incorporating advanced search techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) could significantly improve efficiency and success rates.  **Addressing the issue of redundant proof steps** generated by the greedy exploration strategy is another avenue of exploration; introducing a value function could prioritize more informative steps and prevent wasted computation.  Finally, investigating the potential of **combining POETRY with external solvers** or knowledge bases could enhance its ability to tackle exceptionally complex theorems, unlocking the potential of this methodology to contribute to advanced mathematical problems in the future.
