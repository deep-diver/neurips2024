To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments in the monocular dynamic scenes validate that MotionGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits significant superiority in both qualitative and quantitative results.

For example (see Figures 5 and 12), in the plate scene, our method accurately renders the reflections and sharp edges of the moving plate while significantly reducing visual distortions such as floating artifacts. Similarly, in the basin scene, our method effectively models the smooth surface of the basin, in contrast to other methods that result in a bumpy basin bottom.

For instance (see Figures 6 and 13), in the chicken scene, our method captures the subtle bumps on the red shell, while in the broom scene, it accurately renders the details of the broom in fast movement.

To illustrate the necessity of optical flow decoupling module, we conduct ablations using direct optical flow supervision instead of decoupled motion flow constraints. As shown in the row 2 of Table 3, directly using optical flow to supervise Gaussian motion even results in a performance decline compared to the baseline. This performance drop is likely due to the inherent ambiguity created by the mixed camera and object movements. When camera and object movements are not separated, the supervision signal becomes noisy and less effective. This ambiguity hampers the optimization process of 3DGS, thereby reducing the motion modeling capabilities of the deformation field. In contrast, we use motion flow as supervision, which effectively provides explicit motion guidance for Gaussian deformation, thereby better modeling complex dynamic scenes. As shown in Figures 7 and 14, only the motion flow can clearly highlights movement information in dynamic regions. This explicit motion information efficiently constrains the Gaussian flow, ensuring that the motion guidance remains consistent and effective.

Leveraging the alternating optimization of 3DGS and camera poses, our approach adaptively corrects potential errors in camera poses. Furthermore, the updated camera poses contribute to more accurate camera flow, thus improving the accuracy of motion guidance. In row 4 of Table 3, our camera pose refinement module, built upon motion guidance, yields substantial performance gains for the model. This iterative optimization process enhances the robustness of our model in complex dynamic scenes. For instance, in the HyperNeRF dataset, our method reconstructs more plausible results compared to the baseline approach. Unlike static scene datasets (e.g., Tanks & Temples) that use COLMAP to obtain the ground truth of camera poses, we assume that COLMAP may not provide accurate poses for dynamic scene datasets.

The proposed framework includes two key modules: the optical flow decoupling module and the camera poserefinement module. The optical flow decoupling module decouples the motion flow related solely to object motion from the optical flow priors, providing explicit supervision for Gaussian deformation. The camera pose refinement module alternately optimizes 3DGS and camera poses, further enhancing the rendering quality and robustness of our model in dynamic scenes. Quantitative and qualitative results on the NeRF-DS and HyperNeRF datasets strongly demonstrate the contributions and effectiveness of our proposed method. More importantly, the proposed improvements are agnostic to specific network designs, which can be applied to similar deformation-based 3DGS methods. In future work, we aim to develop a 3DGS method that does not rely on camera pose inputs, thereby achieving robust high-quality reconstruction in dynamic scenes.
