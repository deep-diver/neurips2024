### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications involve learning from continuous data streams, sampled at various times.  However, existing online learning theories largely focus on discrete streams, neglecting temporal dependencies and adaptive sampling crucial for continuous settings. This creates a gap between theory and practice.



The research introduces two novel online learning settings ‚Äì ‚Äòupdate-and-deploy‚Äô and ‚Äòblind-prediction‚Äô ‚Äì that model these aspects.  They develop algorithms for both settings, finding that **adaptive methods are essential** for learning complex patterns in continuous streams. For the update-and-deploy setting, **a uniform sampling algorithm is sufficient** for simpler concept classes.  This work **provides a foundational theory for learning from continuous data streams,** refining our understanding of learnability and informing algorithm design.

> üîº This table summarizes the main contributions of the paper.  It highlights the key theoretical results and their implications for different learning settings (update-and-deploy and blind-prediction) under both discrete and continuous data streams. The contributions include establishing the learnability of concept classes in the update-and-deploy setting using a uniform sampling algorithm, demonstrating the non-learnability of nontrivial concept classes in the blind-prediction setting, characterizing learnability of pattern classes using adaptive algorithms, and developing a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting.
