To better leverage the generation capability of these models, a series of works [39, 41, 10, 27] extend the one-step text-to-image generation paradigm to few-shot fine-tuning with a set of images followed by a personalized text-to-image generation. Following this two-step paradigm, users can create novel images inheriting the visuals of reference images without extensive prompt engineering [45]. Although these works and their successors [52, 48] have made the text-to-image paradigms capable of conveniently generating with the guidance of reference images, they often result in content leakage, where visual clues of unwanted contents from the reference image appear in generated images. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, StyleDrop [41], state-of-the-art method for one-shot style-tuning of text-to-image generation model, suffers from a content leakage of generating spindle leaves in the background when asked to generate a sneaker.

When training text-toimage generation models on a large amount of image-text paired data covering a wide variety of visual concepts, it is easy to decompose individual concepts both in the text and visual spaces and associate those concepts between these two spaces. On the other hand, it is challenging to correctly associate visual concepts with the corresponding text phrases using only a few or one training images, as the contents in the image are highly entangled. As such, [41] has proposed an iterative fine-tuning strategy where later rounds of fine-tuning are done with a set of generated synthetic images curated by automated or human feedback. This synthetic fine-tuning on many images is shown to be effective at disentangling visual concepts of subject and style, leading to an improved image-text association for personalized text-to-image generation.

The primary insight is to fine-tune the models with additional objectives focusing on multiple fine-grained concepts within a text-image pair rather than solely on the text-image pair itself.

Concretely, the sub-image-text pair describes an individual fine-grained concept of a style reference image, such as a laptop, woman, or plant, instead of the original text prompt describing an entire image. Users may identify as many concepts of interest as they want from a main text prompt. Therefore, the more comprehensive the prompt is, the better the concept grounding our method can provide.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
