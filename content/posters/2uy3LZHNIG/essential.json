These models often rely on encoder-decoder architectures and continuous trajectory prediction, leading to issues with multi-modal motion representation and inconsistent scene forecasting.  Existing autoregressive models, while showing promise, also lack scalability and generalization capabilities. \n\nTo overcome these issues, the researchers developed SMART.  SMART uses a decoder-only transformer architecture and a novel next-token prediction approach on tokenized map and trajectory data. This approach allows the model to learn the motion distribution in real driving scenarios, achieving improved performance across various metrics. **The model demonstrates zero-shot generalization and impressive scalability, meeting the demands of large-scale real-time simulation.**  The project code and data are publicly available, enabling further model exploration.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "2uy3LZHNIG/podcast.wav"}
