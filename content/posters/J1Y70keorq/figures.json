Each expert's lifespan (active interval) is represented by filled and unfilled circles along the time axis, showing how experts are created and deactivated over time. This dynamic expert management is crucial for handling distribution shifts in the data.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "J1Y70keorq/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Evaluation of average regret over different interval sizes (50, 100, ..., 500). Note that for previous methods relying on a single model, the lowest regret across the 4 learning models is selected.", "description": "This figure shows the average regret of different conformal prediction methods across various interval sizes for CIFAR-10C and CIFAR-100C datasets.  The average regret is a measure of how well the method adapts to changes in data distribution over time. Smaller average regret indicates better adaptation. The plot shows that SAMOCP consistently outperforms other methods across all interval sizes, indicating its superior ability to adapt to dynamic environments. For methods using multiple models, only the lowest regret among all models is shown for comparison.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
