However, its efficiency in dynamic environments with shifting data distributions is limited by the choice of a single learning model.  Existing adaptive methods struggle to consistently provide optimal results across various distribution shifts and interval widths. \nTo address these issues, the paper introduces SAMOCP, a novel adaptive conformal prediction framework that uses multiple models. SAMOCP dynamically selects the most suitable model 'on the fly' based on recent performance.  The method is rigorously proven to offer strongly adaptive regret while maintaining valid coverage.  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets showcased consistent improvements in prediction set efficiency and maintained validity compared to other existing methods.", "affiliation": "UC Irvine", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "J1Y70keorq/podcast.wav"}
