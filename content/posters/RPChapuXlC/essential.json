Specifically, fine-tuning LLMs on datasets containing harmful content can compromise their safety mechanisms, leading to undesirable outputs.  This is a significant challenge for providers of LLM fine-tuning services, who bear responsibility for the model's behavior. Existing solutions often address this issue through alignment-stage methods or computationally intensive fine-tuning stages, both of which may have limitations.\nThis paper introduces Lisa, a novel Lazy safety alignment technique that aims to improve LLM safety during the fine-tuning stage.  Lisa uses bi-state optimization, alternating between alignment and user data. Crucially, it adds a proximal term to constrain model drift towards the switching points between the two states. Theoretical analysis and empirical results on various downstream tasks demonstrate that Lisa increases alignment performance while maintaining the LLM's accuracy on user tasks, addressing the limitations of previous approaches.  It achieves a computation-efficient fine-tuning-stage mitigation against harmful data.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "RPChapuXlC/podcast.wav"}
