[{"figure_path": "dY4YGqvfgW/tables/tables_27_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Weak regret of different algorithms for dueling bandits in different scenarios", "description": "This table summarizes the performance of different algorithms (WR-TINF, WR-EXP3-IX, Versatile-DB, and WS-W) for minimizing weak regret in three different scenarios of dueling bandits.  Scenario 1 involves a small number of arms and satisfies the strong stochastic transitivity (SST) assumption. Scenario 2 involves a moderate number of arms and does not satisfy SST. Scenario 3 involves a large number of arms and does not satisfy SST. For each scenario and algorithm, the table reports the average weak regret over 20 iterations, along with 0.2 and 0.8 quantiles to illustrate the variability of the results.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
