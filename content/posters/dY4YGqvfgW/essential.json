Minimizing regret (the difference in cumulative reward between the optimal strategy and the learner\u2019s strategy) is a key goal.  Existing research mostly focuses on *strong regret*, where the learner only avoids loss by consistently choosing the optimal option twice. However, many real-world scenarios, like recommendation systems, only require one optimal choice to succeed, motivating research into *weak regret* minimization.\nThis paper addresses the challenges of weak regret minimization in stochastic dueling bandits, assuming only the existence of a Condorcet winner (an option superior to all others).  The authors propose two novel algorithms, WR-TINF and WR-EXP3-IX, which adaptively balance exploration and exploitation based on the problem's specific structure (the pairwise preference probabilities).  They prove that WR-TINF achieves optimal regret in certain regimes, while WR-EXP3-IX outperforms it in others, showcasing a more nuanced and challenging aspect of dueling bandit problems compared to the traditional strong regret.", "affiliation": "KAUST", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "dY4YGqvfgW/podcast.wav"}
