Setting A varies the complexity of the CATE function, setting B varies the level of selection bias, and setting C introduces hidden confounders.  The rank correlation is a measure of how well each selector's ranking of estimators aligns with the ranking based on the true, unobservable CATE values (oracle ranking). Higher values indicate better agreement with the oracle ranking, suggesting the method better identifies high-performing CATE estimators.", "section": "5.2 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "k4EP46Q9X2/tables/tables_29_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of Regret for different selectors across Settings A, B, and C (Note that B (\u03be = 1) matches A (p = 0.1)).
