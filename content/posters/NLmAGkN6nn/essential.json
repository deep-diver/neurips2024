Their wide deployment is hindered by this high cost, especially for real-time applications.  Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers a solution by reducing model size and computation, but applying it to DiTs has proven difficult because of the unique structure of DiTs, which has salient channels and temporal variability.\nPTQ4DiT is a specifically designed PTQ method for DiTs.  It introduces Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearman's p-guided Salience Calibration (SSC) to address these challenges.  CSB redistributes extreme values in channels, while SSC dynamically adjusts the balancing across time steps.  An offline re-parameterization eliminates extra computation during inference. Experiments show that PTQ4DiT successfully quantizes DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) and, for the first time, to 4-bit weight precision (W4A8) while maintaining comparable image quality.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Chicago", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "NLmAGkN6nn/podcast.wav"}
