One promising solution is to use sparse networks, where many of the connections are removed.  However, sparse training is notoriously difficult because removing connections disrupts the flow of information during training, and finding the right settings (hyperparameters) for training is extremely time consuming. These difficulties often lead researchers to re-use the settings that worked for dense networks, even though those settings are often suboptimal. \nThis paper introduces a new technique called Sparse Maximal Update Parameterization (S\u00b5Par) which addresses these issues.  S\u00b5Par ensures that the flow of information is stable regardless of how sparse the network is, and it uses a clever trick to greatly reduce the time needed for finding optimal hyperparameter settings. Experiments on large language models show that S\u00b5Par consistently outperforms existing methods, especially when a high level of sparsity is used.  The authors also provide a straightforward implementation, making their work easy for others to adopt and build upon.", "affiliation": "Cerebras Systems", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "OWmu3QOa0O/podcast.wav"}
