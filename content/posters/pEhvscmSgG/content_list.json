In contrast to the online setting, only using static datasets poses additional challenges, such as policies generating out-of-distribution samples. Model-based offilne reinforcement learning methods try to overcome these by learning a model of the underlying dynamics of the environment and using it to guide policy search. It is beneficial but, with limited datasets, errors in the model and the issue of value overestimation among out-of-distribution states can worsen performance. Current model-based methods apply some notion of conservatism to the Bellman update, often implemented using uncertainty estimation derived from model ensembles. In this paper, we propose Constrained Latent Action Policies (C-LAP) which learns a generative model of the joint distribution of observations and actions. We cast policy learning as a constrained objective to always stay within the support of the latent action distribution, and use the generative capabilities of the model to impose an implicit constraint on the generated actions. Thereby eliminating the need to use additional uncertainty penalties on the Bellman update and significantly decreasing the number of gradient steps required to learn a policy. We empirically evaluate C-LAP on the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmark, and show that C-LAP is competitive to state-ofthe-art methods, especially outperforming on datasets with visual observations.

A key issue is the distributional shift: the state-action distribution of the offline dataset, driven by the behavior policy, differs from the distribution generated by a learned policy.

Therefore, value-based methods are prone to overestimating values due to evaluating policies on out-of-distribution states.

Model-based reinforcement learning methods transform the offline to an online learning setting: They approximate the system dynamics and try to resolve the evaluation of out-of-distribution states by using the generalization capabilities of the model and generating additional samples. But as the training distribution is fixed, the estimation capabilities of the model are limited. Therefore, these model-based methods also rely on a conservative modification to the Bellman update as a measure to counteract value overestimation which is mostly achieved through uncertainty penalties [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Apart from the typical approach of using an auto-regressive model to estimate the dynamics, other model-based methods treat the objective as trajectory modeling [22, 23, 24]. These methods aim to combine decision making and dynamics modeling into one objective. Instead of learning a policy, they sample from the learned trajectory model for planning. We will refer to the first kind of methods, which learn a dynamics model to train a policy, as model-based reinforcement learning.

This is similar to methods that frame offilne reinforcement learning as trajectory modeling, but we use an auto-regressive model and still learn a policy. By formulating the objective as a generative model of the joint distribution of states and actions, we create an implicit constraint on the generated actions, similar to [10, 25]. The goal of this approach is to address the shift in the entire distribution, rather than looking at out-of-distribution actions and states separately. We achieve this using a recurrent state-space model with a latent action space, which we call the recurrent latent action state-space model. Using a latent action space allows us to learn a policy that uses the latent action prior as an inductive bias. This approach keeps the policy close to the original data while allowing it to change when needed, which makes learning the policy much faster. To achieve this, we treat policy optimization as a constrained optimization problem, similar to enforcing a support constraint [9]. We provide a high level overview of our method in Figure 1.

Overall the results indicate that latent action state-space models with constrained latent action polices not only match the state-of-the-art on observations with low-dimensional features as observations, but also jump-start policy learning by using the action decoder to sample actions that lead to high rewards already after the first gradient steps: If the dataset is narrow, generated actions when sampling from the latent action prior will fall into the same narrow distribution. For instance, in an expert dataset, sampled actions will also be expert-level actions. During policy training, instead of sampling from this prior, we restrict the support of the policy dependent on the latent action prior. Thus, sampled latent actions from the policy will always be decoded to fall into the dataset\u2019s action distribution.

To evaluate the effectiveness of C-LAP, we report value estimates alongside normalized returns on all walker2d datasets in Figure 6. A similar analysis for all considered baselines is provided in Appendix G. To further analyze the influence of different action space design choices, we include the following ablations: a variant no constraint, which does not formulate policy optimization as constrained objective, but uses a Gaussian policy distribution to potentially cover the whole Gaussian latent action space; and a variant no latent action, which does not emphasize latent actions, but uses a regular state-space model as in Dreamer [29]. Besides that, we added dashed lines to indicate the dataset\u2019s average return and average maximum value estimate. The no latent action variant fails to learn an effective policy: normalized returns are almost zero and the dataset\u2019s reference returns remain unattained; value estimates are significantly exceeding the dataset\u2019s reference values, indicating value overestimation. The no constraint variant can use the generative action decoder to limit generated actions to the dataset\u2019s action distribution, but the Gaussian policy is free to move to regions which are unlikely under the action prior. Thus, nullifying the implicit constraint imposed by the action decoder, resulting in collapsing returns and value overestimation. Only C-LAP achieves a high return and generates value estimates which are close to the dataset\u2019s reference. The value estimates on walker2d-medium-replay-v2 are higher than the dataset\u2019s reference, as the agent\u2019s performance is also exceeding the reference performance.

Similarly, SPOT [9] includes a regularization term in the policy update, derived from a support constraint perspective. It also uses a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to estimate the behavior distribution. Following a comparable intention, BEAR [8] constraints the policy to the support of the behavior policy via maximum mean discrepancy. BCQ [7] and PLAS [10] use a CVAE similarly but don\u2019t use a regularization term. Instead, they constrain the policy implicitly by making the generative model part of the policy. Beside these methods, many other approaches exist, with CQL [12] and IQL [14] being some of the most well-known. CQL uses a conservative policy update by setting a lower bound on value estimates to prevent overestimation, while IQL avoids out-of-distribution values by using a modified SARSA-like objective in combination with expectile regression to only use state-action tuples contained in the dataset.

This basically converts offline learning to an online learning problem. Model-based methods mainly address model errors and value overestimation by using a probabilistic ensemble and adding an uncertainty penalty in the Bellman update. MOPO [16] uses a probabilistic ensemble as in [32] and adds the maximum standard deviation of all ensemble predictions as uncertainty penalty. Similar to that, MOReL [17] adheres to the same methodology, but uses pairwise maximum difference of the ensemble predictions as penalty instead. Analogously, ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "MOBILE [18] estimates the values for all by the ensemble predicted states and uses the standard deviation of value estimates as penalty. Edge of reach [19] comes to the conclusion that value estimation on edge of reach states are the overarching issue compared to model errors. In the end, they come up with a comparable solution to MOBILE, but use an ensemble of value networks alongside the ensemble of dynamic models. COMBO [28] pursues a different approach, as they integrate the conservatism of CQL into value function updates, removing the need for uncertainty penalties. Besides that, some methods use a different class of models: instead of learning a predictive model in observation space, they use latent state-space models to make predictions on latent states. Among these methods is LOMPO [21], which builds up on Dreamer [29], but integrates an ensemble to predict stochastic states and use the standard deviation of the log probability of the ensemble predictions as an uncertainty penalty similar to previous methods. The policy is trained on a mix of imagined and real world samples, hence they use an off-policy actor-critic style approach for policy learning. Offilne DV2 [20] uses a similar model, but is based on a different penalty. Namely, they use the difference between the individual ensemble mean predictions and mean over all ensembles as uncertainty penalty. Furthermore, the policy is trained only on imagined trajectories with gradients calculated by back-propagating through the dynamics model. Overall, Offline DV2 is the method most comparable to our approach, but still different in many ways as we propose a latent action state-space model compared to a usual state-space model, and frame policy learning as constrained optimization. So far all discussed models operate in an auto-regressive fashion, but another class of methods exists, which casts offline model-based reinforcement learning as trajectory modeling. Instead of learning a policy, these kind of approaches integrate decision making and modeling of the underlying dynamics into a single objective and use the model for planning. Among them are Diffuser [24], which employs guided diffusion for planning; TT [22], which builds on advances in transformers; and TAP [23], which uses a VQ-VAE with a transformer-based architecture to create a discrete latent action space for planning.

Second, we propose a method for policy training to stay within the dataset\u2019s action distribution. We explicitly parameterize the policy depending on the latent action prior and formulate policy learning as constrained objective similar to a support constraint. We find that C-LAP significantly speeds-up policy learning, is competitive on the D4RL benchmark and especially outperforms on the V-D4RL benchmark, raising the best average score across all dataset\u2019s from previously 31.5 to 58.8.
