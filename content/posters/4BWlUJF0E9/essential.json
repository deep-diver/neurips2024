These limitations hinder the performance and scalability of GNNs, especially when dealing with large-scale graphs. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate these issues but often introduce new challenges such as high complexity or information bottlenecks. \nThis paper introduces N2, a novel GNN model that uses a dynamic message-passing mechanism.  **N2 projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo-nodes into a common space**, enabling flexible pathway construction based on evolving spatial relationships.  This approach addresses the inherent limitations of traditional message passing, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency and performance.  **The model utilizes a single recurrent layer**, further contributing to parameter efficiency and scalability.
