To enable effective learning on graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) [33, 64] have been specifically designed for graph-structured data. Within GNN models, message passing serves as a crucial function in extracting informative graph features [22, 63]. The vanilla message passing [33, 66] applies node-centric aggregation constrained between the adjacent nodes. During this aggregation process, central nodes access their neighbors in an isotropic manner [29] and aggregate multi-hop features iteratively. In consequence, the vanilla message passing relies heavily on the input graph structure, leading to over-smoothing [46] or over-squashing [2, 14, 15] issues on GNNs.

Other methods incorporate pseudo nodes connected with all the graph nodes to serve as message pathways [22, 30, 42, 57]. However, these models employ uniform pathways, i.e., each pseudo node is connected to all the graph nodes with equal weights, as illustrated at the top of Fig. 1.

In pursuit of expressive operators for graph learning, methods propose to approximate diverse filters with parameterized polynomials [11, 13, 34].

This constrained process couples message passing with input topology and contains inherent limitations, including over-smoothing [39, 46] and over-squashing [2, 60]. To overcome these limitations, some works try to decouple message passing from input topology and introduce alternate pathways, including edge shortcuts [1, 60, 12, 24], pseudo nodes [42, 57], and graph pooling operations [20, 53, 74].

While edge shortcuts refine local connections, pseudo nodes directly enable global message passing.

The connection weights in DyN are parameterized with a path integral function given the spatial coordinates of neurons.

Specifically, our pseudo nodes avoid becoming new bottlenecks by employing dynamic connections.

During global message passing, these weights can eliminate messages from certain graph nodes while preserving the others. As a result, the messages will not be squashed equally into the pseudo nodes, preventing the nodes from becoming new information bottlenecks.

The concept of state space has been widely adopted in various machine learning methods.

Pseudo nodes optimize communication efficiency between graph nodes during global message passing. Pooling nodes capture the hierarchy in the graph structures, ensuring better structure compression. Second, pooling nodes and pseudo nodes have different relations with input graph nodes. Pooling nodes are higher-level abstractions of graph nodes and are not physically connected with them. In contrast, pseudo nodes can be regarded as learnable graph nodes. These nodes are physically connected to graph nodes as part of the graphs and directly participate in the message passing between graph nodes. Third, pseudo nodes and pooling nodes employ different communication pathways. Pooling nodes employ the coarse adjacency matrix for message passing.
