### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many existing approaches for solving inverse problems using diffusion models are limited by their instability and amplified cumulative errors, especially when dealing with real-world, complex data.  These models often rely on simplified linear representations and overlook the impact of measurement quality and the unreliable nature of priors. This research highlights the critical role of Temporal Distribution Discrepancy in explaining this instability and limits of existing methods.

To address the shortcomings of previous methods, this paper proposes a novel score-based diffusion framework called Dynamics-aware SDE Diffusion Generative Model (D¬≥GM). D¬≥GM leverages the measure-preserving dynamics of Random Dynamical Systems to enhance the stability and generalizability of the model, making it robust to various forms of degradation, noise and domain shift. The experimental results corroborate the efficacy of D¬≥GM across multiple benchmarks, including magnetic resonance imaging, showcasing its ability to deliver high-quality restorations even under challenging circumstances.

### In-depth insights


#### SDE Stability
The stability of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) in the context of diffusion models is crucial for reliable performance.  **Instability in SDEs can lead to accumulated errors**, hindering the generation of high-quality samples and the effective solution of inverse problems. The paper analyzes this instability through the lens of measure-preserving dynamics, uncovering how the failure to preserve the measure throughout the diffusion process results in **Temporal Distribution Discrepancy**. This discrepancy amplifies the impact of noise and errors at each step, significantly affecting the model's ability to return to the original state during the reverse process. The authors demonstrate how maintaining measure-preserving dynamics using techniques like Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) enhances the stability and generalizability of diffusion models, and propose a novel framework that achieves a robust and reliable solution by controlling the Temporal Distribution Discrepancy. This is achieved by using a measure-preserving strategy which effectively mitigate the influence of accumulated errors and degradation during both the forward and reverse diffusion process. In essence, the paper establishes a clear theoretical foundation for understanding and addressing SDE stability issues in diffusion models, impacting the reliability and performance of these models across various applications.

#### DGM Framework
The Dynamics-aware SDE Diffusion Generative Model (DGM) framework offers a novel approach to enhancing the stability and generalizability of diffusion models for inverse problems.  It addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating **measure-preserving dynamics** from random dynamical systems (RDS). This crucial aspect ensures that the model maintains stability even under complex degradations, mitigating the accumulation of errors. By incorporating the measure-preserving property, the DGM can effectively recover the original state from degraded measurements.  The framework introduces **Temporal Distribution Discrepancy** as a key concept for analyzing stability. Furthermore, it leverages a **stationary process** to ensure robust performance across diverse benchmarks and challenging settings.  The DGM framework represents a significant theoretical contribution, providing a more rigorous foundation for score-based diffusion models, and promises a powerful enhancement in solving various inverse problems.

#### RDS Dynamics
The concept of 'RDS Dynamics,' likely referring to Random Dynamical Systems dynamics, is crucial for enhancing the stability and generalizability of diffusion models in solving inverse problems.  **RDS provides a framework for analyzing the temporal evolution of probability distributions** under complex transformations, such as those encountered in image degradation. By leveraging the measure-preserving property of RDS, the approach aims to mitigate the accumulation of errors inherent in iterative processes.  This is achieved by ensuring the model's ability to return to an original state even after significant degradation.  **The analysis of Temporal Distribution Discrepancy highlights a key instability issue in existing methods**, which RDS dynamics addresses by providing a more robust and theoretically grounded approach. The core idea is to guide the diffusion process toward a stationary measure, maintaining stability despite complex degradations. This measure-preserving property is essential for ensuring reliable and consistent results, especially when dealing with noisy or incomplete data frequently encountered in real-world inverse problems.

#### Inverse Problems
Inverse problems, **focused on estimating causal factors from observational data**, are inherently ill-posed due to the complexity of mapping incomplete or degraded data to parameters.  This ill-posed nature necessitates iterative, data-driven solutions, especially prevalent in image reconstruction from noisy signals. **Diffusion models offer a promising approach**, leveraging their superior reconstruction capabilities and compatibility with iterative solvers. However, existing methods often simplify inverse problems by assuming linearity, limiting their effectiveness for complex real-world applications. The reliance on linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) neglects the crucial aspect of measure-preserving dynamics, **leading to accumulated errors and biases.**  A deeper understanding of the measure-preserving dynamics of random dynamical systems (RDS), through the lens of temporal distribution discrepancy, is crucial for developing robust and generalizable diffusion models for diverse, challenging inverse problems.

#### Future Works
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **extending the D¬≥GM framework to handle even more complex degradation scenarios**, such as those involving both unknown and heterogeneous degradation.  A second avenue would involve **investigating the theoretical limits of the measure-preserving dynamics approach**, potentially developing more refined bounds on model error and exploring alternative mathematical frameworks for enhancing stability and generalizability.  Finally, **a deeper investigation into the interplay between the choice of noise schedule and the stability of the diffusion process** could lead to more efficient and robust training methods.  Specifically, exploring alternative noise schedules tailored to complex real-world degradations and establishing a principled way to select the optimal schedule based on the properties of the degradation would be valuable.  Furthermore, **evaluating D¬≥GM on a wider variety of inverse problems and high-dimensional data modalities** would further establish its generalizability and practicality.

> This figure illustrates the concept of reverse initialization and its relation to the basin of attraction in the context of the proposed diffusion model. The left side shows a schematic of the forward and reverse diffusion processes.  The forward process (red arrow) maps the high-quality image (x‚ÇÄ) to the low-quality observation (y) through the operator A. The reverse process (brown arrow) aims to recover x‚ÇÄ from y.  The dotted oval represents the basin of attraction around the true high-quality image (x‚ÇÄ). The right-hand side provides a visual interpretation in a three-dimensional space. Each curve represents the probability distribution at a different time step. As the reverse process progresses (indicated by the red arrows), the distribution shifts from being spread out around y to being concentrated around the actual image (x‚ÇÄ).  The success of the reverse process depends on whether it starts in the basin of attraction (as shown). Starting far outside the basin of attraction can lead to the diffusion process converging to a point other than x‚ÇÄ.
