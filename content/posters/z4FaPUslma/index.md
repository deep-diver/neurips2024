### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Neural Collapse (NC), a phenomenon where classifier weights converge to a Simplex ETF, is usually observed after extensive training. Existing methods that leverage NC by fixing classifier weights to a canonical simplex ETF have not shown improvements in convergence speed. This paper introduces a novel mechanism that dynamically finds the nearest simplex ETF geometry to the features at each iteration, addressing this issue by implicitly setting the classifier weights through a Riemannian optimization.  This inner-optimization is encapsulated within a declarative node, enabling backpropagation and end-to-end learning. 

This method significantly accelerates the convergence to a NC solution, outperforming both fixed simplex ETF approaches and conventional training methods. The approach also enhances training stability by substantially reducing performance variance.  Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate superior convergence speed and stability compared to existing methods.  **The Riemannian optimization problem and its inclusion within a declarative node are key technical contributions** that make end-to-end learning feasible. This is a significant advancement for accelerating convergence and improving stability in deep learning models.

> This figure shows the proposed architecture that optimizes towards the nearest simplex ETF.  The input x goes through a CNN to produce features H. These features are processed to compute normalized class means which then feeds into a deep declarative network (DDN) that solves for the optimal rotation matrix U*. The classifier weights W are then set implicitly as W = U*M, where M is the standard simplex ETF. This is done to efficiently align classifier weights with the features and speed up training. Note that the CNN is updated via gradients from both the loss L and U*.

### In-depth insights


#### NC Optimization
NC optimization, in the context of neural collapse, focuses on accelerating convergence to the optimal solution space characterized by a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF).  **The core idea is to leverage the inherent structure of NC**, where classifier weights and penultimate layer feature means converge to a simplex ETF, thereby improving training efficiency and stability.  This is achieved by incorporating a mechanism to guide the training process toward the nearest simplex ETF at each iteration, often formulated as a Riemannian optimization problem. This problem is typically solved iteratively within the training loop, allowing for implicit updates to the classifier weights based on the current feature means, **often using techniques like implicit differentiation and deep declarative networks to enable efficient backpropagation**.  **Addressing the non-uniqueness of simplex ETF solutions is crucial**, often mitigated by regularization methods or proximal terms in the optimization problem. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through faster convergence speed and reduced variance in network performance compared to standard training and fixed-ETF methods.  **Key challenges include the computational cost** of solving the Riemannian optimization, particularly for large-scale networks, and ensuring stability during training.

#### Simplex ETF Geom
The concept of "Simplex ETF Geom" likely refers to a geometric representation of Simplex Equiangular Tight Frames (ETFs) within a specific context, perhaps in the context of neural networks.  **Simplex ETFs are characterized by their optimal weight separation**, maximizing the margin between classes. The "Geom" aspect suggests the focus is on the geometrical properties and relationships of these frames. This could involve analyzing the structure of the ETF points, their arrangement in a high-dimensional space, and how these properties relate to the performance of a model, particularly the convergence speed. The analysis might involve tools from Riemannian geometry, dealing with orthogonality constraints inherent in ETF structures. The ultimate goal is likely to leverage the inherent properties of this specific geometric structure, perhaps as a regularization technique, to enhance training stability and convergence in machine learning.  Understanding the implications of this geometric structure could lead to new optimization algorithms or improved training techniques for machine learning models.

#### Riemannian Opt
The heading 'Riemannian Opt' strongly suggests a section detailing the optimization of a problem using **Riemannian geometry**.  This is a powerful mathematical framework for handling optimization problems on curved spaces or manifolds, unlike traditional methods suited for Euclidean spaces. The use of Riemannian optimization techniques implies that the problem's parameters or variables reside within a **non-Euclidean space**, necessitating specialized methods.  The specific manifold used likely depends on the problem's constraints.  For instance, if dealing with orthogonal matrices, the Stiefel manifold might be involved. **Solving the optimization problem requires algorithms designed to operate on Riemannian manifolds**.  These might include gradient-based techniques adjusted to account for the curvature, or other specialized methods.  The approach's advantage lies in its ability to efficiently address problems with constraints like orthogonality, which are common in machine learning contexts. This section's deeper analysis should reveal details about the chosen algorithm, its implementation, convergence properties and computational cost within the larger context of the research.

#### DDN Backprop
The section on "DDN Backprop" likely details the method for backpropagating gradients through a deep declarative network (DDN) layer.  This is crucial because the core of the proposed approach involves implicitly defining classifier weights by solving a Riemannian optimization problem within the DDN.  **Standard backpropagation techniques cannot directly handle this implicit relationship**. The authors probably describe how they encapsulate the Riemannian optimization as a differentiable node, allowing gradients from the loss function to flow backward and update the feature means implicitly influencing the classifier weights.  This likely involves techniques from implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end learning despite the nested optimization. The authors might highlight the efficiency and stability gains of this approach compared to explicitly training the classifier weights, potentially showcasing how it facilitates faster convergence and reduces variance in performance. **A key aspect could be the computational efficiency** and scalability, given that solving an optimization problem within each backpropagation step could be computationally intensive for large-scale networks. They may discuss strategies for mitigating this computational cost.  Furthermore, the details of the implementation within a deep learning framework are likely provided, including specifics on the implementation of the differentiable optimization layer. Finally, the authors may present experimental results to support the claim that their DDN backpropagation approach is effective and offers substantial benefits in training stability and speed.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the efficiency of the Riemannian optimization** within the DDN framework is crucial, especially for large-scale datasets, where computational cost becomes a significant bottleneck.  This may involve exploring alternative optimization algorithms or developing more efficient ways to handle the implicit differentiation. **Investigating the impact of the DDN gradient backpropagation** on different network architectures and datasets will yield valuable insights into the method's generalizability and effectiveness.  A **thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods** for improving neural collapse convergence will further solidify the proposed approach's position.  Additionally, **research into theoretical guarantees** for the proposed optimization problem is essential to provide a deeper understanding of its convergence behavior and stability. Finally, examining the method's application to other machine learning problems, such as semi-supervised learning or transfer learning, is a valuable avenue for expanding the scope and impact of the research.
