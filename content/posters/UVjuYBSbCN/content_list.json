The utility of survival models is typically evaluated through two key aspects: discrimination and calibration. Discrimination measures a model\u2019s ability to differentiate between patients with varying risks, prioritizing those more likely to experience the event. Calibration, on the other hand, assesses how well a model\u2019s predictions align with the observed event distribution.

However, a notable improvement in discriminative power often comes at the expense of calibration performance, which can negatively affect the clinical utility of predicted survival outcomes.

Notably, although commonly used in an unsupervised fashion, this framework shares a fundamental principle with ranking losses: both focus on the relative ranking of samples for better discrimination. However, unlike ranking losses, which directly modify differences in model outputs, contrastive learning operates on the relative distances of representations in the embedding space. This distinction offers the potential to overcome misalignment issues caused by direct comparisons and modifications of model outputs inherent in the ranking-based approaches. To leverage this potential and further enhance survival models, we propose incorporating informed sampling into the contrastive learning framework. By assigning lower penalties to potential false negative pairs based on the similarity of their survival outcomes, we instill an inductive bias in the model, encouraging it to learn that samples with similar event times likely share similar clinical statuses.

MLE, based on NLL, provides unbiased estimates of these quantities under the assumption of ignorable censoring, where the event and censoring are independent given the input features.

In particular, these approaches directly utilize model outputs, such as conditional hazard or survival functions, to establish pairwise ordering of comparable individual risks for better discrimination. However, since ranking loss primarily focuses on samples with earlier event times (often ignoring censored samples), these models may struggle to capture the full distributional characteristics of time-to-event outcomes.

Furthermore, the authors in [15] have introduced a novel approach that transforms D-Calibration [16] into a differentiable objective, calculating the squared difference between observed and predicted events across multiple time intervals. In contrast to these methods, our proposed approach does not explicitly incorporate a calibration loss function.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
