The encoder takes the input features x and outputs latent representations h. The projection head maps the latent representations to an embedding space where contrastive learning is applied, and the hazard network predicts the hazard rate at each time point t given the latent representation h. The model uses a contrastive learning loss to enhance discrimination while maintaining calibration by incorporating importance sampling based on survival outcomes. The figure also shows how the model handles right-censoring, by assigning lower penalties to potential false negative pairs based on the similarity of their survival outcomes, thus ensuring that samples with similar event times likely share similar clinical statuses.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "UVjuYBSbCN/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: t-SNE visualization for latent representations learned with LNLL only, LSNCE only, and ConSurvfor the METABRIC dataset, colored by event times (for uncensored samples).", "description": "This figure displays the t-SNE visualizations of latent representations learned by three different training methods: using only the negative log-likelihood loss (LNLL), using only the survival outcome-aware noise contrastive estimation loss (SNCE), and using both LNLL and SNCE (ConSurv).

Calibration plots assess how well a model's predicted probabilities align with observed outcomes.

A perfectly calibrated model would have its points fall along the diagonal line (x=y), indicating perfect alignment between predictions and observations.
