LASR iteratively refines a library of interpretable textual concepts which are used to bias the search for hypotheses for scientific discovery tasks. This involves three distinct phases: (Top) finding optimal hypotheses within a concept-directed hypothesis evolution, (Right) leveraging the optimal hypotheses to find new concept abstractions, and (Left) iterating on learned concepts to discover new concepts to accelerate hypothesis evolution. LASR introduces an orthogonal direction of improvement over current symbolic regression algorithms [10] (in gray).", "description": "The figure illustrates the iterative process of LASR, a symbolic regression method.  It highlights three main phases: hypothesis evolution (using a combination of standard evolutionary techniques and LLM-guided steps), concept evolution (abstraction of patterns from high-performing hypotheses using an LLM), and concept abstraction (refining and generalizing discovered concepts with the LLM). The interaction between these phases allows for a more directed and efficient search for optimal hypotheses.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "B7S4jJGlvl/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: A single step of LASR. LASR induces multiple hypothesis populations that are evolved using a scalable evolutionary algorithm. Concept guidance is provided by randomly replacing symbolic operations with concept-directed LLM operations with probability p. After each iteration, the top-performing programs are summarized into natural language concepts, which are evolved to form new concepts that are sampled to guide the search in the next iteration.", "description": "The figure illustrates a single step in the LASR algorithm, showing the iterative refinement of a library of interpretable textual concepts. These concepts guide the search for hypotheses by selectively replacing standard genetic operations with LLM-guided ones. The process involves three phases: hypothesis evolution using concept-directed operations; concept abstraction from top-performing hypotheses; and concept evolution to refine the concept library for future iterations. The figure highlights the interplay between symbolic regression and LLM-based operations, showcasing the synergistic approach of LASR.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "B7S4jJGlvl/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Evaluation results for ablations/extensions of LASR. (Left): We ablate three components of LASR: Concept Evolution, Concept Library, and variable names and evaluate their MSE solve rate performance on the Feynman dataset over 40 iterations. We find that each component contributes to accelerating search at different stages in the search process. (Right): We extend LASR by providing an initial concept library Co in the form of user provided hints. We find that natural language hints significantly increases the speed of solving equations.", "description": "This figure shows the ablation and extension studies performed on LASR using the Feynman dataset. The left panel shows the effect of removing different components of LASR (Concept Evolution, Concept Library, variable names) on the number of equations solved within a mean squared error (MSE) threshold over 40 iterations. It indicates that all components contribute to the performance.  The right panel shows how providing initial concepts (hints) to LASR improves the number of equations solved, suggesting that incorporating prior knowledge accelerates the search process.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
