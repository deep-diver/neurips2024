", "This paper introduces CHAIN, a novel method that effectively reduces this churn by minimizing undesirable changes in model outputs for states outside the current training batch, significantly improving learning performance.", "The proposed method is general and easy to implement, making it widely applicable across diverse DRL settings (online/offline, value/policy-based) and contributing to more robust and scalable DRL systems."], "tldr": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) uses powerful neural networks, but their output predictions can unexpectedly change after each training update, leading to instability. This phenomenon, known as \"churn,\" is particularly problematic in RL because of its non-stationary nature, potentially causing suboptimal performance and even learning collapse. Existing methods often focus on addressing individual aspects of the problem, such as value function approximation error or policy updates, but they often neglect the interconnected nature of the learning process. \nThis paper introduces a new method called CHAIN (Churn Approximated Reduction) to directly mitigate churn by reducing changes to policy and value network outputs for states outside of the current training batch. CHAIN can be easily integrated into many existing DRL algorithms with minimal code changes. Experiments across various environments and algorithms consistently demonstrate CHAIN's efficacy in reducing churn and improving learning performance, especially regarding sample efficiency and scalability of DRL agents.", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cQoAgPBARc/podcast.wav"}
