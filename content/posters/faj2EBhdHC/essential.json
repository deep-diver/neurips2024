Existing solutions often compromise accuracy or computational efficiency. \n\nThis paper proposes a novel module called Cluster-Normalize-Activate (CNA) to tackle oversmoothing. CNA groups similar nodes into clusters, normalizes them, and then applies individual activation functions.  **The results show that CNA significantly improves GNN accuracy across various datasets and tasks while requiring substantially fewer parameters than competing architectures.**  **The plug-and-play nature of CNA makes it easily adaptable to existing GNN models, leading to improved performance and efficiency**", "affiliation": "TU Darmstadt", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "faj2EBhdHC/podcast.wav"}
