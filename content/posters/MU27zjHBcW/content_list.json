This stems from the observation that as organisms evolve through natural selection, mutations that improve functional properties become more prevalent. Therefore, the likelihood of a mutation occurring is directly linked to its impact on biological function [20]. To compute the informative likelihoods of mutating one amino acid to another, the predominant methods involve protein language models (PLMs) trained on millions of protein sequences, which capture the EI in a self-supervised manner [50, 43, 39].

Evolution optimizes multiple properties simultaneously to meet survival needs, often overshadowing the optimization target of interest [35]. Therefore, conventional fine-tuning methods using the whole evolutionary information are suboptimal. Secondly, the prevalent learning objective incorporates dataset-specific information that is often overfitted to the training data at hand, hindering the model\u2019s ability to generalize toward new proteins.

We conducted a thorough study across four benchmarks, including ProteinGym [44], $\\beta$ -Lactamase (Abbr., $\\beta$ -lact.) and Fluorescence (Abbr., Fluo.) from PEER [63], and GB1 (utilizing a 2-vs-rest split) from FLIP [8], where the latter two involve multiple mutants. We compare DePLM with nine baselines, including 1) four protein sequence encoders trained from scratch (CNN [53], ResNet [47], LSTM [47], and Transformer [47]) as naive baselines, 2) five extended baselines that incorporate self-supervised models (OHE [27], fine-tuned versions of ESM-1v [39], ESM-MSA [48], and Tranception [43], as well as ProteinNPT [46]). More details about datasets and baselines can be found in Appendix C.1 and C.2. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Results. We present the evaluation results in Table 9. DePLM achieves better performance compared to the baselines, affirming the advantage of integrating evolutionary information with experimental data for protein engineering tasks. It is worth noting that ESM-MSA and Tranception exhibit enhanced EI compared to ESM-1v due to the introduction of MSAs. By comparing their results, we demonstrate that higher-quality EI significantly improves outcomes after fine-tuning. However, even with these improvements, their performance still falls short of that achieved by DePLM. We attribute this difference to the architecture employed by our model, which enables more efficient utilization of experimental data. We also notice that DePLM yields better performance than ProteinNPT, underscoring the efficacy of the proposed denoising training process.

Computational techniques that can generalize across different proteins are essential, given the limitations of DMS experimental methods in handling various proteins [58]. In our study, we leverage ProteinGym to test this generalization capability. Specifically, ProteinGym categorizes DMS datasets into five coarse categories based on the protein properties they measure: stability, fitness, expression, binding, and activity. Given a testing dataset, we randomly select an additional 40 datasets from the same category for training. Importantly, we ensure that the sequence similarity between the datasets used for training and testing is kept below $50\\%$ to prevent potential data leakage. In this experiment, we compare DePLM with four self-supervised baselines (ESM-1v [39], ESM-2 [34], and TranceptEVE [45]), two structure-based baselines (ESM-IF [28] and ProteinMPNN [9]), and three supervised baselines (CNN [8], fine-tuned version of ESM-1v and ESM-2).

In addition, the performance of baselines trained to minimize the disparity between predicted and experimental scores (ESM1v (FT) and ESM2 (FT)) falls significantly short of that achieved by our DePLM.

This reduction in performance underscores the detrimental interference among different properties, emphasizing the need to mitigate these adverse effects. Interestingly, we observed that training on datasets targeting alternative properties can improve performance in the binding property. This improvement is likely due to the scarce availability of datasets specifically focusing on the binding property within ProteinGym. This observation suggests a beneficial cross-utilization of data, where leveraging information from unrelated attributes can enhance inference for properties with limited data.

Denoising the evolutionary likelihood is helpful in identifying protein sequences that manifest specific properties.

Residues with outward-facing side chains on alpha helices are associated with higher entropy, whereas inwardfacing positions exhibit lower entropy. Figure 5 (right) compares the evolutionary likelihood and the property-specific likelihood and visualizes the differences. We notice that binding and active share similar offsets. This suggests that the indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase functions by attaching to other molecules, which makes sense considering its role as an enzyme [54]. We also observe that the property-specific likelihoods exhibit a more uniform entropy when compared to the noisy evolutionary likelihood.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
