[{"figure_path": "gPtiGRaVcE/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Architecture of Geographic law aware road network representation learning (Garner).", "description": "This figure shows the architecture of the proposed Garner framework. It consists of three main components: Data preprocessing, Graph augmentation, and Graph contrastive loss. The Data preprocessing component takes street view images and road network data as input and produces initial road features. The Graph augmentation component generates augmented graphs according to the Third Law of Geography and the First Law of Geography. The Graph contrastive loss component then takes the augmented graphs and original graph as input and learns road representations by maximizing the mutual information between the different views. The framework also includes a dual contrastive learning objective to harmonize the effects of the First and Third Laws of Geography. The output is a road segment representation that aligns with both laws.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "gPtiGRaVcE/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Architecture of Geographic law aware road network representation learning (Garner).", "description": "The figure presents a detailed architecture of the Geographic Law-aware Road Network Representation Learning (Garner) framework.  It illustrates the data preprocessing steps, involving the use of street view images to capture geographic configurations. The graph augmentation process, which generates graphs adhering to the Third Law of Geography, is also depicted.  The core of the framework is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder that derives road representations from both original and augmented graphs. The figure highlights the dual contrastive learning objective which harmonizes the implications of the First and Third Laws of Geography, resulting in a comprehensive road network representation.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "gPtiGRaVcE/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Sensitivity analysis of hyper-parameter k and d.", "description": "This figure shows the sensitivity analysis of two hyperparameters: the degree (k) of the augmented KNN similarity graph and the degree (d) of the negative graph.  The results are shown as Micro-F1 scores for road function prediction on two datasets, Singapore and NYC, with error bars representing the standard deviation.  The x-axis represents the values of k and d, respectively, and the y-axis shows the Micro-F1 score. The plots demonstrate the robustness of the model to changes in these hyperparameters, indicating that performance is relatively stable across a range of values.", "section": "5.2 Experimental results"}, {"figure_path": "gPtiGRaVcE/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Architecture of Geographic law aware road network representation learning (Garner).", "description": "This figure presents a detailed architecture of the Geographic Law-aware road network representation learning (Garner) framework.
