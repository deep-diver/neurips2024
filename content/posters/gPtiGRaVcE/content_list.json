Motivated by the advancements of graph representation learning [29, 37], the versatile utility of road networks has spurred research into developing effective and expressive representation learning methods for road networks. The objective is to derive functional and easily integrable representations of road segments that can align with the paradigm of neural network models.

In particular, apart from encoding the topological information of road networks, these methods further integrate additional spatial characteristics, such as geographical distance [2], which are unique to road networks. In these methods, the inductive bias induced by spatial characteristics is primarily based on the First Law of Geography [25], which states that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\" This principle implies that spatially close road segments tend to have similar representations. For example, skip-gram based methods [3, 39, 40] define the context window based on hops among graph neighbors or spatial distance and derive road segment representations similar to word2vec [24]. Besides, graph neural networks [11, 17, 36, 43, 52] based methods [2, 15, 44] employ message passing [5, 53] and aggregation among road segments.

Consequently, this limitation compromises the effectiveness of road segment representations in existing methods. This law predominantly emphasizes the distance decay effect, neglecting the influence of semantic factors of different areas on target variables [54]. To mitigate the limitation, the Third Law of Geography [54, 55] was proposed to further consider geographic configurations, stating that \"The more similar geographic configurations of two points (areas), the more similar the values (processes) of the target variable at these two points (areas).\" The term geographic configuration refers to the description of spatial neighborhood (or context) around a point (area), and the term target variable is the road representation in our context.

To facilitate this integration, it is essential to leverage data sources that provide comprehensive insights into geographic configurations for road segments. Existing approaches commonly utilize data from OpenStreetMap [27], which includes relatively basic features such as coarse-grained road attributes (location, length, type, etc.). While these data support the condition required in the First Law of Geography and are subsequently processed through specialized model designs, they are insufficient to address the application of the Third Law. To enhance the understanding of geographic configurations, we propose to utilize street view images (SVIs) [7] as an additional data source. Street view images capture the visual context of roads and their surroundings, offering a more nuanced representation of geographic configurations. However, it is still non-trivial to tackle these two principles simultaneously.

This law posits that similar representations are expected to be derived for road segments with similar geographic configurations. To this end, the module should capture and reflect the similarity relationships among geographic configurations in the resulting road segment representations, ensuring that road representations faithfully preserve the similarity relationships. Second, it is critical to harmonize the implications of applying both the First and Third Law of Geography in road network representation learning. The First Law emphasizes the importance of spatial proximity, while the Third Law focuses on the significance of similarity in geographic configurations, irrespective of spatial proximity. In real-world scenarios, two distant road segments might exhibit very similar geographic configurations due to similar surrounding buildings and environments. Conversely, two directly connected and proximally close road segments might present vastly different geographic configurations \u2013 for example, one adjacent to a commercial area and the other near a park.

First, to effectively enable the integration of the Third Law, we devise a graph contrastive learning framework [22, 37] tailored for road networks. This enhances conventional contrastive learning by incorporating geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling. Specifically, we utilize SVIs to construct a geographic configuration view for road networks, which facilitates the augmentation of edge connections between road segments sharing similar geographic configurations, even if they are geospatially distant. Then, we employ a Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) [43] encoder, which has the property of implicitly reducing the differences between the representations of connected road segments [43], thereby mapping the similarity relationships between geographic configurations to road segment representations in the contrastive learning process. To further align with the Third Law, the proposed contrastive learning framework is equipped with a novel spectral negative sampling technique. This sampling strategy can be mathematically demonstrated to support the principle of the Third Law in a reverse way, ensuring that road segments with dissimilar geographic configurations are represented distinctly. Second, to harmonize the effects of both the First Law and Third Law, we propose a dual contrastive learning objective, which contrasts the topological structure view with the geographic configuration graph view and the spatial proximity graph view. We maintain shared parameters in the SGC encoder and jointly train the contrastive losses, thus simultaneously learning the consensus and discrepancies of these two laws in a self-supervised manner by minimizing the dual contrastive objective.

Graph augmentation [21, 45] is to generate positive [9] or negative [37] samples, though some recent studies try to remove it [26, 49]. Contrastive strategy chooses which two components to contrast, such as node-node contrast [30, 56] or node-graph contrast [9, 21]. Negative sampling is required by the loss. The loss is usually to maximize the MI [9, 37, 50] between an entity with its positive samples and minimize the MI with its negative samples.

For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
