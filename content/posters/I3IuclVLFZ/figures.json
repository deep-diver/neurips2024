The visualization effectively separates the different classes, demonstrating the model's ability to distinguish between them despite the non-IID data.  This highlights the effectiveness of FedLPA in generating a global model that maintains class separability even with heterogeneous local data distributions.", "section": "3.7 t-SNE observation and discussions"}, {"figure_path": "I3IuclVLFZ/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Extension to multiple rounds on MNIST dataset.", "description": "This figure shows the test accuracy curves for FedLPA and other baseline methods (FedAvg, FedNova, SCAFFOLD, and FedProx) over multiple rounds on the MNIST dataset.  FedLPA achieves the highest accuracy in the first round, demonstrating its strong one-shot learning capabilities.  While its performance improves with additional rounds, it does so more slowly than the other methods.  The figure also shows the accuracy of using FedLPA for one round followed by FedAvg for the subsequent rounds, suggesting a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both methods.", "section": "4.7 Extension to multiple rounds"}, {"figure_path": "I3IuclVLFZ/figures/figures_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: t-SNE visualizations of 10 local clients", "description": "This figure shows the t-SNE visualizations of the data from 10 different local clients. Each subplot represents a different client's data, showing how the data points cluster based on their labels.  The visualizations highlight the non-IID nature of the data across different clients, with some clients having data points concentrated in specific areas of the t-SNE space while others are more spread out. This illustrates the challenge of aggregating models from diverse clients in federated learning.", "section": "G.1 t-SNE visualization"}, {"figure_path": "I3IuclVLFZ/figures/figures_23_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: t-SNE visualization for our FedLPA global model.", "description": "This figure shows the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization of the global model generated by FedLPA on the MNIST dataset.  The data used for training was non-IID, meaning it had a biased distribution across the 10 local clients.
