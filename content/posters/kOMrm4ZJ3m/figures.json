The trajectories (paths of the system over time) are shown as curves. While the individual trajectories might appear complex and winding, the key point is that all trajectories starting within a certain region (the smaller red circle) remain confined within a larger region (the larger blue circle) as time progresses. This visual illustrates the concept of stability, as the system's state doesn't stray too far from the equilibrium point, even if its behavior isn't immediately obvious from the trajectory shapes.", "section": "2 System stability and Lyapunov functions"}, {"figure_path": "kOMrm4ZJ3m/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Two stable systems and associated Lyapunov functions discovered by our model. The second, a polynomial system with a non-polynomial Lyapunov function, was studied in [1].", "description": "This figure shows two examples of stable dynamical systems and their corresponding Lyapunov functions, which were discovered by the model presented in the paper. The first system is relatively simple, while the second system is a polynomial system with a non-polynomial Lyapunov function, a particularly interesting case that has been previously studied in the literature.  The Lyapunov functions shown visually represent the model's ability to find solutions for a range of system complexities.", "section": "System stability and Lyapunov functions"}]
