See Appendix E.5.", "description": "This table compares the properties of two methods, CSD and CSD-iPOT, in terms of their ability to achieve marginal and conditional calibration, maintain monotonicity, and preserve discrimination.  It shows that CSD-iPOT offers asymptotic guarantees for both marginal and conditional calibration and maintains monotonicity, while CSD only guarantees marginal calibration and monotonicity.  Importantly, CSD-iPOT improves space complexity.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "l8XnqbQYBK/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performance summary of CSD-iPOT.
