### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current survival prediction models often focus on discrimination and marginal calibration, neglecting conditional calibration crucial for individual-level decisions.  This leads to inaccurate predictions and suboptimal resource allocation. Existing calibration methods often compromise discrimination. 



This paper introduces CSD-iPOT, a post-processing method using conformal prediction.  **CSD-iPOT leverages individual survival probability at observed time as conformity scores, effectively improving both marginal and conditional calibration without sacrificing discrimination.**  The method is computationally efficient and provides asymptotic theoretical guarantees for calibration, demonstrating its versatility across diverse real-world datasets.

> üîº This figure illustrates two types of distribution calibration: marginal and conditional.  The marginal calibration assesses the overall alignment of predicted survival probabilities with the actual distribution, while conditional calibration evaluates this alignment within specific subgroups defined by features. It uses predicted Individual Survival Distributions (ISDs) plotted against true event times for six subjects, separated into two groups (x=0 and x=1). Histograms and P-P plots further illustrate the calibration for both marginal and conditional scenarios, showcasing how conditional calibration ensures uniform distribution of predictions within subgroups, unlike marginal calibration.

### In-depth insights


#### Survival Prediction
Survival prediction, a critical area within machine learning, focuses on estimating the time until a specific event occurs.  **Censoring**, where the event is not observed for all subjects, significantly complicates this task.  This necessitates methods that can handle incomplete data, such as Kaplan-Meier estimation.  Recent work highlights the importance of **calibration** in survival models, not only in the marginal sense (overall accuracy) but also conditionally (accuracy within subgroups defined by patient characteristics).  **Conformal prediction** is a promising technique for improving both marginal and conditional calibration post-hoc, without compromising discrimination.  By incorporating the model's predicted probability at the observed time as a conformity score, and generating conformalized survival distributions, more precise individual predictions can be generated, leading to better real-world applicability, especially in clinical settings where individual-level decisions are paramount.

#### CSD-iPOT Method
The CSD-iPOT method is a post-processing technique designed to calibrate survival distributions, addressing limitations of previous approaches. It leverages individual survival probability at observed time (iPOT) as conformity scores within a conformal prediction framework.  **CSD-iPOT's key innovation is its use of iPOT**, directly aligning with the definition of distribution calibration in survival analysis. This offers several advantages. First, it naturally handles censored data by using the censoring time as an upper bound for the true event time. Second, **it adapts to feature variability**, capturing the distribution variance of individual survival distributions. This adaptability is crucial in scenarios with heteroskedastic survival times.  Finally,  **CSD-iPOT is computationally efficient**, making it a practical solution for survival prediction tasks.  Theoretical guarantees support its effectiveness in achieving marginal and conditional distribution calibration asymptotically, confirming its capability to provide well-calibrated predictions. The method's versatility is highlighted through experimental results, showcasing its robustness and efficiency across diverse real-world datasets.

#### Calibration Metrics
Proper calibration is crucial for reliable survival prediction models.  **Marginal calibration**, assessing the overall alignment of predicted probabilities with observed outcomes, provides a general evaluation. However, it overlooks potential disparities across subgroups.  **Conditional calibration** addresses this by examining calibration within specific subsets, ensuring fairness and accuracy in individual predictions.  The choice of calibration metric significantly impacts the assessment.  **Harrell's C-index** measures the discrimination capability of a model.   It's essential to select metrics appropriate to the specific research question and the nature of the datasets.  A multifaceted evaluation involving both marginal and conditional calibration, alongside discrimination metrics, offers a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance and limitations.

#### Experimental Results
The Experimental Results section of a research paper is crucial for demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods.  A strong presentation will meticulously detail the metrics used, comparing the new approach against established baselines across multiple datasets.  **Statistical significance** should be rigorously addressed, possibly using error bars, confidence intervals, or p-values, indicating whether observed improvements are likely due to chance or represent a genuine advancement.  The discussion should go beyond simple numerical comparisons, providing **qualitative insights** into the observed trends and relating them back to the paper's core hypotheses.  **Limitations** of the experimental setup should also be candidly acknowledged, such as dataset size or potential biases.  A robust experimental section builds credibility, fostering confidence in the research and its broader implications.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending CSD-iPOT's applicability to other survival analysis scenarios, such as competing risks and multi-state models.  **Investigating the impact of different conformity score choices** and exploring alternative calibration methods is crucial for robustness.  **Theoretical guarantees could be strengthened** to address limitations of current assumptions, focusing on finite sample scenarios and relaxing independence assumptions. Furthermore, **developing efficient algorithms to handle high-dimensional datasets** and large-scale problems would enhance practical applicability. Finally, **investigating the fairness properties** of CSD-iPOT under different demographic subgroups and exploring bias mitigation strategies are paramount given ethical considerations in real-world applications of survival analysis.

Subfigure (a) shows two ISD curves crossing at a percentile level (25% < p* < 50%). Initially, the order of median survival times indicates that patient A precedes patient B. However, after applying the CSD-iPOT adjustment, which vertically shifts predictions, the order is reversed, demonstrating that Harrell's C-index is not preserved. Subfigure (b) illustrates a scenario where CSD's horizontal shifting of ISD curves can change the order of predictions, thus potentially affecting the AUROC score. The example illustrates that while CSD-iPOT preserves the relative order of survival probabilities at any single time point, it does not always preserve the relative order of median survival times.

> üîº This table presents key statistics for 15 datasets used in the paper's experiments.  It categorizes datasets by size (small, medium, large) based on the number of samples and highlights datasets with high censoring rates or Kaplan-Meier estimations ending at high probabilities.  The number of features (after one-hot encoding) is also included.

> Table 3: Key statistics of the datasets. We categorize datasets into small, medium, and large, based on the number of instances, using thresholds of 1,000 and 10,000 instances. The bolded number represents datasets with a high percentage of censorship (‚â• 60%) or its KM estimation ends at a high probability (‚â• 50%). Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of features after one-hot encoding.
