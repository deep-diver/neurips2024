Two different types of clinical data (unstructured clinical notes and structured clinical concepts in a relational graph) are fed into two pretrained LLMs (Teacher 1: general purpose LLM and Teacher 2: LLM with domain knowledge).  The LINE module then aligns the resulting representations from both models into a unified representation space.  This alignment facilitates mutual learning and allows the model to capture critical information from both data sources, improving downstream tasks and allowing for cross-form representation.", "section": "2 The teacher-teacher framework"}, {"figure_path": "zDaD8zv8tG/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The proposed teacher-teacher framework is illustrated for a specific use case.
