To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner.

Our systematic investigation reveals that this problem persists across various existing sign feature extraction methods and causes sharp performance drops in both sign language recognition and translation, particularly in gloss-free methods. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, termed SignCL. Our experiments demonstrate that SignCL encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative features and significantly reduces representation density. Furthermore, our experiments show that SignCL improves translation performance across various frameworks and datasets by a significant margin, achieving a new state-of-the-art in gloss-free sign language translation.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
