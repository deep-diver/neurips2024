### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision Transformers (ViTs) are widely used but have a fixed architecture, limiting their applicability across devices with varying computational capabilities.  Existing model compression techniques lack the flexibility to efficiently generate models of diverse sizes.  Furthermore,  pre-training methods require multiple training sessions for different sizes, increasing costs. This necessitates a more efficient and flexible approach to creating ViT models for various resource constraints.

This paper proposes linearly decomposing a ViT into basic components called "learngenes." These learngenes are trained incrementally, and they can then be recombined to generate ViTs with different sizes, achieving comparable or better performance than conventional methods.  This decomposition-recomposition strategy reduces computational costs because large datasets are trained on only once. Experiments validate that ViTs can be efficiently decomposed and recomposed into diverse-scale models, demonstrating improved performance and cost savings.

> This figure compares the knowledge distillation (KD) approach with the proposed method for creating diverse-scale models. KD requires multiple training sessions with a teacher model to produce different-sized models for various clients.  The new method only requires single training session to decompose a teacher model into learngenes (basic components). These learngenes can be recombined flexibly to generate models with different numbers of layers, accommodating various computational resource limitations.

### In-depth insights


#### Linear ViT Decomp
The concept of "Linear ViT Decomp" suggests a method for decomposing Vision Transformers (ViTs) linearly, potentially leveraging techniques from linear algebra or calculus to break down the complex model into smaller, more manageable components.  This approach likely aims to **improve efficiency** in training, storage, and deployment by reducing model size while preserving accuracy.  A linear decomposition scheme offers advantages over non-linear methods in terms of **simplicity and interpretability**, allowing for easier analysis of individual components and their contributions to the overall model performance. However, such a strategy might **sacrifice expressiveness** if the inherent non-linearity of ViTs is fundamentally crucial for their performance. The success hinges on carefully choosing the decomposition basis and ensuring that recombination maintains the original model's accuracy.  The method could potentially **enable flexible model scaling**, adapting ViT architectures to varying resource constraints, and might unlock techniques for **incremental training** where components are trained iteratively, potentially reducing overall training time and computational cost.

#### Learngene Training
Learngene training is a novel approach to efficiently train Vision Transformers (ViTs) by decomposing the model into smaller, independent components called learngenes.  This decomposition allows for incremental training, where each learngene is trained sequentially, significantly reducing computational cost compared to training the entire model at once. The process begins by decomposing a pre-trained ViT into learngenes using a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. Each learngene encapsulates specific knowledge of the original ViT, allowing for flexible recombination later. **The sequential training of learngenes is a crucial aspect**, focusing on one at a time while freezing the previously learned ones. This strategy not only improves training efficiency but also allows for the creation of varied-scale ViTs by combining a selective number of learngenes, catering to diverse resource requirements.  **This method offers a significant advancement over traditional methods like model compression** which require repetitive training and lack the flexibility to create diverse model sizes. The final recombination step uses these learned learngenes to easily initialize ViTs of varying depths without additional heavy training, maintaining or improving performance compared to standard methods.

#### Recomposition Flex
The concept of "Recomposition Flex" in the context of vision transformers suggests a system capable of dynamically adapting to varying computational resource constraints.  This is achieved by linearly decomposing a pre-trained ViT into modular components (learngenes), allowing for flexible recombination into models of diverse scales and depths.  **Flexibility is key**, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices without the need for repeated, costly training on large datasets.  This contrasts sharply with traditional methods like model compression, which often involve retraining for each target size and lack this adaptability.  The method's success hinges on the **effectiveness of the linear decomposition and the ability of the learngenes to maintain performance** when recombined in different configurations.  **The efficiency gains could be substantial**, particularly when compared to training multiple models from scratch, offering a significant advantage in practical applications.

#### Ablative Study
An ablative study systematically evaluates the contribution of individual components or features within a model or system.  It does this by progressively removing (or "ablating") each component and measuring the resulting performance drop. This allows researchers to **quantify the impact** of each part, revealing which are essential for achieving good results and which are less important or even detrimental.  **Careful design** is crucial:  components should be ablated independently and the baseline model needs to be robust. The results of such a study often inform architectural decisions, leading to simpler, faster, or more efficient models by identifying and removing unnecessary components.  **Interpreting the results** requires understanding how the ablated features interact with the others. A large performance drop may indicate a crucial component, but it could also be caused by an unexpected interaction.  Therefore, ablative studies are more effective when used in conjunction with other analysis methods, potentially giving valuable insights into feature engineering or model optimization.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the linear decomposition framework to other vision architectures** beyond ViTs, such as CNNs, would broaden the method's applicability.  Investigating alternative decomposition techniques, perhaps employing non-linear methods or incorporating adaptive coefficient learning, could enhance performance and flexibility.  A crucial area for further study is **developing more sophisticated learngene regularization strategies** to prevent overfitting and improve generalization capabilities.  **Exploring different polynomial functions** beyond Chebyshev polynomials, and developing methods for automatically selecting the optimal function based on the data, would further refine the decomposition process.  Finally, a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between different learngene numbers and network depths would guide users in selecting the best architecture for specific resource constraints.
