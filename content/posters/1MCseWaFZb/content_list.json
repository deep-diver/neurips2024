The computational task is to reconstruct the 3D density of the particle, along with 3D pose of the particle in each 2D image, for which the posterior pose distribution is highly multi-modal. Recent developments in cryo-EM have focused on deep learning for which amortized inference has been used to predict pose. Here, we address key problems with this approach, and propose a new semi-amortized method, cryoSPIN, in which reconstruction begins with amortized inference and then switches to a form of auto-decoding to refine poses locally using stochastic gradient descent. Through evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that cryoSPIN is able to handle multi-modal pose distributions during the amortized inference stage, while the later, more flexible stage of direct pose optimization yields faster and more accurate convergence of poses compared to baselines.

Second, low electron exposures are used to limit radiation damage to the particles (e.g., see Fig. 1).

More recently, cryoPoseNet [9] and cryoAI [10] introduced amortized pose inference, to avoid the expense of orientation matching for each particle image. They employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map an input image to a pose estimate. Nevertheless, although efficient, amortized inference may not accurately represent multi-modal posterior pose distributions, which occur frequently early in reconstruction before the structure is estimated well. As such, compared to previous methods like cryoSPARC [8] and cryoDRGNv2 [7] that consider many pose candidates, amortized methods sometimes fail to identify the correct mode.

In contrast to cryoPoseNet [9] and cryoAI [10], which use pose encoders that produce one or two estimates, we attach multiple pose predictor heads to a shared CNN feature extractor to predict multiple plausible poses for each image. By design, our multi-output encoder is able to account for pose uncertainty and encourage exploration of pose space during the initial stages of reconstruction. For the 3D decoder, unlike cryoDRGN and cryoAI that use MLPs with computationally expensive feed-forward implicit networks, we adopt an explicit parameterization to further accelerate the reconstruction. To train the encoder-decoder architecture, we apply a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d loss in which the 3D decoder is queried to obtain a 3D-to-2D projection for each predicted pose.

In particular, for each image, we choose the pose with the lowest reconstruction loss, iteratively refine it with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and continue pose optimization and reconstruction in an alternating fashion.

Inspired by scenarios where a set of hypotheses needs to be generated to account for uncertainty in the prediction task, MCL [12] was introduced in a supervised setup to learn multiple structured-outputs with SSVMs [26]. Their motivating question was: can we learn to produce a set of plausible hypotheses? To address this, they define an\u201coracle\u201d loss in which only the most accurate output pays the penalty. This loss is minimized even if there is only a single accurate prediction in the set. The early follow-up work [27, 13] uses the same loss to learn a deep CNN ensemble composed of $M$ heads with a shared backbone network. Importantly, they show that the ensemble-mean loss hurts prediction diversity across different heads, while training with the \u201coracle\u201d loss yields specialized heads. Variations have since been proposed to mitigate hypothesis collapse or overconfidence issues in MCL by modifying the loss or applying learnable probabilistic scoring schemes [28\u201330, 14]. MCL has been used to mitigate the ambiguity in several tasks including image segmentation [31], optical-flow estimation [32], trajectory forecasting [33], human pose and shape estimation [14, 34].

We plot the average pose error with respect to the ground-truth at different epochs in Fig. 4 (left). When using the multi-head encoder, the pose with the least reconstruction error is selected among the candidates. Interestingly, as our method switches to direct pose optimization, the error in pose drops quickly, whereas the fully-amortized baseline exhibits slow convergence.

Qualitatively, poses obtained by direct optimization (blue dots) show stable convergence to the optimal point (highlighted area) while those inferred by the encoder (red dots) frequently oscillate. Indeed, the encoder in amortized inference is a globally parameterized function which might be too restrictive, yielding sub-optimal pose parameters. Therefore, poses inferred in an amortized fashion might fail to consistently converge to the optimal point.

To simplify the visualization, we run our method with $M=4$ heads in this experiment. We first inspect the behavior of encoders for two example cryo-EM images (Fig. 5, left, see Supp. E for more examples). In each row, the approximate posterior distribution over view direction is visualized for both cryoAI and multi-head encoders given the input image and reconstruction. Our multi-head encoder returns a set of plausible candidates, while cryoAI obtains two pose estimates by data augmentation. In both examples, the multi-head encoder identifies the correct mode while cryoAI selects the incorrect one. Note that the pose set predicted by the multi-head encoder contains other posterior modes as well. Intuitively, cryoAI encoder with two pose predictions cannot explore the pose space as much as our multi-head encoder. Thus, the pose posterior in cryoAI remains uncertain and multi-modal during reconstruction. This also contributes to slower convergence to higher-resolution reconstructions as depicted in the top left of Fig. 5. Finally, we visualize the percentage of images assigned to each head by our \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d loss. The relatively even spread of assignments to different heads shows that the multi-head encoder does not suffer hypotheses collapse [30], namely all heads actively participate in the pose prediction.

In this work, we assume that the 3D structure is rigid while many biomolecules are flexible in practice, exhibiting different conformations.

We expect that the beneftis of semi-amortized inference will also apply to such heterogeneous cases. In particular, our proposed multi-head encoder should be applicable to the estimation of the multimodal posterior over heterogeneity latent parameters as well as pose. Yet, there are significant challenges in heterogeneous reconstruction, such as extra uncertainty due to heterogeneity and conflation of latent spaces, making it outside the scope of our analysis on semi-amortized inference.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
