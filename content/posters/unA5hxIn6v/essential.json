This paper tackles this challenge by studying how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trains two-layer neural networks to approximate specific types of functions \u2013 sparse polynomials.  The challenge is that the functions only depend on a small subset of the input data. Existing analyses often rely on specific coordinate systems, limiting their generalizability. \nThis research introduces basis-free necessary and sufficient conditions for successful training, meaning the results apply no matter which coordinate system is used.  They define a new mathematical property, called 'reflective property', to capture how well the activation function of the neural network can approximate the desired function. By satisfying this condition, they prove that the training process efficiently converges. This advances our understanding of neural network learning beyond prior work, providing insights for future model development and optimization.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "unA5hxIn6v/podcast.wav"}
