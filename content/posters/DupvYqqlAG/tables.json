The error is calculated as the log10 of the normalized eigenvalue error, reflecting the accuracy of identifying the shared latent states (nx = n\u2081). An 'X' indicates that a method is not applicable for a specific observation type.", "section": "4.1 Shared dynamics are accurately identified in generalized-linear simulations"}, {"figure_path": "DupvYqqlAG/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Average learning runtime over 25 fits with 30484 training samples", "description": "This table compares the average runtime of five different methods for learning a generalized linear dynamical model (GLDM) from neural data. The methods compared are PGLDM (with two different configurations), PLDSID, and Laplace-EM (with 1 and 100 iterations).  The runtime is broken down into the time spent on subspace identification and parameter optimization, revealing that the PGLDM method is computationally efficient compared to the other methods, especially when compared to Laplace-EM which uses an iterative approach.", "section": "4 Experimental Results"}]
