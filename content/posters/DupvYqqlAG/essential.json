Existing methods often fail to properly address this challenge.  This limitation hinders accurate modeling and interpretation of complex systems. \nThis work introduces Prioritized Generalized-Linear Dynamical Modeling (PGLDM). PGLDM uses a multi-step analytical subspace identification algorithm to model shared and private dynamics.  Simulation and real-world neural data experiments demonstrate PGLDM's superior accuracy in decoding one time series from the other, using significantly fewer latent states. This improvement makes the method more efficient and reduces model complexity.", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "DupvYqqlAG/podcast.wav"}
