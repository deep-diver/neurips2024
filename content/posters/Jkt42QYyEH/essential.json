Existing methods typically use joint modeling approaches, which are inefficient and struggle with high-dimensional interaction spaces. \nLiveScene overcomes these challenges through a novel scene-level language-embedded interactive radiance field.  By decomposing the scene into local deformable fields and using an interaction-aware language embedding, LiveScene achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and interactive control, significantly improving parameter efficiency.  The paper introduces two new datasets, OmniSim and InterReal, further contributing to advancements in the field.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Jkt42QYyEH/podcast.wav"}
