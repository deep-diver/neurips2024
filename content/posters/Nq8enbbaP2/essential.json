However, **occupancy functions**, representing state visitation densities, offer potential advantages in exploration, handling distribution shifts, and optimizing various objectives beyond the expected return. Existing efficient policy optimization methods using only occupancy functions are scarce, and offline RL faces challenges with non-exploratory data.  This limits the applicability and effectiveness of occupancy functions in real-world scenarios.\nThis research introduces novel model-free policy gradient algorithms leveraging occupancy functions for online and offline RL. **The algorithms elegantly transform gradient estimation into a series of computationally efficient squared-loss regressions**, eliminating the need for value function approximation.  Furthermore, the proposed methods are theoretically sound, featuring convergence analysis that accounts for finite-sample estimation error and data coverage. Notably, **they naturally accommodate arbitrary offline data distributions and extend to optimizing any differentiable objective functional**.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Nq8enbbaP2/podcast.wav"}
