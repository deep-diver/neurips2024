However, existing methods often impose overly restrictive constraints or require prior knowledge of exact symmetries, which may not be realistic for real-world data.  This limits their applicability to datasets without clear symmetries or to those with limited data. Addressing this challenge requires methods that can dynamically discover and apply symmetries as soft constraints.\nThis paper proposes a novel weight-sharing scheme that learns symmetries directly from data, avoiding the need for pre-defined symmetries. The method defines learnable doubly stochastic matrices acting as soft permutation matrices on weight tensors, capable of representing both exact and partial symmetries. Through experiments, the authors demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively learns relevant weight-sharing schemes when symmetries are clear and outperforms methods relying on predefined symmetries in scenarios with partial symmetries or in the absence of them, achieving performance comparable to fully flexible models.
