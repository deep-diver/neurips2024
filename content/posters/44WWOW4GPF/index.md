### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Group equivariance has emerged as a valuable inductive bias in deep learning, enhancing generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. However, existing methods often impose overly restrictive constraints or require prior knowledge of exact symmetries, which may not be realistic for real-world data.  This limits their applicability to datasets without clear symmetries or to those with limited data. Addressing this challenge requires methods that can dynamically discover and apply symmetries as soft constraints.

This paper proposes a novel weight-sharing scheme that learns symmetries directly from data, avoiding the need for pre-defined symmetries. The method defines learnable doubly stochastic matrices acting as soft permutation matrices on weight tensors, capable of representing both exact and partial symmetries. Through experiments, the authors demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively learns relevant weight-sharing schemes when symmetries are clear and outperforms methods relying on predefined symmetries in scenarios with partial symmetries or in the absence of them, achieving performance comparable to fully flexible models.

> The figure illustrates the process of creating kernel stacks using a learned weight-sharing scheme. It starts with a set of flattened base kernels (represented as a stack of colored layers).  These kernels are then transformed by a set of learnable doubly stochastic matrices (R‚ÇÅ, R‚ÇÇ, R‚ÇÉ, R‚ÇÑ), which act as soft permutation matrices. The result of these transformations is a reshaped kernel stack suitable for use in a convolutional layer.  The visual shows the transformation from the original kernel layers to the permuted and then reshaped version. This weight sharing is the core concept of the proposed method to learn symmetries from data.

### In-depth insights


#### Symmetry Learning
Symmetry learning is a crucial area in machine learning, aiming to leverage inherent data symmetries for improved model generalization, efficiency, and robustness.  **Traditional approaches often rely on predefining specific symmetries**, such as translation or rotation invariance, limiting their applicability to datasets without clear, known symmetries.  This paper explores a novel, flexible approach that **learns symmetries directly from data**. Instead of enforcing strict group equivariance, it employs learnable doubly stochastic matrices to represent soft permutations of canonical weight tensors. This enables the model to **discover and utilize both exact and partial symmetries**, adapting effectively to various data characteristics.  **The method's flexibility is a key advantage**, allowing it to outperform rigid group convolution methods, particularly in scenarios with limited data or partial symmetries.  By learning soft constraints rather than imposing fixed ones, this approach demonstrates potential for enhanced performance across a wider range of applications.

#### Doubly Stochastic
The concept of "doubly stochastic" matrices plays a crucial role in the paper, serving as a bridge between the theoretical framework of group representations and the practical implementation of learnable weight-sharing schemes in neural networks.  Doubly stochastic matrices, characterized by both row and column sums equaling one, **naturally approximate the behavior of permutation matrices**, which are central to representing group symmetries. By learning a collection of doubly stochastic matrices, the model effectively learns soft permutations of weights, allowing for flexibility in capturing both exact and approximate symmetries present in the data.  This is a **key innovation** of the proposed method, as it elegantly avoids the limitations of traditional group-equivariant models that require predefined knowledge of the symmetries. The use of the Sinkhorn operator further enhances the method's practicality, efficiently transforming any arbitrary matrix into a doubly stochastic one. This flexibility is particularly beneficial when dealing with real-world datasets where precise symmetries may not be readily apparent. Overall, the use of doubly stochastic matrices provides a powerful and efficient approach to learning symmetries directly from data.

#### Weight-Sharing Nets
Weight-sharing neural networks offer a powerful mechanism to incorporate inductive biases into deep learning models, particularly concerning symmetry.  **Traditional methods often rely on pre-defined group symmetries**, which might not accurately capture the complexities of real-world data.  Weight-sharing nets address this limitation by **learning the symmetries directly from the data**, thereby adapting to various patterns and levels of symmetry present.  **This adaptive approach enhances model flexibility and generalization capabilities**, potentially surpassing the performance of models that are constrained by pre-specified symmetries. By learning doubly stochastic matrices, the network effectively learns soft permutations of base weights, approximating group actions as a special case, and offering an efficient strategy for weight-sharing. This dynamic learning process is particularly valuable when handling partial or approximate symmetries, and offers the potential to discover meaningful structure in datasets where exact symmetries may be absent or unclear.

#### Partial Symmetry
The concept of 'partial symmetry' in the context of deep learning is intriguing because it addresses the limitations of traditional methods that assume perfect, global symmetries in data.  **Real-world data often exhibits only approximate or localized symmetries**, making rigid group-equivariant models overly restrictive and potentially hindering performance.  Partial symmetry acknowledges this by allowing models to **learn and exploit symmetries that may not be fully present or consistently applied across the entire dataset**. This approach offers increased flexibility, as it avoids imposing strict constraints that could lead to overfitting or poor generalization.  **By learning soft constraints and partial mappings**, instead of imposing hard-coded symmetries, models can better adapt to the nuances of complex data distributions. The key challenge lies in developing effective mechanisms for learning and representing these partial symmetries, perhaps through the use of learnable permutation matrices or probability distributions over group transformations. Successfully addressing this challenge would lead to more robust and data-efficient models that can effectively handle the complexity of real-world datasets.

#### Future Works
The paper's 'Future Works' section hints at several promising avenues.  **Improving computational efficiency** is paramount, given the quadratic scaling with group size and kernel dimensions.  Addressing this might involve exploring more efficient representations or approximations of the doubly stochastic matrices or leveraging hierarchical structures to share weights across layers. The current reliance on uniform representation stacks across channels limits the model's ability to learn other transformations (like color jittering); **developing more flexible, adaptive architectures** is thus a key priority.  Investigating methods to enhance the diversity of learned features and improve robustness against overfitting are also crucial.  Finally, **integrating the weight-sharing framework with established techniques** like Cayley tensors could lead to more coherent group structures across layers and increase interpretability.  This would also enable the approach to be more broadly applicable to learning symmetries in different domains and data types.
