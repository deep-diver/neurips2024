This suggests that CATS is more efficient and effective in handling shorter inputs.

As shown in Fig. 8, the query-adaptive masking shows better forecasting performance and faster converge speed compared to dropout. Applying a gradually increasing masking probability based on the horizon predicted by the query shows slight performance improvements over using a fixed probability or combining with dropout.

Consequently, the patch immediately preceding the current patch will contain a different shock, leading to lower attention scores due to the differing shock values. In contrast, patches that are an even number of steps before the current patch will contain the same type of shock, resulting in higher attention scores.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
