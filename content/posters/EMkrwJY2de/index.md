### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from over-squashing (information loss from distant nodes due to bottlenecks) and over-smoothing (nodes becoming indistinguishable after multiple aggregation layers). Existing solutions often focus on adding edges to address over-squashing but can exacerbate over-smoothing. This paper challenges this approach. 

The research introduces a novel spectral-based edge pruning technique, leveraging the Braess paradox which shows that removing edges can sometimes improve performance. This method, PROXYDELETE, efficiently optimizes the spectral gap to alleviate both problems simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate improved GNN performance, particularly in heterophilic graphs.  The findings also link spectral gap optimization to the concept of graph lottery tickets, suggesting that pruning can create sparse, high-performing subnetworks.

### In-depth insights


#### Spectral Rewiring
Spectral rewiring, a technique to enhance graph neural networks (GNNs), focuses on modifying a graph's structure to optimize its spectral properties.  **It tackles the dual challenges of over-squashing and over-smoothing** that often hinder GNN performance. Over-squashing, caused by topological bottlenecks, limits information flow; while over-smoothing leads to indistinguishable node representations.  **Spectral rewiring offers a solution by strategically adding or removing edges to improve the spectral gap**, a key indicator of a graph's connectivity.  **The Braess paradox inspired an innovative approach**, demonstrating that edge removal can sometimes improve information flow, challenging conventional wisdom.  This counter-intuitive strategy, combined with efficient spectral gap optimization techniques, enables fine-tuned control over information diffusion in GNNs, resulting in improved generalization and reduced computational costs.  **By connecting spectral optimization to graph pruning**, spectral rewiring also paves the way for efficient training and identification of 'winning' subnetworks, advancing both the theoretical understanding and practical application of GNNs.

#### Braess Paradox in GNNs
The Braess paradox, originally observed in traffic networks, reveals that adding edges to a graph can paradoxically decrease its overall efficiency.  In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this translates to the possibility that adding connections between nodes might hinder, rather than improve, the flow of information.  This is particularly relevant in the context of GNN over-squashing and over-smoothing.  **Over-squashing** occurs when information from distant nodes fails to propagate effectively due to topological bottlenecks.  **Over-smoothing**, conversely, happens when repeated aggregation layers cause node representations to converge, losing their discriminative power.  The Braess paradox in GNNs suggests that intuitively beneficial edge additions, intended to alleviate over-squashing, might inadvertently worsen over-smoothing, highlighting the complex interplay between network topology and GNN performance.  Therefore, understanding and addressing the Braess paradox is crucial for designing effective GNN architectures, and may involve novel pruning strategies that selectively remove edges to optimize information flow and avoid the detrimental effects of both over-squashing and over-smoothing.

#### Over-Squashing & Smoothing
Over-squashing and over-smoothing are two significant challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). Over-squashing occurs when information from distant nodes fails to propagate effectively due to topological bottlenecks, hindering the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. Conversely, over-smoothing arises from repeated aggregation steps, causing node representations to converge and lose their distinctiveness.  **These phenomena are not always diametrically opposed**, as edge deletions can mitigate both simultaneously. The Braess paradox, where removing edges can improve the overall information flow, provides a theoretical basis for this counter-intuitive result.  **Spectral gap maximization**, often pursued through edge additions to combat over-squashing, can exacerbate over-smoothing.  Therefore, a more nuanced approach is needed that selectively adds or removes edges to optimize both objectives, possibly leading to **more generalizable and efficient GNN architectures**.

#### Proxy Spectral Gap
The concept of "Proxy Spectral Gap" in graph neural network (GNN) optimization suggests a computationally efficient method to approximate the spectral gap, a crucial factor influencing GNN performance.  **Instead of directly calculating the spectral gap, which is computationally expensive for large graphs, this approach uses a proxy function.** This proxy likely involves leveraging matrix perturbation theory or similar techniques to estimate the change in eigenvalues caused by adding or deleting an edge. By utilizing this proxy, the algorithm can efficiently rank edges based on their potential impact on the spectral gap, thus enabling faster graph sparsification or rewiring. The **accuracy of this proxy is critical**, as its effectiveness directly affects the algorithm's ability to optimize the spectral gap and improve GNN generalization.  While computationally efficient, a potential trade-off might be a slight loss of precision in identifying the optimal edge modifications compared to a direct spectral gap calculation.  Further investigation is needed to analyze the balance between computational speed and the accuracy of the proxy in various graph structures and sizes.

#### Graph Lottery Tickets
The concept of "Graph Lottery Tickets" cleverly merges the "lottery ticket hypothesis" from deep learning with graph neural networks (GNNs).  It posits that **sparse sub-networks (winning tickets)**, carefully selected from a larger, dense GNN, can achieve comparable or even better performance on graph-related tasks. This offers potential benefits in terms of reduced computational cost and improved generalization.  The research explores how techniques like **spectral gap optimization and edge pruning** can aid in identifying these winning tickets.  The intriguing connection to over-squashing and over-smoothing in GNNs is highlighted, showing that addressing these issues through graph sparsification can simultaneously lead to more efficient and effective models.  **Finding data-agnostic criteria for pruning** is a key challenge, with spectral gap-based methods offering a promising approach to this problem.

> üîº This table compares the performance of Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) augmented with three different graph rewiring methods on nine node classification datasets.  The methods compared are FoSR (First-order Spectral Rewiring), a method based on Eldan's criterion (a theoretical guarantee for spectral gap increase), and PROXYADD (a computationally efficient proxy method for spectral gap maximization). The table shows the test accuracy for each method on each dataset, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed PROXYADD method in several cases.

> üîº This table presents the results of the Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) experiments.  The LRGB is designed to specifically test GNN performance in the presence of over-squashing. The table compares the performance of several methods (Baseline-GCN, DRew+GCN, FOSR+GCN, ProxyAdd+GCN, and ProxyDelete+GCN) across three different datasets: PascalVOC-SP, Peptides-Func, and Peptides-Struct, reporting their F1 score (for PascalVOC-SP), Average Precision (AP, for Peptides-Func), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE, for Peptides-Struct).  The baseline GCN is a standard Graph Convolutional Network, while the other methods incorporate various graph rewiring techniques to mitigate the effects of over-squashing.  The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ProxyAdd and ProxyDelete methods relative to the baseline and other state-of-the-art rewiring methods.

> üîº This table compares the performance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with three different graph rewiring methods on graph classification tasks. The methods are: FoSR (First-order Spectral Rewiring), ELDANADD (greedy edge addition based on Eldan's criterion), and PROXYADD (greedy edge addition based on a proxy for spectral gap changes).  The table shows the accuracy achieved by each method on six different benchmark datasets: ENZYMES, MUTAG, IMDB-BINARY, REDDIT-BINARY, COLLAB, and PROTEINS. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods, especially PROXYADD, in improving graph classification accuracy compared to FoSR.
