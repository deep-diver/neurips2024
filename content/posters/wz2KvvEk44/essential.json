Existing solutions using auxiliary tasks often fail to sufficiently address this issue.  The distribution shift between training and deployment settings, such as variations in lighting or backgrounds, exacerbates this problem.\n\nThe paper introduces SMG, a novel method leveraging image reconstruction. SMG employs two separate model branches for task-relevant and -irrelevant feature extraction.  By incorporating two consistency losses, SMG further emphasizes task-relevant features.
