Estimating global network traffic data from partial traffic measurements is a promising solution. However, the majority of current estimation methods concentrate on low-rank linear decomposition, which is unable to accurately estimate. The reason lies in its inability to capture the intricate nonlinear spatio-temporal relationship found in large-scale, highly dynamic traffic data. This paper proposes Satformer, an accurate and robust method for estimating traffic data in satellite networks. In Satformer, we innovatively incorporate an adaptive sparse spatiotemporal attention mechanism. In the mechanism, more attention is paid to specific local regions of the input tensor to improve the model\u2019s sensitivity on details and patterns. This method enhances its capability to capture nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships.

Emerging mega-constellations networks typically involve numerous satellites, so the dynamic traffic data between satellite pairs can be represented as high-dimensional matrices or tensors. This complexity makes it difficult to capture the complicated relationships within the data [10]. Furthermore, the instability of inter-satellite and satellite-ground links often leads to the loss of traffic data during transmission. It should also be noted that not all satellite pairs have constant communication demands. As a result, the measured traffic data is often sparse and incomplete, making traffic data estimation complex [1].

Satformer systematically constructs encoder-decoder components with stacked spatio-temporal modules to effectively capture complex spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data.

This enables Satformer to capture nuanced traffic patterns essential for accurate estimation. This is particularly useful in satellite networks where traffic may be concentrated in certain areas due to regional demand or satellite coverage. Additionally, ASSIT is more robust to sparsity as it can identify and focus on areas with higher data density, which may contain more informative traffic features, rather than being overwhelmed by overall sparsity. Simultaneously, we utilize a graph embedding module to effectively process non-Euclidean data through a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).

Our Satformer consistently outperforms the mathematical tensor completion algorithms, achieving significant improvements. Notably, even at the minimal $2\\%$ sampling ratio, Satformer maintains proficient performance, with NMAE values recorded as 0.098, 0.1017, and 0.1402 for the Iridium, Telesat, and Starlink datasets, respectively.

On the Iridium dataset (66 satellites), Satformer improves NMAE and NRMSE by $8.57\\%$ and $8.95\\%$ , respectively. As the size of the dataset increases, performance of CoSTCo are evident due to its exclusive reliance on two-dimensional convolution for spatial feature extraction without explicitly modeling temporal features. DAIN falls short by not explicitly modeling interactions between entities, which limits information utilization, despite its combination of information for data augmentation. SPIN\u2019s ability to handle sparsity or irregularly sampled data might be limited, which could affect the accuracy of traffic estimation in satellite networks where data is often incomplete. STCAGCN captures time-asynchronous correlations may not fully account for the complex temporal dynamics in satellite network, leading to less accurate estimations. The architecture of STCAGCN cannot ensure the information learned at earlier stages is preserved and utilized in later stages. Although CDSA also utilizes the self-attention mechanism, its dimension-wise processing may limit its ability to capture complex interactions. RNN-based models of SAITS are generally inferior to Transformer architectures in terms of handling long-distance dependencies and efficiency. In contrast, Satformer excels by explicitly incorporating both spatial and temporal features within each module. The graph embedding captures nonlinear information, the Satformer module integrates the ASSIT, and the transfer module seamlessly transmits global contextual information.

Satellites predominantly communicate with terrestrial terminals via ground stations. Spatially, the distribution of ground stations is uneven due to factors such as topography, economic considerations, and geopolitical influences. In regions with extreme environmental conditions or economic underdevelopment, such as oceans, deserts, and polar areas, the received traffic is significantly lower compared to more favorable environments, contributing to an uneven spatial distribution of traffic in the satellite network. Furthermore, the global distribution of earth stations spans various time zones, resulting in non-stationary traffic generation at different times. This temporal variability leads to significant traffic variations among stations. Additionally, to ensure link quality between satellites and ground stations and to mitigate the impact of frequent satellite handoffs, ground stations must consider multiple factors, including elevation angle, service time, and signal strength, when selecting communication satellites.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
