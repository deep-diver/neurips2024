However, in many real-world applications, algorithmic decisions influence user behavior, leading to a phenomenon known as \"performative learning.\" This poses a significant challenge because the data distribution changes as a consequence of the deployed model, invalidating standard learning approaches. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a new framework for modelling performative effects using \"push-forward measures.\" This framework allows researchers to understand how model parameters affect data distributions and enables new gradient estimation techniques. The framework is applied to classification problems, and under a new set of assumptions, the paper proves the convexity of performative risk.  This has important implications for training algorithms and opens up new research directions.\nThe paper's main contribution is a new and more efficient way to estimate the gradient of performative risk. This is achieved by modelling performative effects as push-forward measures, leading to a more intuitive and scalable learning strategy. Moreover, they prove the convexity of the performative risk in binary classification problems under specific conditions, removing the previous requirement for small performative effects. Finally, they establish a link between performative learning and adversarial robustness, suggesting that techniques from robust learning could improve performative learning models.", "affiliation": "Univ.
