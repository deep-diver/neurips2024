Focusing on classification with a linear-in-parameters performative effect, we prove the convexity of the performative risk under a new set of assumptions. Notably, we do not limit the strength of performative effects but rather their direction, requiring only that classification becomes harder when deploying more accurate models.

Consider for instance a social ranking system: if it consistently favors a particular subpopulation of individuals, user behavior might shift towards mimicking the main characteristics of this subgroup or, conversely, some features of this subpopulation can undergo modification as a consequence of the selection by the system, both effects leading to subtle alterations of the original data distribution.
