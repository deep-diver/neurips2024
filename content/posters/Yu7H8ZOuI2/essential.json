However, existing methods often struggle with incomplete distance information and require a large number of samples.  This leads to computational limitations and reduced data efficiency, hindering their practical applicability.\nThis paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel algorithm called MatrixIRLS, based on iteratively reweighted least squares.  This approach uses a non-convex rank minimization formulation and establishes a local convergence guarantee with a minimal number of distance samples.  MatrixIRLS demonstrates improved data efficiency and scalability through numerical experiments with both simulated and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.  The algorithm's ability to work with limited data and high accuracy makes it valuable across various applications.", "affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Yu7H8ZOuI2/podcast.wav"}
