The dataset is divided into four subsets: stable with diagonal elements only, stable with off-diagonal elements, dynamic-geometric and dynamic-molecular.  The MAEs are shown for the diagonal, non-diagonal, and all elements of the Hamiltonian matrix, along with the MAE of orbital energies (\u2208) and the cosine similarity of orbital coefficients (\u03c8).  The results highlight that DEQHNet significantly improves the accuracy of Hamiltonian predictions compared to QHNet across all subsets.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "PSVkinBs4u/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of the MAEs between QHNet and DEQHNet trained on MD17 dataset.
