They lack a supervision signal for molecular data, further limiting their capabilities. This research addresses these issues by focusing on molecular representation and unified multi-modal learning.\nThe researchers introduce UniMoT, a unified molecule-text LLM, using a tokenizer-based architecture. This converts molecules into sequences of discrete tokens, bridging the modality gap between molecules and text. UniMoT's autoregressive training paradigm facilitates both molecule-to-text and text-to-molecule tasks. The results show that UniMoT achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of its approach for future multi-modal LLM applications.
