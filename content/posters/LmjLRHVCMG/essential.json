This work opens up new avenues for improving Fisher-based methods and optimizing convergence.", "summary": "Improved Empirical Fisher (iEF) approximation significantly boosts the performance of Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) optimizers, offering superior convergence and generalization.", "takeaways": ["iEF significantly improves the quality of approximation to exact Natural Gradient updates.", "iEF exhibits superior convergence and generalization performance compared to existing methods.", "A novel empirical evaluation framework enables accurate comparison of approximate Fisher pre-conditioners in large-scale optimization setups."], "tldr": "Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) methods, while popular, suffer from the limitations of Empirical Fisher (EF) approximation, notably its poor approximation quality.  This is due to an inversely-scaled projection issue that biases updates towards already well-trained samples. This issue hinders efficient training, requiring complicated step-size schedulers and significant damping to function effectively.\nThis paper introduces the Improved Empirical Fisher (iEF) method to overcome this.  iEF is presented as a generalized NGD method that addresses the projection issue while maintaining the practicality of EF. Through extensive experimentation, iEF demonstrates superior approximation quality and significantly better optimization performance in various deep learning tasks compared to both the EF and other methods.  A novel empirical evaluation framework, specifically designed for large-scale tasks, is also presented to enable thorough benchmarking of approximate NGD methods.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "LmjLRHVCMG/podcast.wav"}
