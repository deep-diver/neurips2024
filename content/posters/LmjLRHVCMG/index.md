### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) methods, while popular, suffer from the limitations of Empirical Fisher (EF) approximation, notably its poor approximation quality.  This is due to an inversely-scaled projection issue that biases updates towards already well-trained samples. This issue hinders efficient training, requiring complicated step-size schedulers and significant damping to function effectively.

This paper introduces the Improved Empirical Fisher (iEF) method to overcome this.  iEF is presented as a generalized NGD method that addresses the projection issue while maintaining the practicality of EF. Through extensive experimentation, iEF demonstrates superior approximation quality and significantly better optimization performance in various deep learning tasks compared to both the EF and other methods.  A novel empirical evaluation framework, specifically designed for large-scale tasks, is also presented to enable thorough benchmarking of approximate NGD methods.

### In-depth insights


#### Empirical Fisher Issue
The empirical Fisher approximation, while computationally convenient for natural gradient descent, suffers from a significant limitation: **inversely-scaled projection**.  This issue arises because the loss reduction enforced by EF updates is constant across all samples, regardless of their convergence level.  Consequently, the method is easily biased towards well-trained samples, hindering efficient exploration of the parameter space. The inversely-scaled projection results in distorted update vector fields and inefficient training trajectories, often requiring sophisticated damping schemes to work effectively. **This problem is particularly pronounced in large-scale setups** where calculating the exact Fisher information matrix is computationally prohibitive, yet the limitations of the EF approximation become more apparent. An improved method is needed to overcome this deficiency, enabling better convergence and generalization in deep learning models.  The paper proposes such a method, **iEF**, addressing this limitation while maintaining the simplicity of the EF approach.

#### Improved EF (iEF)
The proposed iEF method addresses the limitations of the Empirical Fisher (EF) approximation used in Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) optimization.  **iEF improves EF's approximation of the exact Fisher information matrix**, a crucial component in NGD for accelerating training and enhancing generalization.  The core issue with EF is identified as an inversely-scaled projection problem, where updates disproportionately favor well-trained samples.  **iEF mitigates this by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix**, weighting updates based on sample convergence level.  This generalized NGD approach, motivated by a loss reduction perspective, improves both convergence speed and generalization performance.  Experimental results demonstrate iEF's superior approximation quality to exact NG updates compared to both EF and computationally more expensive sampled Fisher methods.  **iEF's robustness to the choice of damping parameter is a significant advantage**, simplifying optimization and enhancing its practical utility.

#### iEF Evaluation
The effectiveness of the improved empirical Fisher (iEF) approximation hinges on its ability to accurately reflect natural gradient (NG) updates, a key aspect addressed in the 'iEF Evaluation' section.  **A robust evaluation framework is crucial**, assessing iEF's approximation quality against both the standard empirical Fisher (EF) and the more computationally expensive sampled Fisher (SF) methods. This involves **developing a novel metric**, efficiently quantifiable within modern auto-differentiation frameworks, to directly measure the alignment of iEF updates with true NG updates. **Large-scale experiments across diverse deep learning tasks** (e.g., parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models) become essential, validating not only the approximation quality but also the generalization and convergence performance of iEF when used as an optimizer.  **The robustness of iEF to the choice of damping parameter** is another vital aspect, comparing its performance against EF and SF across multiple tasks and training stages. In essence, a strong 'iEF Evaluation' would rigorously demonstrate the superiority of iEF as both a more accurate approximation of the Fisher information matrix and a superior optimizer, showcasing its advantages over established methods in real-world deep learning applications.

#### iEF Applications
The heading 'iEF Applications' suggests a section dedicated to exploring the practical uses of the Improved Empirical Fisher (iEF) method.  It would likely detail how iEF can be leveraged in various contexts.  **One key application would be its direct use as an optimizer**, potentially outperforming existing methods in terms of convergence speed and generalization ability.  The section could demonstrate this superiority through experimental results on diverse machine learning tasks.  **Another crucial aspect would involve integrating iEF into existing approximate natural gradient descent (NGD) optimizers**.  This would show how iEF's enhanced accuracy in approximating the Fisher information matrix can enhance the performance of these widely used optimizers.  This integration might lead to improvements in convergence speed, robustness, and overall performance. **A further application could center on iEF as an independent Fisher matrix approximation method**, paving the way for advancements in other Fisher-based techniques that extend beyond optimization, such as model compression.  The discussion might include illustrative examples and empirical evaluations showcasing the effectiveness of iEF across these varied applications. The section would conclude by summarizing the key advantages and potential impact of the proposed iEF method.

#### Future Work
The authors suggest several promising avenues for future research.  **Improving existing approximate natural gradient descent (NGD) optimizers** by integrating the improved empirical Fisher (iEF) method is a key direction.  This would leverage iEF's superior approximation quality and robustness while maintaining the efficiency of established optimizers like K-FAC.  **Exploring the application of iEF to other Fisher-based methods beyond optimization** is another compelling area.  This could lead to advancements in diverse tasks such as model compression and Hessian approximation.  **Further theoretical investigations into the iEF method's convergence properties and their robustness to various loss functions and model architectures** would provide a solid foundation for broader adoption and application.  Finally, **developing a more robust framework for evaluating the approximation quality of approximate NGD methods** is vital.  This would involve testing across a wider range of tasks and models to validate the generalizability of the current findings.
