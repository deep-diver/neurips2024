### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Accurately predicting the performance of foundation models (FMs) in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is crucial for their safe and effective deployment. However, evaluating OOD performance is typically challenging due to the scarcity of labeled OOD data.  Existing methods often lack the versatility and efficiency required for large FMs.  This research tackles this problem by leveraging the "agreement-on-the-line" phenomenon, which observes a strong linear correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance metrics. 

This research investigates whether this phenomenon holds true for FMs, which undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights.  They discovered that carefully constructed ensembles, particularly through random linear head initialization, consistently induce agreement-on-the-line across different tasks and modalities.  Further, they showed that this approach works even when ensembling FMs pretrained on different datasets.  The proposed method demonstrates high precision in OOD performance prediction, outperforming existing techniques, especially for question-answering tasks. **This study significantly advances our ability to reliably assess and improve the robustness of FMs in real-world applications.**

### In-depth insights


#### AGL for Foundation Models
The paper explores the applicability of Agreement-on-the-Line (AGL), a method for predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, to foundation models (FMs).  **A key challenge is that FMs, unlike classical neural networks, undergo minimal finetuning, potentially reducing ensemble diversity needed for AGL**.  The authors investigate various methods to induce diversity, including random linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting.  **Surprisingly, only random head initialization reliably induces AGL across multiple vision and language benchmarks.** The study also shows that ensembles of different FMs, even pretrained on diverse data, can exhibit AGL. These findings **highlight the importance of careful ensemble construction to leverage AGL's benefits in FMs**. The results demonstrate that **AGL can provide high-precision OOD performance predictions for FMs**, surpassing other estimation methods.

#### Diversity in Finetuning
The concept of 'Diversity in Finetuning' within the context of foundation models is crucial for achieving robust out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.  The paper highlights that **lightly finetuning multiple runs from a single foundation model can yield drastically different levels of ensemble diversity**, impacting the reliability of agreement-on-the-line (AGL) for OOD performance prediction.  **Randomly initializing the linear head emerges as the most effective approach for inducing such diversity**, consistently promoting AGL across various vision and language benchmarks.  However, other sources of randomness like data ordering and subsetting are less reliable.  Furthermore, the study explores using multiple foundation models pretrained on different datasets, observing that **carefully constructed ensembles of such models also demonstrate AGL**, showcasing its broader applicability beyond single-model finetuning.  This **diverse ensemble approach significantly enhances the precision of AGL-based OOD performance estimation** compared to alternative methods.

#### OOD Performance Prediction
The paper explores **out-of-distribution (OOD) performance prediction** for foundation models (FMs), focusing on the phenomenon of "agreement-on-the-line" (AGL).  AGL leverages the correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD agreement among multiple models to predict OOD accuracy, even without OOD labels.  The study investigates the effectiveness of AGL on lightly finetuned FMs, highlighting the crucial role of diverse ensembles.  **Random initialization of linear heads** emerges as a key strategy for inducing sufficient model diversity, improving OOD performance estimation.  The research also examines the use of ensembles from multiple base FMs, demonstrating that careful ensemble construction is vital for reliable AGL-based predictions.  **The results show AGL's versatility across various tasks and modalities**, showcasing its potential for robust OOD performance estimation in FMs.

#### AGL Across Modalities
The concept of "AGL Across Modalities" in the context of foundation models (FMs) suggests that the agreement-on-the-line (AGL) phenomenon, where a strong linear correlation exists between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) agreement among models, generalizes across different data types or modalities (image, text). This is significant because it implies that a single method of OOD performance estimation using AGL can be applied to various FMs trained on different tasks and datasets. **The success of this approach, however, crucially depends on carefully ensuring diversity within the model ensembles**, often achieved through random initialization of the linear head, rather than methods like data ordering or subsetting which may lead to less reliable results. This implies **practical advantages** by using AGL in a wide range of applications. **A careful consideration of ensemble diversity is crucial for the reliability of AGL-based methods.** 

#### Limitations of AGL
The Agreement-on-the-Line (AGL) method, while promising for out-of-distribution (OOD) performance prediction, has limitations.  **AGL's reliance on a strong linear correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance may not hold for all distribution shifts.**  This limits its generalizability and predictive power in diverse scenarios.  **The diversity of the ensemble is crucial for AGL to succeed,** but achieving this diversity through simple techniques such as data shuffling or subsetting may be unreliable.  **Careful ensemble construction is needed**, and the choice of randomness (e.g., head initialization) significantly impacts AGL's effectiveness. Finally, while AGL offers a computationally efficient approach, it does not provide theoretical guarantees, especially when applied to lightly finetuned foundation models. Further research is needed to explore the robustness and expand the applicability of AGL.

> This table presents the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of different methods in predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.  It compares AGL-based methods (ALine-D, ALine-S) to other baselines (ATC, AC, DOC-Feat, Naive Agr). The diverse ensemble is created by combining models with randomized linear initializations and multiple base models. The table highlights which OOD datasets have been filtered due to a low correlation in agreement.

> This table shows the average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the ALine method for estimating out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of CLIP models finetuned on CIFAR10 and evaluated on CIFAR10C.  It compares the performance using different sources of diversity: random linear heads, data ordering, and data subsetting.  The results demonstrate that only the models with diverse random linear head initialization consistently achieve the smallest MAPE, highlighting the importance of this diversity source for accurate OOD performance prediction.

> This table shows the mean average percentage error (MAPE) of the ALine algorithm for estimating out-of-distribution (OOD) performance for fully fine-tuned CLIP models on 19 CIFAR10-C corruption datasets.  It compares the performance using three different sources of ensemble diversity: random linear heads, data ordering, and data subsetting.  The results demonstrate that ensembles created using random linear head initialization are significantly more accurate at predicting OOD performance than ensembles created using the other two methods.

> This table shows the hyperparameters used for full finetuning the OPT-125M language model on the MNLI dataset.  It breaks down the hyperparameters used for two different diversity strategies:  (1) Initialization + Ordering, where the model's initialization and data ordering were varied; and (2) Subsetting (10% of data), where the model used a subset of 10% of the data, with the learning rate as the varied hyperparameter. For each strategy, the table lists the learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and maximum number of epochs.

> This table shows the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the ALine algorithm for estimating out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of CLIP models.  The models are fully finetuned on the CIFAR10 dataset and tested on the CIFAR10-C dataset (19 different corruption types).  The table compares the performance of three different methods for creating model ensembles: random linear heads, data ordering, and data subsetting.  Results show that the ensemble with randomly initialized linear heads performs significantly better (lower MAPE) in estimating OOD performance.
