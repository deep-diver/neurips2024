### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO) faces challenges managing data efficiently as the objective function changes over time. Existing methods either reset the dataset periodically or assign decreasing weights to old observations, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper introduces the W-DBO algorithm, which uses a novel criterion based on the Wasserstein distance to quantify the relevance of each observation, and selectively removes stale data. This technique allows maintaining predictive accuracy and high sampling frequency while managing dataset size effectively. 



The core of W-DBO is a new criterion which leverages the Wasserstein distance to measure the impact of removing an observation on future predictions.  Using this criterion, W-DBO efficiently removes irrelevant observations in an online setting. The algorithm's performance is evaluated through numerical experiments, demonstrating that W-DBO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, leading to a significant improvement in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. **This makes W-DBO highly relevant for practical applications of DBO where computational cost and real-time performance are crucial**.

### In-depth insights


#### Stale Data Removal
The concept of stale data removal is crucial in dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO) because the objective function changes over time.  **Observations made earlier become less relevant for predicting the optimum in the future.** The paper introduces a method to quantify this irrelevance using a Wasserstein distance-based criterion, which measures the difference in the Gaussian Process (GP) posterior distribution after removing an observation.  This criterion helps identify stale data points by calculating a relevancy score. **A low score indicates that removing the observation has minimal impact on future predictions.**  This efficient criterion allows W-DBO to remove irrelevant data online, balancing predictive performance and computational cost. The removal strategy efficiently maintains a high sampling frequency even in scenarios with continuous-time optimization, thus **preventing the dataset size from growing excessively and improving the algorithm's response time.** The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in the numerical results, showing W-DBO's superiority over existing methods in dynamic optimization tasks.

#### W-DBO Algorithm
The W-DBO algorithm innovatively addresses the challenge of stale data in dynamic Bayesian optimization (DBO).  **It leverages a Wasserstein distance-based criterion to quantify the relevancy of each observation.** This allows the algorithm to efficiently remove irrelevant data points, thereby maintaining good predictive performance while enabling a high sampling frequency.  **The algorithm's ability to adapt on-the-fly, removing stale observations while preserving crucial information, distinguishes it from other DBO methods.** This is particularly crucial for continuous-time optimization with unknown horizons.  The use of a removal budget further enhances its practicality, balancing data reduction with maintaining predictive accuracy.  While computational tractability is addressed through approximations, the overall effectiveness of W-DBO, as demonstrated in numerical experiments, showcases its significant advantage in handling dynamic optimization tasks.

#### Wasserstein Distance
The concept of "Wasserstein Distance" within the context of a research paper likely revolves around quantifying the similarity between probability distributions.  In the specific application of Bayesian Optimization, it's used to **measure the relevance of past observations** in a dynamic environment.  Instead of simply discarding old data points, the Wasserstein distance helps determine which observations are still informative for predicting the future optimum. This approach is powerful because it avoids discarding potentially valuable information too soon.  **The method's efficiency** stems from providing a way to dynamically manage the dataset, ensuring that the computational cost remains reasonable even with continuous-time optimization.  By selectively removing stale data, it's possible to maintain a high sampling frequency and high predictive performance, which are normally conflicting goals in dynamic Bayesian optimization.  Therefore, the use of Wasserstein distance is crucial for **improving both efficiency and accuracy** in this context.

#### Computational Cost
The computational cost of Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms, especially in dynamic settings, is a critical concern.  Standard BO methods have a time complexity that scales cubically with the dataset size, making them impractical for high-frequency data acquisition in dynamic environments.  The paper addresses this by introducing a novel criterion to quantify the relevancy of observations and a method to efficiently remove stale data.  **This significantly reduces the computational burden**, allowing for higher sampling frequency and improved tracking of the optimum in dynamic systems.  While the proposed method still involves matrix inversions, its efficiency gains are achieved by focusing on the most relevant data points.  **Approximations and upper bounds are used to reduce computational cost**. The practicality of the proposed algorithm depends heavily on the efficacy of these approximations; further analysis of approximation error and sensitivity to parameters is necessary for a full understanding of the computational performance.   **The online nature of the approach is a key advantage**, enabling efficient operation in dynamic contexts where data streams continuously arrive.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on stale observation removal in dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO) are manifold.  **Extending the Wasserstein distance-based criterion to a broader class of covariance functions beyond the currently assumed spatio-temporal decomposable structure is crucial**. This would enhance the applicability of the method to a wider range of real-world dynamic optimization problems.  Further investigation into the theoretical guarantees, such as regret bounds, for the proposed W-DBO algorithm in continuous time settings is needed. **Empirical analysis on more diverse and complex real-world datasets is vital**, showcasing the robustness and practical advantages of W-DBO in varied applications.  Finally, exploring the integration of W-DBO with other advanced BO techniques, like parallel or multi-objective BO, offers exciting avenues to push the boundaries of efficient and adaptive optimization in dynamic environments.

> üîº This table compares two different budget formulas for removing stale observations in the W-DBO algorithm.  It shows how the budgets change with different experiment durations (300, 600, and 1800 seconds) and a fixed lengthscale.  The comparison highlights the difference in how these formulas scale with time, demonstrating the more consistent behavior of formula (87).
