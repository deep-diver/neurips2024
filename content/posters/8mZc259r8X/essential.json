Branch-and-cut algorithms are the method of choice; however, selecting effective cutting planes to reduce search space is critical and often heuristic. Recent advances have used data-driven approaches to select good cutting planes from parameterized families. This paper extends this data-driven approach to the selection of the best cut generating function (CGF). CGFs are tools for generating a variety of cutting planes, generalizing well-known Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cutting planes.\nThe paper provides rigorous sample complexity bounds for the selection of effective CGFs from parameterized families, showing these selected CGFs perform better than GMI cuts in specific distributions. The research also explores the sample complexity of using neural networks for instance-dependent CGF selection, furthering the investigation into instance-specific parameter choices within data-driven algorithm design for branch-and-cut.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "8mZc259r8X/podcast.wav"}
