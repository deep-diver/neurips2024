### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs), while not traditionally considered classifiers, perform a classification task during pre-training by predicting the next token.  This raises questions about the presence and impact of neural collapse (NC), a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where model representations converge to specific geometries.  Existing research primarily focuses on NC in other domains, and often under idealized conditions rarely found in LLMs (balanced classes, few classes, noise-free data, sufficient training). This limits its applicability and understanding in the context of LLMs.

This paper empirically investigates NC in causal language models (CLMs) by systematically scaling model size and training duration.  The researchers find that NC properties, particularly hyperspherical uniformity, emerge with increased scale and training, correlating with improved generalization performance.  Crucially, these correlations persist even when controlling for model size and training parameters, suggesting a fundamental relationship between NC and LLM generalization.  These findings challenge the traditional assumptions associated with NC and provide a novel perspective on LLM behavior and training optimization.

### In-depth insights


#### Linguistic Collapse
The concept of "Linguistic Collapse" in the context of large language models (LLMs) presents a fascinating extension of the neural collapse (NC) phenomenon.  It investigates whether the inherent classification task of token prediction in LLMs exhibits NC properties, despite violating typical NC conditions such as balanced classes and sufficient training. The study reveals a surprising emergence of NC-like behaviors with increasing model scale and training, particularly in hyperspherical uniformity of class embeddings. **This suggests NC's generality extends beyond image classification to the complexities of language modeling.**  Furthermore, a correlation is observed between the development of NC properties and improved generalization, even when controlling for model size and training, implying a **fundamental link between the geometrical properties of the model's representation and its performance.**  However, the study acknowledges that traditional NC metrics may not fully capture the subtleties of linguistic data, highlighting potential future research avenues in developing more appropriate metrics and theoretical frameworks to better understand and utilize NC in LLMs.

#### NC in LLMs
The study explores Neural Collapse (NC), a phenomenon observed in classification tasks, within the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).  It challenges the traditional understanding of NC, which typically requires balanced classes, few classes, and noise-free labels. **LLMs violate these conditions**; they deal with imbalanced, numerous classes (vocabulary) and inherently ambiguous contexts.  The research investigates how scaling LLM architecture and training epochs affects the emergence of NC properties.  It finds a correlation between the development of NC properties (specifically hyperspherical uniformity) with improved model generalization, even when controlling for scale, suggesting NC's broader relevance in LLMs beyond simple classification tasks. This **challenges the existing assumptions about NC**, broadening our comprehension of LLMs and suggesting potential avenues for architecture improvement and better generalization by leveraging NC-related properties.

#### Scaling & Generalization
The research explores the intricate relationship between model scaling and generalization performance in large language models (LLMs).  **Increasing model size (width and depth) generally improves generalization**, evidenced by a reduction in validation loss.  However, this improvement is not solely attributed to scale; **intrinsic properties related to Neural Collapse (NC)**, such as within-class variability collapse and hyperspherical uniformity, also demonstrate a strong correlation with enhanced generalization.  **Larger models exhibit a greater tendency toward NC properties**, suggesting that these geometric features contribute significantly to improved generalization.  Interestingly, **even without significant scaling, certain NC characteristics still show a substantial correlation with improved generalization**. This implies that fostering NC-related properties could be a key strategy in designing future LLMs, even independent of simply increasing model size. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between these factors for designing highly effective LLMs.

#### NC Properties & Scale
The interplay between neural collapse (NC) properties and model scale is a crucial theme.  **Larger models generally exhibit stronger NC characteristics**, such as reduced within-class variability and increased hyperspherical uniformity of class means. This scaling effect suggests that **NC is not merely a byproduct of training dynamics, but rather a phenomenon influenced by architectural choices and data characteristics.** The observed correlation between enhanced NC properties and improved generalization performance in larger models supports the hypothesis that NC contributes to a model's ability to generalize well. However, the relationship is complex.  **Not all NC properties scale equally**; for instance, while some show clear improvements with scale, others may plateau or even exhibit a decline. This highlights the necessity of a more nuanced understanding of the individual NC properties and their respective relationships with model size and generalization capabilities. Further research is needed to fully elucidate these relationships and to determine whether specific NC properties are more critical than others in enhancing generalization.  **This investigation into the interaction of NC and model scale offers valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms driving the success of deep learning models.**

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending neural collapse (NC) principles to more complex language modeling tasks, such as those involving multi-modal inputs or instruction-following.  **Investigating the relationship between different NC properties and downstream performance metrics beyond simple validation loss is crucial.** This could involve analyzing NC's impact on fairness and interpretability in various language models.  **A deeper theoretical understanding of NC in the context of imbalanced datasets and the impact of various training methodologies, including weight decay, on NC's emergence** would enhance the understanding of large language models.  Finally, **empirical studies comparing NC's manifestations across diverse language models (LLMs) and architectures are needed** to determine the generality of NC's influence on model performance and its potential as an evaluation criterion.

> üîº This figure shows the simultaneous development of four neural collapse properties (NC1, GNC2, UNC3, NC4) in 230 causal language models, trained on TinyStories dataset, and their relationship with improved generalization (validation performance).  Each property is visualized in a separate plot, showing how the different properties evolve together with model size and training.  The plots are colored according to model size and annotated with the coefficient of determination (R-squared), indicating the strength of the relationship between each NC property and validation performance.  The visualization suggests that increased model size and training correlate with the emergence of NC properties and improved generalization.

> üîº This table presents the results of a statistical test investigating the correlation between Neural Collapse (NC) properties and generalization performance (measured by validation loss).  Twenty-one identical models were trained with different random initializations (data shuffling seeds), and a permutation test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of any observed correlations.  The table shows the R-squared values (measuring the strength of the correlation), and p-values (indicating statistical significance).  Bold p-values below 0.05 indicate statistically significant correlations between the specific NC property and generalization performance.

> üîº This table shows the variability (CDNV) and interference of several English first names.  It demonstrates that most names have lower variability and interference compared to the average token, which could be due to their distinctness and limited contextual overlap with other words.  The exception is the names 'Anna' and 'Tim', which exhibit variability and interference closer to the average.
> <details>
> <summary>read the caption</summary>
> Table 5: Under TinyStories-12x1024_10L, the variability and interference of some English first names were far below those of the average token. This might be because names are distinct from one another and are not typically used in the same contexts as other words (aside from articles). The only names to have CDNV close to that of the average token are ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù and ‚ÄúTim‚Äù. Note that the positive interference of the last row (average token) is not a typo.
