Each panel represents one of the NC properties: within-class variability collapse (NC1), hyperspherical uniformity of class means (GNC2), uniform duality between class means and classifiers (UNC3), and agreement between token classifiers and implicit nearest-class center classifiers (NC4). The models are colored by size, and the R-squared values indicate the strength of the correlation between the NC properties and generalization performance.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "G0LfcMiRkc/figures/figures_33_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Simultaneous development of the four neural collapse (NC) [1] properties in 230 causal language models trained on TinyStories [2], alongside improvement in generalization (i.e. validation performance).
