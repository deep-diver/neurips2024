Encoding and decoding FPS are measured by the number of training steps/evaluation steps per second performed by the INR model with 1080p inputs/outputs.

It breaks down the complexity for different rate points (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) into two main parts: frame processing and model compression. Frame processing complexity is measured by Giga Multiply-Accumulates (GMACs), encoding Frames Per Second (FPS), and decoding FPS.  Model compression complexity is also measured in GMACs, as well as encoding and decoding time in seconds.
