The left panel (Relation I) shows a fully connected network where each client is directly connected to all other clients.  The right panel (Relation II) shows a partially connected network with fewer connections between clients.  These different network topologies represent variations in the relationships between the clients, and this paper investigates how different client relationships and altruistic behaviors may affect stability in federated learning.", "section": "4.2 Altruism hedonic game vs. altruism coalition formation game"}, {"figure_path": "1kyc4TSOFZ/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Fully connected: theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds (green dashed line) align with empirically achieved egalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line) under different client behaviors.", "description": "This figure displays the results of experiments conducted on a fully connected friend-relationship network, comparing theoretically derived fairness bounds with the empirically observed fairness in the core-stable grand coalition.
