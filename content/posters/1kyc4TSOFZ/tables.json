This allows comparison of error and utility values for the same clients under different network configurations and game models.", "section": "4.2 Altruism hedonic game vs. altruism coalition formation game"}, {"figure_path": "1kyc4TSOFZ/tables/tables_5_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The error and utility for friendly welfare altruistic clients within fully connected and partially connected friendship networks under AHG and ACFG frameworks, respectively.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of error rates and utilities for four clients exhibiting friendly welfare altruistic behavior in two different network scenarios: one with a fully connected friendship network and another with a partially connected network. The comparison is made under two game-theoretic frameworks: Altruistic Hedonic Game (AHG) and Altruism Coalition Formation Game (ACFG). This table highlights the differences in the resulting coalition structures and Pareto optimality when the two different frameworks are employed. It is used to analyze how different game-theoretic models and network structures impact the achievement of egalitarian fairness.", "section": "4.2 Altruism hedonic game vs. altruism coalition formation game"}]
