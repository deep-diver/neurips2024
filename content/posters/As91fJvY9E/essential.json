These methods typically involve separate steps for learning user behaviors and clustering latent intents, leading to suboptimal results, especially in large-scale applications.  The computational cost and memory consumption of these methods also pose significant challenges. \n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces ELCRec, a novel intent learning model that integrates behavior representation learning and clustering within a unified end-to-end framework.  **ELCRec employs a learnable clustering module to separate cluster centers (latent intents), improving the model's scalability and efficiency.**  Furthermore, an intent-assisted contrastive learning mechanism is proposed to enhance the mutual promotion of behavior representation learning and clustering.  Experimental results show that ELCRec outperforms existing methods on several benchmarks, offering significant improvements in NDCG@5 and a notable reduction in computational costs.", "affiliation": "Ant Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Recommendation Systems"}, "podcast_path": "As91fJvY9E/podcast.wav"}
