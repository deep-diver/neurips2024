Neural networks must adapt continuously to new information, requiring plasticity. However, many networks suffer from \"plasticity loss,\" losing their ability to learn effectively over time. This is a major hurdle in several domains where the problem is non-stationary. Existing methods like weight decay attempt to address the issue but can lead to over-regularization or inadequate control of parameter norm growth. \nThis paper delves into the mechanisms of Layer Normalization (LN), highlighting its ability to revive dormant neurons but also its susceptibility to uncontrolled effective learning rate (ELR) decay. Based on this analysis, the authors introduce Normalize-and-Project (NaP). NaP inserts normalization layers and employs weight projection to maintain constant ELR, providing numerous benefits of normalization while resolving the vanishing gradient issue. Through experiments in various challenging continual learning tasks (sequential supervised learning and a continual variant of Arcade Learning Environment), NaP significantly mitigates plasticity loss and improves performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that the ELR decay caused by parameter norm growth is essential to the success of many deep RL agents. Therefore, it questions the common practice of utilizing constant learning rates in deep RL, suggesting that optimized learning rate schedules could further enhance performance.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZbjJE6Nq5k/podcast.wav"}
