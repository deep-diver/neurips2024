### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning applications, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL), often involve non-stationary environments.  Neural networks must adapt continuously to new information, requiring plasticity. However, many networks suffer from "plasticity loss," losing their ability to learn effectively over time. This is a major hurdle in several domains where the problem is non-stationary. Existing methods like weight decay attempt to address the issue but can lead to over-regularization or inadequate control of parameter norm growth. 

This paper delves into the mechanisms of Layer Normalization (LN), highlighting its ability to revive dormant neurons but also its susceptibility to uncontrolled effective learning rate (ELR) decay. Based on this analysis, the authors introduce Normalize-and-Project (NaP). NaP inserts normalization layers and employs weight projection to maintain constant ELR, providing numerous benefits of normalization while resolving the vanishing gradient issue. Through experiments in various challenging continual learning tasks (sequential supervised learning and a continual variant of Arcade Learning Environment), NaP significantly mitigates plasticity loss and improves performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that the ELR decay caused by parameter norm growth is essential to the success of many deep RL agents. Therefore, it questions the common practice of utilizing constant learning rates in deep RL, suggesting that optimized learning rate schedules could further enhance performance.

> This figure compares the performance of three different network architectures on a continual learning task. The x-axis represents the number of label resets, which means how many times the labels of the training data have been changed. The y-axis of the three subplots represents the final loss, the Jacobian norm, and the parameter norm respectively. The first architecture is a simple feedforward network without normalization, which shows rapid growth in both parameter and Jacobian norms, resulting in poor performance. The second architecture uses layer normalization, which shows reduced Jacobian norm and slower performance degradation but still shows performance decline as parameter norm increases. The third architecture uses layer normalization and weight projection, which is able to maintain the parameter norm at a constant level, resulting in constant performance as good as the initialization. This experiment shows how layer normalization can help to avoid plasticity loss, and how weight projection can help to improve the performance of layer normalization.

### In-depth insights


#### ELR Dynamics
The concept of Effective Learning Rate (ELR) dynamics is crucial in understanding the training behavior of neural networks, particularly within the context of normalization layers.  **ELR is not a fixed parameter but changes dynamically**, influenced by factors such as parameter norm growth.  In reinforcement learning (RL), where training often occurs on non-stationary problems, controlling ELR dynamics becomes particularly important.  The paper highlights how **normalization layers implicitly lead to ELR decay** due to increasing parameter norms, which can cause loss of plasticity.  **Explicit control over ELR through methods like Normalize-and-Project (NaP)** is thus presented as a crucial mechanism to avoid performance degradation in nonstationary settings.  The research demonstrates that the commonly used constant learning rate strategy might be far from optimal, and that **carefully designed ELR schedules can significantly improve performance.**  This necessitates understanding the interplay between normalization, parameter norm growth, and ELR in shaping the optimization landscape.

#### NaP Protocol
The Normalize-and-Project (NaP) protocol is a novel training approach designed to enhance the stability and plasticity of neural networks, particularly within non-stationary learning environments.  **NaP combines layer normalization with weight projection**, a technique that maintains constant per-layer parameter norms.  **Layer normalization mitigates the loss of plasticity by preventing the saturation of ReLU units**, and it offers resilience against vanishing gradients.  Weight projection ensures that the effective learning rate remains constant during training, thus preventing the decay induced by parameter norm growth.  **This consistent effective learning rate is crucial**, as demonstrated in deep reinforcement learning (RL) experiments where an implicit ELR decay is shown to be critical for achieving competitive performance. The effectiveness of NaP is shown across several continual learning scenarios, improving the performance and stability in both supervised and RL settings.

#### Plasticity Loss
The concept of "plasticity loss" in neural networks, particularly within the context of continual learning and reinforcement learning, is a critical challenge.  **Plasticity loss refers to a network's reduced ability to adapt and learn new information over time**, often manifesting as performance degradation on newly encountered tasks or environments. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon including **the accumulation of saturated ReLU units**, leading to dormant neurons, and **the increased sharpness of the loss landscape**, making further learning difficult.  The implicit decay of effective learning rate (ELR), caused by the growth of parameter norms in models employing normalization layers, is another key mechanism.  This loss of plasticity hinders the ability of neural networks to maintain their adaptability in non-stationary settings, demonstrating the importance of developing techniques to mitigate these effects and enhance the robustness of learning algorithms.

#### ReLU Revival
The concept of "ReLU Revival" in the context of neural network training using layer normalization is intriguing.  **Layer normalization's ability to counteract the detrimental effects of saturated ReLU units is a key finding.** The mechanism appears to be twofold: first, layer normalization effectively ensures that pre-activations maintain a unit variance and zero mean distribution, preventing units from becoming permanently inactive.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, **layer normalization introduces dependencies between units via mean subtraction and variance normalization.** This mixing effect allows for gradient information to still flow to saturated units, even if their direct gradients are zero, thereby allowing them to "revive" or become active again. This is particularly significant in non-stationary environments, where units can become dormant due to concept drift.  The revival mechanism is a critical aspect of layer normalization's effectiveness at preserving network plasticity.

#### Deep RL Impact
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) presents a transformative potential across diverse sectors.  **Game playing** showcases its prowess, achieving superhuman performance in complex games like Go and StarCraft.  **Robotics** benefits from its ability to learn intricate motor skills and adapt to dynamic environments, leading to more agile and versatile robots. In **healthcare**, Deep RL optimizes treatment plans, accelerates drug discovery, and enhances personalized medicine.  However, challenges remain.  **Sample efficiency** needs improvement to reduce training time and data requirements. **Safety and robustness** are crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications, requiring rigorous testing and mitigation strategies.  **Explainability and interpretability** are also needed for increased trust and wider adoption. **Bias and fairness** must be addressed to prevent discriminatory outcomes.  Despite these challenges, the long-term impact of Deep RL is likely to be significant, promising advancements in numerous domains.

The task is continual learning where the MNIST labels are randomly reassigned every 1000 steps.  The plot shows that networks using normalization layers (RMSNorm and LayerNorm) are less susceptible to accumulating dead units compared to networks without normalization, indicating normalization's ability to help networks recover from periods of low plasticity.

> This figure compares the learning curves of four different network training setups.  All networks are trained on the same task.  The first three subplots show layer-wise rescaling with NaP, global rescaling, and no rescaling of the learning rates. The last subplot combines all three into one graph.  The key finding is that while a global learning rate schedule produces very similar results to the NaP approach, perfectly matching the dynamics requires layer-wise rescaling.

> This figure shows the normalized return of Rainbow agents trained on five different Atari games with different training protocols. The x-axis represents the training progress in millions of frames, and the y-axis represents the normalized return. The different lines represent different training protocols: Rainbow + LN (layer normalization), Rainbow + LN + WP (layer normalization and weight projection), and LN + WP + Schedule (layer normalization, weight projection, and learning rate schedule). The figure demonstrates that the implicit learning rate schedule in Rainbow agents is important for performance but not optimal; using an explicit learning rate schedule can significantly improve performance.

The task involves re-randomizing the MNIST dataset labels every 1000 steps, creating non-stationarity. The plot demonstrates that networks employing layer normalization (LayerNorm) exhibit better resilience against spikes in the number of dead units compared to networks without normalization. The results suggest that LayerNorm helps recover from the temporary deactivation of ReLU units caused by the non-stationary nature of the task.

Conversely, the normalized network shows parameter norm growth but with reduced gradient norm, still experiencing a performance drop but less severe than the non-normalized network. Finally, constraining the parameter norm in the normalized network maintains performance close to the initial random initialization.
