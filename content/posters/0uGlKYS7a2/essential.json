However, it's challenging to predict how learners will behave in these environments, making it difficult to optimize an agent's own utility.  This paper investigates this challenge, focusing on the interaction between an optimizer and a learner in repeated games. The complexity of predicting learner behavior makes it difficult to design optimal strategies for the optimizer, particularly in general-sum games where players have non-opposing objectives.\nThis research presents new algorithms that precisely maximize the optimizer's utility in zero-sum games where the learner employs the Replicator Dynamics, a continuous-time online learning algorithm.  For general-sum games, the researchers show that there is no efficient algorithm to calculate optimal strategies unless P=NP. This theoretical result provides crucial insights into the inherent computational limitations involved in optimizing against learners and opens new avenues for future work in algorithm design and approximation techniques in the domain of multi-agent learning.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "0uGlKYS7a2/podcast.wav"}
