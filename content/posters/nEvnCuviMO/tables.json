[{"figure_path": "nEvnCuviMO/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Axioms satisfied by commonly studied models of probabilistic voting", "description": "The table shows whether commonly studied models of probabilistic voting satisfy three axioms: Scale-Freeness (SF), Independence of Other Candidates (IOC), and Strict Monotonicity (SM).  Scale-Freeness means that the probability of a voter ranking one candidate higher than another is invariant to scaling of distances. Independence of Other Candidates means that this probability is independent of distances to other candidates. Strict Monotonicity means the probability is strictly increasing in the distance between the voter and the lower-ranked candidate. The table indicates which models satisfy which axioms, allowing for a comparison of different probabilistic voting models.", "section": "2 Axioms and Model"}]
