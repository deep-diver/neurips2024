It compares intra-segment points (points within the same activity segment) and inter-segment points (points at transitions between activity segments). The goal is to illustrate the limitations of using consecutive distance differences to identify boundaries, especially when changes are subtle. The figure shows that for gradual changes (e.g., 'up or down'), the distributions overlap significantly, making it difficult to distinguish between intra- and inter-segment points based solely on distance. However, for abrupt changes (e.g., 'stand \u2194 sit'), the distributions overlap less.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "WK2KxPAMQv/figures/figures_1_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Comparison of the curvatures between intra- and inter-segment points.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of confinement in the representation space.  Intra-segment points (those belonging to the same class) tend to cluster tightly together within a small hypersphere (the blue circle), while inter-segment points (transitions between classes) are located in the space between hyperspheres (the orange circle). The curvature of the trajectory representing the sequence of points is higher for intra-segment points because the trajectory needs to make sharp turns to stay within the confines of the small hypersphere. In contrast, inter-segment points have a lower curvature, as they transition between hyperspheres with less sharp turns. The figure visually reinforces the core idea that curvature can be used as an effective change metric for boundary detection.", "section": "3.4 Theoretical Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "WK2KxPAMQv/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Turning angle.", "description": "This figure shows three points in a representation trajectory (zt\u2212,zt,zt+) at consecutive timestamps.

It shows that intra-segment points (within a single class) in the representation space tend to be clustered within a smaller hypersphere (Sc;), while inter-segment points (transitioning between classes) lie in a larger hypersphere. The smaller radius of the intra-segment hypersphere implies that the trajectory of representations for intra-segment points tends to curve more sharply than for inter-segment points.

Each trajectory contains 100 points sampled from the original trajectory, centered on a boundary. Inter-segment points (within five timestamps of the boundary) are marked with 'x', while intra-segment points are represented by '\u2022'. The color intensity of each point corresponds to its change metric value (1 - curvature). The visualization aims to show how curvature can differentiate intra- and inter-segment points, even when the consecutive distances between them remain similar.
