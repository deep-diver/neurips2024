First, the future trajectories of all agents (including the autonomous vehicle) are represented as braid sets.  These braid sets are then used to create a topological graph that explicitly represents the consensual behavioral pattern among the multi-agent futures. The intertwine indicators in the braid sets highlight the interactive behaviors between agents, which are crucial for determining the compliant interactive topology. This topology serves as a supervision signal to guide downstream trajectory generation and planning.", "section": "3 Behavioral Topology"}, {"figure_path": "FSgwgQXTxo/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The BeTopNet Architecture.
