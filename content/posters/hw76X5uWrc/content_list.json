However, it is difficult to identify, combine, and refine complementary information in an increasingly large and diverse knowledge base. This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in this process. An evolutionary AI framework, termed RHEA, fills this role by distilling knowledge from diverse models created by human experts into equivalent neural networks, which are then recombined and refined in a population-based search. The framework was implemented in a formal synthetic domain, demonstrating that it is transparent and systematic. It was then applied to the results of the XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, in which over 100 teams of experts across 23 countries submitted models based on diverse methodologies to predict COVID-19 cases and suggest non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for 235 nations, states, and regions across the globe. Building upon this expert knowledge, by recombining and refining the 169 resulting policy suggestion models, RHEA discovered a broader and more effective set of policies than either AI or human experts alone, as evaluated based on real-world data. The results thus suggest that AI can play a crucial role in realizing the potential of human expertise in global problem-solving.

This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in this process, making it possible to realize the full potential of diverse human expertise. Though there are many AI systems that take advantage of human expertise to improve automated decision-making [4, 31, 66], an approach to the general problem must meet a set of unique requirements: It must be able to incorporate expertise from diverse sources with disparate forms; it must be multi-objective since confilcting policy goals will need to be balanced; and the origins of final solutions must be traceable so that credit can be distributed back to humans based on their contributions. An evolutionary AI framework termed RHEA (for Realizing Human Expertise through AI) is developed in this paper to satisfy these requirements. Evolutionary AI, or population-based search, is a biologically-inspired method that often leads to surprising discoveries and insights [5, 15, 39, 48, 67]; it is also a natural fti here since the development of ideas in human teams mirrors an evolutionary process [14, 17, 38, 32].

For swing and separability, RHEA is similar to real schedules, but finds that the high separability proposed by some expert models can sometimes be useful. RHEA finds the high focus of the expert models even more attractive; in practice, they could provide policy-makers with simpler and clearer messages about how to control the pandemic.

Evolution alone, on the other hand, produces a discordant scattering of schedules, reflecting its unconstrained exploratory nature, which is disadvantageous in this domain. What kind of structure does RHEA harness to move beyond the existing policies? Five high-level properties were identified that characterize how RHEA draws on submitted models in this domain: swing measures the stringency difference between the strictest and least strict day of the schedule; separability measures to what extent the schedule can be separated into two contiguous phases of different stringency levels; focus is inversely proportional to the number of IPs used; agility measures how often IPs change; and periodicity measures how much of the agility can be explained by weekly periodicity (Fig. 4b; App. C.4). Some ideas from submitted policies, e.g., increased separability and focus, are readily incorporated into RHEA policies. Others, e.g. increased focus, agility, and periodicity, RHEA is able to utilize beyond the range of policies explored by the human designs. The examples in Fig. 4a illustrate these properties in practice. Example (i) shows a number of real policies, suggesting that geos are capable of implementing diverse and innovative schedules similar to those discovered by RHEA; e.g., weekly periodicity was actually implemented for a time in Portugal and France. Examples (ii-v) show RHEA schedules and their nearest submitted neighbors, demonstrating how innovations can manifest as interpolations or extrapolations of submitted policies.

Some final solutions stem from a single beneficial crossover of distilled parents, while others rely on more complex combinations of knowledge from many ancestors (Fig. 5a). While the solutions are more complex, the evolutionary process is similar to that of the illustrative example: It proceeds in a principled manner, with child models often falling between their parents along the case-stringency tradeoff (Fig. 5b-c). Based on these evolutionary histories, one can compute the relative contribution of each expert model to the final RHEA Pareto front (App C.5). These contributions are highly consistent across independent runs, indicating that the approach is reliable (Fig. 5d). Indeed in the XPRIZE competition, this contribution amount was used as one of the quantitative metrics of solution quality [12]. Remarkably, although there is a correlation between the performance of expert models and their contribution to the final front, there are also models that do not perform particularly well, but end up making outsized contributions through the evolutionary process (Fig. 5e; see also Fig. 4a(ii)). This result highlights the value of soliciting a broad diversity of expertise, even if some of it does not have immediately obvious practical utility.

Our implementation of RHEA uses established methods in both the Distill and Evolve steps; the technical novelty comes from their unique combination in RHEA to unlock diverse human expertise. Popular prior methods for combining diverse models include ensembling [18] and Mixture-of-Experts [42], but, as highlighted in Fig. 2, although multi-objective variants have been explored in prior work [36], neither of these methods can innovate beyond the scaffolding provided by the initial experts. Evolution is naturally suited for this task: Crossover is a powerful way to recombine expert models, mutation allows innovating beyond them, and populationbased search naturally supports multiobjective optimization. Other approaches for policy optimization include contextual bandits [73], planning-based methods [66], and reinforcement learning [29, 69], and an interesting question is how they might play a role in such a system. One approach could be to use evolutionary search for recombination and use another method for local improvement, akin to hybrid approaches used in other settings [6] (See App. A for a longer discussion). ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Theory. It is intuitive why expert knowledge improves RHEA\u2019s search capability. However, any theoretical convergence analysis will depend on the particular implementation of RHEA. The present implementation uses NSGA-II, the convergence of which has recently been shown to depend critically on the size of jumps in the optimization landscape, i.e. roughly the maximum size of non-convex regions [20, 21]. On the ONEJUMPZEROJUMP benchmark, the tightest known upper-bound for convergence to the full ground truth Pareto front is $O(N^{2}n^{k}/\\Theta(k)^{\\overline{{k}}})$ , where $k$ is a measure of the jump size, $n$ is the problem dimensionality, and $N$ is the (sufficiently large) population size. In other words, a smaller jump size leads to a drastic convergence speed up. Distilling useful, diverse experts is conceptually analogous to decreasing the jump size. This effect is apparent in the illustrative domain, where the experts provide building blocks that can be immediately recombined to discover better solutions, but that are difficult to discover from scratch (Fig. 2). This interpretation is borne out in the experiments: RHEA continues to converge quickly as the action space (i.e. problem dimensionality) increases, whereas evolution regresses to only being able to discover the most convex (easily-discoverable) portions of the Pareto front (App. Fig. 6).

In contrast, RHEA would not be effective, (1) if the problem is too easy, so that the input from human experts would not be necessary, (2) if the problem is hard, but no useful and diverse experts exist, and (3) if there is no clear way to define context and/or action variables upon which the experts agree.

One particularly exciting opportunity for RHEA is climate policy, which often includes complex interactions between multiple factors [46]. For example, given the context of the current state of the US energy grid and energy markets, the green hydrogen production subsidies introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act will in fact lead to increases in carbon emissions, unless the Treasury Department enacts three distinct regulations in the definition of \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d [60]. It is precisely this kind of policy combination that RHEA could help discover, and such a discovery process could be an essential part of a climate policy application. For example, the En-Roads climate simulator supports diverse actions across energy policy, technology, and investment, contexts based on social, economic, and environmental trajectories, and multiple competing outcomes, including global temperature, cost of energy, and sea-level rise [8]. Users craft policies based on their unique priorities and expertise.

An important barrier in the adoption of AI by real-world decision-makers is trust [44, 65]. For example, such systems could be used to justify the decisions of bad actors. RHEA provides an advantage here: If the initial human-developed models it uses are explainable (e.g. are based on rules or decision trees), then a user can trust that suggestions generated by RHEA models are based on sensible principles, and can trace and interrogate their origins. Even when the original models are opaque, trust can be built by extracting interpretable rules that describe prescriptor behavior, which is feasible when the prescriptors are relatively compact and shallow [71, 72], as in the experiments in this paper. That is, RHEA models can be effectively audited\u2014a critical property for AI systems maintained by governments and other policy-building organizations.

The format of the data was then automatically verified, to ensure that it complied with the Defined API. Verified data from all teams was then aggregated for the Distill & Evolve steps.

", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations. Understanding the limitations of the presented RHEA implementation is critical for establishing directions for future work. The cost measure used in this paper was uniform over IPs, an unbiased way to demonstrate the technology, but, for a prescriptor to be used in a particular geo, costs of different IPs should be calibrated based on geo-specific cost-analysis. The geo may also have some temporal discounting in its cases and cost objectives. For consistency with the XPRIZE, they were not included in the experiments in this paper but can be naturally incorporated into RHEA in the future. When applying surrogate-developed policies to the real world, approximation errors can compound over time. Thus, user-facing applications of RHEA could benefit from the inclusion of uncertainty measures [26, 58], inverse reinforcement learning [2, 70], as well as humans-in-the-loop to prevent glaring errors. Distillation could also be limited in cases where expert models use external data sources with resulting effects not readily approximated by the inputs specified in the defined API. If this were an issue in future applications, it could be addressed by training models that generalize across domain spaces [47, 59]. RHEA prescriptors were evaluated in the same surrogate setting as prescriptors in the XPRIZE, but not yet in hands-on user studies. Hands-on user evaluation is a critical step but requires a completely different kind of research effort, i.e. one that is political and civil, rather than computational.

This paper motivated, designed, and evaluated a framework called RHEA for bringing together diverse human expertise systematically to solve complex problems. The promise of RHEA was illustrated with an initial implementation and an example application; it can be extended to other domains in future work. The hope is that, as a general and accessible system that incorporates input from diverse human sources, RHEA will help bridge the gap between human-only decision-making and AI-from-data-only approaches. As a result, decision-makers can start adopting powerful AI decision-support systems, taking advantage of the latent real-world possibilities such technologies illuminate. More broadly, the untapped value of human expertise spread across the world is immense. Human experts should be actively encouraged to continually generate diverse creative ideas and contribute them to collective pools of knowledge. This study shows that AI has a role to play in realizing the full value of this knowledge, thus serving as a catalyst for global problem-solving.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches use a more sophisticated approach of conditionally selecting which models to use based on the input [42]. However, as highlighted in Fig. 2, although some multi-objective variants have been explored in prior work [36], neither of these methods are inherently sufficient for the kind of policy discovery required by RHEA.

In this paper, it was possible to specialize the expert models to different regions and pandemic states, but the input-output spaces of the models were uniform to enable a consistent API.

RHEA is different from these existing methods because it is not about discovering diverse solutions de novo, but rather about harnessing the potential of diverse human-created solutions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
