Existing methods often fail to model this modality discrepancy effectively, leading to suboptimal performance.  Some methods try to bridge the gap by transforming images, but the results are often visually poor. Others attempt to make the network more robust to such a difference using image transformation strategies, but lack a thorough understanding of the real cross-spectral transformation.\nThis paper proposes a novel data augmentation strategy called Random Linear Enhancement (RLE) that directly tackles the modality discrepancy. By modeling the transformation based on the Lambertian reflection model, RLE categorizes augmentation strategies into moderate and radical transformations, proposing Moderate Random Linear Enhancement (MRLE) and Radical Random Linear Enhancement (RRLE). **RLE achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets**, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for improving cross-spectral re-identification.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "Ok6jSSxzfj/podcast.wav"}
