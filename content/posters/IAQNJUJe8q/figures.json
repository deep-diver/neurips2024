The intricacy of protein-peptide interactions demands efficient exploration in the vast space for sequence-structure co-design.

The left panel shows that peptides must interact compactly with the receptor's binding site, necessitating efficient exploration of a vast sequence-structure space.  The right panel highlights the variability in binding site geometry across different examples (a-d).  These sites have varying shapes and locations, represented as different 3D Gaussian distributions.
