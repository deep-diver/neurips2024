### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but they often struggle with high-order or high-dimensional PDEs due to convergence issues.  This difficulty arises because PINNs incorporate the PDE directly into the loss function, requiring the computation of derivatives up to the order of the PDE.  This becomes increasingly complex and computationally expensive as the order and dimensionality increase.  Existing solutions offer limited theoretical understanding of these pathological behaviors. 

This paper addresses these limitations by providing a **comprehensive theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of PINNs**, focusing on the inverse relationship between PDE order and convergence probability. The researchers demonstrate that higher-order PDEs hinder convergence due to the increased difficulty in optimization.  To overcome this, they propose a novel method called **variable splitting**, which decomposes a high-order PDE into a system of lower-order PDEs.  This effectively reduces the complexity of derivative calculation, resulting in improved convergence. Through rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical experiments, the study validates the efficacy of variable splitting and enhances our understanding of PINN behavior.

### In-depth insights


#### PINN Convergence
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) demonstrate promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their convergence behavior remains a significant challenge, especially with high-order PDEs.  **The relationship between PDE order and PINN convergence is inverse**: higher-order PDEs hinder convergence.  This is due to the increased complexity of calculating higher-order derivatives within the loss function, demanding greater network capacity for accurate approximation.  **Dimensionality further exacerbates this issue**, compounding the difficulty.   **Variable splitting**, a technique that decomposes a high-order PDE into a system of lower-order PDEs, offers a potential solution.  By reducing the derivative order in the loss function, it improves convergence likelihood.  Theoretical analysis supports this claim and numerical experiments validate its effectiveness. **The power of the activation function** (e.g., ReLU) also influences convergence, with lower powers generally facilitating better results.  **Further research** could focus on refining the variable splitting approach for optimal performance and exploring the interplay between different activation functions and PDE characteristics.

#### PDE Order Impact
The section on "PDE Order Impact" would delve into the crucial relationship between the order of the partial differential equation (PDE) being solved and the convergence properties of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).  A higher-order PDE translates to needing to compute higher-order derivatives of the neural network's output, significantly increasing the complexity of the optimization problem. The analysis would likely show that **higher-order PDEs lead to slower convergence** and potentially worse generalization performance. This is because higher-order derivatives are harder to approximate accurately with neural networks, especially with limited training data. The authors would investigate different network architectures, activation functions, and optimization techniques to determine their impact on convergence rates for varying PDE orders.  **Theoretical analysis**, possibly including error bounds, and **numerical experiments** would be crucial to support the claims.  The investigation would likely highlight challenges in optimizing PINNs for high-order PDEs and suggest potential solutions or strategies, such as variable splitting methods to decompose the original PDE into a set of lower-order ones, making the problem more tractable.

#### Variable Splitting
The variable splitting technique, applied within the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), presents a powerful strategy to overcome the limitations imposed by high-order Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).  By **decomposing a high-order PDE into a system of lower-order PDEs**, variable splitting effectively reduces the complexity of the problem. This simplification reduces the computational burden of calculating higher-order derivatives, which is a significant challenge in PINNs. **This method enhances convergence of gradient descent**, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the neural network's approximation.  The theoretical analysis suggests that variable splitting's effectiveness increases as the order of the original PDE or the dimensionality of the problem increases, thereby **mitigating the effects of the curse of dimensionality**.  The numerical experiments further support these findings, demonstrating the practical benefits of this approach.  However, while variable splitting offers significant advantages, it also increases the number of parameters and thus the model complexity, which is a trade-off that needs to be considered.

#### High-Dim. Effects
The section on "High-Dimensional Effects" in this research paper would likely delve into the challenges posed by high-dimensionality when applying Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).  A key insight would be that **the curse of dimensionality is exacerbated by the order of the PDE**.  Higher-order PDEs necessitate a wider neural network to guarantee convergence, meaning the computational cost escalates dramatically with increasing dimensions. The paper likely demonstrates this through theoretical analysis, revealing how the width of the network needed for convergence increases exponentially with both dimensionality and PDE order.  **Incorporating high-order differential operators into the loss function of PINNs further amplifies this sensitivity to dimensionality**. This is in contrast to standard deep learning models which don't incorporate such operators in the loss function.  The analysis would likely provide valuable insights into why PINNs often struggle with high-dimensional problems and offer a theoretical underpinning for this empirically observed behavior.  **Variable splitting**, a technique to decompose high-order PDEs into systems of lower-order PDEs, may be presented as a potential solution to mitigate these high-dimensional challenges.

#### Future Research
The "Future Research" section of this paper could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the theoretical analysis to nonlinear PDEs** would be a significant advancement, moving beyond the current focus on linear equations and broadening the applicability of the findings.  **Investigating alternative activation functions** beyond ReLU, and their effect on convergence, could reveal superior optimization strategies.  **A deeper exploration of variable splitting** strategies, perhaps optimizing the splitting method itself or examining different splitting approaches, could lead to even more efficient solutions to high-order PDEs.  Furthermore, **empirical validation on a broader range of complex, real-world problems** is needed to fully demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed variable splitting technique. Finally, **research into the inherent limitations of PINNs**, such as their sensitivity to dimensionality and the challenge of ensuring global convergence, should continue to refine this important field.

Subfigure (a) shows the effect of the power p of the ReLU activation function on the training loss of PINNs. The results show that the convergence of loss is enhanced as p decreases, which supports the theoretical finding that the smaller p is, the more likely the gradient descent will converge. Subfigure (b) shows a comparison between PINNs and VS-PINNs for the second-order heat equation. The results show that the training loss for VS-PINNs converges more effectively than that of PINNs, which indicates that VS-PINNs, which optimize a loss function incorporating lower-order derivatives using networks with smaller p, facilitate convergence of GD.
