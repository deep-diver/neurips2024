This difficulty arises because PINNs incorporate the PDE directly into the loss function, requiring the computation of derivatives up to the order of the PDE.  This becomes increasingly complex and computationally expensive as the order and dimensionality increase.  Existing solutions offer limited theoretical understanding of these pathological behaviors. \nThis paper addresses these limitations by providing a **comprehensive theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of PINNs**, focusing on the inverse relationship between PDE order and convergence probability. The researchers demonstrate that higher-order PDEs hinder convergence due to the increased difficulty in optimization.  To overcome this, they propose a novel method called **variable splitting**, which decomposes a high-order PDE into a system of lower-order PDEs.  This effectively reduces the complexity of derivative calculation, resulting in improved convergence. Through rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical experiments, the study validates the efficacy of variable splitting and enhances our understanding of PINN behavior.", "affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "8K6ul0hgtC/podcast.wav"}
