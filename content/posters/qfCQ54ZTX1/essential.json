Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution by automating annotation, but their outputs are often noisy and the annotation space is large, making direct application challenging.  Furthermore, using LLMs for annotation can be prohibitively expensive. \nLLM4EA addresses these challenges by employing a unified framework that integrates active learning and unsupervised label refinement.  **Active learning strategically selects entities to annotate**, significantly reducing the annotation space, while **unsupervised label refinement enhances the accuracy of noisy LLM annotations**.  Experiments show LLM4EA outperforms other baselines across various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, opening up new possibilities for automated EA and large-scale knowledge graph integration.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "qfCQ54ZTX1/podcast.wav"}
