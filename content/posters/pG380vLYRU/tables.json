The comparison is performed for different numbers of constraints (m=8, 10, 12).  The results show that rAPDPro is faster than MOSEK, especially as the number of constraints increases; MOSEK fails to produce results within a reasonable time when the number of constraints reaches 12.", "section": "I Experiment details"}]
