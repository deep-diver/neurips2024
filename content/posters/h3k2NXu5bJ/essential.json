Existing methods, like retraining, are computationally expensive.  Approximate unlearning offers a compromise, aiming for a model similar to one retrained from scratch after data removal, but with lower computational cost.  However, most existing approximate unlearning techniques either lack formal guarantees or are limited to full-batch settings, hindering their practicality.\nThis research addresses these limitations by proposing a novel unlearning approach.  They leverage projected noisy stochastic gradient descent (PNSGD) and establish its first approximate unlearning guarantee under the convexity assumption. The method supports both mini-batch and sequential unlearning, showing significant computational savings compared to retraining in experiments.  Their results showcase  improved privacy-utility-complexity trade-offs, especially for mini-batch settings.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "h3k2NXu5bJ/podcast.wav"}
