### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is powerful but can produce unsafe actions in critical systems due to its trial-and-error learning process.  Existing safe RL methods either compromise safety or performance. This creates a need for algorithms that balance safety and performance. 

RL-AR, proposed in this paper, directly addresses this by integrating a safety regularizer with an RL agent. The safety regularizer avoids unsafe actions using an estimated environment model, while the RL agent learns from actual interactions. A focus module combines both agents' policies based on the state's exploration level. Results in critical control scenarios show that RL-AR ensures safety during training and outperforms existing methods in terms of return.

### In-depth insights


#### Adaptive Regularization
Adaptive regularization, in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) for critical systems, represents a crucial advancement in ensuring safety without significantly compromising performance.  The core idea is to dynamically adjust the level of regularization applied to the RL agent's policy based on the current state's level of exploration. **In less-explored states, where the risk of unsafe actions is higher, the algorithm heavily relies on a pre-defined safe policy (e.g., from a model predictive controller), effectively increasing the regularization.** This prioritizes safety in uncertain regions. Conversely, **in well-explored states, the algorithm reduces regularization, allowing the RL agent to learn and converge to an optimal policy unimpeded.** This dynamic adjustment is often implemented via a 'focus module' that weighs the contributions of the safe and RL policies according to the state's exploration level.  This approach offers a powerful balance between safety and performance, addressing a long-standing challenge in applying RL to domains where mistakes are costly.  **The adaptive nature is key; it allows for safe initial deployment and a gradual shift towards optimal, yet safe, control as the agent's understanding of the environment improves.**

#### Safe RL Exploration
Safe reinforcement learning (RL) exploration focuses on designing algorithms that guarantee safety during the learning process, a critical aspect when deploying RL in real-world applications with potential risks.  **A core challenge lies in balancing exploration (finding optimal policies) and exploitation (avoiding unsafe actions).**  Methods like adding safety constraints or using penalty functions can restrict exploration, potentially limiting the agent's ability to find truly optimal solutions. **Adaptive techniques**, which modify the exploration strategy based on the agent's current knowledge and risk assessment, are crucial. These could involve adjusting exploration parameters based on the proximity to unsafe states, using learned safety models to guide exploration, or employing a combination of safe and unsafe policies, switching between them according to context.  **Ensuring safety while maintaining sufficient exploration for good performance is a key research area**; strategies vary, and finding the right balance often involves careful consideration of specific application contexts and risk tolerances. **Theoretical analysis and rigorous empirical evaluation** are vital for establishing the efficacy and limitations of any proposed safe exploration method.

#### Focus Module
The focus module is a **crucial component** of the proposed RL-AR algorithm, acting as an arbiter between a risk-averse policy (safety regularizer) and a potentially unsafe but high-reward policy (off-policy RL agent).  Its function is to **dynamically combine** these two policies according to the context, relying more on the safety policy in uncertain or unexplored states, and transitioning to the reward-focused policy as confidence in the learned model increases. This **state-dependent weighting mechanism** offers a unique approach to safe reinforcement learning, allowing for cautious exploration early in the learning process and gradually shifting towards riskier, potentially more rewarding behaviors as the agent's knowledge improves.  The effectiveness of this adaptive weighting is supported by both theoretical analysis, which demonstrates its role in regulating the effect of policy uncertainty, and empirical findings that confirm its contribution to achieving both safety and high rewards.

#### Safety-Critical Control
Safety-critical control systems demand **high reliability and dependability**, as failures can have severe consequences.  Traditional control methods often prioritize performance over safety, relying on accurate models and deterministic algorithms. However, these methods can be brittle and may not adapt well to unanticipated situations or model inaccuracies.  **Reinforcement learning (RL)** offers the potential for adapting to complex, dynamic environments, but its inherent trial-and-error learning process can be unsafe for safety-critical applications.  The challenge lies in designing RL algorithms that guarantee safety throughout the learning phase without sacrificing performance. **Adaptive regularization techniques** and **constraint-based methods**, such as those using Control Barrier Functions or Model Predictive Control, are crucial for developing safe and robust RL controllers. **Verification and validation** become paramount, needing robust methodologies to ensure that the learned policy consistently meets safety requirements.  The research area requires a careful balance between leveraging RL's adaptive capabilities and enforcing strict safety guarantees, necessitating a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive empirical testing.

#### Model Discrepancies
The concept of 'Model Discrepancies' in reinforcement learning (RL) for critical systems is crucial.  It acknowledges that **real-world environments are complex and rarely perfectly captured by models**.  This imperfect modeling leads to discrepancies between the model's predictions and the actual system behavior.  The impact of these discrepancies is particularly significant in safety-critical applications where the consequences of errors can be catastrophic.  A robust RL algorithm should be able to handle these discrepancies gracefully, **ensuring safety and performance even when the model is inaccurate**.   The focus should be on strategies that either reduce the reliance on the model or incorporate mechanisms to adapt to model inaccuracies, such as robust optimization techniques, or a combination of model-based and model-free methods.   Moreover,  quantifying the level of acceptable model discrepancy to still guarantee safety is a critical challenge that demands careful consideration.  This requires rigorous analysis and testing under various degrees of model mismatch.
