Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown promise in transferring knowledge between domains, but their success often hinges on complex model architectures unsuitable for such devices. Existing solutions integrating knowledge distillation into domain adaptation often suffer from network capacity issues and inefficient knowledge transfer. \nThis paper introduces Reinforced Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation (RCD-KD) to address these limitations. RCD-KD uses reinforcement learning to dynamically select the most suitable target domain samples for knowledge transfer, improving the efficiency of the process and adapting to the student model's capacity. Experiments across four public datasets demonstrate that RCD-KD outperforms existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in transferring knowledge efficiently while maintaining high accuracy in the target domain.  **The use of reinforcement learning for sample selection is a key innovation**, as it enables the method to dynamically adapt to the student model's capabilities and avoid transferring unreliable information from the teacher.", "affiliation": "Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "tUHABDZP0Q/podcast.wav"}
