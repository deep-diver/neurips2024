In particular, we utilize core-feature descriptions generated by LLMs to induce core-based zero-shot predictions which then serve as proxies to estimate the worst-case risk.

ERM models tend to exploit the non-core features even when the core features are clear (Geirhos et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020).

Some other work explored updating only a small number of (pre-trained/add-on) parameters (Guo et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2024b). Similar ideas (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017) were also discussed in continual learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey and Cohen, 1989). Apart from explicit constraints on model parameters, Ge and Yu (2017) turned to the source of robust features and proposed to incorporate a subset of pre-trained data for fine-tuning, while Cha et al. (2022) aimed to enhance the mutual information between pre-trained and fine-tuned features. Jiang et al. (2019); Zhu et al.

The study of worst-case risk minimization (WRM) dates back to the work of Wald (1945), which has gradually evolved into what we know as robust optimization today (Ben-Tal et al., 2009). More recently, WRM has been considered (by many) a basic principle for domain generalization (DG; Blanchard et al., 2011; Muandet et al., 2013). A notable example is invariant risk minimization (IRM; Arjovsky et al., 2019), which aims to learn core-feature representations from multi-domain data. Such representations, under mild causal assumptions, give rise to classifiers that minimize the worst risk (Peters et al., 2016). Another key method, GroupDRO (Sagawa et al., 2020), imposes higher penalties on domains with higher empirical risks. Unlike DRM, neither IRM nor GroupDRO formulates WRM as an explicit optimization constraint for ERM. Eastwood et al. (2022) pointed out that sacrificing too much average performance for worst-case performance is not ideal for DG. Hence, they proposed to minimize the risk among the most likely domains.

DRM combines ERM with WRM, focusing on the preservation of core features which essentially define the target classes. To guide the fine-tuning process, DRM utilizes concept descriptions generated by LLMs like GPT-4. By balancing expected and worst-case performance, DRM overcomes the traditional limitations of ERM and achieves significant OOD performance improvements on multiple real-world benchmarks, establishing a new state of the art. Potential future directions include a deeper theoretical investigation into DRM as a general principle, using DRM to improve the general robustness of zero-shot models across a broad range of tasks, and better understanding the role of concept descriptions in vision-language modeling.
