It uses a simple binary classification example (detecting skis in an image) to show how ERM and WRM each fail under specific conditions (clear core features with spurious non-core features for ERM; unclear core features with robust non-core features for WRM). DRM is presented as a superior method that balances the strengths of both ERM and WRM to achieve better robustness in more general settings.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "p50Dyqk0GX/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Concept descriptions better capture core features than default prompts. The affinities between images and default prompts (df) are not stable w.r.t. changes in image background (BG) containing non-core features and are insensitive to changes in image foreground (FG) containing core features, as indicated by the relative changes (gray numbers in parentheses) w.r.t. the affinities of the original images. In contrast, the affinities between images and concept descriptions (cd) are stable w.r.t. to changes in BG while being highly responsive to changes in FG, making them a good detector for core features. See Appendix D.1 for more examples and a full quantitative study on this.", "description": "This figure shows that using concept descriptions as prompts for image classification is more robust to changes in background (non-core features) and more sensitive to changes in foreground (core features) than using default prompts.

ERM performs poorly when there are spurious features (features that correlate negatively with the target).

DRM, by combining ERM and WRM, aims to overcome these limitations and achieve better performance by striking a balance between expected performance and worst-case performance.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
