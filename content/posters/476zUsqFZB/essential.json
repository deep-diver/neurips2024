This limits their usefulness for organic chemists who reason using elementary reaction steps.  The reliance on large datasets like the US Patent Office dataset further exacerbates the problem.  Furthermore, existing ML models for reaction prediction often lack interpretability. \nTo address these issues, this paper introduces PMechRP, a system trained on the PMechDB dataset, which contains polar elementary steps representing reactions as sequences of electron movements. PMechRP utilizes a novel two-step transformer-based method to predict these steps. The system achieves high top-5 accuracy (89.9%) and offers interpretable predictions by explicitly modeling reaction mechanisms. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "476zUsqFZB/podcast.wav"}
