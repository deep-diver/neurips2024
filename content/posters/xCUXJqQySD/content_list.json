By constructing digital twins for disease processes, we can perform in-silico simulations that mimic patients\u2019 health conditions and counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical interventions in a virtual setting. This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of learning a differentiable simulator of a physiological process. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct physiological measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining.

This personalized vision of healthcare has given rise to virtual patients constructed with data-tuned models, known as digital twins. Originally an engineering concept, digital twins have recently been realized as a resource in healthcare (6; 4). The concept combines data-driven approaches with mechanistic or simulation techniques, serving as a bidirectional map between real data and simulations. Medical digital twins have been applied and developed broadly in applications ranging from cellular mechanics (24) to the development of whole body and human digital twins (50; 76), with aims ranging from tailoring cardiovascular interventions (30) to agent-based trauma care management systems (14). Both academic and industry efforts are prolific with digital twins having been developed for various medical problems (9; 69; 74; 13; 22; 70).

We focus on scenarios where identifying a patient\u2019s digital twin from noninvasive data allows us to simulate other physiological parameters that typically require invasive measurement, such as through catheterization. Such an approach assumes that there is a mapping from rich noninvasive imaging data to patient-specific mechanistic models of physiology; such a mapping is not known to scientists humans but can be learned from data. This hypothesis is supported by previous experimental work (2; 64; 43). However, the challenge lies in the absence of datasets containing both noninvasive data and the corresponding parameters of the underlying physics-based physiological model, hence the problem cannot be solved using standard supervised learning. To this end, we propose a new class of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) (60) to incorporate inductive biases informed by mechanistic models of patient physiology into neural network architectures.

We study obtaining latent parameters of a physics-based model from image measurements directly as an inverse problem. Learning patient specific parameters for a physics-based model from a complete description of patient physical states and a known forward model is an inverse problem. This task can be modeled using, for example, a PINN approach (71; 39; 29). The process of obtaining patient physical states from non-invasive medical imaging is a second inverse problem with an unknown forward model. Obtaining patient specific latent parameters from non-invasive medical imaging directly combines these two inverse problems and could be modeled by learning the unknown process components. Large numbers of labeled data pairs of images and parameters for the full inverse task would need to be obtained from invasive procedures to use supervised learning. Instead, we propose a training approach that structurally resembles selfsupervised learning (SSL), and leverages labeled data pairs of images and non-invasively measurable patient physical states. We first train a neural network using supervised learning with synthetic data to approximate the forward physics-based model as a pre-text task. We then freeze this network to finetune the learning of a solution to the composite inverse problem from the labeled measurable data pairs. Our methods are then extendable to include exogenous intervention parameters for the development of in-silico experiments. We call this framework \u201cMed-Real2Sim\u201d since it learns virtual simulators of patient phyisology on the basis of real (noninvasive) data.

Cardiac ejection fraction, the ratio between left-ventricular stroke volume and end-diastolic volume, while more routinely measured as a proxy for cardiac function, does not take into account cardiac pressure, preventing diagnosis of many severe cardiac conditions and providing motivation to develop digital twins for pressure-volume relations (80; 45; 59).

Systems of differential equations describe the relationships between circuit parameters and volume and pressure states.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
