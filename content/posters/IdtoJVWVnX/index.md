### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on effective prompt engineering.  Automatic prompt optimization (APO) aims to automate this process, typically focusing on either instruction optimization (IO) or exemplar optimization (EO).  However, current research disproportionately emphasizes IO. This paper systematically compares IO and EO across various tasks.  The study addresses this research gap by comprehensively evaluating both approaches separately and in combination.

The findings reveal that EO, even with simple methods like random search, can significantly improve performance, surpassing SoTA IO methods that focus solely on instructions.  Furthermore, the research discovered a synergy between EO and IO: intelligently combining both techniques consistently outperforms either approach in isolation, even with constrained computational budgets. The results suggest a critical need for more balanced research in APO, with greater focus given to EO and its combined application with IO to advance the field.

### In-depth insights


#### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is a crucial technique for effectively utilizing large language models (LLMs).  It involves carefully crafting input prompts to guide the model towards desired outputs, **optimizing both instructions and exemplars** to maximize performance.  While instruction optimization focuses on refining the textual instructions, exemplar optimization centers on selecting relevant examples.  The interplay between these two approaches is significant, with intelligent combination often surpassing the performance of either method alone.  **Effective prompt engineering is vital, even with highly capable instruction-following models**, as the right exemplars can significantly influence LLM behavior. Therefore, a balanced approach considering both instructions and exemplars remains crucial for unlocking the full potential of LLMs and minimizing the need for manual intervention.

#### Exemplar Optimization
Exemplar optimization (EO) in automatic prompt optimization (APO) focuses on selecting the most effective examples to guide a large language model's (LLM) behavior.  **Unlike instruction optimization (IO), which refines the instructions themselves, EO leverages the existing input-output pairs from a validation set, treating them as exemplars.**  The paper highlights the often-overlooked significance of EO, demonstrating that intelligent reuse of model-generated exemplars can substantially improve LLM performance, even surpassing state-of-the-art IO methods in certain scenarios. **Simple EO strategies, such as random search, can surprisingly outperform sophisticated IO methods**, revealing that choosing the right exemplars is paramount.  The research emphasizes a synergistic relationship between EO and IO, advocating for their combined use to achieve optimal results.  **This highlights a critical need for a more balanced approach to APO, giving EO the attention it deserves.**  Future research should explore the combined use of EO and IO, as well as more advanced optimization techniques for selecting and utilizing exemplars, especially in resource-constrained settings.

#### Synergy of IO & EO
The research explores the interplay between Instruction Optimization (IO) and Exemplar Optimization (EO) in enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance.  **A key finding is the synergistic relationship between IO and EO**, where intelligently combining both methods consistently surpasses the performance achieved by either method alone. This suggests that optimizing instructions and exemplars jointly unlocks a level of performance not attainable through independent optimization. The study demonstrates that **even simple EO strategies can significantly improve performance, sometimes even exceeding state-of-the-art IO methods**.  This highlights the often-underestimated importance of EO, suggesting that it deserves more attention in future research.  Furthermore, the investigation suggests that **SoTA IO methods might implicitly utilize model-generated exemplars**, indicating an inherent link between the two optimization strategies. The findings advocate for a more holistic approach to automatic prompt optimization, emphasizing the complementary nature of IO and EO and advocating for joint optimization techniques.

#### APO Generalization
Analyzing the generalization capabilities of Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods is crucial for their real-world applicability.  **Effective APO should not only optimize prompt performance on a validation set but also generalize well to unseen data.**  A model that performs exceptionally well on the validation set but poorly on unseen data suffers from overfitting, rendering it unreliable. The paper investigates this by comparing validation and test accuracies, revealing the extent of generalization achieved by different APO techniques.  **Exemplar Optimization (EO) methods demonstrate superior generalization compared to Instruction Optimization (IO) methods**, suggesting that carefully selected exemplars are more transferable across different tasks than finely tuned instructions. This highlights the importance of a balanced approach, potentially combining IO and EO for optimal performance, while maintaining good generalization. **Further research should focus on understanding why EO generalizes better** and how to design robust APO strategies that avoid overfitting and enhance transferability.

#### Future Research
Future research should prioritize a more unified approach to automatic prompt optimization (APO), focusing on the synergistic interplay between instruction and exemplar optimization.  **Further investigation into the implicit generation of exemplars by instruction optimization methods is crucial**, to understand their contribution to overall performance.  This requires deeper analysis of the generated prompts to identify and quantify the impact of unintentional exemplar creation.  **Developing advanced methods for exemplar selection is vital**, moving beyond simple heuristics towards optimization-based techniques that can effectively handle high-dimensional search spaces in many-shot scenarios. This would require exploring novel search strategies and incorporating effective methods for promoting exemplar diversity. **Investigating the impact of context length limitations on the effectiveness of different APO methods is needed**, especially given the emergence of LLMs with expanded context windows.  Finally,  a thorough analysis of the generalization capabilities of various APO methods will clarify their practical applicability across diverse tasks and model types.

The table highlights the maximum performance gains achieved by using EO and/or IO compared to the baseline (No IO and No EO). The background colors help visualize the computational cost associated with each method, with gray indicating no cost, blue indicating moderate cost, and orange indicating high cost.

> This table presents the average Big-Bench Hard (BBH) accuracy results for 30 different combinations of instruction optimization (IO) and exemplar optimization (EO) methods using the PaLM 2 language model.  It shows the impact of various EO strategies (No EO, Random, Nearest, Diversity, Random Search, and Mutation) when combined with various IO strategies (No IO, APE, ProTeGi, PromptAgent, OPRO). The table highlights the maximal accuracy gains achieved by using EO and/or IO compared to the baseline (No IO, No EO), and uses color-coding to represent the computational cost (number of prompt evaluations) for each combination.

> This table presents the average Big-Bench Hard (BBH) accuracy for various combinations of instruction optimization (IO) and exemplar optimization (EO) methods using PaLM 2.  It shows the maximum accuracy gains achieved by using either EO or IO alone, and by combining them. The color-coding highlights the computational cost (number of prompt evaluations) for each method.

> This table presents the average Big-Bench Hard (BBH) accuracy scores achieved by combining various instruction optimization (IO) and exemplar optimization (EO) methods.  It shows the impact of each method individually and in combination.  The table highlights the computational cost (number of prompt evaluations) for each combination, categorized into no cost (gray), moderate cost (blue), and high cost (orange). The last row and column indicate the maximum accuracy improvement achieved by using EO and/or IO, respectively.

It shows the impact of using various EO methods (No EO, Random, Nearest, Diversity, Random Search, Mutation) in combination with various IO methods (No IO, APE, ProTeGi, PromptAgent, OPRO). The maximum improvement achieved by applying EO and IO methods is also presented. The background color-coding helps in understanding the computational cost (number of prompt evaluations) associated with each combination.
