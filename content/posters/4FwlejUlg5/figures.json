Each subfigure illustrates a structural causal model (SCM) showing the relationships between observed variables (X, T, Y) and latent variables (confounders C, post-treatment variables M, instrumental variables I, and adjusters A).  The differences highlight how each method handles confounders and post-treatment variables, showcasing the key assumptions made by each approach. CiVAE's model explicitly distinguishes between latent confounders and latent post-treatment variables, addressing limitations in the other approaches.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "4FwlejUlg5/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visualization of p-value of independence test before and after conditioning on treatment T.", "description": "This figure visualizes the results of independence tests performed before and after conditioning on the treatment variable (T). It shows three cases: Intra-Confounder, Intra-Mediator, and Confounder-Mediator. Each case is represented by a heatmap where the color intensity represents the p-value, illustrating the change in dependence between pairs of latent variables before and after conditioning on T.  This visualization helps to differentiate between latent confounders and latent post-treatment variables by their dependence behavior when conditioning on T.", "section": "5.1.1 Disentangle Confounders and Post-treatment Variables"}, {"figure_path": "4FwlejUlg5/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visualization of p-value of independence test before and after conditioning on treatment T.", "description": "This figure visualizes the p-values obtained from independence tests performed before and after conditioning on the treatment variable (T).  The tests assess the independence between pairs of latent variables inferred by the CiVAE model.
