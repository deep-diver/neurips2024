It introduces a novel framework and adaptive algorithms, pushing the boundaries of existing restless multi-armed bandit models and opening new avenues for research in various real-world applications.", "summary": "Restless multi-armed bandits with global rewards (RMAB-G) are introduced, extending the model to handle non-separable rewards and offering novel index-based and adaptive policies that outperform existing methods.", "takeaways": ["The RMAB-G framework generalizes the restless multi-armed bandit problem to encompass real-world scenarios with non-separable rewards.", "Linear-Whittle and Shapley-Whittle indices, along with iterative and MCTS-based adaptive policies, are proposed to efficiently solve RMAB-G.", "Empirical evaluations using synthetic and real-world data (food rescue) demonstrate that the proposed policies outperform baselines and index-based policies."], "tldr": "Many real-world resource allocation problems involve interdependent rewards, meaning the overall reward isn't simply the sum of individual rewards from different options.  Traditional restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) models struggle with such scenarios due to their assumption of separable rewards. This limits their applicability to many practical problems like food rescue operations where the overall success depends on the interplay of various factors.\nThis paper introduces a new model called \"Restless Multi-Armed Bandits with Global Rewards\" (RMAB-G) to address this limitation. The authors develop novel algorithms, including Linear-Whittle and Shapley-Whittle indices, and sophisticated adaptive policies that combine these indices with search techniques.  They demonstrate through experiments that their proposed adaptive policies significantly improve upon existing RMAB approaches, particularly when dealing with highly non-linear reward structures.  This work has important implications for various fields requiring efficient resource allocation under uncertainty.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3apt5AJ5QN/podcast.wav"}
