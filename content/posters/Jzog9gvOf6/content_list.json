In this work, we focus on a demanding but practical sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD) in aerial images, which encompasses a wider variety of aerial scenes with the same number of annotated objects. Although most existing SAOD methods rely on fixed thresholding to filter pseudo-labels for enhancing detector performance, adapting to aerial objects proves challenging due to the imbalanced probabilities/confidences associated with predicted aerial objects. To address this problem, we propose a novel Progressive Exploration-Conformal Learning (PECL) framework to address the SAOD task, which can adaptively perform the selection of high-quality pseudo-labels in aerial images. Specifically, the pseudo-label exploration can be formulated as a decision-making paradigm by adopting a conformal pseudo-label explorer and a multi-clue selection evaluator. The conformal pseudo-label explorer learns an adaptive policy by maximizing the cumulative reward, which can decide how to select these high-quality candidates by leveraging their essential characteristics and inter-instance contextual information. The multi-clue selection evaluator is designed to evaluate the explorer-guided pseudo-label selections by providing an instructive feedback for policy optimization. Finally, the explored pseudo-labels can be adopted to guide the optimization of aerial object detector in a closed-loop progressive fashion.

To address this challenge, semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has been proposed to enhance detection performance by utilizing limited labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. SSOD methods (14; 30; 23; 36) mainly focus on general images, and cannot consider the unique characteristics of objects in aerial images, such as dense arrangements, rich contextual relationships, and large complex scenes.

For example, the average objects per image are $68.4\\;\\nu s\\;7.7$ in the DOTA (27) and COCO (13) datasets, respectively.

For example, Yoon et al. (32) combined an anchor-free object detector with an object tracker to generate dense annotations for training images. Co-mining (26) employed a Siamese network comprising two branches that mutually predict pseudo-label sets. Niitani et al. (18) utilized a part-aware sampling technique to handle instances within primary categories and used pseudo-labels to exclude un-annotated regions. However, existing SAOD methods typically focus on using fixed thresholds to filter pseudo-labels, lacking the ability to adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels. Different from conventional objects, some aerial objects characterized by substantial dimensions and notable features (e.g., planes) exhibit higher predicted probabilities, whereas smaller aerial objects like vehicles are associated with comparatively lower predicted probabilities. Consequently, the discrepancy in probabilities and confidence levels observed in the predicted results poses a severe challenge in identifying pseudo-label instances by setting a rigorous threshold in the sparsely annotated aerial object detection process.

SSOD aims at the detector optimization by using limited labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. For example, Pseudo labeling (10) has been widely used in semi-supervised learning, which utilizes pre-trained detector to generate labels for unlabeled data. Furthermore, some methods (2; 28; 11) combined consistency regularization with pseudo labeling. CSD (9) leveraged consistent predictions of horizontally flipped image pairs, STAC (21) enforced consistency constraints on weakly and strongly augmented image pairs. Unbiased Teacher (14) adopted the focal loss (12) to resolve pseudo-label bias caused by class imbalance in real labels. SOOD (7) designed rotation-aware adaptive weighting loss and global consistency loss for semisupervised oriented object detection. Furthermore, considerable efforts have been made in weaklysupervised oriented bounding box detection. H2RBox (31) learned object center from horizontal box labels in weak-supervision, used scale and spatial constraints to estimate object dimensions in self-supervision. PointOBB (16) and Point2RBox (34) used Multiple Instance Learning and Knowledge Combination to learn rotated box regression from single point supervision. While SAOD labels part of instances in each image. Many researchers have explored methods to address this challenge. Niitani et al.

To meet the requirement of sparse annotation, we adopt a novel protocol where we randomly sample $1\\%$ , $2\\%$ , $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ of instances for each class for annotation.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
