The metrics used are FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), which measures the image fidelity, and CLIP-Score, which assesses the alignment between the generated image and its text prompt.  Lower FID scores indicate better image quality, and higher CLIP-Scores represent better text alignment. ASR (Attack Success Rate) is also presented. The table shows that GUARDT2I maintains high image quality and text alignment, while demonstrating significantly better defense effectiveness in terms of a lower attack success rate when compared to the baselines.", "section": "4.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "FMrNus3d0n/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison with baselines.
