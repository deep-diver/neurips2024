The evaluation metrics are Chamfer Distance and Point-to-Surface Distance, both measured in centimeters.  The comparison is broken down into two parts: (A) a comparison with implicit function-based methods and (B) a comparison with different SMPL estimation methods used to condition the MHCDIFF approach.  The results highlight the superior performance of MHCDIFF, particularly when considering its robustness to occlusions (40% average masking).", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "E2JCQyYu0E/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative evaluation on MultiHuman dataset.

As the number of SMPL samples increases, the Chamfer Distance and Point-to-Surface Distance initially decrease, suggesting improved accuracy. However, beyond a certain point (15 samples in this case), increasing the number of samples does not lead to further improvement and may even slightly decrease quality while significantly increasing the evaluation time. This indicates an optimal number of SMPL samples exists to balance accuracy and efficiency.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
