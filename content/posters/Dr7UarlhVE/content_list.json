Among these, local differential privacy (LDP) [5] stands out as a standard model and has been deployed in industry, e.g., by Google [6, 7], Apple [8], Microsoft [9]. In the LDP framework, individual clients randomize their data on their own devices and send it to a potentially untrusted aggregator for analysis, thus preventing the user data from being inferred. However, this perturbation inherently diminishes data utility. Consequently, the central challenge in privacy mechanism design lies in optimizing utility while preserving the desired level of privacy protection. This goal involves characterizing the optimal balance between privacy parameter and utility, referred to as the privacy-utility trade-off (PUT). The analysis of the PUT and the proposal of privacy mechanisms have been actively conducted for various settings of statistical inference and machine learning [10\u201327].

However, there are increasingly more applications where each client has a large local dataset with multiple data records. One can formulate the privacy requirement in these cases by assuming that clients have datasets of the same size, generated independently from an underlying distribution $[28-$ 34]. This probabilistic assumption, however, restricts practical flexibility. The work [35] explored a scenario where clients have large datasets that may vary in size and seek to privately release another dataset that closely resembles their original dataset. In this scenario, local datasets can be represented by an empirical distribution, allowing each client to be seen as holding a probability distribution and generating a private sample from it. This setup, which is called private sampling, is the main focus of this paper.

It then constructs what is termed the \u201crelative mollifier\u201d, a closed ball centered around the reference distribution with a radius equivalent to half of the privacy budget, within the space of probability distributions. Subsequently, the mechanism computes the projection of $P$ onto the relative mollifier, utilizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This projected distribution serves as the sampling distribution for generating a sample (see Section 2.3 for more details). However, this mechanism has a notable shortcoming: the sampling distribution is only locally optimal within the relative mollifier. This, in turn, implies that the optimality of the sampling distribution depends on the choice of the reference distribution. A more fundamentally intriguing goal would be to formulate and characterize the PUT without such an ambiguity in the choice of reference distribution.

To avoid arbitrarily large number of Gaussian distributions to be mixed, we set an upper bound $K$ of the number of Gaussian distributions to be mixed per client. Also, to make the numerical integration tractable, we truncate the domain of the distributions to lie inside an interval $[-4,4]$ . Unlike the finite space case, there is no known closedform expression of the worst-case $f$ -divergence for the mechanism in [35]. The set of Gaussian mixtures is not exactly of the form $\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}=\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{c_{1},c_{2},h}$ , hence our proposed mechanism also does not have a known closed-form expression of the worst-case $f$ -divergence.

Using utility measures involving the geometry, such as Wasserstein distance [62, 63, 49], may be more appropriate for some scenarios. Also, we can consider the Bayesian approach instead of the worst-case approach. Furthermore, we only consider the task of releasing a single sample per client in this paper.

For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
