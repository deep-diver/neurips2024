Analyzing such networks efficiently is crucial but challenging due to their size and complexity.  Graph sparsification, which involves selecting a subset of edges while preserving crucial network properties, is often used to address this challenge.  However, existing sparsification techniques may unintentionally disrupt the community structure, hindering meaningful analysis. This paper investigates whether the metric backbone, a graph sparsification method that keeps only edges belonging to shortest paths, can address this issue.\nThis research uses a formal analysis of weighted stochastic block models and numerical experiments on various real-world networks. The study found that, contrary to expectations, metric backbone sparsification remarkably preserves the community structure, maintaining a similar proportion of inter- and intra-community edges. The findings are validated using various spectral clustering algorithms. Moreover, the paper explores the application of this method to constructing graphs from data points (using q-NN) and demonstrates how it increases the robustness of clustering results to the choice of hyperparameter q.", "affiliation": "EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Kx8I0rP7w2/podcast.wav"}
