Existing differential privacy mechanisms struggle to provide strong privacy protection in the dynamic MARL setting.  This limits the application of MARL to scenarios involving sensitive user information.\n\nThis research introduces a new algorithm called DP-Nash-VI that addresses this challenge.  DP-Nash-VI combines optimistic Nash value iteration with a novel privacy mechanism to guarantee trajectory-wise privacy while maintaining near-optimal regret bounds.  This work extends the definition of differential privacy to two-player zero-sum episodic Markov games and provides the first results on trajectory-wise privacy protection in MARL.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "T07OHxcEYP/podcast.wav"}
