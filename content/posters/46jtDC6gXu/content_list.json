Unlike the continuous broadcasting of hidden states at each time step, stride denoising broadcasts them every two steps. As depicted, at time step $t$ , we conduct denoising alone, and at time step $t-1$ , we compute and broadcast the hidden states for the next parallel computation round.

Stride denoising completes multiple steps simultaneously through a single parallel computation, reducing the number of parallel rounds and communication frequency across devices. For a diffusion process with $T$ steps and warm-up step $W$ , the number of broadcasts decreases from $T-W$ to $\\bar{(}T-W)//2$ with a stride of 2. This strategy also reduces the computational load on each device by skipping unnecessary calculations. Table 5 shows the effects of stride denoising in our parallel framework with 3 and 4 devices. Stride denoising significantly lowers overall latency and the proportion of communication time, especially as the number of devices used increases. While stride denoising slightly impacts generation quality, this effect is minimal and can be mitigated by a modest increase in warm-up steps, preserving efficiency and maintaining quality.

We split the denoising model into several components, each assigned to a different device. We transform the conventional sequential denoising into an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity of hidden states between consecutive time steps, enabling each component to compute in parallel. Our method has been comprehensively validated on three image diffusion models (SD 2.1, SD 1.5, SDXL) and two video diffusion models (SVD, AnimateDiff). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates inference with only a marginal impact on generative quality. This work investigates the practical application of model parallelism in diffusion models, establishing a new baseline for future research in distributed diffusion models.

In our method, we partition the cumbersome denoising model into multiple components, each assigned to a different device. After successfully parallelizing the computation of each component, the time cost for each time step now corresponds to the maximum latency among these components. To optimize parallel processing efficiency, we partition the model into segments that each carry a roughly equal computational load. This arrangement allows all modules to finish their computations nearly simultaneously, making full use of available computational resources. The segmentation strategy is sequential except for SDXL [41]. For the denoising U-net within the SDXL module, we group its first and last blocks into a single segment and apply sequential splitting to the remaining blocks. This is because SDXL has specific needs for high-frequency details, and res connections typically contain abundant high-frequency information. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Time Shifting. We introduce a technique called time shifting. Following the warm-up steps, the time embedding for each step is shifted back by one step. For instance, in a 50-step asynchronous denoising process with a warm-up of 2 steps, the original sequence of time embeddings is $\\{50,49,48,47,...,\\dot{3},2,1\\}$ . With time shifting, this sequence is adjusted to $\\{50,49,49,48,...,3,2\\}$ . In certain extreme cases, asynchronous denoising might leave residual noise in the output. Time shifting addresses this by adjusting the time embeddings backward, enhancing the denoising effect. It\u2019s important to note that time shifting is not a standard component of our method but is employed optionally. The quantitative results presented in this paper are achieved without the use of time shifting. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Stride Denoising. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce stride denoising, which completes multiple denoising steps simultaneously through a single parallel computation.

In this depiction, the denoising model $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ is divided into three components $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\,n=1}^{n^{3}}$ , and for clarity, the stride $S$ is set to 2. Unlike the continuous broadcasting of hidden states at each time step, stride denoising broadcasts them every two steps. As depicted, at time step $\\{T-1,T-3,T-5,T-7\\}$ , we conduct denoising alone, and at time step $\\{T-2,T-4,T-6\\dot{,}T-8\\}$ , we compute and broadcast the hidden states for the next parallel computation round. Consequently, the hidden states from time step $\\{T-1,T-3,T-5,{\\bar{T}}-7\\}$ are not required, allowing us to skip the calculations for $\\epsilon_{\\theta}^{1}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta}^{2}$ at these steps. Stride denoising effectively reduces both computational load and communication demands by decreasing the parallel computing rounds needed to complete the process. Compared to the significant improvements it brings in efficiency, the quality sacrifice is minimal and can be entirely compensated for by slightly increasing the warm-up steps.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
