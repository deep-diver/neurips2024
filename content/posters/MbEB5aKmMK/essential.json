This research paper addresses a critical gap by introducing the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model, which considers intermediate scenarios between these two extremes.  The paper highlights challenges in adapting existing algorithms to this new setting due to the presence of non-smooth regularizers that are common in practice. Existing algorithms are often designed to work on smooth loss functions and thus do not efficiently work in scenarios that include non-smooth regularizers. \nTo address these issues, the paper proposes the Optimistic Composite Mirror Descent (OptCMD) algorithm for online composite optimization within the SEA framework. OptCMD is designed to efficiently handle both stochastic and adversarial aspects of the environment, while also leveraging the advantages provided by the regularizer in composite losses.  The algorithm achieves optimal regret bounds (a measure of performance) for three types of time-varying functions: general convex, strongly convex, and exp-concave. Further, to address situations where the exact function type is unknown, the paper introduces a novel multi-level universal algorithm. This algorithm adapts dynamically to the characteristics of the environment and achieves similar optimal bounds.  The research shows that using regularizers does not increase the regret bound, confirming the beneficial nature of regularizers.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "MbEB5aKmMK/podcast.wav"}
