It shows both the cumulative regret (the difference between the algorithm's cumulative loss and the loss of the best single decision in hindsight) and the running time for three types of convex functions: exp-concave, strongly convex, and general convex functions. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable or better regret while having significantly faster running times than other methods.", "section": "E Experiments"}]
