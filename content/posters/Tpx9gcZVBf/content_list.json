Similarly, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) [5] applies denoised smoothing [43], a certified adversarial defense for pretrained classifiers, using one reverse diffusion step.

When generating augmentations, it is important to ensure that the resulting augmentations lie on the image manifold. Recent studies [10, 38] on theoretical properties of denoised examples suggest that denoised examples can be considered to be on the data manifold under certain assumptions lending theoretical support to the idea of using denoised examples as augmentations. We can interpret training on denoised examples as a type of Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) since the denoised examples can be considered to lie in the vicinal distribution of training samples. Previous works have shown that VRM improves generalization: for example, Chapelle et al. [8] use Gaussian perturbed examples $\\bf{\\Psi}(x)$ as the vicinal distribution while MixUp [57] uses a convex sum of two random inputs (and their labels) as the vicinal distribution. From Eq. 4, we can observe that a denoised example is a convex sum over $\\mathbf{m}_{t}$ and we can interpret $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t}$ as being vicinal to examples ${\\mathbf{m}}_{t}$ that have a non-trivial likelihood, $p_{t}(\\mathbf{m}_{t}|\\mathbf{x})$ , of generating $\\mathbf{x}$ .

Augmentations that alter the true class-label are said to cause manifold intrusion [21] leading to underfitting and lower classification accuracies. In particular, accurate predictions on class-altered augmented examples would be incorrectly penalised causing the classifier to output less confident predictions on all inputs (i.e., underfitting). Interestingly, however, diffusion denoised augmentations that alter the true-class label are also of lower sample quality. The correlation between label noise and sample quality allows the model to selectively lower its prediction confidence when classifying denoised samples generated from larger perturbations applied to $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{0}}$ (we empirically confirm this in Section 4). In other words, the classifier learns to observe important details in $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t}$ to determine the optimal prediction estimating the class-membership probabilities of $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{0}}$ . On the other hand, any augmentation that alters class-label by preserving the sample quality can impede the classifier training since the classifier cannot rely on visual cues to selectively lower its confidence (for an example, see Fig. 7 in appendix).

While we presented a unified training scheme, we follow previous works and evaluate robustness to covariate shifts, adversarial examples and out-of-distribution detection using separate evaluation pipelines (for e.g., we do not apply DDA on OOD examples). A unified evaluation pipeline for classifier robustness is an open problem and out of scope for this paper. The key advantage of our method is its computational efficiency since it requires just one reverse diffusion step to generate the augmentations; however, this is computationally more expensive than handcrafted augmentation techniques such as AugMix. Nevertheless, it is fast enough that we can generate the augmentations online during each training step. With recent advances in distilling diffusion models for fast sampling [34] such as Consistency-Models [48], it may be possible to generate better quality synthetic examples within the training loop. Since the improved robustness introduced by DiffAug can be attributed to the augmentations of varying image quality (Fig. 1), we believe that this complementary regularization effect can still be valuable with efficient high-quality sampling and leave further exploration to future work. Likewise, DiffAug is complementary to the use of additional synthetic data generated offline with text2image diffusion models and the extension of DiffAug to text2image diffusion models is suitable for future investigation. We also extend DiffAug to test time and propose DE, wherein we demonstrate improvements comparable to DDA at $10\\mathrm{x}$ wallclock time on all classifiers except ViT on Imagenet-C; while this demonstrates a limitation of single-step denoising (i.e., DE) vs. multi-step denoising(i.e., DDA), we also note that DE improves over DDA for all classifiers when considering Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S. While we demonstrate improvements over existing baselines of classifier-guidance (e.g., [6, 29, 58]), we do not compare with classifier-free guidance [25], the popular guidance method, since our primary focus is on the training of robust classifiers with DiffAug and demonstrating the potential of DiffAug. Training classifier-guided diffusion models for careful comparison requires additional computational resources and we leave this analysis to future work. Nevertheless, classifier-guidance is a computationally attractive alternative to perform conditional generation since this allows flexible reuse of a pretrained diffusion model for different class-definitions by separately training a small classifier model. We also note that computing classifier-gradients is slower for DA-classifiers as compared to noisy classifiers since it requires backpropagating through the score-network and shares this limitation with other recent works that utilize intermediate denoised examples for guidance (e.g., Bansal et al. [3], Chung et al. [10, 11], Ho et al. [26]) \u2013 the recent advances in efficient diffusion sampling could be extended to class-conditional sampling to reduce the gap.

The evaluation of classifiers on Imagenet-C, Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S using DE and Default evaluation modes are fairly fast. However, generating DDA examples for the entire Imagenet-C dataset and Imagenet-test dataset is computationally expensive and takes up to a week (even while using 8 GPUs in parallel) and also requires sufficient storage capacity to save the DDA-transformed images. Likewise, evaluation of certified accuracy with DDS is also computationally expensive since it uses 10k noise samples per example to estimate the certified radius and prediction. Training CIFAR10 guidance classifiers are fairly efficient while finetuning the Imagenet guidance classifier can take up to 3 days depending on the gradient accumulation parameter (i.e., number of GPUs available) \u2013 when available, we used a maximum of 4 GPUs.

Improvements in classifier-guided diffusion can be used in developing a myriad downstream applications, each with their own potential balance of positive and negative impacts.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
