Existing methods that directly align visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.  Prompt learning offers an alternative, but existing approaches often lead to poor performance on unseen classes. \nThis paper introduces EZ-HOI, an efficient framework addressing these issues. EZ-HOI uses a novel prompt learning approach guided by LLMs and VLMs. It leverages information from related seen classes to learn effective prompts for unseen classes, minimizing overfitting.  The results demonstrate that EZ-HOI achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, showing improved efficiency and effectiveness in zero-shot HOI detection.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "R1Rrb2d5BH/podcast.wav"}
