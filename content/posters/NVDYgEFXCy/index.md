### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many existing second-order methods for solving minimax optimization problems require either a line search or solving auxiliary subproblems, which limits their applicability.  Additionally, most methods rely heavily on knowing the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian. These requirements can significantly impact both efficiency and practical use. 

This paper introduces adaptive second-order optimistic methods that cleverly address these issues. The proposed methods use a recursive, adaptive step size definition, eliminating the need for line search entirely.  Further, a parameter-free variant is developed that eliminates the need for the Hessian's Lipschitz constant, making these methods both efficient and widely applicable.  The paper rigorously analyzes the proposed methods demonstrating that they achieve optimal convergence rates.  Experimental results showcase superior performance compared to existing approaches.

### In-depth insights


#### Adaptive Minimax
Adaptive minimax methods represent a significant advancement in optimization, addressing the challenges of solving minimax problems where the objective function is not fully known or changes over time.  **Adaptivity** is crucial because it allows the algorithm to adjust its strategy based on the observed behavior of the function, leading to faster convergence and improved robustness.  Unlike traditional minimax methods that rely on fixed parameters or strong assumptions, adaptive approaches dynamically adjust parameters such as step sizes and regularization terms, making them better suited for complex, real-world scenarios.  **Optimal convergence rates** are a key feature, signifying that these algorithms are theoretically efficient; however, the practical performance is highly dependent on proper parameter tuning and careful implementation.  The core ideas often involve recursively updating step sizes based on gradient information, prediction errors, or local curvature estimates.  **Parameter-free versions**, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of problem parameters such as Lipschitz constants, are particularly desirable for practical applications.  Challenges in adaptive minimax optimization include balancing exploration and exploitation, maintaining stability while adapting rapidly to change, and ensuring the algorithms remain efficient and robust across a wider range of problems.

#### Optimal Second-Order
The concept of "Optimal Second-Order" methods in optimization signifies algorithms that leverage second-order derivative information (Hessian matrix) to achieve the best possible convergence rate for a given problem class.  **Optimality**, in this context, often refers to achieving a theoretical lower bound on the number of iterations required to reach a solution within a specified tolerance.  Second-order methods generally outperform first-order methods (which only use gradients) in terms of convergence speed, particularly for well-conditioned problems, but they come at the cost of higher computational complexity per iteration.  **Adaptivity** is often a desirable feature, allowing the algorithm to adjust its step size or other parameters based on the problem's characteristics, thus improving robustness and efficiency. Line search procedures are frequently employed but add computational overhead and can be problematic.  **Parameter-free** methods represent an ideal scenario, requiring no prior knowledge of problem-specific parameters (like Lipschitz constants), making them more readily applicable in real-world scenarios. The research area focuses on designing algorithms that gracefully balance optimality, adaptivity, and computational efficiency to provide practical and effective solutions for various min-max or saddle point problems.

#### Line Search-Free
The concept of 'Line Search-Free' in optimization algorithms is significant because line searches, while ensuring convergence, often add computational overhead.  **Eliminating the line search simplifies the algorithm's update rule**, making it more computationally efficient, especially in high-dimensional spaces. This is particularly crucial for second-order methods, where line searches are computationally more expensive.  **The trade-off lies in finding a suitable adaptive step size that guarantees convergence without the line search's guarantees.**  The success of a line search-free method hinges on the robustness of its step-size selection mechanism, which must be adaptive and accurately reflect the local curvature of the objective function to achieve optimal convergence rates.  **A well-designed adaptive step size is paramount for the practicality and efficiency of these algorithms.** While theoretical guarantees are important, the practicality of line search-free methods needs to be demonstrated empirically, which involves careful evaluation across a range of problem instances and dimensions.

#### Parameter-Free
The concept of a "Parameter-Free" method in optimization is appealing due to its potential to **reduce the reliance on hand-tuning hyperparameters** which are often problem-specific and require extensive experimentation.  A parameter-free approach promises **greater ease of use and broader applicability** across diverse problems.  The absence of pre-defined parameters shifts the challenge from tuning to designing an algorithm that adapts effectively to the problem's inherent characteristics, relying instead on data-driven mechanisms for adaptation.  However, achieving this adaptive behavior can introduce complexities.  **Robustness becomes paramount**, as the method needs to reliably handle various problem instances without manual intervention, requiring rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence and stability. The tradeoff between parameter-free simplicity and adaptive complexity needs careful consideration.   Parameter-free optimizers often use more sophisticated mechanisms, such as recursive step size updates that locally estimate problem-specific quantities, potentially leading to more computationally expensive iterations, although this could be offset by reduced tuning time. Therefore, the true efficacy of parameter-free optimization is context-dependent and should be assessed carefully.

#### Hessian Lipschitz
The concept of "Hessian Lipschitz" in optimization refers to the Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian matrix of a function.  **This property implies a bound on the change in the curvature of the function**, ensuring that the second derivatives do not vary too wildly. This is crucial in many second-order optimization algorithms, such as those based on Newton's method or its variants, because it **guarantees convergence properties and allows for step size selection**. In the context of minimax optimization, where the objective function is often non-convex-non-concave,  Hessian Lipschitz conditions are usually applied to either the individual components of the objective function (convex and concave parts) or the operator derived from the objective function.  The **Lipschitz constant itself quantifies the smoothness of the Hessian**, and its value is critical in determining convergence rates and choosing appropriate step sizes in iterative algorithms. Algorithms that assume Hessian Lipschitz continuity often have better theoretical convergence properties but are sensitive to the accuracy of the Lipschitz constant estimate.  **Adaptive schemes that attempt to locally estimate or track the Lipschitz constant can be more robust in practice**, but might require additional assumptions (e.g., Lipschitz continuous gradient). Therefore, the presence and careful consideration of the Hessian Lipschitz assumption are fundamental in creating efficient and provably convergent second-order methods for both convex and non-convex optimization problems.
