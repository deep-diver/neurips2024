Traditional methods like Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are slow, particularly for systems with multiple metastable states separated by high energy barriers. This makes studying such systems, crucial in drug discovery and materials science, challenging.  Boltzmann Generators (BGs) have emerged to address this, using machine learning to learn a transformation from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution.  However, existing BGs lack transferability, requiring retraining for each molecule. \nThis work introduces the first transferable Boltzmann Generator (TBG). The TBG learns a transformation that generalizes well to unseen molecules.  **It uses continuous normalizing flows, trained using flow matching**, a simulation-free method. The TBG is evaluated on dipeptides, showcasing its ability to generate unbiased samples of unseen molecules.  Furthermore, **the TBG improves the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecules.** Ablation studies reveal its efficiency even with limited training data.", "affiliation": "Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "AYq6GxxrrY/podcast.wav"}
