Methods in top / bottom accept 4 views with shaded / shaded&albedo color channels.", "description": "This table presents the results of a four-view reconstruction experiment evaluating the accuracy of physically-based rendering (PBR) material prediction.  It compares different model variations of MetalLRM, assessing the performance of albedo, metalness, and roughness prediction using LPIPS (lower is better) and PSNR (higher is better) metrics. The table shows the impact of adding material prediction, deferred shading loss, and texture refinement to the baseline model (LightplaneLRM with SDF).  The top section uses models trained with shaded images, while the bottom section uses models trained with both shaded and albedo images.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "M3BIsgGQNb/tables/tables_5_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Win-rate of AssetGen in text-to-3D user study evaluating visual quality and the alignment between the prompt and the generated meshes.

The study evaluates two key aspects: visual quality and the alignment of the generated 3D models with the text prompts used to generate them. The results show that Meta 3D AssetGen significantly outperforms other methods in both visual quality and text fidelity, achieving a win-rate of over 70% against the best competitors within a 30-second time limit.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "M3BIsgGQNb/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Four-view reconstruction on GSO comparing the appearance and geometry of MetaILRM (outputting baked-light texture) to baselines (top) and ablations (bottom).
