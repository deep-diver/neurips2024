Existing methods often rely on hand-picked kernels, which may not be optimal for specific datasets and downstream tasks. This limits the effectiveness and generalizability of distribution regression models. \nThis paper tackles this issue by proposing a novel unsupervised method for learning data-dependent distribution kernels. The method leverages entropy maximization in the embedding space of probability measures, which helps learn kernels adapted to specific data characteristics.  Experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate its superiority over traditional approaches and opens up avenues for advanced kernel learning in various fields.", "affiliation": "Dipartimento di Matematica, Universit\n\ngli Studi di Genova", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "A0cok1GK9c/podcast.wav"}
