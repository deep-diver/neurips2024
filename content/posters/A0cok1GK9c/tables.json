The models compared include various kernel methods (GMM-FV, SW1, SW2, MMD with different kernels), a distributional variance baseline, and the proposed MDKE method with and without regularization.  The results demonstrate the superior performance of MDKE, especially with regularization, across both datasets.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
