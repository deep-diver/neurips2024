However, real-world data often violates this assumption, resulting in distribution discrepancies between training and test datasets.  Measuring this discrepancy is crucial for assessing the generalization ability of a model, especially when test labels are unavailable, a common situation in practice.  Existing methods often struggle with this label unavailability, hindering accurate evaluation.\nTo address this, the authors introduce Importance Divergence (I-Div). I-Div cleverly transfers sampling patterns from the test distribution to the training distribution by estimating density and likelihood ratios, using only the training data.  The density ratio is estimated via Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization, informed by the selected hypothesis, while the likelihood ratio is adjusted to reduce generalization error.  Experiments across various datasets and complex scenarios validate I-Div's high accuracy in quantifying distribution discrepancy, confirming its effectiveness for hypothesis applicability evaluation without test labels. **This provides a significant advancement in evaluating model generalization capabilities in practical scenarios.**", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Macquarie University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "bnzeOG0yey/podcast.wav"}
