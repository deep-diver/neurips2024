The left side shows how NLP methods like single character, character N-grams, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) have been directly applied to DNA, but these methods have limitations due to the unique characteristics of DNA sequences. The right side presents the ideal properties of a genomic tokenizer as meaningful segments, allowing for discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous tokens, reflecting the complex and varied nature of DNA. The figure highlights that MxDNA aims to achieve these ideal properties for genomic sequence tokenization.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "AQ1umQL7dZ/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Our proposed MxDNA.

MxDNA's adaptive approach, shown in two forward passes, demonstrates its ability to identify and assemble meaningful units that may be discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous. In contrast, the rule-based methods show more rigid and potentially less biologically meaningful segmentations.

The top panel shows the distribution of token lengths using BPE across four different genomic datasets (Histone Marker, Enhancer, Promoter, Splice Site).
