However, the optimal estimation rate for HSIC remained unknown for nearly two decades, hindering the development of efficient and reliable algorithms. This paper addresses this critical issue.\nThis research establishes the minimax lower bound for HSIC estimation, proving that the existing estimators, such as U-statistic, V-statistic, and Nystr\u00f6m-based ones, achieve the optimal rate of O(n\u207b\u00b9/\u00b2). This finding settles a long-standing open problem, confirming the efficiency of commonly used methods.  Moreover, the results extend to estimating cross-covariance operators, providing a more solid theoretical foundation for applications using HSIC.", "affiliation": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "KyNO0n1bJ9/podcast.wav"}
