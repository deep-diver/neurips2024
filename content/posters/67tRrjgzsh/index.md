### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but their performance is not solely determined by scale.  **Existing research primarily focuses on scaling up models, ignoring the significant influence of architecture.**  A notable issue is the decline in base capabilities observed in certain architectures like FFN-Wider Transformers, despite comparable pre-training performance to standard models.  This highlights a gap in our understanding of how architecture impacts PLMs' effectiveness.

This paper investigates the architectural influence on PLMs' base capabilities.  **It introduces a novel Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) designed to address the performance drop in FFN-Wider Transformers.** By analyzing the contribution ratio of different layers, the researchers identified Multi-Head Attention (MHA) as a critical component affecting base capabilities.  CEA successfully improves the base capabilities by enhancing the MHA layer's contribution.  Moreover, the effectiveness of CEA is demonstrated by applying it to Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers, showing substantial performance improvements. This work provides critical insights into architectural design for PLMs.

### In-depth insights


#### Arch. Impact on LMs
The architectural impact on Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical area of research, as it directly influences their capabilities.  **Scale isn't the only factor determining performance**:  While increased scale often leads to better results, the underlying architecture significantly shapes how well an LLM utilizes its size and training data. The study of architectural impact on LMs goes beyond simply modifying existing structures; it delves into **understanding how design choices affect the contribution of different model components**.  This involves analyzing the interplay of components like Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), specifically examining their respective roles in language modeling (combination vs. transformation) and how modifications like wider FFNs unexpectedly decrease base capabilities.  Ultimately, a key finding is that **architectures must carefully balance the interplay of combination and transformation functions** to optimize the base capabilities of LLMs.

#### FFN-Wider Analysis
An FFN-Wider analysis would delve into the impact of increasing the feed-forward network (FFN) layer's width in transformer-based language models.  A key question is whether this architectural change improves model performance, and if so, under what conditions.  **Wider FFNs might enhance the model's capacity to process complex information**, but this advantage may be offset by other factors.  The analysis would likely investigate the trade-off between increased computational cost and potential performance gains.  A crucial aspect would be to examine how wider FFNs affect the interaction between FFNs and the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, perhaps revealing a shift in their contribution ratios to the overall model's capability. **The study should carefully consider whether increased FFN width improves in-distribution or out-of-distribution performance**, and it should also address the effects on downstream tasks to get a complete picture of the impact. The findings will help researchers understand the role of FFN width in base capabilities and guide the design of more efficient and powerful transformer architectures. Ultimately, the analysis aims to determine if and when increasing FFN width is a beneficial architectural modification.

#### CEA: Comb. Enhance
The heading 'CEA: Comb. Enhance' likely refers to a proposed Combination Enhanced Architecture within a research paper on pre-trained language models.  The core idea revolves around **improving base capabilities** of such models by carefully adjusting the contribution ratio between transformation and combination functions within the model's architecture.  Standard Transformer models use feed-forward networks (FFNs) for transformation and multi-head attention (MHA) for combination; this method likely seeks to improve the balance, potentially mitigating performance drops seen when using FFNs.  A key insight is that MHA acts as a combination function, capturing the inter-relationship of word tokens, whereas FFNs perform isolated transformations.  By strategically enhancing the combination function (likely through modifications to the MHA), the CEA architecture aims to **improve generalization and few-shot learning** abilities‚Äîimportant aspects of base capabilities. This approach highlights that focusing solely on scale (model size) may overlook crucial architectural considerations in pre-trained language model optimization.

#### MoE Extension & CEA
The section 'MoE Extension & CEA' would logically delve into adapting the Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models.  Given CEA's success in mitigating the negative impact of wider FFN layers by adjusting the contribution ratio of combination and transformation functions, its extension to MoE would be a significant step. **The core challenge lies in how the CEA's principles translate into the MoE framework**, where gating networks determine expert activation. The analysis would likely explore how the gating mechanism might interfere with or complement the intended effects of CEA.  **Successfully applying CEA to MoE would demonstrate its generalizability and broad applicability**, potentially highlighting the fundamental role of balancing combination and transformation in achieving strong base capabilities across diverse model architectures. The experimental results would be crucial, showcasing whether CEA-enhanced MoE models outperform standard MoE models in various downstream tasks while maintaining efficiency.  **A key finding might be an optimal balance between the number of experts activated and the contribution ratio adjustments made by CEA**, demonstrating that the architecture improvement offered by CEA transcends specific model designs and is potentially beneficial for various architectures which struggle with similar balance issues.

#### Future Work & Limits
Future work could explore applying the Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) to other large language model (LLM) architectures beyond FFN-Wider and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and investigate its impact on various downstream tasks.  **A critical limitation** is the current study's focus on models using language modeling as the sole pre-training objective; future research should explore LLMs with different pre-training tasks and objectives to broaden the applicability and robustness of the findings.  **Another limitation** involves the scale of models investigated, which were relatively small compared to the largest models; replicating this research with even larger models would be valuable. Finally, **a deeper investigation** into the interplay between architecture and model scaling laws is needed.  While the current work highlights architectural effects, a unified understanding of how these effects interact with scaling laws is crucial for optimal LLM design.

The x-axis represents different models (BERT and GPT with different hidden dimensions, H=128 and H=768). The y-axis shows the percentage of the total accuracy increase attributed to the FFN layer. The bars are grouped in pairs: vanilla models (blue) and FFN-Wider models (orange).  The figure illustrates that the FFN-Wider models consistently have a higher FFN contribution ratio than their vanilla counterparts. This supports the hypothesis that widening the FFN layer disproportionately increases its contribution, potentially at the expense of the MHA (Multi-Head Attention) layer's contribution and the model's overall base capabilities.

A direct pathway within the MHA bypasses the Inner-FFN, allowing for a controlled adjustment of the contribution ratio of each function, ultimately revealing how this balance impacts model performance.
