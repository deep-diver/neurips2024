Lower approximation ratios indicate better fairness guarantees.  The table shows that FJR is always achievable (approximation ratio of 1), while core approximation is more challenging, with ratios varying according to the loss function.  The table also notes the time complexity of achieving the approximation bounds (polytime denotes polynomial time).", "section": "1.1 Our Contributions"}, {"figure_path": "Actjv6Wect/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The feasible core and FJR approximation guarantees, both existentially and in polynomial time. In each case, we can obtain a better FJR approximation than the core approximation.", "description": "The table summarizes the approximation ratios achievable for the core and FJR fairness criteria in non-centroid clustering under different loss functions.  Lower approximation ratios indicate better results, with 1 being optimal. The table shows results for both existential guarantees (meaning a solution exists) and polynomial-time guarantees (meaning an efficient algorithm can find a solution).  It highlights that FJR is generally easier to satisfy than the core, especially for arbitrary loss functions, and that efficient algorithms can often approximate FJR with reasonable performance.", "section": "1.1 Our Contributions"}]
