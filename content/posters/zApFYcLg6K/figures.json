The horizontal axis represents the value of the local H\u00e1jek projection \u0125(i) and the vertical axis represents the weight wt(i) assigned to each index i.  The weight is 1 for values of \u0125(i) within a certain range around the empirical mean An. As \u0125(i) moves outside this central range, the weight linearly decreases to 0. The intervals where the weight is 1 and the intervals where the weight transitions to 0 are labeled, showing their dependence on the parameters \u03be, C, L, and n.", "section": "A.5.1 Proof of Theorem 4"}]
