However, applying this to private data, where individual datapoints' privacy must be preserved, has been largely ignored. Directly applying existing private mean estimation algorithms to this problem leads to suboptimal results. \nThis paper focuses on improving private U-statistic estimation. The authors propose a novel thresholding-based approach that leverages local H\u00e1jek projections to reweight data subsets. Their new algorithm achieves nearly optimal private error for non-degenerate U-statistics and shows strong evidence of near-optimality for degenerate cases, which greatly improves upon existing methods.  This is demonstrated through lower bounds and applications to uniformity testing and sparse network analysis.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "zApFYcLg6K/podcast.wav"}
