Existing event-based vision models often lack efficiency and struggle with temporal modeling. This paper introduces Parametric Piecewise Linear Networks (PPLNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms, to address these limitations.\n\nPPLNs use piecewise linear functions to represent neural membrane potential, enabling efficient temporal modeling.  Experiments show that PPLNs achieve state-of-the-art results in motion deblurring, steering prediction, and human pose estimation, outperforming existing methods in both event-based and frame-based settings.  **The key is its bio-inspired design and efficient use of learnable parameters**.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "S8wFXyT4dY/podcast.wav"}
