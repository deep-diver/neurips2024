### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Autonomous driving demands real-time perception, promptly reacting to environmental changes.  However, existing stereo-based 3D object detection methods struggle with high computational costs, leading to significant latency and reduced accuracy, especially in the context of 'streaming perception' which considers both accuracy and latency. This misalignment between predictions and real-time changes hinders performance.

This paper introduces StreamDSGN, an end-to-end framework directly predicting the next moment's 3D object properties using historical information.  To boost accuracy, StreamDSGN employs three key strategies:  a feature-flow based fusion to solve misalignment, an extra regression loss for object motion consistency, and a large kernel backbone for capturing long-range context.  Extensive testing on the KITTI Tracking dataset showcases a substantial improvement in streaming average precision (up to 4.33%), proving the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

> The figure illustrates the challenges of real-time online streaming perception.  The left shows stereo images at time t. These are fed to a processing unit (CPU), which takes a time Œît to compute. During this computation time Œît, the real-world scene changes (right side).  The predictions made at time t based on the input at time t (bottom left) are misaligned with the actual scene at time t+Œît because of the computation delay. The misalignment is clearly shown for vehicles and pedestrians.

### In-depth insights


#### Stream Perception
Stream perception represents a paradigm shift in computer vision, moving away from the traditional offline paradigm to one that prioritizes **real-time processing** and **latency considerations**. Unlike offline methods, which process entire videos or long sequences, stream perception focuses on timely prediction of the next frame based on current and past information.  This requires frameworks to efficiently process data and make predictions with minimal delay, as accuracy degrades significantly with increasing latency. The key challenge lies in balancing accuracy and latency, as high-accuracy models often have high computational costs. This necessitates the design of models and algorithms specifically optimized for speed and efficient utilization of historical context, while simultaneously maintaining high accuracy. The emergence of this field signifies a growing need for perception systems capable of responding promptly to dynamic environments, particularly important in autonomous driving and robotics.

#### Stereo 3D Object Detection
Stereo 3D object detection is a crucial technology for various applications, particularly autonomous driving and robotics.  **It aims to identify and locate objects in three-dimensional space using two images from slightly different viewpoints**. This approach leverages the principles of binocular vision, mimicking human depth perception.  Existing methods are typically categorized into 2D detection-based, pseudo-LiDAR-based, and geometric-volume-based approaches. 2D methods first detect objects in 2D images and then estimate their 3D properties. Pseudo-LiDAR methods generate a depth map from stereo images resembling LiDAR point clouds before performing 3D object detection.  **Geometric-volume-based methods directly learn 3D representations from stereo data**, which can be more accurate but often computationally expensive.  Recent advancements have focused on enhancing efficiency and accuracy by incorporating deep learning architectures, exploring novel feature fusion techniques, and refining the use of geometric constraints.  **A key challenge remains balancing accuracy and real-time performance**, especially in applications demanding swift responses. Future research will likely concentrate on improving computational efficiency, handling challenging scenarios (occlusion, varying lighting), and robustly integrating data from other sensors for enhanced reliability.

#### Feature Flow Fusion
Feature Flow Fusion (FFF) is a crucial technique for addressing the **misalignment problem** in streaming perception.  It cleverly leverages optical flow principles to warp current features to align with the ground truth of the *next* frame. This ingenious approach overcomes the temporal discrepancies caused by processing delays in real-time systems.  Instead of directly comparing the current frame's features to the future ground truth, FFF **predicts the feature flow** between consecutive frames, effectively bridging the temporal gap and enabling accurate comparison. By utilizing this warped or pseudo-next feature, the model can better learn to map current observations to future states, improving the accuracy of predictions in streaming video perception applications. The method is particularly important for moving objects, as their displacement becomes significant over time, exacerbating the misalignment issue.  FFF's ability to **effectively align features** irrespective of object velocity represents a key enhancement for accurate and reliable streaming perception models.

#### Motion Consistency
Motion consistency, in the context of video analysis and autonomous driving, is crucial for robust and reliable 3D object detection.  It refers to the **accurate prediction of object movement** across consecutive frames, maintaining the consistency of object trajectories over time.  Inaccuracies in motion prediction lead to misalignments between predicted object locations and ground truth, negatively impacting detection accuracy, particularly for high-speed objects or those undergoing complex maneuvers.  Strategies to enforce motion consistency, like those described in the paper, typically involve **incorporating temporal information** and object tracking techniques, explicitly modeling object motion dynamics to enhance prediction accuracy. **Explicit loss functions** that penalize inconsistencies in predicted trajectories further improve the model's ability to learn and maintain accurate motion estimations.  Successfully handling motion consistency requires considering various factors like object speed, occlusion, and the sensor's limitations.  Therefore, designing efficient and robust methods is key to the advancement of real-time 3D object detection for autonomous systems.

#### Future Work
The paper's conclusion mentions several avenues for future research.  One key area is improving the robustness of the Feature-Flow Fusion (FFF) method, particularly when dealing with occluded or truncated objects. The current approach uses a simple integration of historical features, which is a limitation.  **Future work should explore the use of neural networks to directly predict the flow of dynamic foreground objects**, which could significantly enhance accuracy in challenging scenarios. Another important direction is extending the methodology beyond stereo-based 3D object detection to encompass multi-view camera systems.  This would require adapting the BEV representation to accommodate data from multiple perspectives.  **Finally, more extensive research is needed to address the potential challenges in real-world deployment and edge cases**. While the current framework is designed for real-time performance, rigorously testing its capabilities in diverse and unexpected scenarios is crucial.  Furthermore, investigating the broader impacts of real-time streaming 3D object detection, including potential safety and privacy implications, would be valuable.

> This figure illustrates the process of generating pseudo-next features using Feature-Flow Fusion (FFF).  It starts with two feature maps, Ft and Ft-1, representing features from the current and previous frames, respectively.  The FFF method computes a similarity volume by shifting Ft-1 relative to Ft and calculating the similarity at each shift.  The flow map Ft‚Üít‚àí1 is then obtained by finding the maximum similarity for each pixel in Ft. This flow map indicates the displacement of features between frames. Using this flow map, the current frame's features (Ft) are warped to align with the ground truth of the next frame (t+1) using an inverse warping operation. The resulting warped features are referred to as pseudo-next features (Fpseudo t+1) which are then used in conjunction with historical features.
