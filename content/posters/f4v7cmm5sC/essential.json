Current methods often struggle with sparse or noisy observations, and their parameters are highly dataset-specific, limiting generalizability. This hinders efficient analysis of diverse dynamic systems across various scientific fields. \nThis research introduces a **novel methodology** for zero-shot inference of MJPs, addressing these limitations. Using a pretrained neural recognition model and a synthetic training dataset covering a wide range of MJPs and noise levels, the researchers successfully infer hidden MJPs from various real-world datasets with **zero-shot learning**.  The model matches or even surpasses state-of-the-art performance on these datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and broad applicability.", "affiliation": "Fraunhofer IAIS", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "f4v7cmm5sC/podcast.wav"}
