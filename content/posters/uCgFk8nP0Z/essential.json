However, data is often scattered across multiple owners, making aggregation challenging.  This paper tackles the \"dataset valuation\" problem\u2014how to fairly compensate data owners for their contributions to a joint machine learning project.  The Shapley value, a game-theoretic concept, provides a theoretically sound solution but is computationally expensive to calculate. Existing approximations are often computationally costly.\nThis research introduces DU-Shapley, a novel approximation method that significantly improves efficiency.  It leverages the inherent structure of dataset valuation to reduce the number of calculations needed. The method is proven theoretically sound with asymptotic and non-asymptotic guarantees.  Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate DU-Shapley's significantly superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational speed compared to existing methods.  This makes it a practical tool for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Inria", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "uCgFk8nP0Z/podcast.wav"}
