Based on CLIP, recent methods design various learnable prompts to evaluate the zero-shot generalization capability on a base-to-novel setting. This setting assumes test samples are already divided into either base or novel classes, limiting its application to realistic scenarios. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging and practical setting: generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), i.e., testing with no information about the base/novel division. To address this challenging zero-shot problem, we introduce two unique designs that enable us to classify an image without the need of knowing whether it comes from seen or unseen classes. Firstly, most existing methods only adopt a single latent space to align visual and linguistic features, which has a limited ability to represent complex visual-linguistic patterns, especially for fine-grained tasks. Instead, we propose a dual-space feature alignment module that effectively augments the latent space with a novel attribute space induced by a well-devised attribute reservoir. In particular, the attribute reservoir consists of a static vocabulary and learnable tokens complementing each other for flexible control over feature granularity. Secondly, finetuning CLIP models (e.g., prompt learning) on seen base classes usually sacrifices the model\u2019s original generalization capability on unseen novel classes. To mitigate this issue, we present a new topology-preserving objective that can enforce feature topology structures of the combined base and novel classes to resemble the topology of CLIP. In this manner, our model will inherit the generalization ability of CLIP through maintaining the pairwise class angles in the attribute space.

This can be done by aligning the visual features and textual descriptors into a shared latent space, where the intrinsic visual-linguistic relationship is extracted for zero-shot classification at test time.

Several methods [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 16, 24] seek to learn a latent space where visual and linguistic data are aligned and the inference is performed by searching which class has the highest similarity score.

The bias arises because the model is only trained on seen classes and, therefore, learns features and patterns specific to those classes. This phenomenon often leads to inferior performance on unseen classes in the GZSL evaluation setting. For VLM methods such as prompt learning [8, 10, 11], although the model weights are frozen, another problem called weak generalizability problem is observed [8]: the learned prompt is not generalizable to unseen classes within the same dataset. A reasonable explanation is the learned task-specific prompt overftis the seen base classes when finetuing VLMs. CoCoOP [8] try to alleviate this problem by using instance-conditioned prompt, but the evaluation is only in the base-to-novel setting rather than the more challenging GZSL setting 4.

For example, we can constrain the rank of image features to be no-decreasing, which boils down to maximizing the nuclear norm of the feature matrix [50]. However, this method empirically proves less effective. Then, we observe that the pre-trained VLMs such as CLIP perform equally well on both seen and unseen classes (Fig. 1 and also [8, 10, 11]). This motivates us to inherit the generalization capability of CLIP to prevent overfitting to seen classes during the finetuning process, as shown in Fig. 1(b-d).

First, a reservoir containing both static and learnable vocabulary tokens is devised to construct a representative attribute space to enhance the latent space, which facilitates the exploitation of complex and fine-grained visuallinguistic patterns. Second, we propose a topology-preserving objective, which inherits the good generalization ability of CLIP to mitigate the weak generalization problem of prompt learning methods. In particular, topology-preserving objective constrains the variations of angles between pairwise categories before and after CLIP finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on twelve object recognition datasets, validating the superior performance of our method in the challenging and more practical GZSL setting. In the future, we want to investigate TPR on other applications such as few-shot learning and other modalities such as video.
