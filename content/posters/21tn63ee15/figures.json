It is divided into two main phases: Database Construction and Location Prediction. The Database Construction phase involves Geo-alignment, a process of aligning image representations with textual geographical descriptions and GPS coordinates to capture fine-grained location-aware semantics. The resulting image representations are then stored in a database. The Location Prediction phase consists of three steps: Image Vectorization, Geo-diversification, and Geo-verification. Image Vectorization creates vector representations of the query image. Geo-diversification enhances the robustness of prediction by using multiple prompts with varying numbers of reference GPS coordinates.  Geo-verification combines both retrieved and generated GPS candidates to select the best prediction.  The figure also shows the text prompts used within the RAG process.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "21tn63ee15/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Varying the number of RAG prompts on IM2GPS3K.", "description": "This figure shows the impact of varying the number of RAG prompts on the accuracy of geolocalization at different geographical granularities (street, city, region, country, continent).

The x-axis represents the number of candidates, and the y-axis represents the accuracy.  The results show an initial increase in accuracy as the number of candidates increases, indicating the benefit of exploring a wider range of possibilities. However, beyond a certain point, increasing the number of candidates leads to diminishing returns and even a decrease in accuracy, suggesting that the additional candidates introduce noise that outweighs the potential benefits.

The framework is composed of two main phases: database construction and location prediction.

The location prediction phase involves retrieving images from the database, generating diverse GPS coordinate candidates using a prompt ensembling method (Geo-diversification), and finally selecting the best coordinates through a verification process (Geo-verification) that combines retrieved and generated candidates.
