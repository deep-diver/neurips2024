In this paper, we discuss its role as a reduction of the larger loss landscape derived from Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM).

Teaching recognized as a pervasive mechanism for disseminating knowledge within human society, has found extensive application in contemporary deep learning methodologies.

Recent investigations into pedagogy have illuminated the integration of large language models and multi-agent systems into educational frameworks. This novel approach emphasizes the significance of understanding interactions among multiple clients and agents. Multi-agent systems, anchored in language models, orchestrate the accomplishment of intricate tasks by assigning specific roles and prescribing behavioral norms to individual agents [18, 37].

While SAM operates on a single network, it necessitates the computation of two separate gradients at distinct locations. In this case, the initial step involves identifying the sharpest points within a specified range of data proportions within the loss landscape.

In this paper, we initially ascertain that interactive teaching effectively diminishes the loss landscape by strategically discarding a specific subset of high-loss data points.

Such an approach may be construed as a prior induction of bias, strategically acknowledging the presence of noise within the training dataset. Subsequently, we advance the conceptualization of interactive teaching as an EM-iterative parameter estimation technique, drawing upon seminal work by Dempster et al. [9]. The method\u2019s convergence is predicated upon the continual refinement of the lower bound of maximum likelihood estimation. This refinement targets the expectation of the noise posterior distribution pertaining to latent variables, enacted via a relaxation of inequalities.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
