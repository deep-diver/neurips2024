Existing theoretical analyses often rely on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, which assumes an overparameterized network and simplifies the training process.  However, **this simplification breaks down for nonlinear PDEs, where the NTK's properties change significantly during training.** This leads to issues like slow convergence and spectral bias, hindering the performance of PINNs. \nThis research delves into the theoretical differences between training PINNs for linear versus nonlinear PDEs.  The authors demonstrate that **the NTK framework is inadequate for nonlinear PDEs due to the stochastic nature of the kernel at initialization, its dynamic behavior during training, and the non-vanishing Hessian.**  To overcome these limitations, they propose and thoroughly analyze using second-order optimization methods. Their theoretical results, backed by numerical experiments on various linear and nonlinear PDEs, show **substantial performance improvements over first-order methods, particularly in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.**", "affiliation": "BMW AG", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "FY6vPtITtE/podcast.wav"}
