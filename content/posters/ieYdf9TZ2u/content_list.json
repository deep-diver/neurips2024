A common understanding of diffusion models is that they first restore global concepts before local details [19]. This motivates us to design a time-aware strategy to benefit from different approaches at different denoising steps \u2013 using position interpolation in the early stages of denoising to ensure the overall structure and gradually shifting to NTK-Aware Scaled RoPE to preserve local details.

To approximate the local truncation error $\\tau_{t_{i}}$ at time $t_{i}$ , we estimate the ground truth sample ${\\bf x}_{t_{i+1}}$ by running a large number of Euler steps from $t_{i}$ to $t_{i+1}$ with uniform intervals and compute the discretization error as $\\tau_{t_{i}}=\\mathbf{x}_{t_{i+1}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t_{i+1}}$ . In addition, since the flow model builds linear interpolation between noise and data and predicts the constant velocity field, it is natural to use the curvature to describe local errors on the trajectory, i.e., the straighter the trajectory, the smaller the discretization error. Following [60], we compute the second-order derivative to estimate the local curvature of each step as $\\kappa_{t_{i}}=\\mathbf{x}_{t_{i}}-(\\mathbf{x}_{t_{i+1}}+\\mathbf{x}_{t_{i-1}})\\times0.5$ . The average L2-norm of discretization error $\\tau_{t_{i}}$ and curvature $\\kappa_{t_{i}}$ are visualized in Figure 4. Our analysis reveals that discretization errors are much larger when $t$ is near pure noise $t=0,$ ) and are relatively larger near clean data $\\left(t=1\\right)$ ), compared to intermediate timesteps. This observation contradicts the findings in diffusion models, where EDM [42] discover the discretization errors monotonically increase as samples get closer to clean data. Hence, diffusion schedules like EDM are not ideal for flow-based models.

It is also compatible with advanced solvers applicable to flow models, which can unleash its full potential. However, limited work has explored the use of higher-order solvers for solving the Flow ODE. Unlike the Probability Flow ODE [75] in diffusion models, which has a semi-linear structure, the Flow ODE derived from the continuity equation is in a simpler form of ${\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}=$ $\\mathbf{v}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{t},t)$ . This simplicity allows for the direct use of existing higher-order ODE solvers, such as the traditional explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) methods in the form of $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\mathbf{x}_{s}+\\int_{s}^{t}\\mathbf{v}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\tau},\\tau)\\mathrm{d}\\tau}\\end{array}$ , where the $n$ -th order solver ensembles $n$ intermediate steps between $[s,t]$ to reduce the approximation errors. During sampling, explicit RK family solvers also need to specify the timesteps $\\{t_{0},t_{1},...,t_{N}\\}$ in advance and adopt the uniform intervals as default. Thus, our improved schedules, such as the rational or sigmoid schedule, can be directly applied to these higher-order solvers.

Among various inferencetime acceleration methods, Token Merging (ToMe) [9] is a simple yet effective approach that merges similarly visual tokens to reduce redundancy in attention blocks, thereby speeding up inference for image classification. Although ToMe has been successfully applied to diffusion U-Net [10, 73], we find that a straightforward application of ToMe to Next-DiT, a purely transformer-based diffusion model, completely fails to produce satisfactory images. We hypothesize that performing the original token merging in all transformer layers across all diffusion steps is clearly unsuitable for the task of generative modeling with diffusion transformers. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "To bridge this gap, we propose Time-Aware Context Drop, an optimized method to drop redundant visual tokens during inference for Next-DiT. First, the original bipartite soft matching in ToMe not only introduces additional complexity but also contradicts the design of 3D RoPE in Next-DiT. Therefore, we replace this complex token partitioning strategy in ToMe with a simple average pooling for downsampling, aligning with the spatial prior introduced in 3D RoPE. Similar to [73], we find that applying the merge-and-unmerge operation to all queries, keys, and values greatly undermines the quality of generated images as this strategy is designed for visual recognition. To preserve the complete visual content, we only perform average pooling on keys and values for downsampling. Finally, considering the time-awareness in diffusion models, we perform token dropping for all layers at $t=0$ to enhance efficiency and gradually transform to no token dropping at $t=1$ to maintain visual quality. The Context Drop without time-awareness is similar to the key-value (KV) token compression in PixArt- $\\Sigma$ [14], which merges KV tokens in spatial space using $2\\times2$ convolution to reduce complexity. However, unlike their fine-tuning methods, Context Drop is a training-free technique with an adaptive compression rate that aligns with the diffusion time schedule.

Such choices took advantage of pretrained text encoders or multimodal aligned text encoders as good representations for textconditional image synthesis. However, employing T5 and CLIP as text embedding shows limited effectiveness in handling multilingual prompts. Different from those approaches, the Lumina series adopts decoder-only LLMs as text encoders. For instance, Lumina-T2X uses a 7 billion LLaMa as text encoder, while Lumina-Next employs the smaller Gemma-2B to decrease GPU memory costs and increase training throughput. Remarkably, both LLaMa-7B and Gemma-2B endow Lumina T2I models with the ability to understand multilingual prompts in a zero-shot manner, despite being primarily pretrained on English-only corpora. As shown in Figure 13, our T2I models not only accurately interpret multilingual prompts but also generate images with cultural nuances and show a preliminary ability to understand emojis, even though it was mainly trained with English-only image-text pairs. Compared to SDXL and PixArt- $\\cdot\\alpha$ , which use CLIP and T5, there is a significant improvement in the understanding of multilingual prompts. We argue that decoder-only LLMs with strong language understanding abilities better align multilingual semantics than the encoder-decoder architecture of T5 or the multimodal alignment of CLIP text embeddings. To further explore the relationships between multilingual generation abilities and text encoders, we train Lumina-Next with different open-source LLMs, including Gemma-2B, Qwen-1.8B [5], and InternLM-7B [12]. As demonstrated in Figure 15, Lumina-Next with Qwen-1.8B and InternLM-7B showcase significantly better text-image alignment compared to Gemma-2B when using diverse Chinese prompts as inputs.

These methods often alter the original resolution of aspect ratio of the input images a lot, potentially causing a performance drop, and they incur additional computational costs by resizing low-resolution images to higher resolutions unnecessarily.

Firstly, we introduce relative pose control to Next-DiT to distinguish between views. Specifically, for $N$ multi-view images with the same elevation and random azimuths rendering from 3D object, taking the azimuth of the first image as the reference view, the relative azimuths of the remaining $N-1$ images to the first image are calculated sequentially. The obtained relative azimuths are encoded into the same dimension as time embedding using a 2-layer MLP network after sin and cos transformation, and are added to the time embedding to inject camera control into the model. Secondly, we expanded the original text condition of Next-DiT into text and image conditions. Specifically, the same encoding and injection method as Next-DiT is used for text condition. For the image condition, we use VAE to encode the input image, and then concatenate it to the multi-view noises $(N+1)$ . This image is not used for supervision during training. In addition, when building the training data, this condition image has the same azimuth as the first supervised view (both are 0), but it is a random elevation. It is worth noting that the image condition is dropped based on probability during training, and the input of the image condition is optional during inference. Finally, a progressive training strategy of views and resolution is adopted during training, and views flexible inference strategy is used during inference. Specifically, during training, we first performed training at $256\\times256$ resolution with $N=4$ .
