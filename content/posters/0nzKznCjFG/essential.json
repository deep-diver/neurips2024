Existing personalized models struggle with diverse user data distributions and risk compromising user privacy. This paper focuses on improving personalized frequency histogram estimation, a crucial aspect of tasks like next-word prediction.  The task is challenging because users have few samples and different data distributions. \nThe paper proposes a novel approach using **clustering-based algorithms** to group users with similar distributions.  They develop a **differentially private** version of this algorithm, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining accuracy. The method is tested on real-world datasets such as Reddit and Stack Overflow. The empirical results showcase significant improvements in accuracy, compared to existing methods, while upholding the desired level of privacy.  The study is supported by a **mixture-of-Dirichlet data model** which helps to explain the performance gains.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "0nzKznCjFG/podcast.wav"}
