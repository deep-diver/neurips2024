Traditional methods, like Poisson Surface Reconstruction, rely on complex calculations and struggle with noisy or incomplete data.  Neural network-based approaches, while improving accuracy, usually demand significant computational resources and large training datasets.  This limitation makes them unsuitable for real-time applications or resource-constrained environments.\nThis research paper introduces LoSF-UDF, a novel neural network framework that addresses these challenges.  **LoSF-UDF uses local shape functions to learn unsigned distance fields (UDFs) from point cloud patches, allowing for efficient and robust surface reconstruction.** By focusing on local geometric features, it avoids the need for global context and reduces computational demands.  The approach demonstrates improved resilience to noisy data and outliers, yielding high-quality reconstructions even under challenging conditions.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "7nbAots3f8/podcast.wav"}
