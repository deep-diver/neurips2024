Our model, eFreeSplat, generalizes to novel scenes without relying on epipolar priors, offering superior appearance and geometric perception.", "description": "This figure illustrates the limitations of epipolar priors in novel view synthesis, especially in scenes with sparse views or occlusions.  The top row shows reference views and a novel view generated by three different methods: pixelSplat, MVSplat, and the authors' proposed method, eFreeSplat.  The bottom row provides a visual explanation of the problem. The left image shows a case where epipolar priors are valid and reliable for establishing correspondences between views. The middle image demonstrates a situation where epipolar priors fail due to occlusion and sparsity. The corresponding depth maps generated by the three methods showcase the differences in performance. eFreeSplat shows more robust results, highlighting its advantage of not relying on epipolar lines.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "iO6tcLJEwA/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Fig. 2. Overview of eFreeSplat. (a) Epipolar-free Cross-view Mutual Perception leverages self-supervised cross-view completion pre-training [60] to extract robust 3D priors. The ViT [11] with shared weights processes the reference images, followed by a cross-attention decoder to generate multiview feature maps, forming 3D perception without epipolar priors. (b) Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment module iteratively refines Gaussian attributes through a 2D U-Net. The process involves warped features to align corresponding features and depths, ensuring consistent depth scales across different views. (c) The final step involves employing rasterization-based volume rendering [23] to generate high-quality geometry and realistic novel view images.", "description": "This figure provides a detailed overview of the eFreeSplat architecture. It is divided into three main stages: Epipolar-free Cross-view Mutual Perception, Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment, and Novel View Rendering.  The first stage uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract 3D priors without relying on epipolar lines. The second stage iteratively refines Gaussian attributes to ensure consistent depth scales.
