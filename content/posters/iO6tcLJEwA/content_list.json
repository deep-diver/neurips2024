In this paper, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS-based model for generalizable novel view synthesis that operates independently of epipolar line constraints.

Recently, generalizable novel view synthesis (GNVS) techniques have emerged as a promising solution. These models, trained on large-scale multiview datasets, can directly synthesize novel views of new scenes from a few observations, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining. Notable works in this vein include NeRF-based GNVS [37, 38, 55, 64] and Light Field Networkbased GNVS [12, 48, 49]. An enabling factor in their generalizability is the use of epipolar priors, which help determine the precise location of a pixel in one image on the corresponding epipolar line in another viewpoint [17, 70]. More recently, generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting methods, such as pixelSplat [6] and MVSplat [9], have been proposed. These methods leverage the benefits of a primitive-based 3D representation, offering fast and memory-efficient rendering along with an interpretable 3D structure for generalizable view synthesis. Like previous approaches, most 3DGS-based GNVS methods [6, 9, 61] depend on epipolar priors to achieve high-quality and fast cross-scene novel view rendering. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite significant advancements utilizing epipolar priors, a new and underexplored issue has emerged in GNVS: epipolar priors prove unreliable in non-overlapping and occluded regions of complex realworld scenes, where corresponding points on epipolar lines are absent. As depicted in Fig. 1, epipolar lines (marked in green) effectively identify geometric correspondences in multiview overlapping areas. Conversely, epipolar lines (marked in red) become invalid in those non-overlapping regions, leading to unreliable geometric reconstructions. Moreover, sampling on invalid epipolar lines and employing attention mechanism will produce a lot of redundant calculations [6, 38, 49].

Leveraging this insight, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting model for GNVS that operates independently of epipolar line priors. eFreeSplat is built upon 3DGS [23] originally designed for single-scene NVS and extends its advantages to GNVS. The overview of our method is illustrated in Fig. 2. To capture 3D structural information across sparse views without unreliable epipolar priors, we utilize a self-supervised pre-training model for 3D cross-view completion [59, 60]. This model uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) [11] encoder and cross-attention decoder to predict parts of the masked images from reference views. In eFreeSplat, the pre-training model retains all patches, effectively capturing spatial relationships and acting as a \u201ccross-view mutual perceiver\u201d.

ICGA is based on the fact that the features of most surface points projected onto the camera planes of different views remain consistent. Specifically, we obtain the warped features for each view based on the predicted depths via U-Net. We then calculate the fine depths for the next iteration via the correlation between the warped features and the features from other views.

Unlike early 3D neural representation methods [37, 39, 46] that require intensive computations and large memory usage (e.g., neural fields [2, 3, 67] and volume rendering [27, 65, 66]) , 3DGS enables real-time rendering and editability with minimized computational demands [8]. Existing single-scene 3DGS-liked methods [10, 18, 23] demand dense views for each scene via the expensive per-scene gradient back-propagation process.

Cross-scene generalizable 3DGS learns robust priors from large-scale scenarios to predict Gaussian primitive parameters and render novel view images using sparse inputs. pixelSplat [6] and LatentSplat [61] leverage the epipolar transformer [17] to find cross-view correspondences and learn per-pixel Gaussian depth distributions. However, this can fail in non-overlapping and occluded areas, leading to inaccurate geometry and surface reconstructions. Splatter Image [50] merges Gaussian primitives from single-view regressions but lacks cross-view information, limiting its multiview applications. GPS-Gaussian [71] and MVSplat [9] improve feature matching with cost volumes for better geometries; however, GPS-Gaussian is limited to human body reconstruction with depth ground truth, and MVSplat, using plane-sweep stereo [28, 29, 62, 63], still relies on the epipolar priors [13, 15, 63]. Triplane-Gaussian [73] encodes single-view images into latent 3D point clouds and triplane features, outputting 3D Gaussian properties via MLP decoders. However, it focuses on single-view reconstruction, with rendering quality dependent on initial geometry. Our method bypasses 3D priors through sampling along epipolar lines or cost volumes, instead using cross-view competition pre-training [59, 60] on large-scale datasets [25, 35, 40, 44, 45]. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Solving 3D Tasks using Geometry-free Methods. Priors are crucial for visual tasks to provide generalized features [14, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Capitalizing on the geometric priors, methods based on re-projection features [21, 51, 64], cost volume [7, 19, 22, 63], and image warping [5] have performed well in downstream 3D activities. However, these methods rely on task-specific designs and struggle with complex scenarios, such as occlusions or non-overlapping views. Recently, some geometry-free alternatives have been proposed to this challenge. SRT [43] and GS-LRM [68] are epipolar-free GNVS methods that boldly eschew any explicit geometric inductive biases. SRT encodes patches from all reference views using a Transformer encoder and decodes the RGB color for target rays through a Transformer decoder. GS-LRM\u2019s network, composed of a large number of Transformer blocks, implicitly learns 3D representations. However, due to the lack of targeted scene encoding, these methods are either limited to specific datasets or suffer from unacceptable computational efficiency and carbon footprint. Some pose-free GNVS methods [20, 43, 54] are also epipolarfree. These methods, lacking known camera poses, find it challenging to perform epipolar line sampling. They often reduce task complexity through specially designed feature representations (e.g., Learned 3D Neural Volume in LEAP [20] and Triplane in PF-LRM [54]), but this reduction comes at the cost of decreased model generalization. Different from the above methods, our method focuses on data-driven 3D priors and does not require any time-consuming and complex structured feature representations, such as cost volumes. CroCo [59], a self-supervised pre-training method for 3D vision tasks, uses cross-view completion to recover occluded parts of an image from different viewpoints without any 3D inductive biases, significantly enhancing downstream 3D vision tasks. DUSt3R [56] introduces a novel paradigm for dense and unconstrained stereo 3D reconstruction from arbitrary image collections, operating without prior information about camera calibration.
