Existing differentially private (DP) kernel learning methods suffer from scalability issues, restricted kernel choices, or dependence on test data.  These limitations hinder the application of powerful kernel methods to privacy-sensitive tasks, which require efficient and privacy-preserving techniques. \nThis research introduces DP-scalable kernel learning algorithms that overcome these limitations.  The core innovation is the use of a DP K-means Nystr\u00f6m method, a low-rank approximation technique.  This approach allows for efficient computation on large datasets with general kernels and provides theoretical guarantees for privacy and accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods, confirming both theoretical claims and practical utility.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "MdmzAezNHq/podcast.wav"}
