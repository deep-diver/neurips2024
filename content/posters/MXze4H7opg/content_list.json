Recent studies have explored low-rank structures on weights for efficient fine-tuning in terms of parameters and memory, either through low-rank adaptation or factorization. While effective for fine-tuning, low-rank structures are generally less suitable for pretraining because they restrict parameters to a low-dimensional subspace. In this work, we propose to parameterize the weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse matrices for pretraining, which we call SLTrain. The low-rank component is learned via matrix factorization, while for the sparse component, we employ a simple strategy of uniformly selecting the sparsity support at random and learning only the non-zero entries with the fixed support. While being simple, the random fixed-support sparse learning strategy significantly enhances pretraining when combined with low-rank learning. Our results show that SLTrain adds minimal extra parameters and memory costs compared to pretraining with low-rank parameterization, yet achieves substantially better performance, which is comparable to full-rank training.

The predominant success of these models is primarily due to the model size, usually scaling to hundreds of billions of parameters. The scaling laws seem to suggest the capacity of LLMs grows with the model size [25], but nonetheless requiring massive amount of resources for pre-training, storing, and fine-tuning. Particularly, memory requirement for training an LLM imposes a hard barrier for model deployment on commercial GPUs. For example, the LLaMA 7B model requires a minimum memory cost of approximately 42G under 16-bit floating point, including 14G of parameter state and 28G of optimizer state for momentum-based optimizers, like Adam [59, 28].

The premise is that LLMs usually adapt to downstream tasks in a lowdimensional subspace, which allows to parameterize the update by low-rank factors. Low-rank finetuning requires minimal trainable parameters and significant reduction of memory and computation resources [10, 12].

This is because neural networks often exhibit full-rank structure in the weights and imposing low-rank restrictions could significantly limit their representation power. Hence, recent works have explored full-rank training with low-rank updates. For instance, ReLoRA [32] periodically restarts LoRA, where the low-rank updates are merged with the weights from the last period. However, ReLoRA also requires a warm-start full-rank training to achieve competitive performance [32]. GaLore [59] takes a different route by enforcing a low-rank structure not on the weights but on the gradients. This allows the Adam optimizer states to be stored in a low-dimensional space.

Existing strategies for sparse learning usually involve prune-and-growth [13, 2, 58, 49] that iteratively train, prune, and grow neurons. Such a strategy is usually not memory efficient due to the need of storing (and learning) a support and a dense weight matrix.

While low rank is modeled via the product $B A$ of $r$ -dimensional matrices, the support of the sparse factor $S$ is obtained by uniformly random sampling over indices. The matrices $B,A,S$ are learned for different layers via backpropagation. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art memory reduction during pretraining while maintaining competitive performance. Although we show results on the LLaMA language models (with varying size from 60M to 7B parameters), we believe SLTrain could also help to improve memory efficiency for vision foundation models and multi-modal foundation models, such as diffusion models [37] and CLIP [38]. The significant improvements shown by SLTrain also motivates future works to understand the theoretical guarantees of training with both low-rank and sparse factors, such as convergence and loss landscape.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
