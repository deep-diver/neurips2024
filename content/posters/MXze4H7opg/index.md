### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, demanding significant memory and processing power. Existing methods like low-rank parameterization aim for efficiency but often compromise performance, especially during pretraining.  Low-rank structures, while useful for fine-tuning, restrict parameters to a low-dimensional space and struggle to capture the full representation power needed for effective pretraining.  This limitation hinders the ability to train larger and more complex models.

This paper introduces SLTrain, a novel approach that parameterizes the weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse matrices for pretraining.  The low-rank component is learned through matrix factorization, while the sparse component utilizes a random, fixed-support learning strategy. This strategy, while simple, significantly improves pretraining efficiency.  SLTrain achieves substantially better performance than low-rank pretraining while adding minimal extra parameters and memory costs.  Combined with quantization and per-layer updates, it reduces memory requirements by up to 73% when pretraining LLaMA 7B model.

### In-depth insights


#### Low-Rank Limits
The concept of 'Low-Rank Limits' in the context of large language model (LLM) training refers to the inherent constraints imposed when using low-rank approximations of the model's weight matrices.  While low-rank methods offer significant advantages in terms of reduced computational cost and memory footprint, they also restrict the model's representational capacity. This limitation arises because low-rank matrices inherently lie in a lower-dimensional subspace compared to full-rank matrices. Therefore, the expressiveness of the model is inevitably curtailed, leading to a potential trade-off between efficiency and performance.  **This trade-off is a central challenge in the pursuit of efficient LLM training.**  Approaches like the addition of sparse components, as suggested in the research paper, may alleviate some of these limitations by enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex relationships without significantly increasing computational demand.  **Understanding these limitations is key to designing effective strategies for efficient, yet high-performing LLMs.**  Future research may focus on adaptive low-rank techniques that dynamically adjust the rank based on the training data and task demands, thereby mitigating the limitations of static low-rank parameterizations.

#### Sparse Plus LR
The concept of "Sparse Plus Low-Rank" (LR) represents a hybrid approach to parameter-efficient model training, combining the strengths of both sparse and low-rank matrix factorizations.  **Sparsity** reduces the number of parameters directly by setting many weights to zero. This offers significant memory savings and computational efficiency, particularly beneficial for large language models. **Low-rank factorization** approximates a full-rank weight matrix using the product of two smaller matrices, reducing the number of parameters required to represent the model. This also leads to faster training and inference speeds. By combining these two techniques, the "Sparse Plus LR" approach aims to capture the most important information in the weight matrices concisely and efficiently. This involves identifying the most influential weights (low-rank component) while also eliminating less important ones (sparse component).  **The method's effectiveness hinges on a careful balance**: too much sparsity risks loss of information crucial for model accuracy, while insufficient sparsity negates the memory benefits. Similarly, a low-rank approximation that is too low may underfit the data, compromising performance.  A key research question would be how to optimally determine the degree of sparsity and the rank to ensure an appropriate trade-off between model size and accuracy. The random support selection strategy for sparse learning is intriguing; however, more sophisticated techniques might yield even greater improvements.  **The approach promises a significant reduction in the memory footprint** required for both training and deploying large models.

#### SLTrain Method
The core of the SLTrain method lies in its novel parameterization of weight matrices.  Instead of using a standard full-rank representation, SLTrain cleverly decomposes each weight matrix into the sum of a low-rank component and a sparse component. **This dual approach is key to achieving both parameter and memory efficiency.**  The low-rank component is learned through matrix factorization, effectively capturing dominant patterns in the data with a limited number of parameters.  Simultaneously, the sparse component, using a randomly selected and fixed support, strategically identifies important neuron-wise interactions. **This random fixed-support strategy is crucial**, making SLTrain computationally efficient because it avoids complex iterative pruning and growth algorithms typically needed in sparse learning methods. The combination of low-rank and sparse components yields a pretrained model with high representational power while minimizing memory footprint.  **The strategy of optimizing only the non-zero values in the sparse component is a major innovation**, significantly reducing memory demands compared to previous low-rank or sparse methods.  SLTrain's architecture allows for seamless integration with quantization and per-layer updates, maximizing memory savings.

#### Memory Gains
The concept of 'Memory Gains' in the context of large language model (LLM) training is crucial for practical application.  **Reducing memory footprint is paramount** as it directly impacts the feasibility of training and deploying larger, more powerful LLMs.  The paper explores memory efficiency through a combination of low-rank and sparse weight parameterization.  **SLTrain's memory gains stem from two key factors:** a reduction in the number of parameters and a novel strategy for handling the sparse component.  **The fixed-support sparse learning avoids the need to store a full sparse matrix**, leading to substantial memory savings.  Importantly, the memory reduction is achieved without significant performance degradation, often achieving performance comparable to full-rank training.  Quantization and per-layer updates further amplify the memory gains, demonstrating a practical approach to train LLMs on more modest hardware resources.  **The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated across varying LLM sizes**, showing consistent improvements in memory efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy.

#### Future Works
Future research directions stemming from this sparse plus low-rank approach for efficient LLM pretraining could involve several key areas.  **Improving the sparsity selection strategy** beyond uniform random sampling is crucial; exploring adaptive or learned sparsity patterns could significantly enhance performance and efficiency.  **Investigating alternative low-rank factorization techniques** and comparing them to the current approach would be valuable, potentially leading to more robust and effective model compression.  **A thorough theoretical analysis** is needed to rigorously establish the convergence guarantees and generalization properties of the proposed method. Furthermore, **extending the method to other large foundation models**, beyond LLMs such as vision or multimodal models, is a promising avenue.  Finally, **combining SLTrain with other memory-efficient optimization techniques**, such as quantization and gradient checkpointing, holds potential for even greater memory savings and scalability. Investigating the effects of different initialization strategies for the sparse and low-rank components warrants further study.  Understanding the interplay between sparsity, rank, and model architecture to better determine the optimal hyperparameters could improve both the efficiency and performance.

It specifies the batch size, number of epochs, rank (r), learning rate, sparsity (Œ¥), and scaling factor (Œ±) for each of the eight GLUE tasks (COLA, STS-B, MRPC, RTE, SST-2, MNLI, QNLI, QQP).  The rank and epochs are consistent with the settings in the paper referenced by [59], while the other hyperparameters are tuned specifically for SLTrain on this fine-tuning task.

> üîº This table compares the performance of different model training methods on various sizes of the LLaMA language model.  The metrics compared are validation perplexity (PPL), number of parameters (in millions), and estimated total memory cost (in gigabytes).  The results show SLTrain's comparable performance to full-rank training with reduced parameter size and memory cost.  The baseline methods for comparison include Full-Rank, Low-Rank, ReLORA, and GaLore.  For SLTrain, a consistent sparsity ratio (Œ¥) of 0.03 is used across different model sizes.

> Table 2: Validation perplexity (PPL(‚Üì)), number of parameters in millions (Param), and estimated total memory cost in G (Mem). The perplexity results for all the baselines are taken from [59]. For SLTrain, we use the same rank as other baselines and fix Œ¥ = 0.03.
