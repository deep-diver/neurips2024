These shortcomings hinder accurate predictions, especially for extensive datasets. The paper addresses these issues by exploring the potential of signal processing techniques in deep time series forecasting. \n\nThe proposed FilterNet uses learnable frequency filters to select key temporal patterns. Two types of filters, plain and contextual shaping filters, are introduced.  **FilterNet effectively surrogates widely adopted linear and attention mappings** while achieving robustness against high-frequency noise and utilizing the entire frequency spectrum. Experimental results demonstrate FilterNet's superior performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods across eight benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ugL2D9idAD/podcast.wav"}
