Setting 2: Causal mechanism changes in Z introduces dependencies on the observed distributions of Xi, Xj. We leverage such dependencies to measure confounding when contexts C{i}^{j} are known (Defn. 4.6). Setting 3: If we know that there is a causal path from Xi to Xj, we leverage dependencies between the pairs (Xi, Xj) and (Z, Xi) to measure confounding. Similarly, if we know that there is a causal path from Xj to Xi, we leverage dependencies between the pairs (Xi, Xj) and (Z, Xj) to measure confounding (Defn. 4.7). Dashed arrows from Z indicate that Z is unobserved.", "description": "This figure illustrates three different settings for measuring confounding between two variables Xi and Xj, potentially influenced by an unobserved confounder Z.

The results are shown for four different causal graph structures (G1-G4).  G1 and G2 represent unconfounded scenarios (empty graph and Xi\u2192Xj, respectively), while G3 and G4 represent confounded scenarios (Z\u2192Xi, Z\u2192Xj and Z\u2192Xi, Z\u2192Xj, Xi\u2192Xj respectively).  The plots show that the confounding measures correctly output values near zero in the unconfounded cases and positive values in the confounded cases, demonstrating the methods' effectiveness in detecting confounding.", "section": "6 Experiments and Results"}, {"figure_path": "SvmJJJS0q1/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Left: Conditioning on one of \u00d8, Z1, Z2 will not remove confounding between X\u2081, Xj in G5.

Conditioning on Z will block the confounding between Xi, Xj. Hence CNF-2 is closer to zero.", "description": "This figure shows the results of measuring conditional confounding using CNF-2 in two different causal structures (G5 and G6). G5 has two confounding variables, Z1 and Z2, while G6 has one (Z). The left panel illustrates that conditioning on either Z1, Z2, or neither, still results in positive conditional confounding values because the confounding relationship remains.
