In this work, we propose Ref- $\\mathbf{M}C^{2}$ that introduces the multitimes Monte Carlo sampling which comprehensively computes the environmental illumination and meanwhile considers the reflective light from object surfaces. To address the computation challenge as the times of Monte Carlo sampling grow, we propose a specularity-adaptive sampling strategy, significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Specifically, Nvdiffrec [28] proposes a differentiable pipeline that enables gradient-based optimization on both meshes and volumetric textures. These methods ignore the shadow when modeling the illumination, resulting in failed disentanglement for diffuse and shading appearances. To model more realistic shadings, Nvdiffrecmc [9] further incorporates ray tracing and Monte Carlo sampling [27] into inverse rendering, significantly improving the decomposition of shape, materials, and lighting. However, it ignores the indirect illuminations during path tracing and treats rays attacking object surfaces as sheltered illumination. As a consequence, methods like Nvdiffrecmc increase the ambiguity of geometry reconstruction and undermine material learning. Unfortunately, the scene with multiple inter-reflections is common in the real world. The failure in these scenes hinders the wider applications of these methods. Recent methods [17, 40, 22] take inter-reflections into account and can reconstruct the reflective objects well. However, the implicit representations of these methods for materials and renders sacrifice their scalability to downstream tasks. Recently, Nefii [45] further incorporated the implicit neural radiance to estimate ray tracing, alleviating the ambiguity between materials and indirect illuminations. However, this leads to a huge computational consumption for path tracing.

Although our method takes advantage of hardware-accelerated ray tracing to model the indirect illumination, we still face two major challenges brought by the multi-times Monte Carlo sampling. 1) Efficiency: the explosive computational growth from multiple times is too heavy for the hardware algorithm only. 2) Geometry: the geometry quality greatly affects the calculation of indirect light and the decomposition of the materials, because the error will accumulate over and over again as the times of Monte Carlo sampling increase.

When we trace the indirect light from an object, instead of recalculating the diffuse component, we can take the value directly from the diffuse map. It can be optimized through self-supervision. Therefore, we only need to sample the specular component within a small lobe along around the reflective direction. 2) For geometry, we refer to the SDF-based methods [41, 17, 6] and replace the common positional encoding with the Sphere Gaussian encoding to get an accurate initial geometry for reflective objects. We use this geometry to initialize Flxicubes [35] that optimizes surface meshes based on the gradient, and further fine-tunes the Flexicubes in a differentiable pipeline.

However, the unconstrained volumetric representation of the original NeRF method leads to low-quality geometry. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [16, 11, 12, 20, 53] has gained popularity in novel view synthesis. Different from NeRF, it is an explicit representation that involves the optimization of multiple Gaussians to reconstruct 3D objects. 3DGS learns color and density in a volumetric point cloud, but it also fails to produce accurate geometry due to its discrete representation. Besides, these methods are all entangled learning, integrating all inherent materials and the environment map into the appearance. This limits the downstream applications in the current industrial pipeline. To produce a high-quality geometry, follow-up works [48, 43, 51, 30] use a function to associate signed distance field (SDF) and volume density.

RefNeuS [6] introduces a reparametrization method to distinguish the reflective appearance from the diffuse appearance by a direction-relative process, but it fails to faithfully reconstruct non-reflective objects.

Multi-times sampling considers the indirect illumination, and thus successfully disentangles the environment light and inner reflective light. As shown in Fig. 4, the environment maps learned by single-time sampling contain noise and shades that are actually the inner reflection. In contrast, multi-times sampling significantly releases the problem, producing a clearer environment map. Single-time sampling also undermines the rendering results, with darker inverted reflections. When the sampling ray is sheltered by objects during path tracing, the ray returns no light, resulting in a dark point. Multi-times sampling returns the reflective light of the sheltering points containing both diffuse and specular light. As a consequence, the rendering results of multi-times sampling show realistic appearance and reflections. Besides, it can be seen that results with 2-time sampling are comparable to results with 3-time sampling. Tab. 1 also quantitatively shows minimal improvement by deeper tracing. However, each additional sampling time induces a 4-times computation increment. Therefore, a 2-times sampling is a more cost-effective setting. Additionally, we also compare the efficiency between the sampling with and without acceleration. As shown in Tab. 1, our method can make the training speed twice as fast while keeping a comparable PSNR. The degree of acceleration is related to the complexity of geometry, and here we adopt the median in our dataset.

When applying a good-quality initialization, the network bypasses the ambiguity brought by the geometry. It helps our method learn well-disentangled materials and finally produces high-quality rendering results. Quantitative comparison in Tab. 1 also demonstrate the necessity of geometry initialization.

Due to the well-disentangled shading, our rendering results are natural and realistic in all five environment maps, even the point light in a dark environment. They also perform well after editing materials thanks to the well-learned material map. For example, after we increase the metalness and reduce the roughness of the teapot, the teapot clearly reflects the neighboring objects on its surface. In another case, where we extremely increase the reflectance and change the base color of the toaster, it accomplishes to reflect the scene and other objects.

It improves the performance in scenes with complex interreflections. However, increment of sampling times significantly increases computational consumption and makes the pipeline highly geometry-sensitive. To solve the challenge of computational efficiency, based on the Lambert model, we simplify the BRDF for indirect lighting, which allows us to reduce the number of ray traces. To improve the geometry quality, we adopt SDF-based architecture to get an initial geometry and refine a design with Spherical Gaussian encoding for reflective objects. We further use Flexicubes to take the initial mesh into the differentiable rendering pipeline that learns disentangled materials. Our Ref-MC2 still has several limitations. The major limitation is that the 2-time sampling cannot handle extremely reflective objects, e.g., mirrors, as the specular energy hardly degrades after reflections. Besides, the training time needs to further reduce in future time.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
