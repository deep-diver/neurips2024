Ignoring indirect illumination leads to inaccurate results, and existing solutions often compromise computational efficiency or downstream task flexibility.  Furthermore, geometric errors accumulate with multiple reflections, reducing the overall accuracy.\n\nThe proposed Ref-MC2 method tackles these issues by introducing a multi-times Monte Carlo sampling technique to comprehensively compute environmental and reflective light. To address the computational cost increase, a **specularity-adaptive sampling strategy** is implemented. In addition, a **reflection-aware surface model** is used to initialize and refine geometry during the inverse rendering process, which effectively minimizes the accumulation of geometric errors. This results in significantly improved reconstruction of reflective surfaces and disentanglement of materials.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "TLUGoShY30/podcast.wav"}
