Ours (1) is about 1.5h longer than Nvdiffrecmc [9] as we need additional time to learn the initial geometry.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed method (Ref-MC2) against three baseline methods (NDR, NDRMC, and Nefii) in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and training time.  Different configurations of Ref-MC2 are shown, indicating the impact of  removing the acceleration technique (w/o Acc.), removing geometric initialization (w/o Geo.), and using different numbers of Monte Carlo sampling iterations (3 and 1).  The table highlights that Ref-MC2 generally achieves higher PSNR at a comparable or lower computational cost.", "section": "4.2 Comparison with Baseline"}, {"figure_path": "TLUGoShY30/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Geometry qualitative comparison. We use the Chamfer Distance (\u2193) to evaluate our reconstructed geometry. As shown in the table, we obtain the best results in multiple scenes.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the geometric quality achieved by different methods, including Nvdiffrec [28], Nvdiffrecmc [9], NeRO [18], and the proposed method.  The Chamfer Distance, a metric measuring the dissimilarity between two point clouds, is used to evaluate the quality of the reconstructed geometry. Lower values indicate higher geometric accuracy. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other methods on both \"Materials\" and \"Coral\" datasets.", "section": "4.4 Geometry"}]
