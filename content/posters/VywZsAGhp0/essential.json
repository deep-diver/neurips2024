This opens avenues for developing more robust and effective GNNs for various applications.", "summary": "PSNR, a novel node-adaptive residual module, significantly improves deep GNN performance by mitigating over-smoothing and handling missing data.", "takeaways": ["The PSNR module effectively alleviates over-smoothing in deep GNNs.", "PSNR improves GNN performance, especially when dealing with missing features.", "PSNR is lightweight and adaptable to various GNN architectures."], "tldr": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at processing graph-structured data but suffer from over-smoothing as layers increase, leading to indistinguishable node representations.  Existing residual methods have limitations: lack of node-adaptability and loss of high-order neighborhood information.  These limitations restrict the performance of deep GNNs and hamper their ability to effectively model long-range dependencies.\nThe paper introduces a Posterior-Sampling-based Node-Adaptive Residual module (PSNR) to address these issues. PSNR uses a graph encoder to learn node-specific residual coefficients, enabling fine-grained, adaptive neighborhood aggregation.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSNR surpasses previous residual methods in both fully observed and missing feature scenarios, verifying its superiority and potential for improving GNN performance.  **PSNR's node-adaptability and efficient use of high-order neighborhood information are key to its success.**", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VywZsAGhp0/podcast.wav"}
