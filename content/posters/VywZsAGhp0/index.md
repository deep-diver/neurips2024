### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at processing graph-structured data but suffer from over-smoothing as layers increase, leading to indistinguishable node representations.  Existing residual methods have limitations: lack of node-adaptability and loss of high-order neighborhood information.  These limitations restrict the performance of deep GNNs and hamper their ability to effectively model long-range dependencies.

The paper introduces a Posterior-Sampling-based Node-Adaptive Residual module (PSNR) to address these issues. PSNR uses a graph encoder to learn node-specific residual coefficients, enabling fine-grained, adaptive neighborhood aggregation.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSNR surpasses previous residual methods in both fully observed and missing feature scenarios, verifying its superiority and potential for improving GNN performance.  **PSNR's node-adaptability and efficient use of high-order neighborhood information are key to its success.**

> This figure displays the Smoothness Metric Value (SMV) for nodes grouped by their degrees, using the GAT model with varying numbers of layers (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).  The SMV measures how similar node representations become as the number of layers increase in a GNN.  The results show the relationship between node degree and over-smoothing.  Nodes with higher degrees tend to show higher SMV values, indicating higher over-smoothing, as their neighborhood subgraphs have more overlap. This observation is used to support the paper's argument on over-smoothing from the perspective of overlapping neighborhood subgraphs.  Appendix C contains additional results for other models and datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### Over-smoothing Revisited
Over-smoothing, a phenomenon where node representations in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become indistinguishable, is revisited.  The core issue is identified as **overlapping high-order neighborhood subgraphs**, leading to information redundancy and hindering the model's ability to learn distinctive features. This perspective helps clarify how residual methods, by integrating multiple orders of neighborhood information, mitigate over-smoothing.  However, existing residual methods are criticized for lacking **node adaptability** and causing a **severe loss of high-order subgraph information**.  A novel approach is proposed to address these limitations, suggesting a more nuanced understanding and improved solutions for tackling over-smoothing in GNNs.

#### PSNR Module
The PSNR (Posterior-Sampling-based Node-Adaptive Residual) Module is a novel approach to address over-smoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).  **It leverages a graph encoder to learn node-specific residual coefficients**, avoiding the limitations of previous methods that use fixed coefficients. This **node-adaptability** allows for finer-grained control over the information aggregation process and prevents the loss of high-order neighborhood subgraph information that often plagues deep GNNs.  The PSNR module introduces randomness during both training and testing, improving generalization and mitigating oversmoothing. By dynamically adjusting the residual connections based on the posterior distribution of the coefficients, PSNR allows GNNs to effectively model long-range dependencies and significantly improves performance, especially in cases of missing features where deep networks are essential.

#### Adaptive Residuals
The concept of "Adaptive Residuals" in deep learning models, particularly within the context of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), presents a powerful approach to mitigate the over-smoothing problem.  **Adaptive residuals go beyond the traditional static residual connections by dynamically adjusting the residual components based on node-specific characteristics or layer-wise needs.** This adaptability is crucial because nodes in a graph exhibit varying degrees of information richness and connectivity, requiring a more nuanced approach than a uniform residual across all nodes. By learning these adaptive weights, the model can selectively integrate information from different layers or neighborhood aggregations, preventing information loss and maintaining node identity at deeper layers.  **This approach is especially valuable for scenarios with missing data or when dealing with graphs with complex topological structures.** The challenge lies in effectively learning these adaptive components without introducing excessive computational overhead, hence the need for efficient learning mechanisms, such as those based on posterior sampling or graph attention networks. Overall, adaptive residuals represent a significant advancement in GNN design, offering a pathway towards building deeper and more robust models capable of handling intricate graph patterns and incomplete data. The use of a graph encoder within the adaptive residual module also signifies a powerful approach to integrate node features and graph structure for improved performance.

#### Deep GNNs
Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) hold immense potential but face challenges as depth increases.  **Over-smoothing**, where node representations become indistinguishable, significantly hinders performance.  Many approaches, including various residual methods, attempt to mitigate this.  Residual connections aim to preserve initial information and integrate multi-order neighborhood subgraphs, counteracting the homogenizing effect of repeated aggregation.  However, existing methods often lack **node-adaptability**, uniformly applying residual connections regardless of node characteristics and potentially losing information.  **A novel, adaptive residual module** is needed to address these shortcomings, enabling more effective learning from graph structures, even at substantial depths.

#### Scalability & Limits
A crucial aspect of any machine learning model is its scalability and inherent limitations.  **Scalability** refers to the model's ability to handle increasing amounts of data and computational demands efficiently.  For graph neural networks (GNNs), scalability is challenged by the complexity of graph operations, especially as graph size and depth grow.  **Memory constraints** become a significant bottleneck for larger graphs due to the storage of node embeddings and adjacency matrices.  **Computational costs** rise with increasing graph size and depth, limiting the applicability of GNNs to very large-scale datasets. Addressing these challenges often requires innovative techniques like graph sampling or efficient aggregation methods.  **Model limitations** arise from the inherent inductive biases of GNNs.  Over-smoothing, where node representations become indistinguishable, can severely hamper performance in deep GNNs.  The choice of architecture, message-passing scheme, and aggregation functions all significantly impact performance and scalability.  **Overfitting** is also a concern, particularly with deep architectures and limited data.  Therefore, understanding the trade-offs between model capacity, computational resources, and data requirements is vital when designing and applying GNNs to real-world problems.  Careful consideration of these factors is crucial for successful deployment at scale.  Future research should focus on developing more efficient algorithms and architectures that mitigate scalability issues and improve the robustness and generalizability of deep GNNs.

> This figure shows the architecture of the Posteriori-Sampling-based Node-Adaptive Residual module (PSNR).  The PSNR module takes the output of a previous GNN layer (Hk-1) as input. A GNN layer processes this input to produce H‚Äôk-1. These are then fed into an encoder along with the adjacency matrix (A) and positional embedding (LayerEmb(k)) to obtain the posterior distribution of the residual coefficients (Œ∑k). This distribution is then sampled to obtain node-adaptive residual coefficients which are then used to compute the final output (Hk) via a residual connection with the initial input.
