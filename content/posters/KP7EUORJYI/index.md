### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) algorithms struggle with Non-Markovian Reward (NMR) problems because the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) technique they rely on cannot effectively densify rewards in such scenarios.  This leads to poor policy learning and ineffective curriculum creation.  The lack of informative rewards results in many failed trajectories overwhelming the replay buffer. 

To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces GCPO, a novel on-policy GCRL framework that is applicable to both MR and NMR problems. GCPO consists of two main components: (1) Pre-training from Demonstrations, which provides an initial goal-achieving capability, and (2) Online Self-Curriculum Learning, which progressively selects challenging goals based on the policy's current capabilities.  The empirical evaluation of GCPO on a challenging multi-goal long-horizon task demonstrates its effectiveness in solving both MR and NMR problems.

> The figure is composed of two parts. The left part illustrates how Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) works on both Markovian Reward (MR) and Non-Markovian Reward (NMR) problems.  It shows that HER can successfully densify rewards in MR problems by using a single encountered state as the hindsight goal, but it fails in NMR problems because the reward computation depends on multiple steps of states and actions, and a single state cannot serve as a hindsight goal. The right part presents the experimental results of HER on MR and NMR problems, demonstrating that HER's performance deteriorates as the NMR's dependence on consecutive states and actions increases, ultimately becoming indistinguishable from the case without HER. The experiments were conducted on a simplified version of the fixed-wing UAV velocity vector control task.

> This table compares the Goal-Conditioned Policy Optimization (GCPO) method with existing HER-based methods.  It highlights key differences in the type of reinforcement learning (off-policy vs. on-policy), the types of reward functions they can handle (Markovian Reward (MR) vs. Non-Markovian Reward (NMR)), the methods used to increase informative rewards, and the goal sampling methods employed.  The table clarifies that HER-based methods utilize hindsight replay and rely on replay buffers, while GCPO uses pre-training from demonstrations and off-policy evaluation for goal sampling.





### In-depth insights


#### GCPO Framework
The GCPO framework presents a novel **on-policy approach** to Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL), significantly diverging from existing off-policy methods reliant on Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).  Its core innovation lies in addressing the limitations of HER when dealing with **non-Markovian rewards (NMR)**, a common challenge in real-world applications where reward calculation depends on multiple state-action sequences. GCPO cleverly incorporates **pre-training from demonstrations** to provide an initial goal-achieving capability, thereby easing the subsequent online learning process and mitigating the issues of failed trajectories often found in HER-based methods.  Furthermore, its **online self-curriculum learning** dynamically adjusts the difficulty of learning goals based on the policy's evolving capabilities, ensuring effective training progress. This adaptive curriculum generation is crucial for navigating the complexities of both MR and NMR problems, making GCPO a versatile and robust framework for multi-goal reinforcement learning.

#### NMR Challenges
Non-Markovian reward (NMR) problems pose significant challenges in Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL).  **Traditional methods like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) struggle to effectively handle NMRs** because the reward's dependence on multiple past states and actions prevents the simple hindsight goal assignment that makes HER successful in Markovian reward settings.  This limitation leads to an abundance of uninformative rewards, overwhelming the replay buffer, and hindering the construction of an effective learning curriculum.  **Addressing NMRs requires novel approaches that move beyond simple hindsight goal relabeling.**  The lack of readily available informative rewards necessitates innovative ways to provide sufficient guidance to the learning agent. This might involve crafting more sophisticated reward functions, developing novel exploration strategies to ensure the generation of informative trajectories, or designing entirely new learning algorithms that are inherently better equipped to handle the complexities of non-Markovian reward structures.

#### Self-Curriculum
A self-curriculum learning approach in reinforcement learning dynamically adjusts the training difficulty based on the agent's current performance.  **It avoids overwhelming the agent with overly challenging tasks early on**, focusing instead on a gradual progression.  This strategy **improves learning efficiency and stability**, mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and premature convergence.  The curriculum's design is crucial; it must be sufficiently diverse to cover a wide range of scenarios while remaining challenging enough to promote continuous improvement. **Effective evaluation metrics are needed to accurately gauge the agent's skill level** and appropriately select the next set of training objectives.  Successfully implementing a self-curriculum often necessitates integrating online evaluation methods for continuous assessment and adaptive goal selection. This approach is particularly useful for handling complex tasks that require mastering a wide spectrum of skills and goals.

#### Pre-training Value
The concept of "Pre-training Value" in a reinforcement learning context suggests a significant advantage.  **Pre-training a model on a simpler task or with readily available data before tackling the main, complex objective enhances performance**.  This is particularly beneficial when dealing with limited data or computationally expensive environments, because the pre-training step imparts an initial level of competence. The resulting policy, already possessing some goal-achieving ability, requires less exploration and may converge more rapidly during the subsequent fine-tuning phase.  **Effective pre-training can mitigate the challenges of sparse rewards** and long horizon problems by providing a stronger starting point for online learning.  However, the choice of pre-training data and task is crucial; an inappropriate pre-training regime might hinder, rather than help, the ultimate performance, introducing biases that are difficult to overcome later.  Therefore, a thoughtful selection process, considering data relevance and task similarity, is essential for maximizing the pre-training value and achieving the desired overall improvement.

#### Future of GCPO
The future of Goal-Conditioned Policy Optimization (GCPO) looks promising, given its demonstrated effectiveness in handling both Markovian and non-Markovian reward problems.  **Improving the efficiency of the pre-training phase** is crucial; exploring more advanced imitation learning techniques or self-supervised methods could significantly reduce the reliance on extensive demonstrations.  **Expanding the online self-curriculum learning** component to incorporate more sophisticated goal selection strategies based on more nuanced estimations of policy capabilities is key to improving adaptability and efficiency.   **Exploring alternative architectures and algorithms** for policy optimization beyond KL-regularized RL could unlock further performance improvements.  **Addressing scalability challenges** associated with handling extremely long horizons or high-dimensional state spaces is essential for real-world applications.  Finally, **rigorous testing on a broader range of multi-goal tasks**, especially more complex real-world problems beyond velocity vector control, will be necessary to fully validate GCPO's generalizability and robustness.

The left side shows the pre-training phase, where a policy is pre-trained using demonstrations (illustrated as UAV flight paths). The right side depicts the online self-curriculum learning phase.
