Existing learning-based simulators often suffer from ill-posed problems caused by this 2D-3D ambiguity.  They frequently struggle with generalization to unseen materials and scenarios. \nThis paper introduces the Discrete Element Learner (DEL), a novel physics-integrated neural simulator that addresses these limitations.  DEL integrates learnable graph kernels into the classic Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) framework. This approach leverages the interpretability and robustness of DEA while utilizing the power of GNNs to learn complex interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DEL outperforms other learned simulators, particularly in handling diverse materials and robustly dealing with limited data and various camera viewpoints.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2nvkD0sPOk/podcast.wav"}
