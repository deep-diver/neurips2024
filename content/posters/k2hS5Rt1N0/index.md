### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of limited interaction with the target environment due to safety concerns or cost.  This often leads to performance degradation when deploying policies trained in a simpler 'source' environment. Existing methods typically focus solely on modifying rewards in the source domain to match the target domain's optimal trajectories. However, this does not guarantee optimal performance in the target domain.



The paper introduces DARAIL, a novel approach that uses reward modification to align the source and target domains, followed by imitation learning to transfer the learned policy to the target.  **DARAIL uses a reward augmented estimator to improve stability and provides an error bound analysis justifying this approach**.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARAIL significantly outperforms methods relying only on reward modification in various challenging scenarios.

### In-depth insights


#### Off-Dynamics RL
Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning (RL) tackles the challenge of training RL agents in a source environment and deploying them in a target environment with differing dynamics.  This is crucial because direct interaction with the target environment may be impossible, too expensive, or unsafe. **The core problem lies in the dynamics shift**, where the transition probabilities between states differ between source and target.  Existing reward-based approaches attempt to mitigate this by modifying rewards in the source domain to encourage behaviors similar to the optimal policy in the target, but they **often fail to guarantee optimal performance in the target due to the inherent limitations of reward shaping**.  This is where imitation learning comes in, offering a potential solution by enabling the agent to mimic the behavior of an expert policy trained (or imagined) in the target domain, thus bridging the gap between source and target environments. **Combining domain adaptation and imitation learning** offers a promising avenue to address the inherent limitations of relying solely on reward shaping for adapting to unseen target dynamics.

#### DARAIL Algorithm
The DARAIL algorithm ingeniously combines domain adaptation and reward-augmented imitation learning to tackle the challenge of off-dynamics reinforcement learning.  **It addresses the limitations of prior reward-modification methods** by first utilizing a modified reward function to train a policy in the source domain that mimics the behavior of an optimal policy in the target domain.  However, unlike previous methods, DARAIL doesn't directly deploy this policy to the target. Instead, **it leverages imitation learning** to transfer the policy's behavior, effectively generating similar trajectories in the target domain. This two-stage approach ensures better generalization to the target environment and improved performance. A key innovation is the **reward-augmented estimator**, which blends the source domain reward and information from a discriminator to improve policy optimization, leading to superior performance. The theoretical error bound provides a solid foundation, justifying the method's efficacy.

#### Reward Augmentation
Reward augmentation, in the context of reinforcement learning, particularly within the off-dynamics setting, is a crucial technique to bridge the gap between source and target domains.  It involves modifying the reward function in the source domain to encourage behaviors that would be optimal in the target domain, thereby mitigating the negative effects of dynamics mismatch. **This modification isn't a simple adjustment; rather, it requires careful consideration of the underlying dynamics and distribution of trajectories in both domains**. Effective reward augmentation methods ensure the source agent's experience closely resembles the target domain's optimal trajectory distribution.  However, relying solely on reward augmentation can be insufficient.  **Pure reward modification only indirectly influences the policy's behavior in the target domain**, and the learned policy's performance may still degrade upon deployment, as seen in the limitations of the DARC method.  Therefore, many advanced approaches integrate reward augmentation with other techniques like imitation learning, creating a hybrid model that combines the benefits of both strategies for more robust off-dynamics reinforcement learning.

#### Theoretical Analysis
A theoretical analysis section in a research paper provides a formal justification for the proposed method. It often involves deriving **error bounds** or **convergence rates** under specific assumptions.  This section is crucial for establishing the **method's reliability** and **predictive power**. The analysis might involve proving that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution, bounding the approximation error, or quantifying the impact of various factors. The assumptions made during theoretical analysis should be clearly stated, including any simplifications or limitations. A rigorous theoretical analysis enhances the paper's credibility, providing a solid mathematical foundation for the empirical results.  **Well-defined assumptions** and a **clear and concise presentation of the mathematical derivation** are essential for a successful theoretical analysis.

#### Future Work
The paper's "Future Work" section could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending DARAIL to handle more complex dynamics shifts** beyond those tested (e.g., variations in reward function, state space changes) would significantly expand its applicability.  **Investigating the sensitivity of DARAIL to different amounts of target domain data** is crucial; determining the minimum data required for effective transfer learning would improve its practical value.  **A theoretical analysis of DARAIL's robustness to model misspecification** and noise would enhance the theoretical foundations, addressing potential limitations in real-world applications.  **Evaluating the effectiveness of DARAIL in more safety-critical reinforcement learning tasks** is needed, to assess its potential for applications with high stakes such as autonomous driving. Finally, **comparing DARAIL with other advanced off-dynamics RL methods** that employ different techniques is important to show its relative performance and contributions.

> Figure 1: (a) Training reward in the source domain, i.e. ŒïœÄDARC, psrc [‚àëtr(st, at)], evaluation reward in the target domain, i.e. ŒïœÄDARC, ptrg [‚àëtr(st, at)] and optimal reward in target domain, for DARC in Ant. Evaluating the trained DARC policy in the target domain will cause performance degradation compared with its training reward, which should be close to the optimal reward in the target given DARC's objective function. Results of HalfCheetah, Walker2d, and Reacher are in Figure 9 in Appendix. (b) Learning framework of DARAIL. DARC Training: we first train the DARC in the source domain with a modified reward that is derived from the minimization of the reverse divergence between optimal policies on target and learned policies on the source. Details of DARC and the modified reward are in Section 3.1 and Appendix A.1. Discriminator training: the discriminator is trained to classify whether the data is from the expert demonstration (DARC trajectories) and provide a local reward function for policy learning. Generator training: the policy is updated with augmented reward estimation, which integrates the reward from the source domain and information from the discriminator. We first train DARC, collect DARC trajectories from the source domain, and then train the discriminator and the generator alternatively.

> üîº This figure compares the performance of DARAIL and IPS-ACL on two different environments (HalfCheetah and Walker2d) under various importance weight clipping intervals.  The results show that DARAIL consistently outperforms IPS-ACL across all conditions. Notably, IPS-ACL's performance is sensitive to the choice of clipping interval, achieving comparable results to DARAIL only under a specific interval ([0.01, 100]), while its performance degrades significantly with other intervals.
