However, training them using traditional divergence measures proved ineffective due to high gradient variance. Current training relies on minimizing the difference between proposal and target distributions, which can be less efficient.\nThis research paper tackles the limitations of current GFlowNet training. It introduces innovative variance-reduction techniques, using control variates, that substantially improve gradient estimation. The researchers also formally establish the connection between GFlowNets and HVI for broader distribution types, paving the way for new algorithmic improvements.", "affiliation": "School of Applied Mathematics", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "N5H4z0Pzvn/podcast.wav"}
