### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional time series forecasting methods often struggle with variable-length data and require separate model training for different prediction horizons.  Recent attempts to use Large Language Models (LLMs) have been hindered by the mismatch between LLMs' inherent autoregressive nature and the common non-autoregressive approaches used in time series forecasting.  This leads to inefficient use of LLM capabilities and often results in lower generalization performance.

AutoTimes directly addresses these issues. It introduces a novel method that fully leverages LLMs' autoregressive properties to forecast time series of arbitrary lengths. By representing time series as prompts and incorporating contextual information, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with only 0.1% trainable parameters and a significant speedup in training and inference compared to other LLM-based approaches. This method exhibits flexibility in handling variable-length lookback windows and scales well with larger LLMs, opening up exciting new possibilities for time series forecasting and foundation model development.

> üîº This figure compares two approaches for using LLMs in time series forecasting. (a) shows the prevalent non-autoregressive approach, where the LLM processes a flattened representation of the lookback series to generate predictions all at once. In contrast, the figure highlights the autoregressive approach proposed in the paper. This approach leverages the inherent autoregressive nature of LLMs for sequential prediction of the next token in the series. (b) demonstrates a comparison of prompting mechanisms.  The traditional method uses natural language prompts, which can introduce modality disparities. The proposed method leverages time series itself for prompting, a technique referred to as 'in-context forecasting'.

> üîº This table compares several Large Language Model for Time Series (LLM4TS) methods based on three key aspects: whether they are autoregressive, whether they freeze the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), and whether they are multimodal.  Autoregressive models generate predictions sequentially, using previous predictions to inform current ones. Freezing the LLM means that only a small set of parameters are trained, reducing computational cost. Multimodal methods incorporate data from sources other than just the time series, like textual descriptions or images. The table highlights that AutoTimes is unique in combining all three of these characteristics.

Prior to AutoTimes, none of the LLM4TS methods achieved all three.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM4TS Autoregression
LLM4TS (Large Language Models for Time Series) research has predominantly focused on non-autoregressive methods, treating LLMs as feature extractors rather than leveraging their inherent autoregressive capabilities for sequential prediction.  **Autoregressive approaches are crucial** because they directly align with the nature of time series data and the strength of LLMs in generating sequential outputs. By fully utilizing the autoregressive property of LLMs, models can naturally generate multi-step predictions with arbitrary lengths, overcoming limitations of non-autoregressive methods that often require separate models for different forecast horizons. **This inherent autoregressive nature offers significant advantages**, enabling more efficient and accurate forecasting, especially for longer prediction windows where error accumulation in non-autoregressive methods becomes a significant problem.  Furthermore, **autoregressive LLM4TS models may also improve zero-shot generalization**,  as the autoregressive training better captures the underlying sequential patterns in time series, leading to more robust models capable of handling unseen data.

#### In-context Forecasting
The concept of "In-context Forecasting" presented in the research paper proposes a novel approach to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting.  It suggests that instead of solely relying on a limited lookback window of time series data, the model's prediction context can be significantly enriched by incorporating relevant prior time series data as prompts. This method, termed "self-prompting," enhances forecasting accuracy by effectively extending the context beyond the immediate lookback period.  **The key advantage lies in the model's ability to learn from broader contextual patterns and dependencies**, thereby potentially improving forecasting accuracy and robustness. The paper further investigates the strategic selection of these prompts, exploring the impact of chronological ordering and the use of LLM-embedded timestamps to align multiple time series and maximize the benefits of this approach.  This innovation has the potential to significantly improve forecasting capabilities of LLMs in various applications by allowing for better context awareness and generalization to unseen data.

#### Multi-variate Time Series
Analyzing multivariate time series presents unique challenges and opportunities.  The inherent complexity arises from the interdependencies between multiple variables, requiring sophisticated models to capture these relationships effectively.  **Traditional univariate methods often fail to account for these interactions**, leading to inaccurate predictions.  Therefore, techniques designed specifically for multivariate data are essential, often involving vector autoregressive models (VAR) or dynamic factor models.  The selection of an appropriate model depends on the characteristics of the data, such as stationarity, autocorrelation, and the presence of non-linear relationships. **Dimensionality reduction techniques** can be beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional data, helping manage computational complexity and improving model interpretability.  **Forecasting accuracy in multivariate scenarios** is critically important for decision-making across numerous fields, including finance, environmental science, and healthcare, impacting resource allocation, risk management, and policy decisions. Advanced machine learning techniques, like deep learning, also show promise in tackling the complexities of multivariate time series analysis.

#### LLM Adaptation
LLM adaptation in time series forecasting involves leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for the task.  A crucial aspect is how the LLM is adapted to handle the sequential nature of time series data effectively.  **Common approaches include fine-tuning the LLM on a time series dataset, often adapting the input embedding layer to represent temporal data properly.**  However, this can be computationally expensive and may not fully exploit the LLM's inherent capabilities.  **Alternative strategies focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, which freeze most of the LLM's weights and only adjust a small set of parameters.  **Another key consideration is maintaining the autoregressive nature of the LLM, allowing it to generate predictions iteratively.**  This autoregressive approach, unlike some non-autoregressive methods, directly leverages the LLMs generative capacity.  **The choice of adaptation method significantly impacts the balance between model performance, training efficiency, and computational cost.**  Future research should explore more effective and efficient methods for LLM adaptation for enhanced accuracy and generalization in time series forecasting.

#### Future of LLM4TS
The future of LLMs in time series forecasting (LLM4TS) is bright, but faces challenges.  **Autoregressive approaches**, fully leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs, show great promise, surpassing non-autoregressive methods in accuracy and efficiency.  **In-context learning** allows for better generalization and adaptation to unseen data, reducing the reliance on extensive fine-tuning.  **Multimodal approaches**, integrating time series with other data types (text, images), will unlock new forecasting capabilities.  However, addressing **limitations in probabilistic forecasting**, improving computational efficiency for very large LLMs, and ensuring fair and responsible use of these powerful models remain key research areas.  Further exploration of **low-rank adaptation** techniques offers a path to reduce the computational burden and enhance the efficiency of LLM adaptation.  Developing robust methods for **prompt engineering** and context selection is also crucial for maximizing the performance and reliability of LLM4TS models in real-world applications.

A single model is trained on each dataset and then used to predict four different forecast lengths (96, 192, 336, and 720 time steps). AutoTimes uses a context length of 672, while other methods use an input length of 672 and an output length of 96. The table shows the average results across all four forecast lengths, with complete results available in Table 10. This setup tests the model's ability to generalize to different prediction horizons without retraining.

> üîº This table presents the results of forecasting experiments on three additional benchmark datasets, namely Australian Electricity, Bdg-2 Panther, and Oikolab Weather.  The experiments use a lookback length of 672 time steps and predict the next 96 time steps.  The table compares the performance of AutoTimes against three other state-of-the-art forecasting models: PatchTST, iTransformer, and DLinear. The metrics used for comparison are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

> üîº This table presents the results of experiments using different strategies for selecting time series prompts in in-context forecasting. Four different strategies are compared: (P.1) using only the lookback window, (P.2) combining the lookback window with a prompt from the first 2F time points of the series, (P.3) combining the lookback window with a prompt from the last 2F time points of the series, and (P.4) combining the lookback window with a prompt from 2F time points of another series. The results are presented in terms of averaged error for four different time series frequencies (Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, Others). Strategy P.2 and P.3 show improvement over P.1, while P.4 shows negative results as expected.

> üîº This table presents the results of an ablation study on different prompt selection strategies for in-context forecasting.  The study compares the performance of using different methods to select the time series prompts that are concatenated with the lookback window to form the context for prediction. The strategies include using the first 2F time points, the last 2F time points, randomly selected time points, and time points from other uncorrelated time series. The average error for each strategy is reported, illustrating the significant impact of prompt engineering on forecasting performance and highlighting the importance of using relevant and periodic time series prompts.

> üîº This table presents the ablation study comparing the performance of AutoTimes with a variant called 'FlattenHead'.  FlattenHead replaces the segment-wise projection used in AutoTimes with a simpler flatten linear head, a common approach in non-autoregressive forecasting models. The results demonstrate that the performance of the non-autoregressive method (FlattenHead) is consistently inferior to the autoregressive approach (AutoTimes), highlighting the importance of AutoTimes' autoregressive design for better performance.
