This is because these systems rely on single-point estimations which do not capture the context distribution of the data. \nThis paper introduces **Quantile Activation (QACT)**, a novel activation function which outputs the relative quantile of a sample within its context distribution instead of its absolute value. Experiments on various distorted datasets show that QACT significantly **outperforms** traditional methods, maintaining class structure even under severe distortions. This is particularly evident in its better handling of distortions compared to the state-of-the-art DINOv2, even with a significantly smaller model.  The improved generalization offered by QACT makes it a promising technique for various applications where robust performance is critical.
