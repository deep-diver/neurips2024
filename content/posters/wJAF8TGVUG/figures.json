It shows two encoders, fe and gy. Encoder fe processes limited labeled molecules using contrastive learning to generate a similarity matrix and embeddings. Encoder gy processes the full dataset (labeled and unlabeled molecules).  The embeddings from fe, without gradient updates, are used to compute a similarity matrix. Optimal transport is then used to transfer information from fe to gy, generating soft labels for gy which are used in training along with the full data similarity matrix. The framework combines semi-supervised contrastive learning with optimal transport to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for more effective molecule search.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "wJAF8TGVUG/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: t-SNE visualization of molecular representations learned by S-MolSearch versus pretrained checkpoint.

Different colors represent molecules that bind to different protein targets. The visualization aims to show how well the different methods separate molecules according to their target protein. The S-MolSearch model shows clearer separation between different targets and tighter clustering within each target, suggesting that it learns more informative representations that better capture the relationships between molecular structure and activity.", "section": "3.2 Pretraining Backbone of Molecular Encoder"}, {"figure_path": "wJAF8TGVUG/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: t-SNE visualization of molecular representations learned by S-MolSearch versus pretrained checkpoint.
