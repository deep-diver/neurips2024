However, existing methods often lack theoretical guarantees and struggle with limited data during the meta-test. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel bilevel optimization framework (BO-MRL) that learns a meta-prior for task-specific policy adaptation.  Unlike single-step methods, BO-MRL uses one-time data collection followed by multiple-step policy optimization, improving data efficiency. \nThe core contribution of this paper is the development of a universal policy optimization algorithm that is applicable to various existing policy optimization algorithms.  It also provides theoretical upper bounds on the expected optimality gap, quantifying model generalizability. The effectiveness of the proposed BO-MRL is empirically validated against benchmark methods, demonstrating superior performance.  The rigorous analysis provides new theoretical insights into meta-RL, pushing the field towards more robust and efficient algorithms.", "affiliation": "Pennsylvania State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "rpjh69DUX2/podcast.wav"}
