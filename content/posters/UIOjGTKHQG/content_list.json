However, such strong ability relies on a huge amount of computing resources, which makes it difficult to deploy LLMs on computing resource-constrained platforms. Currently, LLMs process each token equivalently, but we argue that not every word is equally important. Some words should not be allocated excessive computing resources, particularly for dispensable terms in simple questions. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic inference paradigm for LLMs, namely D-LLMs, which adaptively allocate computing resources in token processing. We design a dynamic decision module for each transformer layer that decides whether a network unit should be executed or skipped. Moreover, we tackle the issue of adapting D-LLMs to real-world applications, specifically concerning the missing KV-cache when layers are skipped. To overcome this, we propose a simple yet effective eviction policy to exclude the skipped layers from subsequent attention calculations. The eviction policy not only enables D-LLMs to be compatible with prevalent applications but also reduces considerable storage resources. Experimentally, D-LLMs show superior performance, in terms of computational cost and KV storage utilization. It can reduce up to $45\\%$ computational cost and KV storage on Q&A, summarization, and math solving tasks, $50\\%$ on commonsense reasoning tasks.

Benefiting from existing parameter-efficient finetuning strategies [30, 44, 54, 66, 84], LLMs can also be adapted to specific domains with extra training costs. However, such models containing billions of parameters require expensive computation costs and memory overhead at the inference stage. Thus, deploying LLMs on resource-constrained platforms becomes challenging especially considering the ever-growing requirements for offilne using, model customizing, and data privacy [10, 14, 16, 50, 61, 63, 83]. To alleviate this problem, various inference acceleration techniques have been proposed, e.g., quantization [4, 42, 57, 76, 79], distillation [24, 39, 40, 64, 65], and pruning [51, 52, 77, 81, 82]. Among these methods, pruning is a typical structural compression method to reduce the participating network layers. These methods usually remove redundant neurons based on hand-crafted metrics [37, 78], when optimizing or finetuning large language models. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Although previous methods can decrease computational cost, many essential characteristics of natural languages are ignored. First, tasks of different difficulties should not be allocated with the same computing resource. Obviously, a response to \"how are you\" is much easier than \"explaining a math theorem\". More importantly, not every word in a sentence is equally important. Thus, it is not necessary to allocate too much computing resources to non-critical tokens, i.e., articles and punctuation marks. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic inference mechanism, namely D-LLMs, which can boost inference speeds by dynamically skipping redundant network components. Specifically, we assign an execution decision module for each transformer layer. Before going through a transformer layer, tokens need to pass through the decision module to obtain an execution decision. Based on the execution decision, D-LLMs would adaptively decide whether the following layer should be executed or skipped. Thus, dispensable tokens and simple tasks would utilize much fewer layers than relevant tokens and difficult tasks. Another critical issue that should be emphasized here is how to apply such dynamic inference mechanism on LLMs, e.g., LLaMA [69], GPT [55, 58], etc. Note that it is unacceptable to retrain or finetune entire models due to the high computational overhead and massive training data. Therefore, we combine our strategy with finetuning methods by inserting low-rank adaptors, LoRA [30], for well pre-trained large language models.

However, to deploy such dynamic inference networks for realistic scenarios, making this dynamic inference compatible with KV-cache strategies [13, 21, 29] is a crucial challenge. Compared with static inference networks which cache all KV embeddings of previous tokens, dynamic inference networks selectively skip layers would lead to KV-cache misses. To tackle this issue, we design a simple yet effective eviction strategy on KV-cache in our proposed D-LLMs framework. Specifically, we evict the KV embeddings of uncalculated transformer layers in previous tokens and simplify the regular causal masks to sparse ones. For example, if a given token skips a transformer layer at the inference time, it would not be included in self-attention calculation of subsequent tokens. This way, the attention mask in each layer is also dynamically changed according to the execution decisions of preceding tokens.

Due to the large amount of computational cost of training LLMs, various parameter efficient finetuning methods have been explored, including prompt-based learning methods [7, 19, 25, 41, 80], adapter-based learning methods[27, 34, 67, 74] and reparametrizationbased learning methods [11, 15, 30, 45]. Prompt-based learning methods propose to insert and infer a collection of trainable embeddings to existing tokens. For example, P-tuning [47] adds a prefix to input, and P-tuning v2 [46] applies prompts to intermediate layers. Adapter-based learning methods propose to insert specially designed adaptors to pre-trained LLMs. How to insert adaptors has also been explored, i.e., Adamix [74] and Compacter [34] serially connect adaptors and [27, 67] parallelly connect adaptors with transformer.

Specifically, LoRA [30] decomposes parameters into two low-rank trainable matrices before computation.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "LLMs Acceleration Methods. Extensive research works have been proposed to compress LLMs and reduce the network parameters. Among these methods, quantization [4, 36, 42, 57, 62], distillation [24, 39, 40, 64, 65] and pruning [38, 43, 48, 51, 82] are mainstream approaches. Quantization methods propose to reduce the bits of each parameter by converting floating-point (FP32 / FP16) parameters to integers (INT8 / INT4) or other discrete forms. This line of methods preserves the structural characteristics of the network and compresses models in exchange for lowering accuracy. Distillation methods [24, 39, 40] attempt to transfer knowledge from LLMs to a lightweight student model. However, such methods usually require retraining models in an end-to-end manner and may take up large computing resources. Model pruning methods propose to reduce the complexity of models by removing redundant parameters. These methods have two forms, static pruning [3, 18, 23] and dynamic pruning [2, 12, 21, 29, 49, 81]. Static pruning methods usually remove redundant layers based on various relevant metrics. For example, Shortened-LLaMA [35] measures the importance of layers and prunes the unnecessary ones. However, with the increase of pruned parameters, static pruning poses inevitable performance degradation. Dynamic pruning methods tend to prune unimportance layers based on inputs. For example, Ada-Infer [17] introduces an early-exit mechanism to stop the inference at intermediate layers. Mixture-of-Depths [59] measures the importance of each token and only calculates the top-k tokens at different layers.

Dynamic inference is a promising technique to skip layers at inference time to achieve acceleration [70, 71, 72, 73], which was initially proposed in computer visions. Research on dynamic inference mechanisms has two different approaches. The first one is layer skipping. This line of methods mainly focus on how to design a specific dynamic decision module or metric to reduce computational cost. Specifically, ConvNet-AIG [70] uses a convolutional module to define the inference graph conditioned on inputs. It proposes a router to make the execution decision for each model layer. SkipNet [73] utilizes LSTM as the decision module to determine whether a layer should be executed or not. Besides, CoDiNet [72] attempts to model the relationship between the inputs and their executing decisions to enhance the optimization. The second line of methods is early prediction. While a dynamic inference network has only one exit, an early prediction network is characterized by multiple exits. In early prediction networks, the execution would stop once a criterion for a given sample is satisfied. MSDN [31] is a typical example, which introduces multiple early-exits, according to the allowed time budget. Instead of bypassing all units, DCP [20] generated decisions to reduce the computational cost on channels.
