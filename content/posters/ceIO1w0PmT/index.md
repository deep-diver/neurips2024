### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current vision-language-action (VLA) models for instruction-following agents struggle with open-world environments due to challenges in handling complex, context-dependent tasks and long-term interactions.  Prior methods either rely on separate controllers for action execution or directly output commands, both of which have limitations. 

OmniJARVIS tackles these issues by introducing a unified tokenization scheme for multimodal interaction data.  This allows the model to jointly process vision, language, and action information, facilitating more robust reasoning, planning, and execution.  **The key innovation lies in the self-supervised behavior tokenizer, which discretizes behavior trajectories into semantically meaningful tokens integrated into a pretrained multimodal language model.** This approach leads to improved performance on a wide range of Minecraft tasks.

> üîº This figure illustrates the multimodal interaction data used for decision-making in the OmniJARVIS model.  It shows a sequence of human interaction steps, starting with an instruction and memory, progressing through observations, chain-of-thought reasoning, and finally resulting in a behavior trajectory.  The OmniJARVIS model uniquely unifies these different modalities (vision, language, action) into a single autoregressive sequence for prediction. A key component is a self-supervised behavior encoder that converts actions into discrete behavior tokens, which are then incorporated into the overall sequence.

A canonical interaction sequence depicting the human decision-making process starts from a given task instruction and memory, followed by a series of sub-task completion which involves initial observations, chain-of-thought reasoning, and behavior trajectories. Our proposed VLA model OmniJARVIS jointly models the vision (observations), language (instructions, memories, thoughts), and actions (behavior trajectories) as unified autoregressive sequence prediction. A self-supervised behavior encoder (detailed in Section 2 and Figure 2) converts the actions into behavior tokens while the other modalities are tokenized following the practices of MLMs [31, 3, 1].

### In-depth insights


#### Unified VLA Tokenization
The concept of "Unified VLA Tokenization" centers on representing vision, language, and action data within a single, unified token space.  This approach offers several key advantages. First, it facilitates **more effective multimodal reasoning** by allowing a model to directly relate observations, instructions, and actions.  Second, **unified tokenization enables the use of powerful autoregressive transformer models**, which excel at processing sequential data and capturing long-range dependencies between different modalities.  This is crucial for complex, open-world tasks where decisions depend on a history of interactions.  Third, **unified tokenization simplifies model architecture**, avoiding the need for complex interfaces between separate vision, language, and action processing modules. This leads to improved efficiency in training and inference.  Finally,  **this approach offers potential for better generalization**, since the model learns to integrate information from all modalities seamlessly. However, challenges remain in developing effective tokenization schemes that capture the nuances of multimodal data, and sufficient training data is crucial to realize the potential of this approach.

#### Behavior Token Design
Effective behavior tokenization is crucial for bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level actions in embodied agents.  A well-designed tokenization scheme should **capture the semantic essence of action trajectories**, allowing the model to understand not just individual actions, but also their temporal relationships and overall intent.  This requires careful consideration of various factors, including **granularity**, which determines the level of detail encoded in each token; **vocabulary size**, balancing expressiveness with computational feasibility; and **training methodology**, employing techniques like self-supervised learning or reinforcement learning to efficiently learn meaningful token representations.  **Choosing an appropriate encoding method (e.g., one-hot encoding, vector quantization)** is essential. It's also vital to ensure the tokens are **compatible with other modalities** (e.g., vision and language) within the unified multimodal model, enabling seamless integration and information flow across different representations.  Finally, a robust evaluation methodology is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the token design in improving the agent's performance across various tasks and environments.  Ideally, the design should be **scalable and adaptable** to diverse tasks and complexities, ensuring the system can handle increasingly challenging and diverse real-world scenarios.

#### Minecraft Experiments
A hypothetical section on "Minecraft Experiments" within a research paper would likely detail the use of the Minecraft game environment for evaluating an AI agent's capabilities.  The experiments would need to be carefully designed to test specific aspects of the agent, such as **navigation**, **resource management**, **tool use**, and **problem-solving**.  A well-designed experimental setup might involve a series of increasingly complex tasks within Minecraft, starting with simple instructions and gradually progressing to more open-ended challenges.  The metrics for evaluating performance would be crucial, and these could include task completion success rates, efficiency (time to completion), resource utilization, and the robustness of the agent's actions.  **Control groups** or baselines (e.g., other AI agents or human players) would be essential for demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.  The challenges of using Minecraft as an experimental platform would also warrant discussion, including the inherent variability of the game environment and the computational cost of simulating Minecraft.   Finally, a thorough analysis of the results, identifying both strengths and limitations of the AI agent, would be vital for drawing valuable insights and guiding future research. **Qualitative data analysis** of the agent's decision-making processes could complement quantitative results.

#### Open-World Challenges
Open-world environments present significant challenges for AI agents due to their **unpredictability and complexity**. Unlike controlled lab settings, open worlds lack predefined rules, goals, and interactions.  Agents must handle unexpected events, dynamic situations, and incomplete information.  **Robustness** becomes paramount; agents must be able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, recover from failures, and make effective decisions with limited knowledge. This requires advanced reasoning capabilities, including planning, learning, and adaptation, often within a **multi-modal context** (integrating vision, language, and action).  Furthermore, **generalization** is critical; an effective open-world agent should be capable of performing a wide range of tasks across diverse environments and situations, without extensive retraining for each new scenario.  Addressing these challenges requires breakthroughs in several areas, such as representation learning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge transfer, to build truly adaptable and intelligent agents.

#### Future Scale Potential
The "Future Scale Potential" of large language models (LLMs) for vision-language-action (VLA) tasks, like those explored in OmniJARVIS, is significant but multifaceted.  **Scaling up both model size and dataset size is crucial**, as demonstrated by the consistent performance improvements observed with larger models and more data.  However, **diminishing returns** may become apparent at a certain point.  The relationship between model scale and performance is not always linear; careful consideration of the cost-benefit ratio is needed.  While simply increasing model parameters can be effective, **research into more efficient model architectures** is necessary to continue improving performance and generalization without exponential resource growth.  Furthermore, the quality of interaction data is critical.  **More sophisticated data collection and augmentation techniques** could unlock further improvements, particularly for open-world scenarios.  Finally, exploring **transfer learning** across different tasks and environments could reduce the need for extensive, task-specific training, maximizing scalability.

Three different model sizes (2B, 7B, and 13B parameters) are shown. As expected, the loss decreases as the amount of training data increases for all model sizes.  The near-linear relationship in the log-log plot indicates that OmniJARVIS follows a power law scaling behavior, a characteristic observed in many large language models. The Pearson correlation coefficients close to 1 confirm a strong relationship between training data size and performance for each model, with larger models showing slightly slower improvements.

(a) shows a simple, high-frequency model directly mapping instructions to actions based on the current state. (b) presents a hierarchical model using a large language model for planning and a separate controller for execution.  (c) illustrates OmniJARVIS, which uses a self-supervised behavior tokenizer to create behavior tokens that are jointly modeled with vision and language, enabling more efficient and seamless action generation.

> <summary>read the caption</summary>
> Figure 8: Comparative Framework of Vision-Language Action Models. (a) depicts a model where upon receiving a language instruction, actions are directly output based on the environmental state, facilitating immediate interaction with the environment at a unified frequency. Smaller models with <1B parameters like VPT [2] maintain higher frequencies (>20Hz), though their capability for complex reasoning tasks is limited. Larger models with >7B parameters such as RT-2 [6], offer enhanced performance but operate at significantly reduced frequencies (2-3Hz). (b) illustrates a common approach utilizing large vision-language models for planning, subsequently outputting language goals [46, 14, 4]. A language-conditioned policy then translates these language goals into actions at a real-time interaction rate of 20Hz, with high-level models re-planning at less than 1Hz. This hierarchical structure balances interaction frequency and performance, while it requires language as an intermediary and additional language labels. The training process of high-level vision-language models and language-conditioned policies are separate, thus performing poorly on tasks that can not be easily connected by language. (c) (ours) mirrors the hierarchical structure of (b) but differentiates by employing a self-supervised encoder-decoder policy [10] and FSQ quantization [34] as a behavior tokenizer. The upper-level vision-language models produce self-supervised behavior tokens, which are then conditioned by a policy decoder to output actions, facilitating environment interaction. The behavior tokens are injected into the training corpus of vision-language-action models, which enables end-to-end inference. This approach also eliminates the need for external language supervision and scales efficiently.
