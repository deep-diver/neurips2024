The methods are High Rank PCFD, PCFD, linear and RBF signature MMDs, linear and RBF classical MMDs, and High Rank signature MMDs. The Hurst parameter H, which ranges from 0.4 to 0.6, is used to control the degree of long-range dependence. The test power, representing the probability that the method correctly rejects the null hypothesis (that the two processes are identical), is reported as the mean and standard deviation over 5 runs.
