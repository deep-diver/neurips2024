{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in machine learning and data markets. It offers **a novel, scalable, and federated approach** to data acquisition, eliminating the need for labeled validation data and directly optimizing for test set prediction.  This significantly advances the field by addressing the limitations of existing data valuation methods and opens **new avenues for research** into decentralized data marketplaces and efficient data acquisition techniques.", "summary": "Federated data acquisition via experimental design (DAVED) achieves lower prediction error without labeled validation data, optimizing cost-effectively for test-set predictions in decentralized markets.", "takeaways": ["DAVED achieves lower prediction error without relying on labeled validation data.", "The method directly optimizes data acquisition for test set prediction, unlike prior data valuation techniques.", "DAVED is highly scalable and can be implemented in a federated manner, making it suitable for decentralized data markets."], "tldr": "Acquiring training data is critical for machine learning, but current methods often assume centralized access. This is problematic as data owners are increasingly resistant to indiscriminate data collection, leading to the development of data marketplaces.  However, choosing the most valuable data points from a seller poses a significant challenge for buyers in such a market.\n\nThis research introduces DAVED (Data Acquisition via Experimental Design), a novel federated approach inspired by linear experimental design.  DAVED directly optimizes data selection for test set prediction without needing labeled validation data.  The method is shown to be highly scalable, computationally efficient, and cost-effective.  Importantly, it avoids the overfitting problems associated with validation-based approaches and thus better addresses the unique challenges posed by decentralized data marketplaces.
