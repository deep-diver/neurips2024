[{"heading_title": "Imbalanced Data Synth", "details": {"summary": "Addressing **imbalanced datasets** is crucial in machine learning, as traditional algorithms often struggle with skewed class distributions.  Synthetic data generation offers a potential solution by augmenting the minority class, thus improving model performance.  However, simply generating synthetic data may introduce artifacts or fail to accurately reflect the underlying data distribution.  **Effective methods** must consider feature correlations, value ranges, and relationships between numerical and categorical variables, all while avoiding overfitting or generating unrealistic samples.  This requires careful design, potentially leveraging techniques like **in-context learning** within large language models (LLMs) to better capture subtleties of the original data.  **Prompt engineering**, which involves crafting specific instructions for the LLM, plays a vital role in steering the generation process and ensuring the synthetic data complements the original data effectively.   Ultimately, success hinges on carefully balancing the benefits of increased data volume with the need to maintain data integrity and realistic feature representation."}}, {"heading_title": "Prompt Engineering", "details": {"summary": "Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in effectively leveraging large language models (LLMs) for tabular data generation, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets.  **Careful prompt design is essential to guide the LLM in generating realistic synthetic data that accurately captures feature correlations and represents minority classes adequately.**  The choice of data format (e.g., CSV vs. sentence-style), class presentation (single-class vs. multi-class, balanced vs. unbalanced ratios), variable mapping (original values vs. unique mappings), and task specification (explicit instructions vs. completion triggering) significantly impacts the quality and efficiency of the generated data.  **The study highlights the effectiveness of balanced, grouped data samples combined with unique variable mappings in ensuring clear distinction and variability among variables, ultimately leading to improved model performance.**  Further research should explore optimal strategies for handling large datasets within the token limitations of LLMs and investigate the generalizability of prompt design principles across various model architectures."}}, {"heading_title": "LLM-based Data Gen", "details": {"summary": "LLM-based data generation represents a **paradigm shift** in synthetic data creation.  Leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of large language models offers the potential to generate high-quality, diverse datasets, especially valuable for addressing **class imbalance** issues prevalent in many real-world applications.  **Prompt engineering** plays a crucial role, with careful design of prompts significantly impacting the quality and characteristics of generated data.  While **model-agnostic** approaches are preferred, different LLMs may exhibit varying performance, necessitating careful consideration of model selection.  **Balanced data representation** within prompts is key for accurate minority class generation, alongside unique variable mapping to enhance data variability and avoid repetitive patterns.  However, challenges remain, such as potential biases in generated data reflecting the biases present in training data, and limitations in fully representing complex data distributions, particularly in very large datasets where only subsets can be used for prompt examples. Future research should focus on optimizing prompt design for enhanced data quality and efficiency, and also exploring the integration of LLMs with existing generative models to combine the strengths of both approaches."}}, {"heading_title": "EPIC's Strengths", "details": {"summary": "EPIC demonstrates several key strengths.  **Its model-agnostic nature** allows for flexibility in choosing the underlying LLM, adapting to various models and resource constraints.  The **simplicity and ease of implementation** are significant advantages, requiring minimal preprocessing and making it accessible to researchers with varying levels of expertise.  **Improved generation efficiency** is another key benefit, producing high-quality data faster than comparable methods.  Furthermore, **robustness and practicality** are underscored by its strong performance across diverse, real-world datasets, even in the face of class imbalances.
