### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications rely on tabular data, but data scarcity and class imbalance hinder machine learning model performance.  Traditional methods like SMOTE struggle with complex relationships within data.  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, but require extensive fine-tuning, risking overfitting.  This increases the risk of poor performance.



The paper introduces EPIC, a novel prompting method.  EPIC leverages LLMs' in-context learning abilities, using balanced data samples and unique variable mapping in the prompts. This guides the LLMs to accurately generate synthetic data for all classes, handling imbalance effectively.  Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrated state-of-the-art classification performance and significantly improved generation efficiency.  The method is model-agnostic, easy to implement, and practical for various applications.

### In-depth insights


#### Imbalanced Data Synth
Addressing **imbalanced datasets** is crucial in machine learning, as traditional algorithms often struggle with skewed class distributions.  Synthetic data generation offers a potential solution by augmenting the minority class, thus improving model performance.  However, simply generating synthetic data may introduce artifacts or fail to accurately reflect the underlying data distribution.  **Effective methods** must consider feature correlations, value ranges, and relationships between numerical and categorical variables, all while avoiding overfitting or generating unrealistic samples.  This requires careful design, potentially leveraging techniques like **in-context learning** within large language models (LLMs) to better capture subtleties of the original data.  **Prompt engineering**, which involves crafting specific instructions for the LLM, plays a vital role in steering the generation process and ensuring the synthetic data complements the original data effectively.   Ultimately, success hinges on carefully balancing the benefits of increased data volume with the need to maintain data integrity and realistic feature representation.

#### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in effectively leveraging large language models (LLMs) for tabular data generation, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets.  **Careful prompt design is essential to guide the LLM in generating realistic synthetic data that accurately captures feature correlations and represents minority classes adequately.**  The choice of data format (e.g., CSV vs. sentence-style), class presentation (single-class vs. multi-class, balanced vs. unbalanced ratios), variable mapping (original values vs. unique mappings), and task specification (explicit instructions vs. completion triggering) significantly impacts the quality and efficiency of the generated data.  **The study highlights the effectiveness of balanced, grouped data samples combined with unique variable mappings in ensuring clear distinction and variability among variables, ultimately leading to improved model performance.**  Further research should explore optimal strategies for handling large datasets within the token limitations of LLMs and investigate the generalizability of prompt design principles across various model architectures.

#### LLM-based Data Gen
LLM-based data generation represents a **paradigm shift** in synthetic data creation.  Leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of large language models offers the potential to generate high-quality, diverse datasets, especially valuable for addressing **class imbalance** issues prevalent in many real-world applications.  **Prompt engineering** plays a crucial role, with careful design of prompts significantly impacting the quality and characteristics of generated data.  While **model-agnostic** approaches are preferred, different LLMs may exhibit varying performance, necessitating careful consideration of model selection.  **Balanced data representation** within prompts is key for accurate minority class generation, alongside unique variable mapping to enhance data variability and avoid repetitive patterns.  However, challenges remain, such as potential biases in generated data reflecting the biases present in training data, and limitations in fully representing complex data distributions, particularly in very large datasets where only subsets can be used for prompt examples. Future research should focus on optimizing prompt design for enhanced data quality and efficiency, and also exploring the integration of LLMs with existing generative models to combine the strengths of both approaches.

#### EPIC's Strengths
EPIC demonstrates several key strengths.  **Its model-agnostic nature** allows for flexibility in choosing the underlying LLM, adapting to various models and resource constraints.  The **simplicity and ease of implementation** are significant advantages, requiring minimal preprocessing and making it accessible to researchers with varying levels of expertise.  **Improved generation efficiency** is another key benefit, producing high-quality data faster than comparable methods.  Furthermore, **robustness and practicality** are underscored by its strong performance across diverse, real-world datasets, even in the face of class imbalances.  Finally, the **state-of-the-art classification performance** achieved when using synthetic data generated by EPIC highlights its effectiveness in enhancing machine learning workflows.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques** to further enhance the quality and diversity of synthetic tabular data generated by LLMs.  Investigating the impact of different LLM architectures and sizes on the effectiveness of EPIC is also warranted.  **A key area to explore is handling complex data patterns**, such as multi-modal data or data with extensive missing values.  Further work should focus on the development of **robust evaluation metrics that go beyond standard classification performance** to fully capture the quality of the synthetic data and its suitability for various downstream tasks.  Finally, **research on the ethical implications** of using LLMs for data generation, particularly concerning bias mitigation and ensuring data privacy, is crucial for responsible deployment of this technology.

> üîº This table shows the percentage point improvement in F1 score, balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity achieved by adding synthetic data generated using the proposed EPIC method compared to the original dataset for each of the six datasets used in the study (Travel, Sick, HELOC, Income, Diabetes, and Thyroid).  Positive values indicate improvements, while negative values indicate decreases in performance compared to using only the original data. The table highlights the consistent improvements achieved by the EPIC method across various datasets and metrics.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of machine learning (ML) classification performance results when synthetic data generated by different methods are added to the original dataset. The results are averaged over four different classifiers, each run five times.  It shows the F1 score, Balanced Accuracy (BAL ACC), Sensitivity, and Specificity for various methods including TVAE, CTAB-GAN+, GReaT, TabDDPM, and the proposed method EPIC.  The table allows for a comparison of the performance gains or losses when using synthetic data generated by different methods, providing insights into the effectiveness and potential benefits or drawbacks of each approach.

> üîº This table compares the F1 scores achieved by several robust tabular classification models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, GB, TabPFN, T-Table, and TabR) on the Travel dataset.  The comparison is made using three different scenarios: the original dataset alone, the original dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by the proposed EPIC method, and the original dataset augmented with synthetic data from the TabDDPM and GReaT methods.  The results illustrate the performance improvement achieved by using the EPIC synthetic data generation method.

Four different classifiers (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and gradient boosting classifier) were used, each run five times. The table shows the F1 score, balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each method on different datasets (Travel, Sick, HELOC, Income, Diabetes, and Thyroid). The 'Original' row shows the performance of the original dataset without added synthetic data, and other rows show the performance when synthetic data generated by different methods (TVAE, CopulaGAN, CTGAN, GReaT, TabDDPM, and the proposed 'Ours' method) are added.  The complete results including standard deviations and the results of all the baseline methods are available in Appendix F.2.
