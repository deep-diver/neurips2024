### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Training large neural networks often employs learning rate warmup, which gradually increases the learning rate from a low initial value, but its benefits are not fully understood.  This paper investigates why large initial updates can destabilize training, focusing on small-scale GPT training.  The authors analyze different metrics for update size, including the l2-norm, directional change, and impact on network representations. They found large initial updates to be problematic.

This research explores how modifications to optimizers (like AdamW and Lion) can reduce the need for warmup.  Specifically, modifications to explicitly normalize updates based on these metrics significantly reduced or eliminated the need for warmup.  The findings suggest that the benefits of warmup are tied to controlling initial update size, primarily by mitigating large angular updates and high initial gradient signal-to-noise ratio. High momentum also contributes to efficient training, suggesting that careful design of optimizers might be able to remove the need for learning rate warmup altogether.

### In-depth insights


#### Warmup's Mysteries
The concept of "warmup" in neural network training, particularly for large language models, presents several intriguing mysteries.  While empirically beneficial, its effectiveness remains poorly understood.  **The paper delves into why initial updates are often too large**, leading to instability, and explores different metrics to quantify this, such as the l2-norm and angular update size.  **A key finding is that large angular updates and high gradient correlation early in training contribute significantly to the need for warmup.**  The authors propose optimizer modifications, such as normalizing updates based on these metrics, which substantially reduces the need for explicit warmup in smaller-scale GPT training.  **However, it is shown that simply controlling the l2-norm or angular update size isn't sufficient**; a new metric focused on changes to the internal network representation is introduced, indicating that the effective update size is more complex than previously thought. The interplay of momentum and bias correction within optimizers like AdamW further complicates the dynamics of warmup, highlighting the nuanced and often non-intuitive behavior of this critical training technique.  **Ultimately, the paper argues that effective warmup strategies should aim to control the rate of change in network representations**.

#### AdamW Momentum Bias
AdamW, an adaptive learning rate optimizer, incorporates momentum to accelerate convergence.  However, **AdamW's momentum mechanism introduces a bias, particularly noticeable in early training stages**. This bias manifests as artificially large initial updates, potentially disrupting the optimization trajectory and necessitating learning rate warmup.  The bias correction term in AdamW, while intended to mitigate this issue, proves insufficient in certain scenarios, especially when early gradients are highly correlated.  **Analyzing the interaction between momentum and gradient magnitude is crucial for understanding this effect**. Modifying the optimizer to directly control update norms, either via normalization techniques or by scaling matrices, offers a potential pathway toward reducing or eliminating the need for warmup while addressing AdamW's momentum bias.  This addresses the core problem of large updates early in training by decoupling learning rate scheduling from the intrinsic dynamics of momentum.

#### Angular Update Control
The concept of 'Angular Update Control' in the context of neural network optimization is a novel approach focusing on the directional aspect of weight updates, rather than just their magnitude.  **Instead of solely considering the L2-norm of updates, this method emphasizes the change in the angle of weight vectors**. This is particularly relevant for adaptive optimizers that inherently normalize the update size, potentially masking underlying issues. By regulating angular updates, the approach aims to mitigate issues arising from highly correlated gradients early in training, promoting smoother transitions in feature learning and enhancing training stability.  **This control can be achieved through specific optimizer modifications, for example, by incorporating mechanisms that directly limit the angular change of weight vectors**. This refined control offers a promising alternative to traditional learning rate warmup strategies, providing a new perspective and potentially leading to more efficient and stable training.  **The effectiveness of angular update control highlights the importance of considering directional changes in weight space**, offering a more nuanced approach to optimizing neural network training.

#### SNR & RRC Analysis
The analysis of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Relative Representation Change (RRC) offers a novel perspective on learning rate warmup.  **High initial SNR correlates with large early changes in network representations**, potentially destabilizing training.  The RRC, measuring the relative change in network outputs due to weight updates, provides a more direct measure of this instability than the commonly used L2 update norm.  **Modifying optimizers to control either SNR or RRC can reduce the need for warmup**, demonstrating that the problem stems from the magnitude of representation changes, not just the magnitude of weight updates. This research highlights a critical need for better methods to quantify and control the impact of updates on the network's internal representations during the initial stages of training.

#### Future of Warmup
The "Future of Warmup" in neural network training hinges on **a deeper understanding of its mechanisms**.  While empirical success is evident, the lack of theoretical clarity surrounding its benefits necessitates further investigation.  Future research should focus on refining metrics beyond simple l2-norm and angular updates to capture the impact on internal representations. **Developing adaptive methods that dynamically adjust warmup based on gradient characteristics and network dynamics** is crucial.  Exploring relationships between warmup, optimizer choice, and network architectures will unlock more efficient training strategies.  **The interplay between momentum and warmup** merits further attention, given its impact on the effective update size and the angular displacement of weight vectors. Ultimately, a predictive framework for warmup's effectiveness, potentially based on gradient signal-to-noise ratios or curvature measures, is needed. This will lead to optimal warmup schemes tailored to specific training contexts, eventually minimizing or eliminating the need for this heuristic entirely. The goal is not simply to understand warmup better, but to **transition from a heuristic to a principled, theoretically grounded training technique**.

> This figure shows the impact of large initial updates on the performance of a ResNet-20 model trained on CIFAR-10.  Two training methods are compared: standard ReLU activation and Leaky ReLU activation.  Initial update sizes are scaled by factors of 1, 8, and 128 for both methods. The results indicate that even with extended training (800 epochs), the performance gap caused by large initial updates persists.  However, using Leaky ReLU activation reduces the performance degradation, suggesting that network non-linearities play a significant role in the impact of large initial updates.
