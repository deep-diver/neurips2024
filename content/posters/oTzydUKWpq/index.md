### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly graph injection attacks (GIAs). Existing research primarily focuses on embedding-level GIAs, which inject node embeddings rather than actual textual content. This limitation simplifies detection and limits applicability.  Moreover, embedding-level attacks are often unrealistic and lack interpretability. 

This paper introduces text-level GIAs, injecting textual content instead of embeddings. Three novel attack designs are proposed and analyzed: Vanilla Text-level GIA, Inversion-based Text-level GIA, and Word-frequency-based Text-level GIA.  The study demonstrates that text interpretability, previously overlooked, significantly affects attack strength.  **Word-frequency-based Text-level GIA** shows a balance between attack effectiveness and interpretability, but defenses can be enhanced via customized embeddings or LLMs.

### In-depth insights


#### Word-Level GIA
Word-level graph injection attacks (GIAs) represent a **novel and realistic threat** to graph neural networks (GNNs). Unlike embedding-level attacks that manipulate node embeddings, word-level GIAs directly inject malicious textual content, making them harder to detect and more aligned with real-world scenarios.  This approach introduces **interpretability as a crucial factor**, influencing the attack's success.  **Word-frequency-based attacks** show a good balance between effectiveness and interpretability, leveraging the simplicity of binary word embeddings to ensure that injected text is both meaningful and easily generated by large language models (LLMs). However, the study reveals that defenses can be easily strengthened with **customized text embedding methods or LLM-based predictors**, suggesting that word-level GIAs face significant challenges in practice.  Further research is needed to explore these new attack vectors and develop effective defense mechanisms against this emerging threat.

#### Interpretability Tradeoffs
The concept of 'Interpretability Tradeoffs' in adversarial attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs) reveals a crucial tension.  **Higher attack effectiveness often comes at the cost of reduced interpretability**, making it challenging to understand why an attack is successful.  This is especially true for text-level attacks, where injecting meaningful, human-understandable text is more difficult than injecting carefully crafted embeddings.  While methods like those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate interpretable text, **this often sacrifices attack potency**. Conversely, simpler, embedding-based methods might achieve stronger attacks, but the injected data lacks clear semantic meaning, hindering analysis and defense development.  The ideal approach would balance both interpretability and effectiveness, allowing for both robust attacks and a better understanding of GNN vulnerabilities, yet this remains a significant research challenge.

#### LLM-based Defenses
The emergence of LLMs has revolutionized various NLP tasks, and their application to bolstering graph neural network (GNN) security against injection attacks represents a significant advancement.  **LLM-based defenses offer a unique advantage** by directly processing textual node features, bypassing the need for handcrafted feature engineering often employed in traditional defense mechanisms. LLMs can learn complex relationships between text and graph structure to identify malicious injections.  However, this approach introduces new challenges: **interpretability and explainability** of LLM-based decisions remain critical concerns.  Furthermore, the reliance on LLMs shifts the defense strategy towards a black-box model, requiring careful evaluation to ensure robustness against adversarial attacks targeting the LLMs themselves.  **The performance of LLM-based defenses is highly dependent on the quality and size of the training data** used to fine-tune the LLM; therefore, ongoing research is essential to create effective and generalizable solutions for securing GNNs in various applications.

#### Transferability Limits
The concept of "Transferability Limits" in the context of adversarial attacks on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is crucial.  **Transferability refers to how well an attack designed for one text embedding method (e.g., word frequency) performs when the defender uses a different method (e.g., a pre-trained language model).**  High transferability is undesirable for defenders, as it means attacks are robust to changes in defense strategies.  This paper highlights that text-level attacks often suffer from low transferability.  **Attacks relying on easily interpretable textual features like word frequency perform better with similar defense embedding methods, but their effectiveness significantly decreases when the defense uses sophisticated methods like PLMs.**  This is because PLMs capture nuanced semantic information which the simpler methods miss, making the injected text easily detectable. The interpretability-performance trade-off creates a **limitation on the practicality of simple text-level attacks** as defenders easily adapt and counter such attacks by leveraging more sophisticated techniques.  **Future work should focus on designing attacks with higher transferability, potentially by using methods which avoid easily identifiable features**.

#### Future Research
Future research should prioritize enhancing the **robustness and generalization** of text-level graph injection attacks (GIAs).  The current methods struggle with interpretability versus attack effectiveness, and transferability across various embedding techniques remains a significant hurdle.  Investigating **novel attack strategies** that effectively leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) while mitigating their limitations is crucial.  Furthermore, exploring **defensive techniques** beyond simple text embedding methods or LLM-based predictors is needed to understand the long-term implications of text-level GIAs.  Research into the interaction between text-level attacks and other attack types (e.g., graph modification attacks) could offer valuable insights. Finally, a thorough investigation into the **real-world applicability** and potential risks of text-level GIAs, including societal impact analysis, is necessary to develop comprehensive mitigation strategies and guide ethical development in this area.

> This table shows the performance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on text-attributed graphs that have been attacked using Inversion-based Text-level GIAs (ITGIAs).  The table compares the accuracy of GCNs on clean graphs versus graphs modified by five different ITGIA variants.  The 'Avg. cos' column shows the average cosine similarity between the embeddings of the inverted text produced by the ITGIAs and the original embeddings, giving an indication of how interpretable the generated text is. The 'Best Emb.' column shows the best attack performance achieved at the embedding level (without text-based injection) for comparison purposes.
