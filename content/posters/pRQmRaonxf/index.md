### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

In-context learning (ICL) in pre-trained transformer models has shown promising results in single-agent settings, but its capabilities in multi-agent scenarios remain largely unexplored. This paper focuses on the in-context game-playing (ICGP) capabilities of these models in competitive two-player zero-sum games.  The study highlights the challenges of applying ICL to multi-agent scenarios due to game-theoretic complexities and the need to learn Nash Equilibrium.  Previous work primarily focused on ICRL in single-agent settings, limiting the broader applicability of the findings.

This research addresses these challenges by providing theoretical guarantees demonstrating that pre-trained transformers can effectively approximate Nash Equilibrium for both decentralized (each player uses a separate transformer) and centralized (one transformer controls both players) learning settings. The authors provide concrete constructions to show that transformers can implement well-known multi-agent game-playing algorithms.  These results expand our understanding of ICL in transformers and offer insights into developing more robust and efficient AI agents in competitive scenarios.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial because **it bridges the gap between empirical observations of transformer in-context learning and theoretical understanding**, especially in multi-agent settings.  It opens new avenues for research in **in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL)**, potentially leading to more efficient and robust AI agents for various applications. The theoretical guarantees provided offer valuable insights for designing and improving such systems.

> üîº This figure illustrates the framework for in-context game playing using pre-trained transformers.  It shows two scenarios: centralized learning, where a single transformer controls both players' actions, and decentralized learning, where two separate transformers independently control each player. Both scenarios involve a pre-training phase using a context algorithm to generate a dataset of interactions and an inference phase where the pre-trained transformers are prompted with a limited set of interactions in a new game environment to generate actions and predict the game's outcome. The orange arrows represent the supervised pre-training phase, and the blue arrows represent the inference phase.

> üîº This figure presents the results of the NE gap comparison between the pre-trained transformers and the context algorithms (EXP3 and VI-ULCB) over episodes in both decentralized and centralized learning settings. The NE gap is averaged over 10 inference games.  It empirically validates the theoretical result that more pre-training games benefit the final game-playing performance during inference, and that the obtained transformers can indeed learn to approximate NE in an in-context manner.
