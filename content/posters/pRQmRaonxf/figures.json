It shows two scenarios: centralized learning, where a single transformer controls both players' actions, and decentralized learning, where two separate transformers independently control each player. Both scenarios involve a pre-training phase using a context algorithm to generate a dataset of interactions and an inference phase where the pre-trained transformers are prompted with a limited set of interactions in a new game environment to generate actions and predict the game's outcome. The orange arrows represent the supervised pre-training phase, and the blue arrows represent the inference phase.", "section": "A Theoretical Framework for In-Context Game Playing"}, {"figure_path": "pRQmRaonxf/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparisons of Nash equilibrium (NE) gaps over episodes in both decentralized and centralized learning scenarios, averaged over 10 inference games.", "description": "This figure presents the results of experiments comparing the Nash Equilibrium (NE) gap over episodes for decentralized and centralized learning scenarios.  Two subfigures are shown.  The left subfigure shows a comparison of decentralized learning using EXP3 as a baseline, while the right subfigure shows a comparison of centralized learning using VI-ULCB as a baseline. Both show the NE gap for pre-trained transformers under two different pre-training conditions (10 vs 20 environments). The shaded areas represent the standard deviation. The results demonstrate that with sufficient pre-training (20 environments) the pre-trained transformers can effectively approximate the NE policy in both settings, and the performance is comparable to the respective baselines.", "section": "5 Empirical Experiments"}]
