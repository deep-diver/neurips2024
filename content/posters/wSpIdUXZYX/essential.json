Existing neural operator architectures struggle with these issues, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.  They often require extensive training data and fail to generalize well to new, unseen problems. \nThis paper introduces Codomain Attention Neural Operator (CoDA-NO), a novel transformer-based neural operator designed to tackle these challenges. CoDA-NO processes functions along the codomain (channel space), enabling self-supervised learning and efficient adaptation to new systems.  By using a curriculum learning approach and positional encoding, self-attention, and normalization layers in function spaces, the model can efficiently learn representations from different PDE systems and achieve state-of-the-art performance.   Experiments demonstrate that CoDA-NO outperforms existing methods in various multiphysics problems, exhibiting superior generalization capabilities, especially with limited data.", "affiliation": "Caltech", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wSpIdUXZYX/podcast.wav"}
