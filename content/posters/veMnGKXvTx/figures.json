It shows a sequence of nested simplicial complexes (K_a1, K_a2, K_a3) built from a point cloud. As the parameter 'a' (representing a distance threshold) increases, more edges and higher-dimensional simplices are added to the complex, reflecting the growth of connected components and the appearance/disappearance of topological features (e.g., holes) at different scales. This progression visualizes how persistent homology tracks the evolution of topological features across multiple scales by observing their 'birth' and 'death' within the filtration.", "section": "3.1.2 Persistent Homology"}, {"figure_path": "veMnGKXvTx/figures/figures_3_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Schematic illustration of our proposed HC constraint. (a) TC guides the directions of the persistence tracks to coincide each other to establish the alignment of underlying structures beyond the observed samples. (b) DP encourages samples to be uniformly distributed.", "description": "This figure illustrates the Homology Consistency (HC) constraint, a key component of the proposed method.  Panel (a) shows the concept of 'Persistence Track Coincidence' (TC).  It explains how the method aligns the topological structures of image and text latent manifolds by ensuring that the directions of persistence tracks in both manifolds match. This goes beyond simply aligning observed data points and aims to capture the overall relationship between the manifolds. Panel (b) depicts 'Deviating Perturbation' (DP). This addresses the issue of limited data in few-shot learning by encouraging a uniform distribution of text-related images around their corresponding texts, even beyond the seen data. This prevents overfitting and improves generalization.", "section": "3.2 Homology Consistency"}, {"figure_path": "veMnGKXvTx/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The performance comparison of baselines and our proposed HC and HC* on few-shot learning, including 1-/2-/4-/8-/16-shots on 11 benchmark datasets and the average accuracy.

The methods include baseline approaches (CLIP-Adapter, TaskRes, Tip-Adapter-F) and the proposed methods with and without a pre-trained text classifier (HC-TR, HC*-TR, HC-TAF, HC*-TAF). The x-axis represents the number of labeled training examples per class (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 shots), and the y-axis represents the classification accuracy.  The results show the improvement achieved by incorporating the homology consistency constraint (HC) in the adapter tuning methods.", "section": "4.2 Performance Analysis"}]
