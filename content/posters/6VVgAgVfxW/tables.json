[{"figure_path": "6VVgAgVfxW/tables/tables_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: All the above figures show the variation of TNG over time. (a) Comparison of different levels of explicit coordination for Team-FP: independent agents (group size 1), pairs of cooperating agents (group size 2), and fully coordinated teams (group size 4). (b) Performance of Team-FP and Independent Team-FP compared to MWU and SFP algorithms in a 2-team ZSPTG. (c) Convergence of Team-FP against stationary and competitive opponents in a 3-team ZSPTG.", "description": "This figure shows three subfigures that illustrate the performance of the Team-Fictitious Play (Team-FP) algorithm and its comparison to other algorithms.  Subfigure (a) demonstrates the impact of different levels of explicit team coordination on Team-FP's convergence, (b) compares Team-FP and independent Team-FP with the Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) and Smoothed Fictitious Play (SFP) algorithms, and (c) displays Team-FP's convergence behavior against both stationary and competitive opponents.", "section": "5 Illustrative Examples"}]
