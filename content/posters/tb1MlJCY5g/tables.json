The descriptions highlight the differences in complexity and the types of manipulation tasks involved, making it easier to understand the experimental setup and the challenges faced by the AI agent in each scenario.", "section": "A Experiment Details"}, {"figure_path": "tb1MlJCY5g/tables/tables_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Hyper-parameters.", "description": "This table lists the hyperparameters used in the KALM method and baseline methods for comparison.  The hyperparameters cover discount factor, batch size, learning rate (LR), imitation weight (for BC), conservative weight (for CQL), alpha (for TD3+BC), and lambda (for AWAC).  The feature extractor network architecture is also specified.

It categorizes these unrealistic transitions into two types: 'Out of workbench' and 'Exceed dynamics limits'.  'Out of workbench' refers to instances where the object's position in the rollout is outside the bounds of the workbench. 'Exceed dynamics limits' refers to instances where the changes in object position between consecutive steps in the rollout violate the physical constraints of the environment.", "section": "C Additional Results"}, {"figure_path": "tb1MlJCY5g/tables/tables_27_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 5: Ratios of various types of unrealistic transitions of the imaginary rollouts on Meta-world.", "description": "This table shows the percentage of unrealistic transitions in the imaginary rollouts generated by the LLM for different types of tasks in the Meta-world environment.  The unrealistic transitions are categorized into four types:  objects floating in the air, objects outside the workbench area, implausible object poses (e.g., physically impossible joint angles), and exceeding the dynamic limits between consecutive steps.  These statistics provide insights into the quality and plausibility of the LLM-generated rollouts for different task difficulty levels.
