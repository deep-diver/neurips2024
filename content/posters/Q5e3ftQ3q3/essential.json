Traditional multi-armed bandit algorithms struggle in such non-stationary settings. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing the piecewise stationary linear bandit problem, where the environment's characteristics shift at random changepoints.  Existing algorithms fail to efficiently handle these changes. \nThis research introduces a novel algorithm, PS\u025bBAI+, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing methods in the piecewise stationary linear bandit setting. PS\u025bBAI+ cleverly combines changepoint detection and context alignment to adapt to the changing environment.  The paper rigorously proves that PS\u025bBAI+ achieves near-optimal sample complexity, meaning it identifies the best action with minimal data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that PS\u025bBAI+ significantly outperforms naive methods, showcasing its practical efficiency and the effectiveness of its unique approach.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Q5e3ftQ3q3/podcast.wav"}
