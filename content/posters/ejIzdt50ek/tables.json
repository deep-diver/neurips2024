'Sensitivity' indicates the distance metric imposed on D(\u03b8) when the latter is subject to perturbation, given in the form d(D(\u03b8), D(\u03b8')) \u2264 \u03b5||\u03b8 \u2013 \u03b8'|| such that d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a distance metric between distributions. '\u03b8\u221e' indicates the type of convergent points: 'PS' refers to performative stable solution [cf. (4)], 'SPS' refers to Def. 1.", "description": "This table compares the results of this work with existing works on performative prediction.  It shows whether the loss function was non-convex in the loss or variance, whether the sensitivity of the data distribution was considered, the algorithm used, its convergence rate, and the type of solution found.  The sensitivity metric (e.g., Wasserstein-1 distance, total variation) and the type of solution (performative stable or stationary performative stable) are also listed.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
