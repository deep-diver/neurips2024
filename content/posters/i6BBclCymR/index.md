### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current novel view synthesis methods struggle with sparse viewpoints, often relying on external semantic or depth priors for optimization.  However, diffusion models, which offer direct visual supervision, underperform due to low information entropy in sparse data, leading to mode deviation during optimization. This creates a need for methods that effectively leverage diffusion priors under such challenging conditions.

The paper proposes Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which addresses this challenge. **IPSM uses visual inline priors (from pose relationships) to adjust the rendered image distribution.** It decomposes the original optimization objective of Score Distillation Sampling, enabling effective diffusion guidance without any additional training.  **The IPSM-Gaussian pipeline, integrating IPSM with 3D Gaussian Splatting, further enhances performance by adding depth and geometry consistency regularization.**  Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on various datasets.

> This figure shows the performance of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) on the LLFF dataset during training.  It compares three settings: a baseline without SDS, SDS with a configuration factor (CFG) of 7.5, and SDS with a CFG of 100.  The graphs display PSNR (higher is better), SSIM (higher is better), and LPIPS (lower is better) over training iterations.  The results highlight a performance issue with SDS under sparse views (the 'SDS dilemma'), where the addition of the diffusion prior doesn't improve results, and can even hinder them. This issue is most evident in the CFG=100 case.  The figure indicates that the use of a diffusion prior via SDS is not directly beneficial for novel view synthesis from sparse views.

The comparison includes metrics such as SSIM, LPIPS, PSNR, and AVGE, providing a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different settings (trained on DTU, fine-tuned, based on NeRF, optimized, per scene).  This allows for a direct assessment of the performance gains achieved by the proposed approach.





### In-depth insights


#### Sparse View NVS
Sparse View Novel View Synthesis (NVS) presents a significant challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the limited information available from few viewpoints.  Traditional NVS methods, trained on dense datasets, often fail to generalize well to sparse scenarios, resulting in overfitting and poor novel view generation.  **Addressing this challenge requires incorporating strong priors** to guide the optimization process and compensate for missing data.  Researchers have explored various priors, including semantic, depth, and recently, diffusion priors, to improve reconstruction quality under sparsity.  **Diffusion models offer a powerful approach, providing visual supervision directly through the learned score function**, but their effectiveness in sparse scenarios can be limited.  The low information entropy in sparse views compared to rich textual descriptions used in many diffusion model applications can lead to mode collapse or deviation, hindering successful optimization.  **Key research focuses on overcoming these challenges by rectifying the rendered image distribution**, effectively leveraging the visual guidance offered by diffusion models while mitigating the detrimental impact of limited data and inherent ambiguities in sparse views.

#### Diffusion Prior Use
The effective use of diffusion priors in scenarios with sparse views presents a significant challenge.  **Existing methods often struggle due to the low information entropy inherent in sparse data**, leading to optimization difficulties and suboptimal results.  The core problem lies in the mode-seeking behavior of score distillation sampling (SDS), which tends to deviate from the true target mode. The proposed solution, Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), addresses this by incorporating visual inline priors derived from pose relationships between viewpoints. **IPSM rectifies the rendered image distribution**, improving guidance and mitigating mode deviation.  The method cleverly decomposes the optimization objective, providing more effective diffusion-based guidance without requiring fine-tuning or pre-training, showcasing a **significant improvement in reconstruction quality** compared to existing methods.

#### IPSM Algorithmic Details
An 'IPSM Algorithmic Details' section would delve into the inner workings of the Inline Prior Guided Score Matching method.  It would likely begin by formally defining the loss function, clearly showing how it combines the original Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss with the novel inline prior component.  The section should meticulously explain the process of generating inline priors, **detailing the image warping techniques and the rationale behind using them**.  A crucial aspect would be a precise explanation of how the algorithm rectifies the rendered image distribution using pose relationships, ensuring that the mode-seeking behavior of SDS is effectively guided towards the correct mode.  The implementation of depth and geometry consistency regularization should be described with formulas and a clear explanation of their purpose in refining the reconstructed image quality.  **Efficient computational strategies** employed, such as any optimization techniques to improve processing speed, should also be discussed. Finally, it's vital to explain how the algorithm uses the rectified distribution as an intermediate state to guide the overall optimization process, highlighting the interplay between visual inline priors and the diffusion prior.

#### SDS Limitations
The core limitation of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in sparse-view 3D reconstruction is its **inability to effectively leverage visual information** from the diffusion prior due to the low information entropy inherent in sparse views.  Unlike text prompts, sparse views contain implicit visual cues within the scene geometry and inter-viewpoint relationships. SDS fails to effectively utilize these **inline priors**, leading to optimization challenges and suboptimal reconstruction quality.  This mode deviation problem arises because the optimization objective of SDS seeks to align the rendered image distribution with the target mode in the diffusion prior; however, the rendered distribution under sparse views often deviates significantly, causing the model to converge to an incorrect mode.  **Incorporating inline priors to rectify the rendered image distribution** and decompose the optimization objective of SDS is crucial for overcoming these limitations and unlocking the full potential of diffusion models in sparse view synthesis.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore several avenues. **Extending the method to handle more complex scenes with greater variations in viewpoint and lighting conditions** is crucial for broader applicability.  The current approach relies on a specific 3D representation (3D Gaussian Splatting); investigating the effectiveness of IPSM with other 3D representations would demonstrate its generalizability.  **A deeper dive into the theoretical underpinnings of the mode-seeking behavior in sparse-view scenarios** could offer valuable insights. This could involve developing a more robust mathematical framework for understanding the optimization challenges and potentially lead to more effective solutions.  Finally, **integrating other types of priors, such as semantic or depth priors, in conjunction with IPSM** could further enhance the quality and robustness of novel view synthesis, particularly in situations with limited available data.  The integration of these different types of priors could leverage the strengths of each to overcome the limitations of using diffusion priors alone, paving the way for even more advanced solutions.

> The figure illustrates the IPSM-Gaussian pipeline. It starts with sparse views and initializes 3D Gaussians.  Seen views are inversely warped to generate pseudo unseen views. These pseudo views, along with depth information, are used to create inline priors.  These priors modify the rendered image distribution, creating a rectified distribution.  The rectified distribution then guides the optimization process using score matching, improving the final reconstruction quality. This process leverages visual knowledge from diffusion priors to improve sparse-view 3D reconstruction without the need for fine-tuning or pre-training.

The results indicate that adding the diffusion prior (starting at 2000 iterations) significantly affects the performance, with varying results depending on the configuration (CFG).  The opacity reset at step 2000 indicates a change in the training process at that point. The detailed analysis of these results is further discussed in Section 4.4 of the paper.
