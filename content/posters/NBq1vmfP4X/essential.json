Existing research primarily focused on string data, limiting our understanding of their expressive power in broader contexts.  This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the capabilities of transformer models on numerical sequences and providing a more comprehensive theoretical analysis. \nThe study investigates the expressive power of 'Unique Hard Attention Transformers' (UHATs) over data sequences.  The researchers prove that UHATs over data sequences are more powerful than those processing string data, going beyond regular languages.  They connect UHATs to circuit complexity classes (TC\u2070 and AC\u2070),  revealing a higher computational capacity over numerical data. Furthermore, they introduce a new temporal logic to precisely characterize the languages recognized by these models on data sequences. This comprehensive analysis significantly expands our understanding of transformer capabilities and provides valuable insights for future model development and applications.", "affiliation": "RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "NBq1vmfP4X/podcast.wav"}
