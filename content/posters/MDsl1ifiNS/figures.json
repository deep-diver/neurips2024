The noise level (\u03c3\u00b2) is shown on the x-axis, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0.  The y-axis represents the prediction MSE.  The methods being compared include the proposed method and four other existing methods (RIM, SPA, D-optimal, and GPT). The results show that the proposed method generally outperforms the other methods, especially as the noise level increases.  The fact that the performance is relatively consistent across different network types further demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "section": "5 Numerical Studies"}]
