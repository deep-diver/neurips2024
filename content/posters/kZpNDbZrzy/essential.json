Existing data augmentation methods often fail to directly improve data quality. This paper tackles these issues head-on. \nThe paper introduces Generative Trajectory Augmentation (GTA), a novel approach using conditional diffusion models to generate high-reward and dynamically plausible trajectories.  GTA partially adds noise to existing trajectories and then denoises them using classifier-free guidance, conditioned by the amplified return value. This process effectively guides trajectories towards high-reward regions.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "kZpNDbZrzy/podcast.wav"}
