Yet, little task knowledge can be sufficient to identify significantly smaller state-specific sets of relevant actions. Focusing learning on these relevant actions can significantly improve training efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose to focus learning on the set of relevant actions and introduce three continuous action masking methods for exactly mapping the action space to the state-dependent set of relevant actions. Thus, our methods ensure that only relevant actions are executed, enhancing the predictability of the RL agent and enabling its use in safety-critical applications. We further derive the implications of the proposed methods on the policy gradient. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO), we evaluate our methods on four control tasks, where the relevant action set is computed based on the system dynamics and a relevant state set.

During deployment (see Table 1), the baseline episode returns are significantly lower than for action masking, while the three masking methods perform similarly. More specifically, for the Seeker environment, the relative volume of the relevant action set compared to the global action space is on average $70\\%$ , and all action masking methods converge significantly faster to high rewards than the baseline. The generator mask and the distributional mask achieve the highest final reward. Further, action replacement performs better than the baseline but significantly worse than masking.

In the 2D Quadrotor environment, the ray mask, generator mask, and action replacement achieve the highest reward. While the baseline converges significantly slower, the final average reward is similar to the one of the distributional mask. Please note that the confidence interval for the baseline is significantly larger, because three of the ten runs do not converge and, on average, exhibit a reward of one throughout training. Additionally, we observed that if we constrain the relevant action set to intervals for this environment, our optimization problem in (33) often renders infeasible, because the maximal relevant action set cannot be well approximated by an interval. Thus, the masking method proposed in [19] is not suitable for the 2D Quadrotor task.

While the generator and ray mask both learn a performant policy, the ray mask outperforms by a significant margin. The lower performance of the generator mask is likely due to the high-dimensional generator space with 36 dimensions. This is supported by initial experiments with 12 generators (i.e., a more conservative under-approximation of the $L_{2}$ -norm) where the generator mask performed better compared to the ray mask. Replacement performs significantly worse than the two masking approaches, and the PPO baseline does not learn a meaningful policy since the environment is frequently reset due to violations of the power constraint in (20). The frequent terminations occur since in six action dimensions the relative volume of the unit ball compared to the unit box is $\\approx8\\%$ , i.e., more than $92\\%$ of actions are violating the power constraint. To compare masking to a learning baseline, we also evaluated standard PPO without constraints, which performs slightly better than ray masking but almost always uses actions outside $\\mathcal{A}^{r}$ (see Appendix A.7). The deployment results in Table 1 reflect similar results as the training; the ray mask achieves better rewards than the generator mask, followed by replacement, and the baseline performs the worst. We excluded the distributional mask for the Walker2D, since its computation time is approximately 170 times slower than the baseline, compared to a 1.6 increase for the generator, 2.7 for the ray mask, and 2.5 for action replacement (see Table 3).

While the sample efficiency is higher in our experiments, computing the relevant action set adds computational load as shown by the increased computation times (see Appendix A.6). Thus, in practice, a tight relevant action set might require more computation time than the additional samples for standard RL algorithms. Yet, if the relevant action set provides guarantees, e.g., is a set of verified safe actions, this increased computation time is often acceptable. Additionally, the computational effort for the masks differs. Given a relevant action zonotope, the generator mask adds a matrix-vector multiplication, which scales quadratically with action dimensions, the ray mask is dominated by the computation of the boundary points, which scales polynomially with action dimensions [20], and the distributional mask scales cubically with the dimension of the action space due to the mixing time of the hit-and-run algorithm [22].

There are two different approaches of incorporating these functions into RL algorithms. One is to apply the mapping as part of the environment on an action that is sampled by a standard RL policy. The second option, which we use, is to consider the masking as part of the policy, which creates the relevant policy as in (5). This has three main benefits over integrating masking as part of the environment. First, the actions passed to the environment are better interpretable, e.g., for the generator mask, adding the masking mapping function to the environment leads to a policy that samples actions from the generator space, which commonly does not have an intuitive interpretation. Second, more formulations of the functional $h$ are possible, e.g., the distributional mask, and, third, the mapping function can be included in the gradient calculation. For mathematically sound masking as part of the policy, the correct gradient needs to be derived for each RL algorithm, and the standard RL algorithms need to be adapted accordingly. However, the empirical benefit could be minor. Thus, future work should investigate the significance of the correct gradient on a variety of tasks. Note that we showed in Proposition 1 that for the ray mask, the PPO gradient with respect to the original policy and relevant policy is the same. Thus, for the ray mask, it does not matter if it is viewed as part of the policy or the environment. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "PPO is a common RL algorithm. However, off-policy algorithms such as Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) [9] and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [12] are frequently employed as well.

Yet, the implications on the gradient must be derived for each RL algorithm and are subject to future work. For the distributional mask, treating the integral in (15) as constant with respect to $\\theta$ is a substantial simplification, which might be an explanation for the slightly worse convergence of the distributional mask since this introduces an off-policy bias. To address this in future work, one could approximate the integral with a neural network, which has the advantage that it is easily differentiable.

Thus, future work could include investigating hybrid RL approaches [25] to increase the applicability to multiple convex sets or non-convex sets, such as constrained polynomial zonotopes [17]. Further, obtaining the relevant action set can be a major challenge in practice, in particular when the relevant action set is different for each state. Such a high state-dependency is likely when the notion of relevance is safety, while for other definitions of action relevance, the relevant action set might be easy to pre-compute, e.g., excluding high steering angles at high velocities. Additionally, there might be an optimal precision of the relevant action set due to two opposing mechanisms. On the one hand, the larger the relevant action set is with respect to the action space, the smaller the sample efficiency gain from action masking might get. On the other hand, a tight relevant action set might require significant computation time to obtain. Thus, future work should investigate efficient methods to obtain sufficiently tight relevant action sets.

We empirically evaluated our methods on four benchmarks and observed that the generator mask and ray mask perform best. If the relevant action set can be described by a zonotope with fixed generator dimensions and the policy follows a normal distribution, the generator mask is straightforward to implement. If the assumptions for the generator mask cannot be fulfilled, the ray mask is recommended based on our experiments. Because of subpar performance and longer computation time, the distributional mask needs to be further improved. Future work should also investigate a broad range of benchmarks to identify the applicability and limits of continuous action masking with convex sets more clearly.
