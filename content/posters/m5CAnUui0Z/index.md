### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world machine learning applications involve a time lag between data acquisition and label assignment, a phenomenon known as label delay. This delay significantly impacts the performance of online continual learning models which typically assume immediate label availability.  Existing approaches like self-supervised learning and test-time adaptation struggle to compensate for this delay, often underperforming a naive method that simply trains on the delayed labeled data. 

To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel continual learning framework that explicitly models label delay and proposes a new method called Importance Weighted Memory Sampling (IWMS).  IWMS effectively bridges the accuracy gap caused by label delay by strategically selecting and prioritizing memory samples that are highly similar to the newest unlabeled data.  This ensures the model continuously adapts to evolving data distributions, improving its accuracy and robustness against significant label delays.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that IWMS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets and computational budget scenarios.

At each time step, new unlabeled data arrives, but the corresponding labels are delayed by a certain number of time steps (d). The figure shows how the model is evaluated on the newest unlabeled data but trained on both this data and the delayed labeled data.  The colored images represent the delayed labeled data, while the grayscale images represent the current unlabeled data.

### In-depth insights


#### Label Delay Effects
The effects of label delay in online continual learning are significant and multifaceted.  **Simply increasing computational resources is insufficient to mitigate the negative impact** on model performance.  The core issue is the growing discrepancy between the distribution of the most recently observed (unlabeled) data and the older, labeled data used for training.  **State-of-the-art techniques like self-supervised learning and test-time adaptation fail to effectively bridge this accuracy gap**, often underperforming a naive approach that solely utilizes the delayed labeled data.  This highlights the **critical need for methods explicitly designed to handle label delay**, such as the importance weighted memory sampling technique, which prioritizes memory samples that closely resemble the newest unlabeled data.  **Effective solutions must go beyond increasing computational budget and cleverly manage the data used for training** to bridge the performance gap between delayed and non-delayed scenarios.

#### IWMS Method
The Importance Weighted Memory Sampling (IWMS) method is a novel approach designed to address the challenges of label delay in online continual learning.  **IWMS cleverly bridges the accuracy gap caused by delayed labels by prioritizing memory samples that closely resemble the most recent unlabeled data.** This is achieved through a two-stage process. First, the model predicts labels for the incoming unlabeled batch. Then, it selectively samples labeled data points from memory whose labels match the predicted labels and are most similar in feature space to the unlabeled data.  **This targeted sampling ensures the model adapts more effectively to the evolving data distribution despite the label delay, outperforming alternative semi-supervised, self-supervised and test-time adaptation approaches.**  The computational cost of IWMS remains manageable, only slightly increasing compared to the naive baseline, thus making it a practical and efficient solution for online continual learning in real-world scenarios with significant label delay.

#### Unsupervised Methods
The exploration of unsupervised methods in addressing label delay within online continual learning reveals both promising avenues and significant limitations.  **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)** approaches, while intuitively appealing due to their ability to leverage unlabeled data, surprisingly underperformed simpler baselines in many scenarios. This suggests that the computational overhead of SSL, even with carefully chosen methods, might outweigh the benefits in a time-sensitive, resource-constrained setting.  **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** methods, particularly pseudo-labeling, similarly exhibited mixed results, struggling to overcome the accuracy gap created by delayed labels.  **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)**, designed to adapt models to new data distributions, also showed limited effectiveness, likely because of a mismatch between its inherent assumptions of data similarity and the real-world scenario of a dynamically changing data distribution over time.  **Overall, these findings highlight the challenge of efficiently integrating unlabeled data in continual learning settings with significant label delays.  They emphasize that a naive approach of training only on delayed labeled data might remain surprisingly competitive.** Future research should investigate more efficient and adaptable techniques for incorporating unlabeled data, perhaps focusing on methods tailored to address specific characteristics of delayed streams.

#### Computational Limits
The concept of 'Computational Limits' in the context of online continual learning with label delay is crucial.  It highlights the inherent trade-off between model accuracy and the resources available for training. **Simply increasing computational power may not resolve performance issues stemming from significant label delays**. The paper emphasizes this constraint by normalizing computational budgets across different methods, preventing unfair comparisons.  This focus on resource efficiency is vital as it **promotes the development of practical algorithms suitable for real-world applications where computational resources are often limited**.  The authors investigate if increased computation can alleviate the accuracy drop caused by label delay, finding mixed results, thereby reinforcing the significance of efficient algorithms tailored to the label delay challenge.  **The 'Computational Limits' section underscores the need to consider resource constraints in evaluating different continual learning strategies and promotes the development of algorithms that are both accurate and computationally efficient**.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Developing more sophisticated methods for handling label delay** is crucial, potentially involving advanced techniques in online learning or the integration of self-supervised learning methods to better utilize unlabeled data.  **Investigating the interaction between label delay, computational budget, and data characteristics** across diverse continual learning scenarios would provide valuable insights into optimal resource allocation strategies.  **The impact of different data distributions and distribution shifts on the effectiveness of proposed methods** requires further exploration to enhance the robustness of continual learning algorithms in real-world settings.  Finally, **extending the label delay framework to other continual learning paradigms** (e.g., task-incremental learning) and exploring its implications for various application domains will broaden the impact and applicability of this important research area.

The results demonstrate that as the label delay increases, the model's accuracy consistently decreases. This is because the model is trained only on older, labeled data, while its performance is evaluated on more recent, unlabeled data. The gap in data distribution between training and evaluation leads to performance degradation. The severity of the accuracy drop is non-linear, meaning it is not the same across all datasets and varies with the length of the delay.

It displays how the accuracy fluctuates, with a significant drop occurring around the 1970s. The different colored lines represent different levels of label delay (0, 3, 17, and 34 years). The longer the delay, the more prolonged the recovery time is after the accuracy drop. The right plot shows the fraction of male students with either long hair or afros over time, taken from Ginosar et al. [7]. This data highlights a major change in hairstyle trends during the 1970s, which is strongly correlated with the accuracy drop observed in the left plot. This demonstrates how shifts in the data distribution, reflected in changing fashion trends, can impact the performance of the Na√Øve model, especially with label delays.

> üîº This table displays the accuracy of the Na√Øve method on the CGLM dataset.  The accuracy is presented as a matrix, where each cell (i,j) represents the accuracy of a model trained on data from time interval i predicting the labels for data in time interval j. The rows represent the training intervals, and the columns represent the prediction intervals. This shows the performance of the Na√Øve approach, where only the already labeled data is used to train the model.

> üîº This table presents the accuracy of the Importance Weighted Memory Sampling (IWMS) method on the Continual Google Landmarks (CGLM) dataset.  The accuracy is broken down into a matrix showing the performance of the model when trained on data from specific time ranges (rows) and tested on data from other specific time ranges (columns).  Each cell represents the accuracy of the model when trained on the data from the time range specified by the row and tested on the data from the time range specified by the column.  This provides a detailed view of how the model's performance changes over time and across different data distributions.

> üîº This table presents the online accuracy results for online learning without memory rehearsal on the CLOC dataset.  It shows the online accuracy at various time steps under different label delay scenarios (delay=10 and delay=50). The data illustrates the impact of label delay on the model's performance over time, without the benefit of memory replay techniques.

> üîº This table presents the online accuracy of an online learning model without memory rehearsal on the CGLM dataset under different label delays (10, 50, and 100 time steps). The accuracy is measured at various time steps throughout the continual learning process, illustrating how label delay affects performance over time.  The data shows that accuracy generally decreases as the delay increases, with larger fluctuations visible in the different delay scenarios.
