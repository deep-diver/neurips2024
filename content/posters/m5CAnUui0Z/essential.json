This delay significantly impacts the performance of online continual learning models which typically assume immediate label availability.  Existing approaches like self-supervised learning and test-time adaptation struggle to compensate for this delay, often underperforming a naive method that simply trains on the delayed labeled data. \nTo address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel continual learning framework that explicitly models label delay and proposes a new method called Importance Weighted Memory Sampling (IWMS).  IWMS effectively bridges the accuracy gap caused by label delay by strategically selecting and prioritizing memory samples that are highly similar to the newest unlabeled data.  This ensures the model continuously adapts to evolving data distributions, improving its accuracy and robustness against significant label delays.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that IWMS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets and computational budget scenarios.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Continual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "m5CAnUui0Z/podcast.wav"}
