This occurs even under stationary data distributions, and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We develop a framework emulating real-world neural network training and identify noise memorization as the primary cause of plasticity loss when warm-starting on stationary data.

While requiring to overwrite outdated knowledge as the environment changes, models overfitted to previously encountered environments often struggle to cumulate new information, which in turn leads to reduced generalization performance (Lyle et al., 2023b). Under this viewpoint, various efforts have been made to mitigate the loss of plasticity, such as resetting layers (Nikishin et al., 2022), regularizing weights (Kumar et al., 2023), and modifying architectures (Lee et al., 2023; Lyle et al., 2023a; Nikishin et al., 2023).

For a particular example, when a model is pre-trained using a portion of a dataset and then we resume the training with the whole dataset, the generalization performance is often worse than a model trained from scratch (i.e., cold-start), despite achieving similar training accuracy (Ash and Adams, 2020; Berariu et al., 2021; Igl et al., 2020).

Interestingly, Igl et al.

Theorem 3.4 suggests that the loss of plasticity in the incremental setting under the stationary assumption can be attributed to the noise memorization process. A similar observation is made in real-world neural network training. It is widely believed that during the early stages of training, neural networks primarily focus on learning features from the dataset, and after learning these features, the model starts to memorize data points that it fails to classify correctly using the learned features. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted an experiment where CIFAR-10 was divided into two chunks, each containing $50\\%$ of the training dataset. The model was pre-trained on one chunk and then further trained on the full dataset for 300 epochs. We used three-layer MLP and ResNet-18 with SGD optimizer across 10 random seeds.

When pre-training is stopped at a certain epoch and the model is then trained on the full dataset, test accuracy is maintained. However, if pre-training continues beyond a specific threshold (approximately $50\\%$ pre-training accuracy in this case), warm-starting significantly impairs the model\u2019s performance as it increasingly memorizes training data points. We attribute this phenomenon to the neural network\u2019s memorization process after learning features. This is consistent with reports of a critical learning period where neural networks learn useful features in the early phase of learning (Achille et al., 2018; Frankle et al., 2020; Kleinman et al., 2024), and with findings that neural networks tend to learn features followed by memorizing noises (Arpit et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
