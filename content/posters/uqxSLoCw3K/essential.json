However, ICL performance suffers from the large search space and noisy demonstrations.  Existing methods using a single retriever model to select demonstrations face suboptimal performance. \nThis paper introduces MoD (Mixture of Demonstrations), a novel framework that addresses these issues. MoD partitions the demonstration pool into groups, each managed by an expert retriever, reducing the search space. It also employs an expert-wise training strategy, mitigating the effects of unhelpful demonstrations. Experiments across several NLP tasks show MoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of its approach.", "affiliation": "University of Virginia", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "uqxSLoCw3K/podcast.wav"}
