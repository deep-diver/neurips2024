### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Continual learning in deep neural networks struggles with catastrophic forgetting ‚Äì the inability to learn new tasks without losing knowledge of previously learned tasks. Recent methods use prompts (learnable parameters encoding task knowledge) to guide a pre-trained model, but existing approaches suffer from sub-optimal prompt selection because the prompt selection process is not directly optimized with task loss.  This leads to inadequate feature adaptation for new tasks.

VQ-Prompt solves this by incorporating vector quantization (VQ). VQ allows the optimization of a discrete set of prompts end-to-end with task loss, effectively improving knowledge abstraction for each task.  Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VQ-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods in class-incremental settings.

> Figure 2: VQ-Prompt framework. An input image is passed through a query function (e.g., a fixed pre-trained ViT) to generate a query q, which is then used to compute similarity scores with prompt keys K. These scores Œ± serve as weights to aggregate elements from the prompt pool P to form a continuous prompt p'. This prompt is subsequently quantized to an element within the prompt pool p, and then fed into a specific MSA block of a frozen pre-trained transformer. To ensure differentiability, the prompt quantization process employs gradient estimation and prompt pool regularization. The representation statistics of features from learned classes are used to stabilize task knowledge learning. More details are shown in ¬ß4.

### In-depth insights


#### VQ-Prompt's novelty
VQ-Prompt's novelty stems from its **unique integration of vector quantization (VQ) into a prompt-based continual learning framework.**  Existing prompt-based methods either suffer from non-differentiable prompt selection or utilize continuous prompts lacking sufficient abstraction for task knowledge.  **VQ-Prompt addresses these limitations by optimizing discrete prompts end-to-end with task loss.** This is achieved through gradient estimation and VQ regularization, ensuring effective abstraction and efficient prompt selection.  The incorporation of **representation statistics** further enhances stability and mitigates catastrophic forgetting.  Therefore, the key innovation lies not just in using VQ, but in its novel application within a prompt-based continual learning paradigm to improve both efficiency and performance.

#### End-to-end training
End-to-end training is a crucial concept in machine learning, particularly relevant for complex tasks like those addressed in continual learning.  It offers the advantage of **directly optimizing the entire system**, including all components and parameters involved, with respect to the final task objective.  **This contrasts with traditional modular or staged approaches**, which often involve separate optimization steps for different components and potentially lead to suboptimal overall performance.  In continual learning, where a model is trained sequentially on multiple tasks, end-to-end training is beneficial because it allows for seamless integration of knowledge across tasks, preventing catastrophic forgetting.  However, end-to-end training in continual learning can present challenges, especially in scenarios with complex architectures or many parameters.  **Effective optimization strategies** are essential to balance the adaptation to new tasks with the preservation of knowledge from previous tasks.  The paper's use of Vector Quantization (VQ) to facilitate the end-to-end training of discrete prompts is a noteworthy approach in overcoming challenges related to prompt selection in continual learning and optimizing performance.

#### Discrete prompt
The concept of "discrete prompt" in continual learning offers a compelling approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.  **Unlike continuous prompts, which are often represented as vectors in a continuous space, discrete prompts are drawn from a finite, pre-defined set.** This discrete nature facilitates better knowledge abstraction and organization, mirroring how humans categorize information into distinct concepts.  **The use of discrete prompts enhances the effectiveness of prompt-based methods by creating more robust and interpretable representations of task-specific knowledge.**  This discrete representation lends itself well to optimization techniques, allowing for more effective end-to-end training and facilitating the tuning of parameters to minimize task interference and catastrophic forgetting.  Moreover, the inherent discreteness of the prompts improves the generalization of the model to new tasks and prevents issues stemming from continuous prompt representations being overly sensitive to small changes, leading to suboptimal performance.  **Therefore, discrete prompts present a significant advantage in continual learning for both enhanced knowledge representation and optimized model adaptation.**

#### Continual learning
Continual learning addresses the critical challenge of **catastrophic forgetting** in artificial neural networks.  Traditional deep learning models often struggle to learn new tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.  This is a significant limitation, as real-world scenarios frequently demand adapting to new information streams without erasing existing knowledge.  Continual learning research explores diverse strategies including **architectural modifications**, **regularization techniques**, and **memory-based approaches** to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.  **Prompt-based methods**, a recent advancement, show considerable promise. They leverage pre-trained models and task-specific prompts to achieve effective learning without extensive retraining.  However, optimal prompt selection and feature adaptation remain key areas for improvement.  Future research in continual learning will likely focus on more sophisticated memory management, effective prompt engineering, and robustness to noisy or incomplete data streams. The ultimate goal is to create AI systems capable of continuous learning, closely mirroring human adaptability.

#### Future directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving prompt efficiency** is crucial; current methods can be computationally expensive.  **Investigating alternative quantization techniques** beyond vector quantization might yield improved performance and efficiency.  **Addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem** more effectively is key;  current methods still exhibit some level of forgetting, requiring exploration of novel regularization methods.  **Exploring prompt-based methods for different continual learning scenarios** such as domain-incremental learning is needed.  Finally, **enhancing the interpretability and explainability of prompts** remains a critical challenge, vital for building trust and understanding in these models.  These advancements would solidify the place of prompt-based approaches in the field of continual learning.
