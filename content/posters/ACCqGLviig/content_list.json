However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss.

This clear separation of information helps prevent interference among different knowledge domains, and enables models to provide distinct guidance for feature extraction specific to each task.

Domain-incremental learning (DIL) maintains the same set of classes for different tasks while changing the data distributions across tasks, and task identities are not provided for inference. For Class-incremental learning (CIL), each task involves new classes and all the learned classes are to be classified without task identities available during inference. In this paper, we focus on the more representative and challenging CIL scenario. Numerous efforts have been devoted to alleviating catastrophic forgetting.

In inference, the appropriate prompt is chosen through similarity matching with key or feature centroids. However, both kinds of prompt selection are non-differentiable, making it challenging to optimize them end-to-end with the task loss, particularly when the gap between the pre-training task and unknown future tasks is large.

Our proposed Vector Quantization Prompting (VQ-Prompt) framework mitigates the challenge by substituting continuous prompts with their nearest counterparts from the prompt pool, thereby enhancing task accuracy through a more aligned and abstract representation of conceptual task knowledge. To overcome the non-differentiability inherent in this process, we employed gradient estimation along with vector quantization regularization terms, which allows for optimizing prompt retrieval with task loss. Representation statistics are utilized to further stabilize task knowledge learning.

One limitation of VQ-Prompt is its dependence on pre-trained models. While these models offer rich initial knowledge, enabling a more mature learning process akin to that of an adult, they also inherit the limitations of the pre-trained data distribution and the high computational costs associated with their use. This challenge is not unique to VQ-Prompt but applies broadly to other continual learning methods that rely on pre-trained models. Another limitation is the absence of constraints in calculating similarity scores and prompt keys, which can result in suboptimal prompt utilization, i.e., some prompts are more frequently selected for samples from different tasks while others are less frequently used. To alleviate this, one possible strategy is to introduce constraints on prompt selection, such as limiting the reuse of prompts that have already been heavily utilized by previous tasks to enhance the diversity and utility of the prompts. We leave a more thorough exploration of such prompt selection constraints for future research.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
