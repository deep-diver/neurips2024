Similarly, existing works are either unable to handle missing modalities entirely [101, 98] or use imputation approaches [89, 51, 83] of varying sophistication. The former methods restrict usage to cases where all modalities are completely observed, significantly diminishing their utility in settings where this is often not the case (such as in clinical applications); the latter can lead to suboptimal performance due to the inherent limitations of imputed data. In addition, the complex and irregular temporal dynamics present in multimodal data have often been overlooked [101, 88], with existing methods often ignoring irregularity entirely [83] or relying on positional embedding schemes [90] that may not be appropriate when modalities display a varying degree of temporal irregularity. Consequently, there is a pressing need for more advanced and scalable multimodal fusion techniques that can efficiently handle a broader set of modalities, effectively manage missing and irregular data, and capture the nuanced inter-modal relationships necessary for robust and accurate prediction.

However, this approach can lead to representation collapse [13, 69], where a subset of experts dominates the decision-making process, resulting in the redundancy of other experts. This issue likely contributes to the slow rates of estimating expert parameters $a_{i}^{*}$ in this setting (see Table 2). By contrast, the Laplace gating function partially alleviates this problem by computing the similarity score as the $L_{2}$ -distance between token representations and expert embeddings. This approach does not inherently favor any expert based on magnitude, unlike inner product which can be biased towards experts with larger norms. The Laplace gating ensures that all experts have a more balanced opportunity to be selected based on how close they are to the token representation. Therefore, Laplace gating is beneficial when dealing with heterogeneous inputs, such as multimodal data, where its feature distributions can be very different across modalities. This is because it can handle these differences without being overly sensitive to the scale and variance of the input features. In addition, it can gracefully degrade in the presence of missing data, rather than causing abrupt changes in gating probabilities that might occur with inner product-based measures. The improved estimation rates for expert parameters $a_{i}^{*}$ under the Laplace gating Gaussian MoE, along with our empirical results on multiple large-scale datasets, substantiate these insights.

Our tasks of interest for MIMIC datasets include the 48-hour in-hospital mortality prediction (48-IHM), 25-type phenotype classification (25-PHE), and length-of-stay (LOS) prediction. In addition to the previously mentioned baselines, we have incorporated the HAIM method [83], a data pipeline specifically designed for integrating multimodal data from the MIMICIV dataset. We also include the cross-attention combined with irregular sequences modeling approach (MISTS) [101].

Furthermore, we observe that HAIM shows considerable efficacy in extracting features from time series, resulting in a strong performance in the 48-IHM and LOS tasks, which are heavily reliant on such data. However, its performance appears more moderate on the 25-PHE task. The PAM dataset captures daily living activities through 17 sensors, with data from each sensor treated as a separate modality. These modalities are individually processed through time-series and irregularity encoders before being integrated into the FuseMoE framework.

With the diverse evolution of deep learning models, numerous advanced methods have now been employed in the fusion of multimodal data. In the realm of sentiment analysis, [96, 52] employ a low-rank Tensor Fusion method that leverages both language and video content. Attentiongating mechanisms are used by [74, 95] to generate displacement vectors through cross-modal self-attention, which are then added to the input vectors from the primary modality. [90] takes an alternative approach by integrating multiple layers of cross-modal attention blocks in a word-level vision/language/audio alignment task. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the context of clinical prediction, [45, 16] adopt a late fusion approach to combining vital sign and text data by concatenating embeddings from pre-trained feature extractors. [83] developed a generalizable data preprocessing and modeling pipeline for EHR encompassing four data modalities, albeit through a direct concatenation of existing feature embeddings for each modality followed by an XGBoost classifier [12]. Recently, [101] expanded on the work of [90] by introducing a discretized multi-time attention (mTAND) module [82] to encode temporal irregularities in time series and text data. Their fusion approach involves layering sets of self- and cross-modal attention blocks. However, this approach is limited to just two modalities and is not easily extendable to include additional modal components or handle missing modalities. To the best of our knowledge, existing works are tailored to application-specific settings that necessitate the computation of pairwise cross-modal relationships, which are not scalable to more general settings with arbitrary modalities. Moreover, these studies typically do not account for scenarios where modalities are missing, or rely on imputation approaches based on observed data. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "Mixture-of-Experts MoE [35, 93] has gained significant popularity for managing complex tasks since its introduction three decades ago. Unlike traditional models that reuse the same parameters for all inputs, MoE selects distinct parameters for each specific input. This results in a sparsely activated layer, enabling a substantial scaling of model capacity without a corresponding increase in computational cost. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating MoE with cutting-edge models across a diverse range of tasks [79, 19, 103]. These works have also tackled key challenges such as accuracy and training instability [66, 104, 72]. Given its ability to assign input partitions to specialized experts, MoE naturally lends itself to multimodal applications. This approach has been explored in fields such as vision-language modeling [58, 80] and dynamic image fusion [9]. However, the application of MoE in complex real-world settings, such as those involving FlexiModal Data, remains largely unexplored. This gap presents an opportunity to leverage MoE\u2019s potential in handling its intricate and multifaceted nature such as multimodal EHR, where reliable multimodal integration is crucial. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "MoE Theory While MoE has been widely employed to scale up large models, its theoretical foundations have remained nascent. Recently, [64] provided convergence rates for both density and parameter estimation of Softmax gating Gaussian MoE. They connected these rates to the solvability of systems of polynomial equations under Voronoi-based loss functions. Later, [63] extended these theories to the top-K sparse softmax gating Gaussian MoE. Their theories further characterize the effect of the sparsity of gating functions on the behaviors of parameter estimation and verify the benefits of using top-1 sparse softmax gating MoE in practice. Other theoretical results for MoE include estimation rates of parameters and experts for multinomial logistic MoE [62], for dense-tosparse gating MoE [61], for Gaussian gating MoE [65], and for input-independent gating MoE [29].

Similarly, the prediction of patient length-of-stay is indispensable for optimizing treatment plans, resource allocation, and discharge processes [6].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
