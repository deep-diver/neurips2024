For better presentation, we abbreviate the linear proportion as prop. and the baseline DAGuerreotype as DAGu. On different scales of datasets, CaPS consistently achieves the best performance in most linear proportions, especially in mixed scenarios (prop. $_{\\cdot=0.25}$ , 0.5, 0.75).

About the actual-time cost, despite cubic complexity in samples size $n$ , the bottleneck of actual-time growth often lies in the number of nodes $d$ in causal graph since many $n$ -related operations are GPU-friendly.

The symbols $-L$ and - $\\cdot N$ in the dataset denote linear and nonlinear, respectively. Comparing SynER1 and SynER4, we can find that acceleration is more effective in sparse causal graphs than in dense ones. This is due to the fact that in sparse graphs, there are more edges with low confidence in parent score, and pre-pruning is more efficient. Moreover, the acceleration ratio of pre-pruning becomes more significant when the number of nodes $d$ grows, which makes a major contribution to the speed advantage of CaPS in larger-scale datasets.
