However, current methods struggle with complex problems, failing to accurately estimate this vector for problems with irregular Pareto fronts.  This limitation hinders the effectiveness of many optimization algorithms.\n\nThis research introduces BDNE, a boundary decomposition method that addresses these issues. BDNE scalarizes the problem into manageable subproblems, utilizing bilevel optimization to iteratively refine solutions and precisely estimate the nadir objective vector.  The theoretical analysis shows BDNE's effectiveness under mild conditions, and extensive experiments on diverse problems demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods, opening new possibilities for real-world applications and further research in multi-objective optimization.", "affiliation": "Southern University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "f829mkQMUg/podcast.wav"}
