### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-video (T2V) models struggle to generate videos with realistic motion, often producing static or minimally dynamic outputs. This limitation stems from biases in text encoding that overlooks motion and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V models.  The lack of accurate motion representation in text hinders the generation of dynamic and compelling videos. 

This paper introduces DEMO, a novel framework to address these issues by decomposing both text encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. This allows the model to better understand and represent static elements and dynamic motions separately.  Crucially, DEMO incorporates text-motion and video-motion supervision to enhance motion understanding and generation, ultimately leading to videos with enhanced motion dynamics and high visual quality.  The evaluations on various benchmarks showcase DEMO's superior performance in generating videos with realistic and complex motion, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in T2V generation. **The core contribution is a novel framework that effectively leverages decomposed text encoding and conditioning, along with specialized supervision techniques, to generate videos with substantially improved motion.**

> This figure presents a pilot study to evaluate the sensitivity of the CLIP text encoder to different parts of speech (POS) related to content and motion. By generating a large set of prompts with fixed templates and varying POS, the study measures how well CLIP distinguishes between motion and content words. The results show that CLIP is less sensitive to POS related to motion, indicating a need for improved motion encoding in text-to-video models.

> This table presents the quantitative results of zero-shot text-to-video (T2V) generation on the MSR-VTT benchmark dataset.  It compares several different models (Magic Video, Make-A-Video, Show-1, Video LDM, LaVie, PYOCO, VideoFactory, EMU VIDEO, SVD, ModelScopeT2V, a fine-tuned version of ModelScopeT2V, and the proposed DEMO model) using three metrics: FID (Frechet Inception Distance), FVD (Fr√©chet Video Distance), and CLIPSIM (CLIP Similarity). Lower FID and FVD scores indicate better visual quality, while a higher CLIPSIM score indicates better alignment between the generated videos and their corresponding text descriptions. The table shows that the DEMO model outperforms other models in terms of these metrics, achieving superior performance in generating high-quality videos with good text-image alignment.





### In-depth insights


#### Motion Enhancement
Enhancing motion in text-to-video generation is a significant challenge, as current models often produce static or minimally dynamic results.  A key aspect of addressing this is improving the encoding and conditioning mechanisms within the model.  **Decomposing the text encoding into content and motion components**, separately handling static visual elements and the dynamic aspects of motion described in the text, is crucial. This enables a more nuanced understanding of motion. Furthermore, **incorporating separate content and motion conditioning** processes helps the model to distinctly handle static and dynamic aspects within the video generation.  **Supervised learning techniques**, including text-motion and video-motion supervision, are essential in training the model to understand and appropriately generate these motion dynamics. By aligning cross-attention maps with temporal changes in real videos and constraining predicted video latent patterns, the model develops a deeper understanding of the connection between textual descriptions and realistic motion patterns. These techniques are critical for overcoming limitations in existing models and creating videos with significantly enhanced motion realism.

#### Decomposed Encoding
Decomposed encoding, in the context of text-to-video generation, tackles the challenge of encoding rich textual descriptions that encompass both static content and dynamic motion.  Traditional methods often fall short, either overlooking motion details crucial for realistic video generation or struggling to effectively incorporate this temporal information. **The core idea of decomposed encoding is to separate the encoding process into distinct pathways for handling content and motion information.** This disentanglement enables the model to more accurately capture both the static scene elements and the implied actions or movements described in the text. By splitting the encoding, **the model avoids potential bias and interference inherent in the traditional approach**, resulting in improved representation of motion nuances. Consequently, the subsequent conditioning and generation processes can leverage these cleaner, more distinct representations, ultimately producing videos with significantly more realistic and complex motion.  This technique highlights a paradigm shift towards a more comprehensive understanding of textual descriptions, **moving beyond static elements and towards a more complete representation of the dynamic temporal aspects of the narrative.**

#### Dual Conditioning
Dual conditioning, in the context of text-to-video generation, likely refers to a model architecture that leverages two distinct conditioning signals to guide the video generation process.  This approach contrasts with single conditioning methods, which typically use only text or an image as a guide. **One conditioning signal could focus on the semantic content**, encompassing objects, actions, and their spatial relationships as described in the text.  **The other would emphasize the temporal dynamics** of the video, including motion, speed, and changes in the scene over time.  This dual-path conditioning enables a more sophisticated and nuanced control over the generated video. The key advantage lies in the ability to independently control the static aspects (content) and dynamic elements (motion), leading to potentially more realistic and coherent video outputs. **Effective implementation would require careful design of both conditioning pathways and appropriate integration mechanisms**, potentially involving separate encoders for content and motion, and specific architectural modifications within the video generation model to effectively incorporate both signals.  Failure to achieve effective integration could result in suboptimal video quality and inconsistencies between the intended content and motion.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components or features of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of a text-to-video generation model, this might involve removing one or more of the following: **the motion encoder**, **the content encoder**, **motion conditioning**, **content conditioning**, or specific loss functions like **text-motion supervision** or **video-motion supervision**.  By observing how performance metrics (e.g., FID, FVD, CLIPSIM, VQAA) change with each ablation, researchers can pinpoint which parts are most crucial for generating high-quality and dynamic videos.  **A well-designed ablation study isolates the impact of each module**, allowing researchers to confidently attribute success or failure to specific components.  **Careful analysis reveals the relative importance of different architectural choices and training strategies**.  Results help optimize future model designs, guide future research directions, and overall provide a deeper understanding of the model's inner workings.

#### Future Works
The 'Future Works' section of a research paper on enhancing motion in text-to-video generation could explore several avenues.  **Improving the handling of sequential actions** within a single video is crucial; current methods often struggle to represent complex, temporally ordered events described in text.  **Developing more sophisticated motion encoding techniques** that go beyond simple directional cues would greatly improve realism.  This might involve incorporating more nuanced representations of physics, human biomechanics, or object interactions.  Another key area is **expanding the range and diversity of motion styles**.  While the current work focuses on realistic motion, the potential for stylistic control, such as cartoonish or exaggerated movements, remains largely untapped.  Finally, **addressing potential biases and limitations** in the training data is important.  This could involve developing methods to mitigate biases inherent in existing datasets or exploring alternative training methodologies that lead to more robust and fair video generation.
