Existing solutions like replay-based methods are resource-intensive, requiring extra memory to store past data.  Exemplar-free methods, while resource-friendly, often lack accuracy. \n\nF-OAL tackles this problem by employing a forward-only approach using a pre-trained frozen encoder and an Analytic Classifier updated via recursive least squares. This eliminates the need for backpropagation, thus reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining high accuracy.  This **exemplar-free** approach and **recursive least squares** update are key to the efficiency and accuracy gains. The results showcase F-OAL's robustness and effectiveness in various OCIL scenarios.", "affiliation": "South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "rGEDFS3emy/podcast.wav"}
