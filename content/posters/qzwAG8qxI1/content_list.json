OOD detection has gained soaring research attention in recent years. The current research track can be divided into post hoc and regularization-based methods. Post hoc methods derive OOD scores at test-time based on a pre-trained model, which can be categorized as confidence-based methods [39, 24, 40], energy-based methods [26, 41, 42, 43, 44, 29], distancebased methods [45, 46, 47, 23, 48, 49, 50], and gradient-based method [51]. On the other hand, regularization-based methods aim to train the OOD detector by training-time regularization. Most approaches require auxiliary OOD data [52, 53, 54, 36, 55, 56, 57]. However, a limitation of existing methods is the reliance on clean semantic OOD datasets for training. To address this challenge, WOODS [37] first explored the use of wild data, which includes unlabeled ID and semantic OOD data. Building upon this idea, SCONE [5] extended the characterization of wild data to encompass ID, covariate OOD, and semantic OOD data, providing a more generalized data mixture in practice.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
