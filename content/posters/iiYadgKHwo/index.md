### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Diffusion models excel in generative modeling, especially behavior learning, but their iterative sampling process leads to long inference times, hindering real-time applications.  Training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which offer faster inference, is notoriously difficult. This is due to the intractability of their likelihoods and their tendency towards mode-averaging during training. 

This paper introduces Variational Diffusion Distillation (VDD), a novel method to overcome these challenges. VDD leverages variational inference to distill pre-trained diffusion policies into MoE models. A key innovation is the use of a decompositional upper bound of the variational objective, allowing for efficient, separate training of each expert.  Experiments across nine complex behavior learning tasks demonstrate that VDD accurately distills complex distributions, surpasses existing methods, and sets a new benchmark for MoE training.

### In-depth insights


#### Diffusion Policy Distillation
Diffusion policy distillation aims to transfer the capabilities of complex diffusion models to more efficient and tractable models, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE).  Diffusion models excel at generating diverse and high-quality samples, but their iterative sampling process and intractable likelihoods limit their use in real-time applications. **Distillation addresses this by learning a compact MoE policy that mimics the behavior of a pre-trained diffusion model.** This involves a clever optimization scheme that leverages score functions, leading to robust training of the MoE.  **The resulting MoE policy retains the multi-modality and accuracy of the diffusion model while offering faster inference and a tractable likelihood**, making it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments or real-time applications.  A key challenge lies in effectively handling the multi-modal nature of diffusion models during distillation, but methods like variational inference offer a principled way to address this.

#### MoE Training
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models offer the advantage of handling complex, multi-modal data distributions but pose challenges during training.  **Standard maximum likelihood objectives often lead to mode collapse or averaging**, hindering the accurate representation of diverse data modes.  This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel variational inference framework for training MoEs. **A key innovation is the decomposition of the variational objective into per-expert terms**, enabling separate and robust optimization of each expert.  This decompositional approach avoids the instability often associated with traditional MoE training methods.  Further, the method leverages the gradients of a pre-trained diffusion model, effectively transferring the diffusion model's knowledge of complex distributions to the MoE. The resulting training scheme is significantly more stable and produces superior results compared to existing MoE training techniques, showcasing the benefits of this variational distillation approach.

#### Variational Inference
Variational inference is a powerful technique for approximating intractable probability distributions, **particularly useful when dealing with complex models like those used in deep learning**.  It works by defining a simpler, tractable distribution (the variational distribution) that is close to the true, but complex, distribution of interest.  The method then optimizes the parameters of the variational distribution to minimize the difference between it and the target distribution, often measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.  This optimization process often involves iterative updates, balancing the tractability of the variational distribution with its accuracy in representing the true distribution. **A key advantage is its scalability to large datasets and high-dimensional spaces**, making it applicable to problems where exact inference is computationally infeasible.  However, the success of variational inference depends heavily on the choice of the variational family and the accuracy of the approximation can vary significantly depending on the problem. **Careful consideration of the variational family is crucial** to ensure a good balance between tractability and accuracy of the approximation.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically assess the impact of individual components within a model to understand their contributions.  In the context of the described research, ablation studies likely involved removing or modifying parts of the variational diffusion distillation (VDD) method, such as the gating network, the number of experts, or the diffusion timestep selection method, and observing the effects on performance metrics.  **Key insights gained** would center on understanding which components are crucial for achieving high accuracy, versatility, and efficiency. For example, removing the gating mechanism might reveal whether the model's ability to handle multimodality stems from the expert selection process or from the expressiveness of the experts themselves.  Similarly, experimenting with different numbers of experts might show an optimal trade-off between model complexity and performance. Investigating the influence of various timestep selection strategies would demonstrate whether one-step sampling can capture the key information or whether multi-step sampling is truly necessary to distill effectively.  **The results** would guide future model improvements, demonstrating the essential design choices and enabling researchers to create a more streamlined and potentially more efficient model for complex tasks.

#### Future Work
The authors suggest several promising avenues for future research.  **Improving training efficiency and enhancing performance** are key goals.  Leveraging the diffusion model as a backbone and fine-tuning an MoE head is proposed to reduce training time and potentially improve accuracy.  **Addressing the limitation of pre-defining the number of experts** is also highlighted, suggesting that the model could benefit from dynamically adjusting the number of experts based on the task complexity.  Finally, they acknowledge the need to investigate methods for applying VDD to high-dimensional data like images, requiring further investigation to overcome challenges posed by the MoE's mean and covariance prediction.  **Extending VDD to real-world applications** and exploring the effects of the diffusion model's time-dependence to eliminate the need for the time-step selection scheme are also worthwhile future directions.

The main part of the figure shows trajectories generated by VDD with different numbers of experts. Different colors represent different experts, and their intensity reflects the probability of that expert being selected. The bottom row shows the individual experts' behaviors. As the number of experts increases, the diversity of trajectories increases, showing VDD's ability to capture multi-modal behaviors. With only one expert (Z=1), the behavior is deterministic, lacking the diversity seen in the teacher model.

Different colors indicate components with highest likelihood according to the learned gating network q(z|s) at a state s. For each step we select the action by first sampling an expert from the categorical gating distribution and then take the mean of the expert prediction. We decompose the case Z = 8 and visualize the individual experts zi (bottom row). Diverse behavior emerges as multiple actions are likely given the same state. For example, moving to the bottom right (21) and top right (22). An extreme case of losing diversity is seen with Z = 1, where the policy is unable to capture the diverse behavior of the diffusion teacher, leading to deterministic trajectories.
