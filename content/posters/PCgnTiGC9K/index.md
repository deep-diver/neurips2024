### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in deep learning, like Deep Ensembles, often provide unreliable estimates, especially when dealing with unexpected data.  This is a significant problem for applications requiring high reliability, such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis.  There's also a need for methods that offer theoretical justifications, rather than relying solely on empirical observations. 



This paper introduces Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs), which predict probability intervals instead of single probabilities.  This addresses the issue of uncertainty estimation by representing the uncertainty as a set of probabilities (credal set), which accounts for various possible data distributions. CreDEs show improved test accuracy, better calibration, and superior out-of-distribution detection compared to existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

> This figure compares the proposed Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs) with traditional Deep Ensembles (DEs).  CreDEs use Credal-Set Neural Networks (CreNets) that output probability intervals for each class, forming a credal set representing uncertainty.  DEs, in contrast, use standard neural networks (SNNs) and average their single probability distribution outputs. The figure illustrates this difference using a probability simplex, showing how CreDEs' interval predictions create a credal set (a region in the simplex) compared to DEs' single-point predictions. The aggregation method for CreDEs is also briefly described.

### In-depth insights


#### Credal Deep Ensembles
Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs) offer a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning.  **By predicting probability intervals instead of single probabilities**, CreDEs address limitations of traditional methods like Deep Ensembles.  The approach uses a loss function inspired by distributionally robust optimization, which helps the model account for potential divergence between training and test distributions.  This leads to **more robust uncertainty estimates**, particularly valuable for out-of-distribution detection.  CreDEs demonstrate improved performance in various benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy, lower expected calibration error, and better EU estimation.  **Combining this with ensemble methods strengthens the robustness and accuracy.** However, further research is needed to address computational complexities and explore theoretical guarantees.

#### Epistemic Uncertainty
Epistemic uncertainty, stemming from a lack of knowledge rather than inherent randomness, is a crucial consideration in machine learning.  **Deep ensembles**, while popular for uncertainty quantification, often yield low-quality epistemic uncertainty estimates.  The paper introduces **Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs)**, which leverage **Credal-Set Neural Networks (CreNets)** to predict probability intervals instead of single probabilities, representing a credal set encompassing the uncertainty.  This approach, inspired by distributionally robust optimization, directly addresses the potential divergence between training and test data distributions, providing a more robust measure of epistemic uncertainty.  **The training strategy** effectively uses a composite loss, combining vanilla cross-entropy for the upper bound with a distributionally robust loss for the lower bound, capturing both optimistic and pessimistic perspectives on future data.  Importantly, CreDEs demonstrate superior performance in uncertainty quantification compared to deep ensemble baselines across various benchmarks, highlighting their effectiveness in accurately reflecting epistemic uncertainty.

#### DRO Training
Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) training is a powerful technique to enhance the robustness of machine learning models, particularly deep learning models, by mitigating the effects of distributional shift between training and test data.  **DRO aims to minimize the worst-case risk**, considering a set of possible data distributions. In contrast to standard empirical risk minimization, which assumes the training and test distributions are identical, **DRO explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the test distribution**. This makes the model more resilient to unseen data and less prone to overfitting on the training set. The effectiveness of DRO is demonstrated by improved generalization performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.  It is particularly effective when dealing with data that is noisy or contains outliers, scenarios frequently encountered in real-world applications. However, **the computational cost of DRO can be significantly higher than standard training methods**, requiring careful consideration of the trade-off between robustness and computational efficiency. Different DRO formulations exist, each with its own advantages and limitations, necessitating careful selection based on the specific application and data characteristics.

#### OOD Detection
The research paper explores out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a crucial aspect of ensuring reliable model performance.  **OOD detection is framed within the context of epistemic uncertainty quantification**, arguing that models which better capture this type of uncertainty will also demonstrate improved OOD detection capabilities. The authors introduce a novel approach, Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs), that tackles OOD detection by producing probability intervals, effectively representing uncertainty using credal sets.  This method is rigorously tested across multiple benchmarks using different network architectures and OOD scenarios. The results highlight CreDEs' superiority over existing deep ensemble techniques, showing **improved accuracy, better calibration, and significantly enhanced OOD detection performance**. The key findings suggest a strong correlation between improved epistemic uncertainty quantification and robust OOD detection, establishing CreDEs as a promising solution for enhancing the reliability and robustness of deep learning models in real-world applications.

#### Future Works
The paper's "Future Works" section suggests several promising avenues for extending their research on Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs).  **Improving theoretical guarantees** is crucial, as current CreDEs lack formal coverage guarantees.  Exploring this through conformal prediction is a logical next step.  **Extending CreDEs to regression tasks** is another key area, possibly leveraging random fuzzy sets to bridge the gap between credal sets and continuous probability distributions. Finally, the authors plan to conduct **comprehensive real-world applications**, moving beyond benchmark datasets to test the robustness and effectiveness of CreDEs in high-stakes domains.  This involves further investigation into the generalized cross-entropy loss for improved uncertainty quantification, and a detailed exploration of different ensemble approaches beyond averaging, such as union and intersection methods.  This holistic approach will solidify CreDEs' capabilities and applicability in practical scenarios.

> This figure illustrates the final layer structure of a Credal-Set Neural Network (CreNet) for three classes.  The input vector z is passed to two sets of weight and bias matrices: W1:C, b1:C for calculating the interval midpoints (m) and WC+1:2C, bc+1:2C for calculating interval half-lengths (h).  The Softplus function ensures non-negativity of h.  The resulting deterministic intervals [al, au] are then passed through an Interval SoftMax activation function to produce probability intervals [qL, qU] which determine the final credal set on the probability simplex. The figure shows how the final probability intervals determine a credal set (gray shaded area) within the probability simplex.

> This figure illustrates a scenario in a three-class classification problem where the predicted probability intervals for each class ([qL, qU]) determine a credal set (a convex set of probability distributions).  The figure highlights that due to redundancy, not all points within the theoretically possible region based on the intervals (the parallelogram) are actually feasible points within the resulting credal set (the shaded area).  This is because the additional constraints imposed by the requirement that probabilities sum to 1, and must stay within the intervals, reduce the feasible region. The figure demonstrates that the actually reachable upper and lower probabilities might differ from the initially predicted probabilities.
