The latter is caused by a lack of knowledge about the process which generates the data, due to the limited availability of training data, and is reducible [1, 36]. Effective EU quantification is beneficial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection [30, 54] and can contribute to a variety of safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving [21], medical diagnosis [44], flood uncertainty estimation [10], structural health monitoring [72].

This paper presents an innovative approach to classification tasks called Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs), ensembles of novel Credal-Set Neural Networks (CreNets), aiming to improve EU quantification in the framework of credal inference. At the cost of merely doubling the number of output nodes compared to classical SNNs, CreNets are trained to predict a lower and an upper probability bound for each class rather than a single probability value. Such probability intervals over classes thus efficiently determine a prediction in the form of a credal set. The training strategy is inspired by Distributionally Robust Optimization [42, 55, 61], which simulates the potential divergence of the test distribution from the training distribution. As a result, the width of the predicted probability interval reflects the \u2018epistemic\u2019 uncertainty about the future data distribution.

One significant challenge for the latter is the absence of ground truth labels. Although various loss functions have been proposed, these models\u2019 performance often diverges from theoretical EU assumptions [71].

This challenges their practical adaptability, as it cannot guarantee their robustness against other forms of \u2018unseen\u2019 OOD data [71].

We also proposed Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs), ensembles of CreNets, which extend the traditional deep ensemble idea to the credal domain. Extensive experimental validation was conducted on several OOD detection benchmarks, and across different network architectures and uncertainty measures. Compared to traditional Deep Ensembles, our CreDEs achieve higher test accuracy and lower ECE on ID samples, while significantly improving the quality of EU and TU estimation, leading in turn to strongly enhanced OOD detection performance.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
