### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current large language models (LLMs) utilize chain-of-thought prompting to enhance reasoning capabilities.  However, the performance of these models significantly degrades when presented with noisy rationales (Noisy-R), which contain irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning steps. This paper addresses the challenges of noisy rationales.  Existing robust methods like self-correction and self-consistency show limited efficacy.

To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Contrastive Denoising with Noisy Chain-of-Thought (CD-CoT), which enhances LLMs' denoising-reasoning capabilities by contrasting noisy rationales with a clean one. CD-CoT demonstrates improved accuracy and denoising capabilities compared to existing methods. The authors provide the NoRa dataset to evaluate LLM reasoning robustness under noisy rationales.

### In-depth insights


#### Noisy Rationale Problem
The "Noisy Rationale Problem" highlights a critical weakness in chain-of-thought prompting for large language models (LLMs).  **Noisy rationales**, containing irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning steps within training examples, significantly hinder LLM performance.  This contrasts with the common focus on noisy questions, demonstrating that **rationale quality is equally crucial** for reliable reasoning. The problem's practical relevance stems from the prevalence of noisy rationales in real-world datasets, including crowd-sourced and automatically generated data.  **Existing robustness methods** such as self-correction and self-consistency show limited effectiveness against noisy rationales, **underscoring the need for new approaches**.  The challenge demands external supervision, but this must be readily available and minimally intrusive.  This issue necessitates further research into robust methods and better dataset creation practices to address the inherent fragility of LLMs to noisy rationales within the chain-of-thought framework.

#### CD-CoT Method
The core of this research paper revolves around a novel method called CD-CoT (Contrastive Denoising with noisy Chain-of-Thought), designed to enhance the robustness of large language models (LLMs) when faced with noisy rationales during chain-of-thought prompting.  **CD-CoT tackles the challenge of noisy rationales by employing a contrastive learning approach**.  Instead of relying solely on the LLM's intrinsic denoising capabilities, which prove limited in the presence of noise, CD-CoT leverages the availability of at least one clean rationale example. This clean example is used as a baseline for comparison against noisy rationales, allowing the model to discern and rectify irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning steps.  **The method involves a multi-step process: rephrasing noisy rationales, selecting the most promising candidates, exploring diverse reasoning paths, and ultimately voting on the most likely answer**. This approach, grounded in a principle of exploration and exploitation, allows CD-CoT to significantly improve upon baselines methods, demonstrating enhanced denoising and reasoning capabilities, and achieving an average improvement of 17.8% in accuracy.

#### LLM Robustness
The research explores Large Language Model (LLM) robustness, particularly focusing on chain-of-thought prompting's vulnerability to noisy rationales.  **The core finding reveals a significant performance drop in LLMs when presented with examples containing irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning steps.** This highlights a critical gap in current research, as most studies assume clean demonstrations. The study introduces NoRa, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored to evaluate this robustness against various reasoning tasks and noise levels. **The findings demonstrate that existing robust methods, like self-correction and self-consistency, offer limited efficacy against the challenges posed by noisy rationales.** This necessitates external supervision, leading to the proposal of CD-CoT, a contrastive denoising method significantly improving LLM performance in noisy scenarios.  **CD-CoT leverages the contrast between noisy and clean rationales to enhance LLMs' ability to denoise and reason effectively.**  The research also analyzes the impact of different noise types and levels,  and the number of noisy examples on model performance, uncovering valuable insights into the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs.  The study concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to improve LLM robustness, suggesting the exploration of external knowledge bases and multi-modal data integration.

#### Noisy Rationale Dataset
A Noisy Rationale dataset is a valuable resource for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs).  **It addresses a critical gap in existing benchmarks by focusing on the quality of the rationales, or intermediate reasoning steps, within prompting examples.** Unlike datasets focused solely on noisy inputs or outputs, this dataset allows researchers to specifically assess LLMs' ability to handle irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning steps embedded within otherwise correctly formatted prompts.  This is crucial because real-world data often contains such noise, making the ability to filter and correct for such noise a key aspect of reliable LLM performance. The dataset's design, which allows for controlled introduction of noise into rationales, enables nuanced analysis of LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in handling noisy rationales.  **Such insights are vital for enhancing LLM robustness and developing effective countermeasures against the detrimental effects of noisy data.**  The creation of this type of dataset also highlights the importance of carefully considering not just the correctness of input and output but also the quality and reliability of the intermediate steps in the reasoning process used by LLMs.

#### Future Work
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the robustness of LLMs against noisy rationales** is paramount, potentially through techniques like contrastive learning or incorporating external knowledge bases.  **Developing self-supervised methods** that reduce reliance on clean rationale annotations would significantly enhance practicality.  **Exploring diverse prompting strategies and investigating their impact on model performance** under noisy conditions could yield valuable insights.  **Expanding the NoRa dataset** to encompass more diverse reasoning tasks and modalities (such as incorporating visual data) is vital to broaden the evaluation scope and better reflect real-world scenarios.  Finally, **further theoretical analysis** of the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs under noisy rationales is needed to guide the development of more robust algorithms and architectures.

The noisy examples were further divided into two categories: those containing irrelevant information and those with inaccurate information.  The results clearly demonstrate that noisy rationales significantly reduce the accuracy of GPT-3.5. The introduction of irrelevant information reduces accuracy by 1.4%-19.8% compared to the clean examples, while inaccurate information causes a much more significant drop, of 2.2%-40.4%.

It compares the performance of a base LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) with several other LLMs and methods designed to enhance robustness (ISC, SP, SM, SD, SC) against noisy rationales across three different tasks (Math, Symbolic, Commonsense). The accuracy is shown separately for easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels for each type of rationale, and the average accuracy across all difficulty levels is also provided.

> üîº This table presents the accuracy results of different language models on the NoRa dataset under three different few-shot shuffle configurations: shuffling questions, shuffling rationales, and shuffling answers.  The purpose is to investigate whether LLMs heavily rely on the exact mapping between questions, rationales, and answers in few-shot prompting scenarios. It is observed that shuffling the mappings degrades the reasoning performance but still performs better than without prompting. This suggests that LLMs may not rely heavily on the exact mapping but learn abstract information from demonstrations.
