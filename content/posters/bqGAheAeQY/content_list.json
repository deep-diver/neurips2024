Current approaches to this problem were not designed to operate on casual videos recorded by standard cameras or require a long optimization time. Aiming to significantly improve the efficiency of previous approaches, we present TRACKSTO4D, a learning-based approach that enables inferring 3D structure and camera positions from dynamic content originating from casual videos using a single efficient feed-forward pass. To achieve this, we propose operating directly over 2D point tracks as input and designing an architecture tailored for processing 2D point tracks. Our proposed architecture is designed with two key principles in mind: (1) it takes into account the inherent symmetries present in the input point tracks data, and (2) it assumes that the movement patterns can be effectively represented using a low-rank approximation.TRACKSTO4D is trained in an unsupervised way on a dataset of casual videos utilizing only the 2D point tracks extracted from the videos, without any 3D supervision. Our experiments show that TRACKSTO4D can reconstruct a temporal point cloud and camera positions of the underlying video with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while drastically reducing runtime by up to $95\\%$ .

In this problem setup, we are given access to multiple images of a scene taken sequentially, e.g., from a monocular video camera, where both the content in the scene and the camera are moving. Our task is to reconstruct the dynamic 3D positions of the points seen in the images and the camera poses. This fundamental problem has gained significant interest from the research community over the years [7, 37, 26, 64], mainly due to its important applications in many fields such as robot navigation, autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction of general environments [19]. Importantly, in contrast to static scenes where the epipolar geometry constraints hold between the corresponding points of different views [17], determining the depth of a moving point from monocular views is an ill-posed problem [3].

Many existing approaches for the above problem make simplifying assumptions that limit their applicability to real-world scenarios. Methods based on orthographic camera models and low-rank assumptions use matrix factorization techniques [7, 26], but the orthographic camera assumption might not be realistic and may cause reconstruction errors. Techniques that incorporate depth priors often require lengthy optimization processes in order to make the depth estimates across frames consistent [25, 64]. Other physics-based approaches make assumptions about rigid bones [60, 58] or isometric deformable surfaces [37] and typically involve complex, slow optimization per video. In addition, they may require foreground-background segmentation of the moving content, which is not always easily obtained. Alternatively, some methods are specifically tailored to certain object classes like humans [52], restricting their domain to those limited cases. Consequently, these prior methods are either not directly applicable to casual videos, or require long optimization time per video.

Our main insight is that point track tensors may exhibit more common motion patterns across casual video domains compared to image pixels. In other words, we argue that processing the raw point track data rather than scene-specific pixels or features may enable learning class and scene-agnostic internal feature representations for improved generalization.

Specifically, given an input point track tensor, our architecture equivariantly predicts a small set of input-specific basis elements. The output point clouds at each time frame are then defined as a linear combination of these basis elements, with the coefficients also predicted by the network. Notably, the first basis is assumed to fully represent the 3D static points in the video, while the remaining basis elements capture the 3D dynamic deviations.

DROID-SLAM [48] used synthetic data with ground truth 3D supervision for learning to predict camera poses via deep-based BA on keyframes while excluding dynamic objects.

Notably, our network was trained using only raw supervision of 2D point tracks extracted by an off-the-shelf method [20] without any 3D supervision. Yet, it implicitly learned to predict camera poses and 3D structures while identifying the dynamic parts. During inference, our method demonstrates significantly faster processing times compared to previous methods while achieving comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our network exhibits strong generalization capabilities, performing well even on semantic categories that were not present in the training data. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and future work. While our experiments demonstrated that our network is efficient, accurate, and capable of generalizing to unseen video categories, there are several limitations and future work directions that we would like to address. First, our method is limited in handling videos with rapid motion, as it depends on the accuracy of the tracking method used, specifically CoTracker [20], which has limitations in tracking fast movements. We observed that [20] often fails in automotive scenes due to high motion blur, particularly on the road, limiting our ability to perform large-scale evaluations on automotive datasets given the current tracking method performance. We note that any future improvements with point tracking in terms of accuracy and inference time will directly improve our method as well. Second, our method assumes enough motion parallax to constrain the depth values and fails to generate accurate camera poses without it. An interesting direction for future work would be to leverage depth models and 3D tracking techniques, which could potentially improve accuracy, especially in cases with minimal motion parallax. Yet, our current attempts to incorporate MiDaS-inferred depth as an additional input and apply a depth loss relative to MiDaS have not yielded any performance improvements, indicating that this approach needs further exploration. Third, while we found $K=12$ basis elements to be effective for our evaluation set, balancing complexity reduction and motion representation, we acknowledge this fixed number may not capture all possible scene dynamics. Future work could explore automatically inferring the optimal number of bases per scene. Lastly, our network can handle up to about 1000 point tracks in 50 frames in one inference step when running on a single GPU. A possible extension to handle denser point clouds and longer videos could involve querying point tracks iteratively while maintaining a shared state, but this approach remains to be explored.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
