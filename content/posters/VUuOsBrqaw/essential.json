This limits their applicability and necessitates model rebuilding or data preprocessing, both of which can lead to knowledge loss.  This paper highlights the challenge of GNN transferability across datasets with diverse node features, a significant issue that limits the applicability of current self-supervised pre-training methods. \nThe paper introduces Feature-Universal Graph (FUG), a novel contrastive pre-training strategy that tackles this challenge head-on.  FUG cleverly emulates the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) process using contrastive constraints, enabling lossless feature adaptation across different datasets.  It also replaces negative sampling with a global uniformity constraint, drastically reducing computational complexity and memory requirements.  Experimental results demonstrate FUG's competitive performance with re-trained models in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, confirming its strong adaptability and transferability.  This makes FUG a valuable contribution to the field of GNNs.", "affiliation": "Tianjin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VUuOsBrqaw/podcast.wav"}
