Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves longperiod trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture longrange dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism, achieving state-ofthe-art results.

Following the success of Transformers [44] in various domains, Transformerbased models have also become mainstream in the time series domain [23, 27, 36, 49, 54, 55, 56].

Therefore, the conventional approach of shuffling the consecutive samples into mini-batches deprives the model of utilizing the crucial inherent temporal correlation between the samples.

Furthermore, if the commonly used look-back window of 96 is extended fivefold, the model can only utilize time steps of less than 500, making it difficult to consider long-range dependencies spanning thousands or the entire dataset.

This serves as a low-pass filter, inherently embedding long-range information over a thousand steps. Attention is then applied to the stored EMA activations of various smoothing factors (low-pass filters with different frequencies), enabling the model to learn which periodic trends to consider when predicting the future, thereby enhancing its performance.

In Batched Spectral Attention, the EMA is unfolded over time to perform Spectral Attention simultaneously across multiple time steps.

Machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines [4] and Random Forests [14] have proven to be effective even compared to early artificial neural networks [13, 17, 40]. Convolutional network-based methods leverage convolution kernels to capture temporal variations sliding along the temporal dimension [12, 45]. Recurrent neural network (RNN) grasp changes over time via state transitions across different time steps. [25, 41]. However, RNN-based models exhibit limitations in modeling long-range dependencies due to challenges such as vanishing gradients and error accumulation [30, 43].

The Autoformer [49] incorporates series decomposition as an inner block of Transformer and aggregates similar sub-series by utilizing the Auto-Correlation mechanism. PatchTST [36] introduces patching, a channel-independent approach that processes each variable separately and focuses on cross-time attention. Crossformer [54] utilizes a channel-dependent approach to learn cross-variate dependencies. This is achieved through the use of cross-time and cross-dimension attention. iTransformer [31] applies attention and FFN in an inverted way, where attention handles correlations between channels and FFN handles the temporal information. Recently, to address Transformers\u2019 potential difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies [53], methodologies based on the linear model and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) structures have emerged. DLinear [53] utilizes the decomposition method introduced in Autoformer and predicts by adding the output of two linear layers for each seasonal and trend element. TiDE [7] proposes an architecture based on MLP residual blocks that combines information from dynamic and static covariates with a look-back window for encoding, followed by decoding.

SAAM [34], which is applicable to RNNs, performs FFT and autocorrelation on the input signal. WaveFroM [51] uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to project time series into wavelet domains of various scales and performs forecasting through graph convolution and dilated convolution. FEDformer [56] adopts a mixture-of-experts strategy to refine the decomposition of seasonal and trend components and introduce sparse attention mechanisms in the frequency domain. TimesNet [48] transforms 1D time series into 2D tensors utilizing multi-periodicity by identifying dominant frequencies through Fourier Transform, modeling temporal variations effectively. FreTS [52] leverages frequency-domain MLPs to achieve global signal analysis and compact energy representation, addressing the limitations of point-wise mappings and information bottlenecks in conventional MLP-based methods. FITS [50] employs interpolation within the complex frequency domain to construct a concise and robust model.

By preserving temporal correlations and enabling the flow of gradients between samples, this mechanism facilitates the model in capturing crucial long-range interactions essential for accurate future predictions. Therefore, our research paves the way for fixed-sized input models to effectively handle long-range dependencies extending far beyond the input window. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrated that our Spectral Attention mechanism enhances performance across various base architectures, with its ability to grasp long-term dependencies being the key factor behind this improvement. BSA effectively tackles long-term fluctuations, complementing the base model\u2019s capacity to manage intricate yet short-term patterns. This integrated model holds promise for improving real-world application performance. For instance, it could boost weather forecast accuracy by simultaneously capturing minute-by-minute weather changes and seasonal variations. Moreover, when predicting deterioration from a patient\u2019s real-time data, it can consider medications with lengthy onset times. Our study has limitations: we did not analyze the impact of BSA placement within the base model in detail. Also, BSA\u2019s performance gains may be limited when applied to datasets with only high-frequency information within the look-back window. These issues should be addressed in future research.

The Traffic dataset [49] records hourly road occupancy rates from 862 sensors on San Francisco Bay Area freeways, covering the period from January 2015 to December 2016. The ECL dataset [49] captures the hourly electricity consumption of 321 clients. The ETT dataset [55] contains seven factors related to electricity transformers, spanning from July 2016 to July 2018. It is divided into four sub-datasets: ETTh1 and ETTh2 are recorded hourly, while ETTm1 and ETTm2 are collected every 15 minutes. The Exchange dataset [49] comprises panel data of daily exchange rates from eight countries, ranging from 1990 to 2016.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
