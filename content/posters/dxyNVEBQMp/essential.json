This limitation significantly impacts prediction accuracy, especially for sequences with long-term trends. \nTo overcome this, the paper introduces Spectral Attention, a novel mechanism that preserves temporal correlations and efficiently handles long-range information.  This is achieved by using a low-pass filter and an attention mechanism to preserve long-period trends and facilitate gradient flow between samples.  Experiments on 11 real-world datasets show that Spectral Attention consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dxyNVEBQMp/podcast.wav"}
