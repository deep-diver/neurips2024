This paper tackles this by exploring the stationary distribution of SGD\u2014 essentially where the training process eventually settles.  A major roadblock in this exploration is the complexity of the loss landscape, making analytical solutions incredibly difficult.  Prior works focused on simplified assumptions, providing only approximate results. \nThis research makes a breakthrough by demonstrating that **minibatch noise** acts as a regularizer, guiding SGD towards a specific type of solution called a noise-balanced equilibrium, specifically when the loss function possesses a rescaling symmetry.  This finding, termed the \"law of balance,\" is mathematically proven.  Further, the paper derives the stationary distribution of SGD for a diagonal linear network (a simplified, yet insightful model).  This analytical solution reveals interesting, non-linear phenomena like phase transitions and loss of ergodicity, exclusive to deeper networks.  The study also reveals the limitations of using the stationary distribution of SGD as an approximation for Bayesian inference, providing a more accurate characterization of SGD dynamics.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "AM1znjeo9l/podcast.wav"}
