It iteratively uses a discounted reward algorithm with increasing discount factor (1-1/k), decreasing error tolerance (1/k), and decreasing confidence level (1/k^2) to find an asymptotically optimal policy. The algorithm leverages the idea that optimal policies for highly discounted problems often remain nearly optimal in the limit, providing an effective method for learning optimal limit average reward strategies.", "section": "6 Convergence for Limit Average, \u03c9-Regular and LTL Objectives"}]
