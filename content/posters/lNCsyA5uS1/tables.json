The number of tasks is D, the length bound of the search/rollout/plan is L, number of rollouts is T, beam size is m, and branching bound is b. The summed number of states over the D tasks and the projected number of LLM evaluations are given per approach and problem.", "description": "This table compares different planning approaches using LLMs across four datasets (24 Game, Crossword, Blocks World, PrOntoQA).  For each approach, it shows the time complexity, the percentage of states explored, the number of LLM calls needed, and the total number of states in the datasets. The table highlights the efficiency gains of the proposed method, 'Tree of Thoughts' which significantly reduces the number of LLM calls required while maintaining accuracy.", "section": "Discussion"}]
