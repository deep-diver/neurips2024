The algorithms are: Belief-weighted optimistic AAC (ours), Optimistic Asymmetric VI (ours), Asymmetric Q, and Vanilla AAC. The four cases represent four different problem sizes, which vary in the number of states, actions, observations, and the horizon. The figure shows that the Belief-weighted optimistic AAC algorithm (developed by the authors) achieves the highest reward and lowest sample complexity for each problem size.", "section": "6 Numerical Validation"}]
