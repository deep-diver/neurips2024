This significantly limits its applicability in high-stakes decision-making. Existing class-conditional CP methods often produce large prediction sets, hindering practical use.  This paper addresses this issue by proposing a solution that doesn't compromise on the valid coverage guarantee.\nThe proposed Rank Calibrated Class-conditional CP (RC3P) algorithm uses label rank calibration to selectively iterate the class-wise thresholding subroutine only for a subset of classes. This leads to smaller prediction sets without sacrificing the valid class-wise coverage.  RC3P's model-agnostic nature and superior performance (demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on imbalanced real-world datasets) make it a valuable tool for researchers needing high-confidence predictions with improved predictive efficiency.", "affiliation": "Washington State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "T7dS1Ghwwu/podcast.wav"}
