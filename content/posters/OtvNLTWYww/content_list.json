Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise. In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way. Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block. We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets. Inspired by these findings, we propose a simple self-correction strategy, Checking as Context (CaC), which finds novel applications in alleviating social bias and defending against LLM jailbreaks.

We notice that existing self-correction methods admit a general abstraction: generation, critics, regeneration, and further critics, continuing until the final refined output. This self-correction path can be understood as a particular form of context that provides feedback for refining the prediction on the fly. Different from standard (query, response) context examples akin to supervised learning, self-correction examples can be formulated in a triplet form (query, response, reward) that is akin to LLM alignment with both good and bad samples indicated by their rewards [53, 7, 61, 66].

The analysis further reveals that LLMs\u2019 self-correction performance relies crucially on the quality of critics, which agrees well with recent empirical findings [42, 14, 69]. Intriguingly, within this analysis, we nail down the roles of realistic transformer designs \u2013 multi-head softmax attention, feed-forward network, and stacked blocks \u2013 for alignment, providing concrete theoretical insights for designing robust LLMs. This contrasts with previous in-context learning theories that focus on linear attention in the context of linear regression, deviating from practice [74, 84, 2].

We show that with a simple generation-critic-regeneration process (we call Checking-as-Context) and no external feedback, intrinsic self-correction can alleviate social bias on Vicuna-7b and Llama2-7b-chat, and exhibits a strong correlation between self-checking accuracy and final performance again.

The critic can be either generated by LLMs themselves through carefully designed prompting [34, 38], or by external verifiers such as code intepreters [62].

For every task, we draw a common query $x\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\\times d})$ and a groundtruth parameter $W\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\\times d})$ . We then generate $N$ responses and rewards. For each response $y_{i}$ , we sample a reward $r_{i}\\,\\in\\,\\mathcal{U}[0,1]$ and an independent noise weight $W_{i}^{-}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\\times d})$ , and then generate $y_{i}=r_{i}W x+(1-r_{i})W_{i}^{-}x$ . Thus, responses with higher rewards are closer to the ground truth in expectation. By default, we set $d=5,N=20$ and use a 20-layer GPT-2 model with 3 heads, 96 hidden dimension, and a PL loss (Eq. (5)). Then we evaluate the normalized MSE between the predicted output $\\hat{y}$ and ground-truth $y=W x$ using varying numbers of in-context examples, averaged over 256 runs with randomly generated tasks. We also implement the gradient descent (GD) of the linear PL model (Eq. (5)) and measure its optimal solution in the same way.

This can be naturally understood through our theory, where the gradient descent is performed on noisy data that hinders the learning process, as shown in the dashed lines in Figure 1b.

While conventional ICL theories show that $^{\\,I}$ -layer single-head linear self-attention is sufficient for linear regression [74], for in-context alignment, we observe: (1) ICA requires more depth. Figure 1c shows that when transformers are shallow (e.g., 5 layers), ICA is much worse, and more depth benefits ICA effectively. After 15 layers, depth brings diminishing returns. This is consistent with our theory that requires stacking multiple transformer blocks for in-context alignment of $N$ example (Theorem 3.3). (2) Softmax attention is necessary. Figure 1d illustrates that linear attention can hardly solve the in-context alignment task while softmax attention performs much better, which is consistent with our analysis (Section 3.2). (3) Multi-head attention helps. Figure 1e shows that single-head attention struggles to align in-context, while multi-head $(3,4,6)$ performs well. In addition, when the number of attention heads exceeds 3, there is no significant benefti, which aligns surprisingly well with our analysis that requires 3-head to implement the GD of the $N$ -ary PL loss (Theorem 3.3). (4) FFN is necessary. Figure 1f shows that without FFN, the model cannot align in-context, consistent with our analysis that FFN is necessary for transforming selected tokens.

Recent studies also explore directly optimizing language models from preference data with learning reward models [61, 66]. In either case, they utilize an alignment objective for learning from preference data. A common choice is the Bradley-Terry model for pairwise preference [53, 61], while others also explore the use of Plackett-Luce (PL) model for $N$ -ary preference data [61, 66].

However, recent research puts this ability into question by showing that intrinsic self-correction (a scenario wherein the model can correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities) does not bring real improvements on reasoning [28] and planning [70] tasks without external feedbacks (e.g., ground-truth labels). Meanwhile, they find that self-correction does help improve the appropriateness of responses, including alignment-related tasks [7, 21, 48]. Our theory in Section 3 provides a general theoretical explanation for the mechanism of (intrinsic) self-correction by interpreting it as a in-context alignment process and establishing its connection to the alignment objective.

Recently, a lot of interest emerged in the theoretical understanding of in-context learning (ICL), and a major direction is to investigate how linear transformers can perform certain optimization algorithms on simple problems like linear regression [24, 74, 6, 39, 18, 79, 2, 30] from different perspectives, such as, convergence [84], generalization [85], optimization schemes (e.g., high-order [20] and preconditioned [1] ones), distribution shifts [84, 3], etc. Beyond this simple setup, some explore the ability of transformers for learning softmax regression [23], discrete function [8], regression mixture models [56], Gaussian Process [15], etc. As far as we know, we are the first to show that transformers can perform gradient descent of a non-convex alignment objective in-context. Considering the importance of alignment in LLM training, our theory model may be of more practical uses than linear regression. Besides, contrary to the linear regression case, we show that the Transformer modules like softmax attention, feed-forward networks and stacked layers, are naturally important for our construction, indicating our theory model is more aligned with the transformer architecture.

Along this line of research, people find techniques such as, persuasive instructions [78, 63], stealthy conversation [83], low-resource languages [82, 17]. Meanwhile, some explore automatic ways to craft jailbreak instructions, such as, gradient-based optimization [64, 89, 88] (requiring white-box access), and generic algorithms [43, 37, 11] (only requiring black-box queries). To counter such attacks, various defense measures have also been proposed. One direct solution is to detect or purify harmful prompts with preprocessing, such as, perplexity fliter [4], harmful string detection [36, 10], retokenization and paraphrasing [31]. Nevertheless, Varshney et al. [71] point out that they may suffer a considerable loss on benign queries. The instruction method, Self-reminder [80] adds a system prompt to remind the model to be safe in its reply. RAIN [40] proposes a new rewinding decoding scheme based on model evaluation. Different from these prior works, our CaC (Checking as Context) does not use explicit human instructions to teach LLMs how to behave.
