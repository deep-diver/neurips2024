Existing methods struggle to maintain accuracy and fidelity in such scenarios, often failing to separate dynamic objects from the static environment. Many recent methods integrate Gaussian splatting into SLAM, but they still assume static scenes. \nThis paper introduces DG-SLAM, a novel dynamic visual SLAM system that leverages 3D Gaussians.  It uses motion mask generation to filter dynamic objects, adaptive Gaussian point management for efficient map representation, and a hybrid camera tracking algorithm for robust pose estimation. This innovative approach dramatically improves the accuracy, robustness, and fidelity of SLAM, outperforming existing techniques while maintaining real-time performance.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "tGozvLTDY3/podcast.wav"}
