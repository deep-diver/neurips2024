We first select models to check for contamination, then select reference models and benchmarks, and finally compute CONSTAT to detect and quantify contamination.", "description": "This figure illustrates the four main steps of the proposed CONSTAT method for detecting contamination in large language models.  It starts with defining the problem by selecting target models (M1 and M2) and their performance on a benchmark (D). Step 2 involves selecting reference models (Mref,1, Mref,2, Mref,3) and a reference benchmark (Dref).  The reference benchmark can be a rephrased, synthetic, or similar benchmark to the original benchmark D. Step 3 shows the computation of CONSTAT, comparing the performance of the target models on the original benchmark and the reference benchmark, considering the difficulty of the benchmarks using the reference model performances to predict the expected performance and calculate a difference (\u03b4). Step 4 is the result extraction of CONSTAT which displays the contamination magnitude (\u03b4) with its p-value, indicating the statistical significance of the contamination level. A high \u03b4 value with a low p-value signifies strong contamination, indicating a significant performance difference between the original and reference benchmarks. The emojis illustrate the idea of whether a model is contaminated or not (evil vs happy face).", "section": "This Work: A Statistical Test for Contamination"}, {"figure_path": "ALISPmDPCq/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Estimated 8 as a function of the true 8 for the finetuned models. 2-sigma intervals are shown.", "description": "This figure shows the results of evaluating CONSTAT's ability to estimate the sample-specific contamination effect.  It compares CONSTAT's estimate of the contamination effect (\u03b4) against the ground truth measurement obtained from uncontaminated samples.
