### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many reinforcement learning (RL) applications use heuristic rewards alongside task rewards to guide learning and improve performance.  However, existing methods often fail to outperform heuristic-only policies, especially with limited data, due to their focus on 'optimal policy invariance'. This invariance guarantees convergence to the best policy given infinite data, but doesn't ensure better performance with limited data.

This paper introduces Heuristic-Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO), a novel method that addresses this limitation. HEPO directly enforces the policy improvement condition, ensuring that the trained policy always outperforms the heuristic-only policy. Experiments demonstrate that HEPO consistently outperforms heuristic-only policies across various robotic control tasks, showcasing its effectiveness even with suboptimal heuristics and limited data.

### In-depth insights


#### Heuristic Policy Limits
The use of heuristics in reinforcement learning, while often improving performance with limited data, presents significant limitations. **Heuristics, by definition, represent suboptimal strategies**.  They encode human assumptions and biases, potentially restricting the exploration of superior policies that deviate from human intuition.  **Over-reliance on heuristics can lead to premature convergence on locally optimal solutions**, preventing the discovery of globally optimal policies.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of heuristics is highly dependent on their quality and design; poorly designed heuristics can severely hinder performance or even lead to a suboptimal agent. Therefore, incorporating heuristics requires careful consideration of the trade-off between faster initial learning and the risk of limiting the agent's ability to discover truly optimal solutions.  **Balancing heuristic rewards with task rewards is crucial**,  requiring careful tuning that can be time-consuming and task-specific.  A key challenge is to ensure that heuristics serve as valuable guides rather than limiting constraints.

#### Constrained Optimization
The concept of constrained optimization, applied within the context of reinforcement learning using heuristic rewards, presents a powerful approach to overcome limitations of standard reward shaping methods.  **The core idea is to constrain the optimization process**, ensuring that the learned policy consistently outperforms a heuristic-only policy.  This addresses the common issue where policies might exploit heuristic rewards without improving task performance. By imposing this constraint, the algorithm is effectively forced to leverage heuristics only when it genuinely helps achieve a better task-oriented outcome. This approach avoids the need for manual tuning of reward weights, a significant advantage over conventional methods. The introduction of a Lagrangian multiplier facilitates a dynamic balance between task and heuristic rewards throughout the training process, thereby enabling adaptive weighting based on policy improvement rather than relying on predefined constants.  This constrained optimization methodology offers **a robust solution for diverse applications**, particularly in scenarios with limited data or noisy reward signals, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of reinforcement learning techniques.

#### HEPO Algorithm
The HEPO algorithm tackles the challenge of effectively integrating heuristic rewards into reinforcement learning (RL) without compromising optimal task performance.  **Instead of seeking optimal policy invariance**, which can fail with limited data, HEPO imposes a constraint that the learned policy consistently outperforms a heuristic-only baseline. This constraint is implemented using a Lagrangian multiplier, adaptively balancing task and heuristic rewards based on the current policy's performance.  This adaptive approach avoids the often time-consuming and problem-specific task of manually tuning reward weights.  The effectiveness of HEPO is demonstrated across multiple robotic control tasks.  **Crucially, HEPO shows robustness to the quality of the heuristic rewards**, maintaining performance improvements even when heuristic signals are poorly designed or only somewhat helpful. This makes HEPO a valuable tool for RL practitioners, potentially reducing development time by making heuristic rewards more easily deployable and reliable.

#### Reward Function Design
Reward function design is crucial in reinforcement learning, significantly impacting the agent's learning process and overall performance.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unintended behavior, suboptimal solutions, or even catastrophic failures. **Careful consideration of the reward's components, their scaling, and potential biases is necessary.**  For example, sparse rewards might make learning inefficient, while dense rewards might make the agent focus on easier sub-goals instead of the main objective.  This often requires a delicate balance between shaping rewards to guide the agent efficiently towards a solution and avoiding unwanted behavior arising from reward hacking. **Effective reward design often involves iterative refinement**, starting with a simple reward function, observing the agent's behavior, and adjusting the reward based on the observations.  **Human expertise and prior knowledge can guide the process**, suggesting useful heuristic reward terms that can be incorporated to improve learning efficiency and performance.  However, this also necessitates methods to ensure that such heuristic rewards do not limit the potential of the RL agent to discover better solutions than those implied by the heuristics.  Therefore, **constraint-based approaches** that balance heuristic guidance with the pursuit of optimal task performance become critical for effective reward design.  This ensures that the agent's focus remains on optimizing the true task objective while utilizing the heuristic reward to improve efficiency.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In this context, it would likely involve removing or modifying aspects of the proposed method (e.g., the constraint, the Lagrangian multiplier update, the policy training approach) to understand their effects on performance.  **Key findings** from these experiments would pinpoint whether the policy improvement constraint, adaptive reward weighting via the Lagrangian multiplier, or the joint trajectory collection strategy are essential for the improved performance.  **The results** would be crucial for demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of the design choices, clarifying what aspects provide the most significant improvements and helping to determine the overall robustness of the method.  **Comparison to related approaches**, such as Extrinsic-Intrinsic Policy Optimization (EIPO), will also offer valuable insights into the unique advantages of the proposed technique.
