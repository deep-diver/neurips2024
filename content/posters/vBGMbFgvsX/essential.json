{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working with heuristic rewards in reinforcement learning.  It challenges the existing paradigm of optimal policy invariance, offering a novel constrained optimization approach that consistently improves task performance even with limited data. This work opens new avenues for more efficient and reliable RL training with heuristics, particularly in complex robotic applications.", "summary": "HEPO, a novel constrained optimization method, consistently surpasses heuristic-trained policies in reinforcement learning by ensuring policy improvement over heuristics, regardless of heuristic quality.", "takeaways": ["HEPO introduces a new principle for using heuristic rewards in reinforcement learning, focusing on policy improvement instead of optimal policy invariance.", "HEPO consistently outperforms policies trained solely on heuristics across various robotic tasks, showing robustness to heuristic quality.", "HEPO's constrained optimization approach adaptively balances task and heuristic rewards, eliminating the need for manual tuning."], "tldr": "Many reinforcement learning (RL) applications use heuristic rewards alongside task rewards to guide learning and improve performance.  However, existing methods often fail to outperform heuristic-only policies, especially with limited data, due to their focus on 'optimal policy invariance'. This invariance guarantees convergence to the best policy given infinite data, but doesn't ensure better performance with limited data.\nThis paper introduces Heuristic-Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO), a novel method that addresses this limitation. HEPO directly enforces the policy improvement condition, ensuring that the trained policy always outperforms the heuristic-only policy. Experiments demonstrate that HEPO consistently outperforms heuristic-only policies across various robotic control tasks, showcasing its effectiveness even with suboptimal heuristics and limited data.", "affiliation": "National Taiwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "vBGMbFgvsX/podcast.wav"}
