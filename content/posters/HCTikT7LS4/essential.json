This is because learned policies can be deterministically chaotic, leading to unpredictable behavior even when average performance is good.  This lack of robustness severely hinders the deployment of deep RL in various practical applications where sensor inaccuracies and external disturbances are inevitable. \nThis research tackles this challenge by proposing a novel approach. It enhances the Dreamer V3 architecture by incorporating Maximal Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) regularization. This innovative method directly addresses the chaotic behavior of the system by reducing state divergence and enhancing stability.  Experiments demonstrate that the MLE regularization significantly improves the robustness of RL agents, making them less sensitive to noise and perturbations. The increased stability allows for the safe and reliable deployment of deep RL agents in real-world continuous control tasks.", "affiliation": "University of Glasgow", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HCTikT7LS4/podcast.wav"}
