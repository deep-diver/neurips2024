[{"figure_path": "unMRtFfNhF/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Algorithm 1: Good Training-sample Assessment (GTA)", "description": "The GTA algorithm is used to determine if a model is debuggable. It iterates through the training samples and adds a sample to a subset if it improves the model's prediction accuracy on the test instance.  The algorithm then checks if the model retrained on this subset correctly predicts the label of the test instance. If it does, the algorithm outputs TRUE (debuggable); otherwise, it outputs FALSE (not debuggable).", "section": "4.1 The Easy Case"}]
