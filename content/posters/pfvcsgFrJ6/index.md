### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many causal discovery methods assume independent noise, which is often violated in real-world scenarios exhibiting deterministic relations.  This leads to challenges for constraint-based methods that rely on the faithfulness assumption.  Score-based methods using exact search can handle determinism better but are computationally expensive. 

The paper proposes a novel method, Determinism-aware Greedy Equivalent Search (DGES), to address these issues. DGES uses a three-phase approach: (1) identifying minimal deterministic clusters, (2) running a modified Greedy Equivalent Search (GES) globally, and (3) performing exact search only on deterministic clusters and their neighbors.  DGES is shown to be more efficient and accurate than existing methods, accommodating various data types and causal relationships, both linear and nonlinear.

### In-depth insights


#### Deterministic Causality
Deterministic causality, where the cause directly and completely determines the effect without any probabilistic element, presents a unique challenge in causal inference. **Traditional methods often rely on probabilistic assumptions**, such as independent noise, which are violated in deterministic systems.  This leads to difficulties in identifying causal relationships and accurately estimating causal effects.  **Score-based methods**, particularly those using exact search, provide a more robust approach than constraint-based methods in handling deterministic settings.  However,  **computational efficiency remains a significant hurdle**, as exact search rapidly becomes intractable with increasing numbers of variables. The identifiability of causal structures under deterministic relations also requires careful consideration and relies on assumptions like sparsest Markov representation.  Therefore, the development of efficient algorithms and a deeper understanding of identifiability conditions is crucial for advancing causal discovery in the presence of deterministic relationships.

#### DGES Framework
The Determinism-aware Greedy Equivalent Search (DGES) framework offers a novel approach to causal discovery by explicitly addressing the challenges posed by deterministic relationships in data.  **Its three-phase structure** is key:  first, identifying minimal deterministic clusters helps isolate subsets of variables with deterministic dependencies; second, a modified Greedy Equivalent Search (GES) algorithm, adapted to handle determinism, provides an initial causal graph; and third, precise exact search within these clusters and their neighbors refines the structure, leveraging the strengths of score-based methods while mitigating computational costs.  **DGES is designed for generality**, accommodating both linear and nonlinear relationships, and handling continuous and discrete data types.  **Its theoretical grounding**, particularly the identifiability conditions under mild assumptions, makes it a robust and significant contribution to causal inference.  **By combining the efficiency of GES with the accuracy of exact search**, DGES provides a practical solution to a long-standing problem in causal discovery. The framework's ability to detect and incorporate deterministic relations directly improves the accuracy and reliability of causal graph estimation.

#### Identifiability Limits
The concept of "Identifiability Limits" in causal discovery research is critical because it defines the inherent boundaries of what we can reliably infer from observational data. **It highlights that even with perfect data and powerful algorithms, some causal relationships might remain ambiguous or unidentifiable.**  This is especially true in the presence of complex systems, latent confounders, or deterministic relationships, where traditional assumptions of causal inference models can be violated.  **Understanding identifiability limits helps researchers set realistic expectations about the scope and reliability of causal discovery, prompting them to carefully consider limitations and potential biases in their analyses.**  Furthermore, exploring these limits can drive methodological innovation, leading to the development of new algorithms or techniques to address these challenges and improve the accuracy and scope of causal inferences.  **A deep understanding of identifiability limits, therefore, is fundamental to responsible causal inference.**  By acknowledging these inherent limitations, researchers can focus on improving the design of studies, data collection methods, and analytical techniques to overcome these limitations and produce more robust and reliable results, advancing the field of causal inference significantly.

#### Empirical Validation
A robust empirical validation section is crucial for establishing the credibility of any research paper.  It should present a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method, comparing its performance against established baselines across a diverse range of datasets and scenarios.  **Clear descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics (size, dimensionality, noise levels, etc.), are essential.**  The choice of evaluation metrics should be justified and aligned with the research goals. The use of statistical significance tests should be highlighted, quantifying the extent to which observed performance differences are not due to chance.   **Visualizations such as graphs and tables should effectively communicate results**, making it easier for the reader to understand patterns and trends.  A thoughtful discussion of the findings, exploring potential limitations of the method and areas where further improvements are needed, contributes to the paper's overall impact and strengthens its claim of significance.  **Finally, the reproducibility of the empirical validation is critical**. Clear descriptions of experimental setup, including any hyperparameter settings, computing resources, and code availability, ensure that the findings can be verified independently.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on causal discovery with deterministic relations could explore several key areas.  **Extending the DGES framework to handle more complex scenarios** such as those with latent confounders or selection bias is crucial.  **Improving the scalability of the exact search phase** is another critical need, perhaps through the development of more efficient algorithms or heuristics.  **Investigating the impact of different score functions** and their properties under deterministic settings warrants further investigation.  Finally, **applying the DGES methodology to real-world datasets in diverse domains** and evaluating its performance in comparison to existing methods will validate its effectiveness and highlight its limitations.  This could significantly advance the field's practical applicability and provide valuable insights into the nuances of causal inference under deterministic conditions.

In (a), the true causal graph is shown, with a deterministic cluster (DC) {V‚ÇÅ, V‚ÇÇ, V‚ÇÉ, V‚ÇÑ} and a non-deterministic cluster (NDC) {V‚ÇÖ, V‚ÇÜ, V‚Çá}.  The bridge set (BS) represents the edges connecting the DC and NDC. In (b), a possible DAG produced by GES is shown.  GES incorrectly adds edges (BS') resulting in a different structure than the true graph in (a).

> üîº This figure demonstrates the difference between the original GES algorithm and the modified GES algorithm proposed in the paper.  The original GES algorithm, when applied to a graph containing deterministic relations, can incorrectly add or remove edges due to spurious conditional independencies caused by determinism. This example shows how the modified GES algorithm addresses this issue by incorporating additional constraints in the forward and backward phases of the search, ensuring that the resulting graph accurately reflects the causal relationships even in the presence of deterministic clusters. The modified GES algorithm improves the accuracy of the causal graph estimation by handling deterministic relations more effectively.

The graphs demonstrate scenarios where DGES can successfully identify the true Markov equivalence class (MEC) and scenarios where it fails.

The analysis highlights that the method cannot always accurately determine the causal skeleton and directions within the deterministic clusters (MinDCs) when the deterministic relations are complex or involve overlapping variables.
