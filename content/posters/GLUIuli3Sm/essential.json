Current methods often lack strong theoretical guarantees on convergence rates and sample sizes. The paper addresses this limitation by focusing on both loss-based and uncertainty-based active learning strategies.\nThis paper proposes a new algorithm called Adaptive-Weight Sampling (AWS) that uses SGD with an adaptive step size. It theoretically analyzes the convergence rate of AWS for smooth convex training loss functions and demonstrates its efficiency through numerical experiments on various datasets.  The theoretical analysis provides useful insights into the relationship between sampling strategies, convergence rates, and the number of data points needed. The results show that AWS effectively reduces training time and computational cost compared to other approaches.", "affiliation": "Meta", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GLUIuli3Sm/podcast.wav"}
