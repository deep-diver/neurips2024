Additionally, the (robust) generalization gap of neural networks obtained with robust ERM is large and, during training, networks typically exhibit overfitting [Rice et al., 2020]; (robust) test error goes up after initially going down, even though (robust) train error continues to decrease.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our contributions In this work, we explore the implicit bias of optimization in robust ERM and study carefully how it affects the robust generalization of a model. In order to overcome the hurdles of the bilevel optimization in the definition of robust ERM (eq. (1)), we seek to first understand the situation in linear models, where the inner minimization problem admits a closed form solution. Prior work [Yin et al., 2019, Awasthi et al., 2020] that studied generalization bounds for this class of models for $\\ell_{p}$ norm-constrained perturbations observed that the hypothesis class (class of linear predictors) should better be constrained in its $\\ell_{r}$ norm with $r$ smaller than or equal to $p^{\\star}$ , where $p^{\\star}$ is the dual of the perturbation norm $p$ , i.e + p1\u22c6 = 1. For instance, in the case of \u2113\u221eperturbations, these works postulated that searching for robust empirical risk minimizers with small $\\ell_{1}$ norm is beneficial for robust generalization. In Section 2, we further refine these arguments and demonstrate that there are also other factors, namely the sparsity of the data and the magnitude of the perturbation, which can influence the choice of the regularizer norm $r$ . Nevertheless, in accordance with [Yin et al., 2019, Awasthi et al., 2020], we do identify cases where insisting on a suboptimal type of regularization makes generalization more difficult - much more difficult than in \u201cstandard\u201d classification.

The hidden gift of optimization that allowed generalization in the context of ERM can now become a punishment in robust ERM, if implicit bias and threat model happen to be \u201cmisaligned\u201d with each other. We call this the price of implicit bias in adversarially robust generalization and demonstrate two ways this price can appear; either by varying the optimization algorithm or the architecture. In particular, we first focus on robust ERM over the class of linear functions $f_{\\mathrm{lin}}(\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{w})=\\langle\\mathbf{w},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle$ with steepest descent with respect to an $\\ell_{r}$ norm, a class of algorithms which generalizes gradient descent to other geometries besides the Euclidean (Section 3.1). In the case of separable data, we prove that robust ERM with infinitesimal step size with the exponential loss asymptotically reaches a solution with minimum $\\ell_{r}$ norm that classifies the training points robustly (Theorem 3.3). Although this result is to be expected, given that standard ERM with steepest descent also converges to a minimum norm solution (without the robustness constraint, however) [Gunasekar et al., 2018a], it lets us argue that, in certain cases, gradient descent-based robust ERM will generalize poorly despite the existence of better alternatives - see Figure 1 (bottom). We then turn our attention to study the role of architecture in robust ERM. In Section 3.2, we study the implicit bias of gradient descent-based robust ERM in models of the form $f_{\\mathrm{diag}}(\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{u}_{+},\\mathbf{u}_{-})=\\overline{{\\langle}}\\mathbf{u}_{+}^{2}-\\mathbf{\\dot{u}}_{-}^{2},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle$ , commonly referred to as diagonal neural networks [Woodworth et al., 2020].

Note that for this architecture it turns out that the implicit bias of GD is better \u201caligned\u201d with our learning problem and GD generalizes better than SD, despite facing the opposite situation in homogeneous networks. This should not be entirely surprising, since we saw already in linear models that a reparameterization can drastically change the induced bias of the same algorithm.

Our findings seem to suggest that optimizing models for robust generalization is challenging because it is tricky to do capacity control \u201cright\u201d in robust machine learning. The experiments of Section 4 seem to suggest searching for different first-order optimization algorithms (besides gradient descent) for robust ERM (adversarial training) as a promising avenue for future work.

[2020] derived generalization bounds for adversarially robust classification for linear models and simple neural networks, based on the notion of Rademacher Complexity [Koltchinskii and Panchenko, 2002], and form the starting point of our work (Section 2). Gunasekar et al. [2018a] studied the implicit bias of steepest descent in ERM for linear models, while Li et al. [2020] analyzed the implicit bias of gradient descent in robust ERM. Theorem 3.3 can be seen as a generalization of these results. In Section 3.2, we analyze robust ERM with gradient descent in diagonal neural networks, which were introduced in [Woodworth et al., 2020] as a model of feature learning in deep neural networks. The work of Faghri et al. [2021] discusses the connection between optimization bias and adversarial robustness, yet with a very different focus than ours; the authors identify conditions where \u201cstandard\u201d ERM produces maximally robust classifiers, and, leveraging results on the implicit bias of CNNs [Gunasekar et al., 2018b], they design a new adversarial attack that operates in the frequency domain. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Adversarial Robustness Our discussion is focused on so-called white-box robustness (where an adversary has access to any information about the model) - see [Papernot et al., 2016] for a taxonomy of threat models. Adversarial examples in machine learning were first studied in [Biggio et al., 2013] for simple models and in [Szegedy et al., 2014] for deep neural networks deployed in image classification tasks. The adversarial vulnerability of neural networks is ubiquitous [Papernot et al., 2016] and it has been observed in many settings and several modalities (see, for instance, [Kurakin et al., 2017a, Jia and Liang, 2017, Zou et al., 2023]). The reasons for that still remain unclear - explanations in the past have entertained hypotheses such as high dimensionality of input space [Fawzi et al., 2018, Gilmer et al., 2018, Shafahi et al., 2019a], presence of spurious features in natural data [Ilyas et al., 2019, Tsipras et al., 2019, Tsilivis and Kempe, 2022], limited model complexity [Nakkiran, 2019], fundamental computational limits of learning algorithms [Bubeck et al., 2019], and the implicit bias of standard (non-robust) algorithms [Frei et al., 2023, Vardi et al., 2022]. Many empirical methods for defending neural networks have been proposed, but most of them failed to conclusively solve the issue [Carlini and Wagner, 2017, Athalye et al., 2018]. The only mechanism that can be adapted to any threat model and has passed the test of time is Adversarial Training [Madry et al., 2018, Goodfellow et al., 2015, Kurakin et al., 2017b, Shaham et al., 2018], i.e., robust ERM. For neural network training, this translates to calculating at each step adversarial examples with (projected) gradient ascent (or some variant), and then updating the weights with gradient descent (using the gradient of the loss evaluated on the adversarial points). There have been many attempts on improving this method, either computationally by reducing the amount of gradient calculations [Shafahi et al., 2019b, Zhang et al., 2019a, Wong et al., 2020], or statistically by modifying the loss function [Zhang et al., 2019b, Awasthi et al., 2023]. A common pitfall of all these methods is large (robust) generalization gap [Croce et al., 2021] and (robust) overfitting during training [Rice et al., 2020]; towards the end of training, the robust test error increases even though the robust training error continues to decrease. Vast amounts of synthetic training data have been shown to help on both accounts, alleviating the need for early stopping during training [Wang et al., 2023]. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Margin-based Generalization bounds The idea of (confidence) margin has been central in the development of many machine learning methods [Vapnik, 1998, Taskar et al., 2003, Rudin et al., 2005] and it has been used in several contexts for justifying their empirical success [Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Schapire et al., 1997, Koltchinskii and Panchenko, 2002]. In linear models and kernel methods, it is closely related to the notion of geometric margin, and margin-based generalization bounds can explain the strong generalization performance in high-dimensions [Vapnik, 1998, Mohri et al., 2012, Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014]. For neural networks, they are still the object of active research [Bartlett et al., 2017, Neyshabur et al., 2018, Long and Sedghi, 2020, Cortes et al., 2021]. For these kind of bounds, the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class plays a central role [Koltchinskii, 2001]. Rademacher complexity-type analyses have been shown to subsume other similar frameworks [Kakade et al., 2008, Foster et al., 2019], such as the PAC-Bayes one [McAllester, 1998], and in many cases they can provide the finest known guarantees. Yin et al. [2019] and Awasthi et al. [2020] recently derived margin-based bounds for adversarially robust classification - see also Mustafa et al. [2022] for non-additive perturbations. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Implicit Bias of Optimization Algorithms The implicit bias (or regularization) of optimization algorithms refers to the tendency of gradient methods to induce properties to the solution that were not explicitly specified. It is believed to be beneficial for generalization in learning [Neyshabur et al., 2015]. The implicit bias of gradient descent towards margin maximization/norm minimization has been studied in many learning setups including matrix factorization [Arora et al., 2019, Gunasekar et al., 2017], learning with linear models [Soudry et al., 2018, Ji and Telgarsky, 2019b], deep linear [Ji and Telgarsky, 2019a] and convolutional networks [Gunasekar et al., 2018b], and homogeneous models [Lyu and Li, 2020, Nacson et al., 2019]. Telgarsky [2013] and Gunasekar et al. [2018a] have analyzed implicit biases beyond $\\ell_{2}$ -like margin maximization for other optimization algorithms; namely Adaboost and Steepest (and Mirror) Descent, respectively. See Vardi [2023] for a comprehensive survey of the area. The importance of sparsity (min- $\\ell_{1}$ solutions) in binary classification has been studied in [Ng, 2004]. In the context of adversarial training, Li et al. [2020] analyzed the implicit bias of optimizing a worst-case loss with gradient descent in linear models, and Lyu and Zhu [2022] extended these results to deep models.
