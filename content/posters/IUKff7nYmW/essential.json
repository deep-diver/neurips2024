However, the non-smooth, time-varying network setting remains challenging. Existing algorithms lack theoretical guarantees or fall short of optimal performance.  This creates a significant hurdle in diverse applications, particularly in distributed machine learning where network dynamics are common.\nThis paper addresses these issues by establishing the first lower bounds for the non-smooth, time-varying setting.  It then introduces a novel algorithm that achieves these lower bounds, demonstrating optimality.  The algorithm significantly surpasses existing methods in theoretical performance, offering a major advancement for this complex optimization problem.
