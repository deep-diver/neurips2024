It depicts various tables representing different business objects (like CLIENT, DATACENTER, RESOURCEPOOL) and their relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, STAR schema, SNOWFLAKE schema).  The schema's complexity showcases the difficulties that large language models (LLMs) face when trying to reason about these relationships to generate correct SQL queries from natural language questions.", "section": "2 Motivation"}, {"figure_path": "lEDuaGGiCV/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: LUCY's high-level workflow.

The figure illustrates the relationships between these core tables, which are important for understanding how the different components of the database relate to each other.  The edges represent relationships between tables, and the nodes represent the tables themselves.

The workflow is divided into three main phases: MatchTables, GenerateView, and QueryView.  The MatchTables phase uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to identify the relevant tables and attributes in the database based on the user's question. The GenerateView phase uses an automated reasoner to construct a view that combines the relevant tables based on the database schema and constraints. Finally, the QueryView phase uses LLMs to generate the final SQL query based on the user's question and the generated view.
