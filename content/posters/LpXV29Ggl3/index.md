### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Continual embodied instruction following, where AI agents execute multiple tasks based on real-time environmental information, is a major challenge in robotics. Current methods often struggle with efficiency and the dynamic nature of real-world settings.  They frequently rely on repeated interactions to collect environmental knowledge, which is inefficient and can lead to outdated information.

The proposed ExRAP framework addresses these issues by **integrating environment exploration into LLM-based planning**.  It employs memory to store environmental context and uses an information-based exploration strategy to efficiently gather new information.  This approach leads to a better balance between exploration and exploitation, resulting in improved task success rates and execution efficiency.  ExRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various simulated environments, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

> The figure illustrates the ExRAP framework for continual embodied instruction following. It contrasts an integrated planning approach with an instruction-wise approach.  The integrated approach uses memory-augmented query evaluation and exploration-integrated task planning, resulting in more efficient task execution by considering multiple instructions simultaneously and leveraging an environmental context memory. The instruction-wise approach processes instructions one by one, leading to less efficient task completion.

> This table presents the performance of different models (ZSP, SayCan, ProgPrompt, LLM-Planner, and ExRAP) across three different environments (VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA) under varying degrees of non-stationarity (low, medium, high).  The performance is measured using two metrics: Task Success Rate (SR) and average Pending Steps (PS).  Higher SR indicates better performance, while lower PS means higher efficiency. The confidence intervals are calculated using multiple random seeds to provide a measure of statistical significance.





### In-depth insights


#### ExRAP Framework
The ExRAP framework presents a novel approach to continual embodied instruction following, **enhancing LLMs' capabilities** by integrating environmental context memory and information-based exploration.  Its core innovation lies in the **exploration-integrated task planning** scheme, which intelligently balances memory updates with environmental exploration.  This is crucial for efficiency in dynamic, non-stationary environments where continuous adaptation is key.  **Memory-augmented query evaluation** ensures robust condition checking, while **temporal consistency refinement** mitigates knowledge decay. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated across diverse scenarios in VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA, outperforming existing methods in both goal success and efficiency.  **Robustness against variations in instruction scale, type, and non-stationarity** further highlights its practical potential.

#### Continual Planning
Continual planning addresses the challenge of **adapting decision-making processes to dynamic, evolving environments**.  Unlike traditional planning which assumes a static world, continual planning requires mechanisms for **handling unexpected events, integrating new information, and adjusting plans in real-time**.  This necessitates efficient methods for **monitoring the environment**, detecting changes, and triggering plan updates.  Key considerations include **managing computational costs** associated with frequent replanning and **balancing exploration and exploitation**, ensuring the agent effectively learns about the environment while completing tasks.  Successful continual planners need robust mechanisms for **maintaining and updating internal models** of the world, handling uncertainty, and dealing with potential inconsistencies between model and reality.  **Robustness** to both unforeseen circumstances and incomplete information is critical.  A central theme is the intelligent selection of actions that **maximize both efficiency and informational value** simultaneously. Efficient exploration strategies are paramount to continual planning, providing the information necessary for informed decision-making.

#### Info-Based Exploration
Info-based exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to **maximize the information gained** from each action, thus efficiently exploring the environment and improving learning.  Unlike random exploration, it prioritizes actions that yield the most informative outcomes, reducing the time and resources needed to build an accurate model of the environment.  **Uncertainty reduction** is a key driver; actions that resolve uncertainty about the environment are favored.  This approach is particularly useful in complex environments where exploration is costly or dangerous. **Mutual information** is often used as a metric to quantify the information gain, measuring the reduction in uncertainty about the environment's state after taking an action.  In the context of embodied AI, such methods are **crucial** for agents to efficiently discover and utilize relevant knowledge within their environment, leading to faster learning and better task performance.

#### Temporal Consistency
Temporal consistency, in the context of embodied AI and continual instruction following, addresses the challenge of maintaining accurate and up-to-date environmental context memory.  **Information decay** is a major concern; as the agent interacts with the environment, older information might become outdated or irrelevant.  To mitigate this, temporal consistency mechanisms aim to refine the memory by **detecting and resolving contradictions** between newly acquired observations and existing knowledge. This often involves comparing the confidence levels assigned to queries based on the memory against current environmental conditions. **Entropy-based methods** can be particularly useful, as they directly quantify uncertainty or information decay in the memory, allowing the system to prioritize exploration or data collection strategies that maximize information gain and reduce uncertainty, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of the query results and overall task completion.

#### Future of ExRAP
The future of ExRAP hinges on addressing its current limitations and expanding its capabilities.  **Improving the efficiency of environmental exploration** is crucial; perhaps integrating more sophisticated exploration strategies like active learning or curiosity-driven methods could reduce reliance on exhaustive exploration. **Enhancing the robustness of the LLM-based query evaluator** is vital, potentially through techniques like uncertainty quantification or incorporating more advanced reasoning mechanisms.  **Expanding the types of tasks ExRAP can handle** beyond those in the current experimental setup will demonstrate its generalizability. This could involve complex multi-step tasks or tasks requiring intricate reasoning about the physical environment. Lastly, exploring the potential of ExRAP for **real-world applications** is essential, which will involve testing the system in real-world settings and addressing challenges like noisy sensor data and unpredictable environments.  **Addressing the computational cost** associated with large language models, and improving the memory efficiency, will further enhance scalability and real-world practicality.

> This figure illustrates the overall architecture of the ExRAP framework, showing the two main components: (a) Query evaluation and (b) Exploration-integrated task planning.  The query evaluation process uses a memory-augmented query evaluator to assess the likelihood of queries based on the environmental context memory (TEKG). The exploration-integrated task planning involves two planners: an exploitation planner that focuses on completing tasks and an exploration planner that prioritizes updating the environmental context memory by maximizing information gain. The system selects the next skill based on a combination of the exploitation and exploration values.

> This figure illustrates the two main components of the ExRAP framework: query evaluation and exploration-integrated task planning.  The query evaluation process uses a temporal embodied knowledge graph (TEKG) to assess the likelihood of query conditions being met, factoring in potential information decay.  Exploration-integrated task planning combines an exploitation planner (using LLMs and demonstrations) with an exploration planner (using information gain) to select the best action at each step, balancing task completion and environmental understanding.

> This figure shows the exploration value over time for two different levels of non-stationarity: low and high.  The exploration value generally increases over time, indicating that the agent is actively learning and discovering new information about its environment. However, the exploration value also drops sharply at certain points in time, especially in the high non-stationarity case. This suggests that as the agent learns, it quickly becomes confident about certain aspects of its environment and therefore reduces its exploration.  The higher non-stationarity condition leads to a more dramatic increase and decrease in exploration value, suggesting that the agent needs to explore more frequently in a rapidly changing environment.
