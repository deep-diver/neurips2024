The exploration value generally increases over time, indicating that the agent is actively learning and discovering new information about its environment. However, the exploration value also drops sharply at certain points in time, especially in the high non-stationarity case. This suggests that as the agent learns, it quickly becomes confident about certain aspects of its environment and therefore reduces its exploration.  The higher non-stationarity condition leads to a more dramatic increase and decrease in exploration value, suggesting that the agent needs to explore more frequently in a rapidly changing environment.", "section": "E Analysis"}]
