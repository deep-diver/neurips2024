### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep reinforcement learning often struggles with interpretability and generalization to long, repetitive tasks. Existing programmatic RL methods, which aim to address this using human-readable programs, often fail to effectively solve such problems or generalize well to longer testing horizons.  This paper tackles this issue.

The paper proposes the Hierarchical Programmatic Option framework (HIPO) to address these shortcomings. HIPO employs a program embedding space to represent programs, a search algorithm to select effective, diverse, and compatible programs as options, and a high-level policy to manage option selection.  **Evaluation demonstrates that HIPO outperforms baselines on various long-horizon tasks, especially in generalization to longer horizons.**

### In-depth insights


#### Hierarchical Programmatic Options
The concept of "Hierarchical Programmatic Options" suggests a novel approach to reinforcement learning where **human-readable programs serve as building blocks for complex policies**.  Instead of learning a monolithic, opaque neural network, the system learns a hierarchy of programs,  each performing a specific subtask (option). A higher-level policy then decides which option to execute at each time step, based on the current state. This hierarchical structure facilitates **better interpretability**, as the logic of the system is expressed through modular, understandable programs. It also promotes **generalization** because learned subtasks can be reused across different situations and potentially scaled to longer horizons than what's achievable with flat programmatic policies. The key challenge lies in designing efficient methods to search for and select a diverse, yet compatible, set of programs as options. The framework's effectiveness relies heavily on the compatibility and diversity of options as the higher-level policy depends on their seamless integration.  **Effective search algorithms** are essential to find suitable program options and ensure that they are not overly similar, hence limiting the flexibility of the system.  Finally, the high-level policy itself could benefit from techniques enhancing interpretability, perhaps by representing it as a structured model rather than a black box neural network.

#### CEM Enhancements
The paper explores enhancements to the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for program synthesis within a reinforcement learning context.  **The core enhancement involves a diversity multiplier**, which penalizes the selection of programs that are too similar to those already chosen. This encourages exploration of the program space and improves the diversity and ultimately the effectiveness of the synthesized program set.  **A second, more sophisticated enhancement integrates a compatibility measure** into the CEM evaluation function, explicitly rewarding the selection of programs which perform well when executed sequentially with previously selected programs. This addresses the crucial issue of program compatibility when assembling complex task solutions from modular program options.  **These CEM enhancements are experimentally validated**, demonstrating their effectiveness in generating a more diverse and compatible set of program options, leading to improvements in overall reinforcement learning performance across various long-horizon tasks. The combined approach strikes a balance between exploration, exploitation and collaboration, effectively generating a skill set suitable for complex, long and repeated sub-tasks.

#### Long-Horizon Tasks
Addressing long-horizon tasks presents a unique challenge in reinforcement learning due to the **extended temporal dependencies** and **sparse reward signals**.  Traditional methods struggle to effectively learn optimal policies in such scenarios, often resulting in poor generalization and suboptimal performance.  The complexity arises from the need for the agent to plan and execute sequences of actions over long time horizons, requiring **skill acquisition, temporal abstraction, and effective memory mechanisms**.  Successfully tackling long-horizon tasks necessitates designing frameworks that leverage these factors.  **Hierarchical approaches**, decomposing complex tasks into subtasks, emerge as an effective solution, enabling better learning, planning and policy representation.  **Programmatic approaches** can enhance interpretability by explicitly modeling policies as human-readable programs, facilitating analysis and improving trust in the learned behaviors.  Therefore, a unified framework incorporating hierarchical structures and programmatic policies provides a promising direction, enabling both better performance and improved understandability in solving long-horizon tasks.

#### Interpretability and Generalization
The inherent tension between interpretability and generalization in machine learning models is a central theme.  Highly interpretable models, such as those employing simple decision trees or rule-based systems, often struggle to achieve the same level of accuracy and generalizability as more complex, less interpretable models like deep neural networks.  **The choice often involves a trade-off: prioritize the ability to understand how a model arrives at its decisions or its capacity to handle diverse, unseen data effectively?**  This paper's proposed Hierarchical Programmatic Option (HIPO) framework attempts to navigate this trade-off. By expressing policies as human-readable programs, HIPO enhances interpretability.  However, the success of HIPO hinges on the effectiveness of its program search and high-level policy learning, impacting its generalization capabilities.  The experimental results provide some evidence of improved generalization to longer, more complex tasks compared to some standard approaches, highlighting a potential pathway to reconcile interpretability with better generalization in reinforcement learning.  **Further research could investigate ways to systematically enhance the diversity and compatibility of retrieved programs**,  crucial for generalization to new task instances that exhibit similar repetitive patterns but vary in length or other subtle characteristics.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the efficiency and scalability of the program search algorithm** is crucial; exploring advanced search techniques or incorporating prior knowledge, such as LLMs or offline datasets, could significantly enhance the speed and quality of option retrieval.  Another important area is **enhancing the generalizability of HIPO**, enabling it to handle more diverse and complex tasks across various domains and with varying levels of noise or uncertainty.  Further investigation into the potential **limitations of using domain-specific languages** is needed, considering the challenge of developing DSLs for different domains or adapting them to handle increasingly complex tasks.  Finally, a deeper exploration into **improving the interpretability of the high-level policy**, perhaps through techniques like state machine extraction or formal methods for program verification, would enhance user trust and confidence in the learned policies.

> Figure 16: Visualization of SEESAW in the KAREL-LONG problem set. This figure partially illustrates a typical trajectory of the Karel agent during the task SEESAW. (a): Once the Karel agent collects a marker in the left chamber, a new marker appears in the right chamber. (b): The agent must navigate through the central corridor to collect the marker in the right chamber. (c): Once the Karel agent collects a marker in the right chamber, a new marker further appears in the left chamber. (d): Once again, the agent is traversing through the corridor to the left chamber. (e): A new marker appears in the right chamber again after the agent picks up the marker in the left chamber. (f): The agent will move back and forth between the two chambers to collect the emerging markers continuously. Note that the locations of all the emerging markers are randomized. Also, note that we have set the number of emerging markers to 64 during the training phase (i.e., the agent has to pick up 64 markers to fully complete the task.) More details of the task SEESAW can be found in Section H.

> üîº This figure illustrates the proposed Hierarchical Programmatic Option framework (HIPO). The left panel (a) shows the process of retrieving a diverse set of effective and reusable programmatic options from a program embedding space using an advanced search algorithm based on the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) that considers compatibility and diversity. The right panel (b) shows how a high-level policy, represented by neural networks, learns to select and execute these programmatic options to solve long-horizon RL tasks.

> Figure 2: Hierarchical Programmatic Option Framework. (a): Retrieving programmatic options. After learning the program embedding space, we propose an advanced search scheme built upon the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) to search programs pm1,..., Pmk, pmk+1 of different skills. While searching for the next program pmk+1, we consider its compatibility with predetermined programs pm1, ‚Ä¶, Pmk by randomly sampling a sequence of programs. We also consider the diversity among all programs using the diversity multiplier. (b): Learning High-Level Policy with Programmatic Options
