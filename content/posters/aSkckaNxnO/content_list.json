This technique leverages semantic features to control the representation of LLM\u2019s intermediate hidden states, enabling the model to meet specific requirements such as increased honesty or heightened safety awareness. However, a significant challenge arises when attempting to fulfill multiple requirements simultaneously. It proves difficult to encode various semantic contents, like honesty and safety, into a singular semantic feature, restricting its practicality.

By delving into the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs, we manage to identify and pinpoint components that are closely related to specific tasks within the model, i.e., attention heads. These heads display sparse characteristics that allow for near-independent control over different tasks.

On the other hand, LLMs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can elicit harmful responses (Casper et al. [2023], Wei et al. [2023], Kang et al. [2023], Shaikh et al. [2023], Yuan et al.

[2023] proposed the hypothesis of linear representations within LLMs, demonstrating that each semantic concept constitutes a subspace, further bolstering the rationale for linear representation modeling. A common method to locate these representations employs linear classifiers as probes (Alain and Bengio [2017], Tenney et al. [2019], Belinkov [2022]), which are trained to predict attributes of the input from intermediate network layers. Li et al. [2023] pursued this approach further by training a classifier for each attention head within an LLM, identifying the most effective group of heads for linear modeling using PCA to control their output representations. Similarly, Zou et al. [2023a] also utilized PCA for modeling, employing the projection values of principal directions as criteria for classification judgment, aiming to control the output representations of the most effective layer identified. These localization methods primarily depend on the quality and scale of the data itself, making it challenging to avoid biases introduced by data bias. Additionally, the principal directions of PCA lose information from other dimensions within the subspace.

After implementing controls to mitigate exaggerated safety concerns in both single-task and multi-tasks, the controlled model\u2019s general safety ratings remain high, at $97.30\\%$ and $98.26\\%$ , respectively. This indicates that the model\u2019s general safety has not been significantly compromised, with a relatively minor decrease of only $2.2\\%$ . This is because we replaced sensitive keywords (e.g., \u201ckill\u201d and \u201ccrash\u201d) with milder alternatives (Shi et al. [2024b]), creating negativepositive pairs. By transforming/controlling from negative to positive, we reduced the model\u2019s reliance on these keywords and encouraged it to consider the context when evaluating the intention of input, thereby enabling the enhancement on \u201cexaggerated safety\u201d while maintaining \u201csafety in general\u201d.

In contrast, Preference Bias and Exaggerated Safety had 7 shared heads $(14\\%)$ . It is likely that both tasks are associated with the model\u2019s decision on whether to refuse a response.

The outcomes are detailed in Table 2. The results indicate that selecting heads randomly has almost no effect on the outcomes. Because Path Patching has shown most heads don\u2019t cause changes in the output logits, meaning there\u2019s almost a certainty that random heads won\u2019t alter the output. On the other hand, RepE-CLS showed less effectiveness than SAC in all three tasks, particularly in Preference Bias with more than $15\\%$ gap. We found that heads identified by classification had more than a $30\\%$ overlap for Adv Factuality and the other tasks. These heads typically demonstrated common attention patterns, e.g., self-attention or focusing on subjects and objects. You can find a more in-depth discussion in the Appendix E.

", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Further discussions about our work include comparing computational costs with SFT, examining the orthogonality of key components, exploring modeling methods for activations, and assessing transferability to proprietary models. Essentially, SAC is a training-free method, resulting in no modification to model parameters, and it\u2019s the causal mediation process that takes up most of the computational cost. We hope that future research into locating components at different granularity will help further reduce these costs. Moreover, SAC offers flexibility in controlling intensity and can generalize across multiple tasks, which SFT struggles to do. To give a quantitative view, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuning the model only using the same small number of samples as the proposed method used. The fine-tuned model achieved results of $63.00\\%$ , $66.98\\%$ , and $10.83\\%$ on the exsafe, advfact, and pref bias metrics, respectively\u2014over $20\\%$ lower than the performance of our method. Furthermore, when the fine-tuned model was evaluated on robustness and privacy datasets (discussed in Appendix B), its performance drastically declined, dropping from $39.42\\%$ to $12.86\\%$ and from $100\\%$ to $36.43\\%$ . This phenomenon is similar with Qi et al. [2024] that even by fine-tuning the model with benign data, the model\u2019s safety can be compromised sharply. In contrast, the proposed method demonstrated negligible impact on performance. We have observed strong orthogonality of attention heads across different tasks, though some overlaps exist, as discussed in Appendix D. These minor overlaps don\u2019t impact SAC\u2019s performance significantly. For modeling methods, GMM and PCA are popular choices. Both methods have their applicable scenario depending on the feature dimension and data volume. Our choice of GMM is based on its robust framework for density estimation, grounded in probability theory and maximum likelihood estimation. Although many studies support the linear representation space assumption, for practical purposes, we simplified modeling with a single Gaussian distribution within the GMM framework. Additionally, improving closed-source models remains a significant challenge. These insights are inspirational, and we hope future research will continue to build on these discussions.

By implementing this approach, researchers can effectively analyze the causal relationships existing between two computational nodes, often denoted as Sender $\\rightarrow$ Receiver.

Firstly, given reference data $X_{r}$ and counterfactual data $X_{c}$ , the activations of all heads are gathered for preparation of the later perturbation. Then, we do a hard intervention on the Head 0.31 that is perturbated to its activation on $X_{c}$ , where the effect will be further propagated to the Ouput node along with a set of paths $\\mathcal{P}$ . To ensure an independent observation of the impact from the Head 0.31, $\\mathcal{P}$ comprises the forward pathways through residual connections and MLPs except for the other attention heads(e.g., Head $0.0,\\ldots,0.30,1.0,\\ldots,1.31)$ . Thus we do a hard intervention on the other heads by freezing their activations on $X_{r}$ . Finally, we obtain the final output logits to measure the impact of this perturbation.

Pathways $h{\\rightarrow}$ logits that are critical to the model\u2019s behavior on certain task should induce a large drop in the logit of token $\\{{\\bf\\Xi}\\subset\\}$ after patching.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
