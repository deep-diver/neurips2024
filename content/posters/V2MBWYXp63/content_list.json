Compared to binary relational facts, n-ary relational facts in NKGs have more diverse schemas for different scenarios. For example, Wikidata utilizes n-ary relational facts in a hyper-relational schema [20, 10, 23], i.e., $(s,r,o,\\{(k_{i},v_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{n-2})$ which adds $(n-2)$ key-value pairs to the main triple to represent auxiliary information.
