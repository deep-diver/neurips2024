This paper identifies this robustness issue as a major limitation of current unlearning techniques and highlights that straightforward implementations of adversarial training (AT) negatively affect the image quality. \nThis work introduces 'AdvUnlearn', a novel framework that integrates AT into the unlearning process. AdvUnlearn addresses the image quality challenge by incorporating a 'utility-retaining regularization', achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and utility.  Furthermore, the study discovers that applying AT to the text encoder component of the model is significantly more effective, leading to a robust and efficient unlearning process with high image quality.  The resulting robust text encoder can be used as a plug-and-play module for various diffusion models, enhancing usability.", "affiliation": "Michigan State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "dkpmfIydrF/podcast.wav"}
