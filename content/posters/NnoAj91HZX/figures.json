Left: the gray area represents Yk\u22121 consisting of points reachable from Xk\u22121. Middle: if ik = 0 (case 1), Xk\u22121 = Xk holds and Yk\u22121 shrinks to Yk, the darker area, since the constraint on y(V) gets tighter. Right: if ik = i\u2081 (cases 2 and 3), the area, Yk, reachable from Xk = Xk\u22121 + ei\u2081 shifts along ei\u2081.", "description": "This figure shows the visualization of the sets Yk in a two-dimensional space (Z2).  Each panel represents a different scenario, illustrating how the set of feasible points (Yk) changes depending on the choice of ik (update direction).  The feasible region is a trapezoid, and the gray area represents the set of points reachable at each step of the algorithm. Case 1 shows the scenario where no update is made (ik = 0). Case 2 and 3 depict the scenarios when an update is performed (ik \u2260 0), showing the shift of Yk along the update direction ei\u2081. The figure aids in understanding the proof of Theorem 3.1, which establishes the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M-concave function maximization.", "section": "Robustness of greedy M\u00b9-concave function maximization to local errors"}]
