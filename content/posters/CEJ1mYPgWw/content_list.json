Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualizationof-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks.

Humans can not only create task-relevant abstract representations from visual perception [BK18, KC22], but also imagine unseen scenes through their mind\u2019s eye.

Building upon this cognitive function, humans facilitate spatial reasoning by mental image manipulation, such as navigation [Tol48], mental rotation [SM71], mental paper folding [SF72], and mental simulation [MK09]. Figure 1 illustrates the human process involved in a navigation task.

Recent advancements have further explored spatial reasoning within the context of large language models (LLMs). To improve multi-hop spatial reasoning skills of language models, several works [MFNK21, MK22] proposed to pretrain language models with synthetic datasets. An increasing number of dataset were then developed to covers various type of spatial relations in 2D visual scenes [WBC $^{+}15$ , SZL22], geometric patterns [Cho19] and 3D spatial information [AMKK21, $\\mathrm{HZC}^{+}23]$ . $[\\mathrm{FML^{+}}22]$ investigated spatial reasoning capabilities of transformer-based models in the UI grounding setting. On the other hand, some works adopted in-context learning, leveraging LLMs for general purpose reasoning to convert spatial information to logic forms [YIL23], or as a general pattern machine for sequence transformation $[\\mathrm{MXF}^{+}23]$ .

In the configuration generation stage, to generate valid spatial configurations of a rectangle and the corresponding polyomino set, we convert a tiling problem to existing formalized problems. One of the problems is an exact cover problem leveraging dancing link algorithm [Knu00], which could be described as: given a matrix of 0s and 1s, find a set of rows containing exactly one 1 in each column. The conversion is to construct a matrix of 0s and 1s, each row of which represents a possible arrangement of placing a specific polyomino in a rectangle. As illustrated in Equation 9, given $k$ polyomino pieces, and a rectangle of $n$ units to be fliled, the first $k$ columns compose an one-hot vector indicating the corresponding polyomino, and the last $n$ columns are marked with 0 or 1 depending on whether the corresponding unit is fliled by that polyomino. Then finding a set of polyomino arrangements in a rectangle equals to find a set of rows containing exactly one 1 in each column. Another adaptable problem is the boolean satisfiability problem (commonly known as SAT), for which efficient solvers exist [ES03, GN07]. A tiling problem can be converted to SAT by introducing a boolean variable for each possible arrangement of each piece, and then adding clauses comprising of those boolean variables that ensure at least one arrangement of each piece is achieved, while avoiding conflicts between arrangements of one piece or two different pieces.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
