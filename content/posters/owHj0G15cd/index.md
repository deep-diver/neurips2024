### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization (PBEMO) methods often struggle with inefficiency and misalignment with human preferences, particularly due to reliance on reward models and the stochastic nature of human feedback.  These issues lead to mis-calibrated reward models and inefficient use of human time and computational resources.  This limits the applicability of PBEMO methods to real-world scenarios.

This paper introduces D-PBEMO, a novel framework that tackles these issues directly. It uses a clustering-based stochastic dueling bandits algorithm, eliminating the need for a predefined reward model. This model-free approach learns preferences directly from pairwise comparisons, scaling efficiently to high-dimensional problems.  Furthermore, D-PBEMO incorporates a principled termination criterion to manage human cognitive load and computational cost.  Experiments show D-PBEMO's effectiveness, exceeding the performance of existing algorithms on diverse benchmark problems, including those involving RNA inverse design and protein structure prediction.

> üîº Figure 1(a) shows a flow chart of a conventional Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (PBEMO) method, illustrating the three main modules: Optimization, Consultation, and Preference Elicitation.  The optimization module explores the search space, the consultation module interacts with the decision-maker (DM) to obtain preference information, and the preference elicitation module transforms this information into a format that guides the optimization process. Figure 1(b) compares three different preference learning strategies in the Consultation module: Reward/Ranking, Parametric/Structured, and Direct.  The Reward/Ranking strategy uses scores or rankings from the DM, while the Parametric/Structured strategy uses a parameterized model of preferences, and the Direct strategy uses pairwise comparisons from the DM without explicit reward models.

### In-depth insights


#### Dueling Bandit MO
Incorporating dueling bandits into multi-objective optimization (MO) offers a novel approach to preference elicitation.  **Dueling bandits efficiently leverage pairwise comparisons**, allowing decision-makers to express preferences between solution pairs, rather than ranking a large set. This is particularly useful in MO where the concept of a single "best" solution is often not applicable.  By directly modeling preferences through comparisons, the method avoids the complexities and potential biases of reward models often used in preference-based MO.  However, **challenges arise in scaling dueling bandits to high-dimensional spaces** where the number of possible solutions (arms) is vast. Algorithms will need to incorporate smart sampling strategies and efficient data structures to reduce computation and human cognitive load.  **A hybrid approach**, combining clustering or other dimensionality reduction techniques with dueling bandits, could be a promising path toward efficient and effective preference learning in complex multi-objective problems. Future research should explore effective algorithms and theoretical analyses of regret bounds in this context.

#### Direct Preference EMO
Direct Preference Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMO) represents a significant advancement in handling multi-objective problems by directly incorporating human preferences.  Traditional EMO methods often struggle to efficiently navigate the Pareto front to find solutions aligning with decision-maker preferences.  **Direct Preference EMO bypasses the need for intermediate reward models or complex preference learning**, thus streamlining the process and improving alignment with the decision-maker's true aspirations. By using techniques like clustering-based stochastic dueling bandits, it efficiently leverages pairwise comparisons to directly learn preferences, avoiding the complexities and potential biases inherent in alternative approaches.  The resulting preference model is incorporated into the EMO algorithm, **guiding the search toward preferred regions of the Pareto front more effectively**.  Furthermore, this approach offers a principled termination criterion, managing human cognitive load and computational costs.  **The model-free nature of Direct Preference EMO makes it robust and adaptable**, handling the stochastic nature of human feedback without relying on strong distributional assumptions.  This makes Direct Preference EMO a powerful and promising technique for solving complex real-world multi-objective optimization challenges where direct human involvement is crucial.

#### Clustering Bandits
Clustering bandits represent a novel approach to address the limitations of traditional dueling bandits, particularly in high-dimensional settings where the number of arms is substantial.  The core idea involves **partitioning the arms into clusters**, thus reducing the complexity of pairwise comparisons. This clustering strategy effectively **mitigates the computational burden** associated with directly comparing all arms and allows for strategic exploration and exploitation within clusters.  Furthermore, **clustering incorporates prior knowledge or inherent structure among arms**, potentially leading to faster convergence and improved regret bounds compared to methods that treat arms independently.  However, careful consideration must be given to the choice of clustering algorithm and the potential impact of poorly-formed clusters which may hinder performance.  **The optimal clustering technique will likely depend on the specific application and characteristics of the arms.**  Effective clustering can thus significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of dueling bandit algorithms, opening avenues for applications previously deemed intractable.

#### Regret Bound Analysis
A regret bound analysis for a dueling bandit algorithm is crucial for understanding its efficiency.  It quantifies the difference between the performance of the algorithm and that of an optimal strategy.  In the context of preference-based multi-objective optimization (PBEMO), where human feedback guides the search, analyzing regret is especially important because human involvement is costly. **A tight regret bound provides strong theoretical guarantees on the efficiency of the proposed consultation module, indicating that it strategically scales well with high-dimensional dueling bandits.**  The analysis typically involves making assumptions about the stochastic nature of human feedback and the properties of the underlying preference distribution. **Demonstrating a regret bound that is sub-linear in the number of queries suggests the algorithm learns efficiently**, which is essential for managing the cognitive load on human participants. The effectiveness of the clustering-based approach can also be evaluated by comparing its regret bound with the regret bounds of other dueling bandit algorithms.  A significant improvement in the regret bound would further strengthen the proposed method's advantage in efficiency and scalability for PBEMO applications. **Ultimately, a rigorous regret bound analysis provides crucial insights into the algorithm's theoretical performance and its practicality for real-world applications.**

#### PBEMO Advancements
Preference-based Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (PBEMO) has seen significant advancements, addressing limitations of traditional MO methods. **Early PBEMO struggled with inefficient human-in-the-loop interaction**, often requiring numerous queries.  **Recent work focuses on model-free approaches**, reducing the need for complex reward models and model selection. This improves efficiency and better aligns with DM's true preferences, particularly relevant with the stochastic nature of human feedback.  **New algorithms leverage techniques like dueling bandits**, enabling strategic preference learning through pairwise comparisons.  **Clustering methods further enhance scalability**, allowing PBEMO to handle higher-dimensional problems.  Though challenges still exist regarding regret analysis and handling of highly stochastic feedback, **the shift towards model-free and scalable approaches marks a considerable step forward in PBEMO's development**, potentially enhancing usability in real-world applications.
