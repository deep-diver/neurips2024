The study removes components one at a time to measure their individual contribution to the overall performance. Metrics used to evaluate performance include CLIP-F (CLIP score based on front views), CLIP-O (CLIP score based on all views), SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), and FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance).  The rows labeled \"Full model\" and \"Full model*\" represent the complete model and the model's output before the final 4D construction stage respectively.", "section": "4.4 Ablation Study"}]
