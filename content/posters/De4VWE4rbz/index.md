### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Online reconstruction of dynamic scenes from streaming videos is challenging due to limitations in training, rendering, and storage efficiency. Existing methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are prone to overfitting and inefficient storage.  This leads to slow training and suboptimal rendering performance, hindering real-time applications.

HiCoM addresses these issues by employing a three-component approach: a compact and robust initial 3DGS representation, a hierarchical coherent motion mechanism for efficient motion learning, and continual refinement for adapting to the evolving scene.  Parallel training further accelerates the process. HiCoM demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency, storage efficiency, and real-time performance compared to existing methods, paving the way for more efficient dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time free-viewpoint video applications.

### In-depth insights


#### HiCoM Framework
The HiCoM framework presents a novel approach to online dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view video streams, addressing limitations in existing methods by focusing on efficiency and robustness.  It leverages **3D Gaussian Splatting** for its speed and efficiency, but enhances this base with three key innovations:  First, **a perturbation smoothing strategy** during initial 3DGS representation learning creates a compact and robust initial model, reducing overfitting and promoting stability. Second, a **hierarchical coherent motion mechanism** efficiently models scene motion across frames, capturing motion at varying granularities using region-based motion parameters.  This significantly reduces computational costs and maintains consistency across the scene. Finally, **a continual refinement process** ensures the model remains aligned with the evolving scene, dynamically adding and merging Gaussians, while simultaneously removing low-impact Gaussians to retain compactness. This framework allows for significantly faster training times and reduced data storage, thereby making it well-suited for real-time, streamable applications.

#### Perturbation Smoothing
The concept of 'Perturbation Smoothing' in the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scene reconstruction is a clever regularization technique.  By adding noise to the Gaussian's position during training, **it prevents overfitting to limited training views**, a common problem when dealing with dynamic scenes captured by a sparse set of cameras. This controlled perturbation acts as a smoothing agent, guiding the model towards a more robust and generalizable representation.  The **reduced risk of overfitting translates to a more compact and efficient initial 3D Gaussian Splatting representation**, requiring fewer Gaussians to capture the scene accurately. This, in turn, leads to faster convergence during subsequent frame learning, and significantly lower storage and transmission requirements, making the overall framework more efficient and effective for real-time applications. **The perturbation smoothing is not merely a technique to improve performance, but also crucial for creating a solid foundation** upon which the coherent motion mechanisms are applied, allowing the algorithm to smoothly and accurately capture the scene dynamics.

#### Motion Mechanism
The effectiveness of a motion mechanism in reconstructing dynamic scenes hinges on its ability to accurately capture and model temporal changes.  A robust mechanism should handle both **smooth, gradual movements** and **sudden, abrupt shifts**, adapting to varying scene complexities.  **Computational efficiency** is crucial, minimizing memory usage and processing time.  The ideal system would incorporate a representation that easily handles updates and merges new information seamlessly into the existing model, ensuring a compact and efficient representation of the evolving scene.  Furthermore, a successful mechanism should exhibit **generalizability**, performing well across diverse scene types and qualities.  The ability to accurately predict future frames, based on learned motion patterns, is also critical for real-time applications and efficient storage. Finally, the system should be resilient to noise and missing data, maintaining accuracy and stability even with incomplete or imperfect observations.

#### Continual Refinement
The 'Continual Refinement' process described in the paper is a crucial component of their online 3D scene reconstruction framework.  It addresses the limitations of simply relying on motion prediction alone by acknowledging that dynamic scenes evolve gradually, exceeding the capacity of motion estimation to capture all details. The strategy involves identifying regions with significant discrepancies between the learned motion and the actual scene changes, indicated by high gradients.  **New Gaussians are strategically added** to these areas, improving the accuracy of the 3D model. Importantly, these newly added Gaussians are not discarded at the end of each frame. Instead, they are **integrated into the initial 3DGS representation**, ensuring consistency across frames and maintaining a compact scene representation over time. This continual refinement, in conjunction with a strategy for removing low-impact Gaussians, maintains the balance between accuracy and efficiency, preventing excessive model growth that could slow down rendering and learning speed.  **The continual adjustment process** is therefore key for handling gradual changes and major updates in the scene, leading to more stable, robust, and temporally coherent 3D reconstruction results.

#### Parallel Training
The section on "Parallel Training" explores a significant efficiency enhancement.  Instead of processing frames sequentially, the authors propose training multiple frames concurrently.  This **parallel processing** leverages the inherent similarity between consecutive frames in dynamic scenes, treating a base frame as a reference to predict subsequent frames. This strategy **reduces training time** dramatically. However, the effectiveness is not unbounded; increasing the number of parallel frames beyond a certain point leads to performance degradation due to accumulating discrepancies between the reference and subsequent frames. **Optimal performance** seems to exist at an intermediate level of parallelism, suggesting a balance between efficiency gains and error accumulation.  The authors' careful analysis of this trade-off and its impact on overall quality highlights the nuanced nature of parallel training in this context.
