Existing methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are prone to overfitting and inefficient storage.  This leads to slow training and suboptimal rendering performance, hindering real-time applications.\nHiCoM addresses these issues by employing a three-component approach: a compact and robust initial 3DGS representation, a hierarchical coherent motion mechanism for efficient motion learning, and continual refinement for adapting to the evolving scene.  Parallel training further accelerates the process. HiCoM demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency, storage efficiency, and real-time performance compared to existing methods, paving the way for more efficient dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time free-viewpoint video applications.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "De4VWE4rbz/podcast.wav"}
