The diversity (D) represents how diverse the partners are in their behaviors. The specialization (S) shows how focused each partner is on a particular strategy. The overfitness (O) indicates how much the partners overfit to specific situations or partners during training. Finally, the harmonic mean of success (R(\u03c0G, Ptest)) shows the average success rate of generalist agents trained using each partner population, when tested on a set of unseen partners. This table highlights the relationships between these qualities and the robustness of the resulting generalist agents.", "section": "4 Understanding Effects of Specialization and Overfitness"}, {"figure_path": "15460JjocO/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Diversity (D), specialization (S), and overfitness (O) of partner populations.

Other populations do not contain incapable partners.", "description": "This table shows the number of capable partners (i.e., partners that successfully complete at least 50% of their self-play episodes) resulting from different training methods.  It highlights that SpecTRL sometimes produces fewer capable partners than the original XP-min method, but SpecTRL DAgger mitigates this issue. The results suggest that SpecTRL DAgger is more effective at preserving the number of capable partners than SpecTRL alone, especially when combined with the Mutual Information (MI) objective.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
