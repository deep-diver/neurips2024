### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is promising for data-efficient learning, especially when exploration is costly. However, a major limitation is the **objective mismatch** between model and policy learning, leading to poor performance. This paper identifies that **confounders** in offline data are the main cause of this mismatch. 

To solve this, the paper introduces BECAUSE, a novel algorithm that learns a **causal representation** of states and actions. This representation helps to reduce the impact of confounders, leading to improved model accuracy and policy performance.  BECAUSE is evaluated on various tasks and demonstrates significantly better generalizability and robustness than existing offline RL methods, especially in low-sample data regimes and in the presence of numerous confounders.

> The figure illustrates the objective mismatch problem in offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL).  In standard offline MBRL, a low model loss doesn't guarantee successful policy deployment because of a mismatch between the model training objective and the policy's success. The left panel shows this mismatch: low model loss is not correlated with policy success. The right panel illustrates how the proposed method, BECAUSE, addresses this mismatch by aligning model loss with policy success, improving generalizability.

### In-depth insights


#### Causal Offline RL
Causal Offline RL represents a significant advancement in reinforcement learning, aiming to address the limitations of traditional offline RL methods.  **Standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift**, where the data used for training differs from the deployment environment.  Causal methods attempt to overcome this by explicitly modeling the causal relationships within the environment. This allows for more robust generalization and improved performance, even with limited data.  **By disentangling confounding factors**, causal offline RL can identify true causal effects and reduce reliance on spurious correlations learned from biased data.  This leads to policies that generalize better to unseen situations, **enhancing the data efficiency and reliability of offline RL**.  However, the application of causal inference in offline RL presents significant computational challenges.  **Accurate causal discovery and representation learning are crucial yet difficult tasks**, especially when dealing with complex, high-dimensional environments and limited data.  Despite the challenges, the pursuit of causal offline RL holds immense promise for improving the safety and robustness of RL applications in various fields, such as robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems.

#### Bilinear MDPs
Bilinear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a powerful way to model complex systems by capturing the interaction between states and actions through bilinear forms.  This representation is particularly useful in scenarios with high-dimensional state and/or action spaces, where traditional methods might struggle. **The bilinear structure allows for a compact and efficient representation**, potentially reducing the computational burden of model learning and planning.  A key advantage is the ability to factorize the dynamics into separate representations of states and actions, which **simplifies modeling and enhances generalizability**.  By learning low-rank approximations of the bilinear components, one can extract meaningful features and structure from the environment. However, challenges remain in choosing the appropriate feature representations and in ensuring that the bilinear model accurately captures the system dynamics.  Further research into **robust and efficient learning algorithms** for bilinear MDPs is needed to fully unlock their potential.

#### BECAUSE Algorithm
The BECAUSE algorithm, designed for generalizable offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), tackles the challenge of objective mismatch.  It achieves this by focusing on **causal representation learning**, identifying and mitigating the influence of confounders present in offline datasets.  By approximating causal representations for both states and actions using bilinear MDPs, BECAUSE reduces spurious correlations and distribution shifts. **Causal discovery** methods help estimate an unconfounded world model, leading to more robust and generalizable policies.  Furthermore,  BECAUSE incorporates **uncertainty quantification**, utilizing energy-based models (EBMs) to provide a measure of uncertainty in state transitions, enabling conservative planning and avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) states. This combination of causal representation learning and uncertainty-aware planning enhances the overall generalizability and robustness of the offline MBRL approach, particularly beneficial in scenarios with limited data or high levels of confounding factors.  The theoretical analysis further supports its efficiency and provides error bounds.  **Empirical results demonstrate BECAUSE's superiority over various baselines** across a range of tasks and datasets, showing its promise in addressing the limitations of traditional offline RL methods.

#### Generalization Bounds
Generalization bounds in machine learning offer a crucial theoretical framework for understanding a model's ability to perform well on unseen data.  They provide a quantitative measure of the difference between a model's performance on the training set and its expected performance on new, unseen data, offering insights into **model complexity, data size, and the learning algorithm's properties**. Tighter bounds indicate a better ability to generalize.  **Factors such as the VC dimension or Rademacher complexity** directly relate to the capacity of a model to fit complex functions, and hence influence the generalization bound.  **Larger datasets and appropriate regularization techniques** help narrow the gap between training and test performance, thereby improving generalization and leading to tighter bounds.  The quest for tighter bounds often involves **balancing model complexity and data size**, highlighting a trade-off between model expressiveness and its capacity to generalize.  Studying generalization bounds is essential for designing robust and reliable machine learning systems.

#### Empirical Analysis
An empirical analysis section in a research paper would typically present the results of experiments designed to test the paper's hypotheses or claims.  A strong empirical analysis would go beyond simply reporting numbers; it would **carefully describe the experimental setup**, including data sources, participant characteristics (if applicable), and the methods used for data collection and analysis.  The analysis would also **focus on the key findings** relevant to the paper‚Äôs central research question, and provide sufficient detail for the reader to understand the results and evaluate their validity.  Important considerations include **statistical significance**, including effect sizes and confidence intervals, and comparisons with relevant baselines or prior work to demonstrate **the novelty and impact** of the findings. Visualizations (e.g., graphs, tables) should be well-integrated into the narrative and help to clarify the results. Finally, a discussion of any limitations, potential biases, or unexpected findings would enhance transparency and trustworthiness.

> This figure compares three different causal models for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with confounders. (a) shows a confounded MDP where confounders affect both the state transition and the relationship between states and actions. (b) shows an SC-MDP (State-Confounded MDP) where confounders only influence the state transition. (c) shows the proposed ASC-MDP (Action-State-Confounded MDP), which models confounders affecting both the state transition and the relationship between states and actions, as well as the correlation between actions and states.

> The figure illustrates the BECAUSE framework.  It shows how the algorithm learns a causal representation from offline data to improve the generalization and robustness of offline model-based reinforcement learning. The framework consists of three main components:  1. **Causal Representation Learning**: The offline data buffer is processed using feature mappings œÜ(.) and Œº(.) and the learned causal mask M to obtain a causal representation of states and actions that is less sensitive to confounding factors. 2. **World Model**:  The causal representation is used to learn a more robust and generalizable world model T(s'|s,a) that accurately predicts the next state s' given the current state s and action a. 3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: An energy-based model Eg(s, a) is used to quantify the uncertainty of the model's predictions.  This uncertainty is then incorporated into the planning process to make the policy more conservative and less likely to fail in unseen environments.  This uncertainty quantification helps mitigate the objective mismatch problem in offline RL.

> This figure shows three different reinforcement learning environments used in the paper's experiments.  The 'Lift' environment involves a robotic arm manipulating objects. The 'Unlock' environment is a grid world where an agent must navigate to collect a key and unlock a door. The 'Crash' environment simulates an autonomous driving scenario where the agent must avoid collisions with pedestrians and other vehicles.

Panel (b) shows how the success rate changes with varying ratios of offline samples used for training. Panel (c) illustrates the robustness of the algorithms by demonstrating the impact of different spurious correlation levels on the success rate.  The results are averaged over 10 trials, and detailed task-wise information can be found in Appendix Table 6.

> This figure compares the distribution of episodic model loss for successful and failed trajectories in the Unlock environment using two different methods: MOPO and BECAUSE.  The x-axis represents the model loss, and the y-axis shows the number of samples.  Separate distributions are shown for positive reward (success) and negative reward (failure) trajectories.  The key observation is that BECAUSE exhibits a greater separation between the loss distributions for successful and failed trajectories compared to MOPO. This indicates that BECAUSE is better at mitigating the objective mismatch problem, meaning that low model loss more reliably translates into successful outcomes. An example of a failure case is shown in the figure's inset, where the agent attempts to open a door without possessing the required key. The figure helps to illustrate the performance improvement of BECAUSE by showing that a lower model loss correlates more strongly with success than in the case of MOPO.

The bottom row shows the training process using negative samples generated by mixing latent factors from the offline data, a technique leveraging causal representation learned by the BECAUSE algorithm. The images in each row visualize the distribution of the EBM outputs at different timesteps during training. The visualization demonstrates that the causally-informed negative sampling technique leads to faster convergence.

> This figure shows the causal graphs learned by BECAUSE for each of the three environments used in the experiments: Lift, Unlock, and Crash. Each graph visually represents the causal relationships between the state and action variables in the respective environment. The nodes represent variables, and edges represent causal relationships.  The graphs are bipartite, with one set of nodes representing state variables at a given time step, and the other set representing state variables at the next time step, along with action variables. The sparsity of the graphs highlights the focus on significant causal relationships, ignoring less influential correlations.
