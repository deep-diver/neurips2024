Each condition is characterized by the presence or absence of explicit interaction with the AI's policy, whether policy changes occur across iterations, and whether a white-box (interpretable IDCT) or a black-box (NN) policy is used.  This helps to clarify the experimental setup and the different variations of human-AI interaction being investigated.", "section": "5 Human-Subjects Study"}]
