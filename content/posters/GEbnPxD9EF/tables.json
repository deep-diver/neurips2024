The first setting uses a binary instrumental variable, while the second uses continuous variables. The table reports the average bounds and standard deviations obtained by each algorithm across multiple runs, along with the optimal bounds and the true values of the treatment effects.  The results demonstrate that both algorithms generally provide bounds that cover the true values, with NCM achieving tighter bounds, particularly in the continuous setting.", "section": "4.1 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "GEbnPxD9EF/tables/tables_33_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Experiment results of 2 IV settings.
