Higher-order cumulants (HOCs) offer a way to quantify these relationships, but learning from them efficiently has been a challenge.  Existing methods, like random features, fall short in this regime, motivating the need for more efficient algorithms. \nThis paper investigates the efficiency of neural networks in extracting information from HOCs. Using the spiked cumulant model, it analyzes the statistical and computational limitations of recovering a privileged direction (the \"spike\") from HOCs.  It introduces a theoretical analysis based on the low-degree method, showing that neural networks achieve statistical distinguishability with linear sample complexity, while polynomial-time algorithms require quadratic complexity.  Numerical experiments confirm that neural networks efficiently learn from HOCs, outperforming random features significantly.  The results highlight the superior learning capabilities of neural networks over simpler methods when dealing with higher-order statistical patterns.", "affiliation": "International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA)", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "uHml6eyoVF/podcast.wav"}
