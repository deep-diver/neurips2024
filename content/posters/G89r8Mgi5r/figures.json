Panel (a) shows the FedAvg approach, where inconsistent local model updates from clients (due to heterogeneous data distributions) lead to a poorly performing global model.  Panel (b) demonstrates the CRFed approach, which utilizes a data harmonization mechanism and a confusion-resistant strategy. This harmonizes local data distributions and leads to more consistent model updates across clients. The resulting global model in CRFed shows improved performance.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "G89r8Mgi5r/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: CRFed Framework. The process begins with the current global model, which is downloaded by clients. The model encoder processes the global model, and the meta-model is obtained. This meta-model is then projected into a higher-dimensional space and concatenated with the indicator function, forming the combined representation zi. The diffusion-based data harmonization mechanism adds noise to this representation and iteratively denoises it to achieve the desired distribution. The distribution decoder then aligns the denoised data distribution. Client i's data is sampled based on importance sampling weights wi, calculated as the ratio of the optimal sampling probability P* to the original data distribution Po. This ensures that the sampled data aligns with the desired distribution, following a curriculum learning approach that progresses from easy to difficult samples, thus enhancing overall model performance.", "description": "The figure illustrates the CRFed framework, outlining the workflow of model encoding, meta-model generation, data harmonization via diffusion, and client data sampling based on importance weights.

The process involves a forward diffusion process where Gaussian noise is added to the initial data distribution, transforming it into a latent representation.

It's a two-stage process:\n\n1. **Forward Diffusion:** Gaussian noise is iteratively added to the initial data distribution (P\u2080) over a series of timesteps (t = 1...T). This transforms the data into a latent representation.\n2. **Reverse Denoising:** A noise predictor network learns to iteratively remove the added noise, starting from the final noisy representation (at t=T) and working backward to t=1. The goal is to refine the data distribution to a desired target distribution (P*). The process uses the model encoder and meta-model (from Figure 2), along with indicator function, to guide this denoising process.", "section": "3.3 Diffusion-based Data Harmonization"}, {"figure_path": "G89r8Mgi5r/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Test accuracy across federated training rounds for top 5 models on FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.", "description": "This figure shows the test accuracy of the top 5 performing models (CRFed, FedDPMS, G-FML, FRAug, FedCD) across federated training rounds for three different datasets: FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
