Existing solutions either flatten 2D data into 1D sequences, losing spatial information, or use fixed window partitions, limiting long-range modeling.  This paper addresses these challenges.\nThe proposed QuadMamba model uses a learnable quadtree-based scan to partition images into quadrants of varying granularities.  It then adaptively models local dependencies, capturing local detail in informative regions while maintaining efficiency.  This end-to-end trainable system, using Gumbel-Softmax, significantly improves performance in image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art vision models, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "TtcwVuBZu1/podcast.wav"}
