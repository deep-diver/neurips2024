### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current vision models struggle with adapting state-space models (SSMs) from language to vision due to spatial locality and varying granularity of visual data.  Existing solutions either flatten 2D data into 1D sequences, losing spatial information, or use fixed window partitions, limiting long-range modeling.  This paper addresses these challenges.

The proposed QuadMamba model uses a learnable quadtree-based scan to partition images into quadrants of varying granularities.  It then adaptively models local dependencies, capturing local detail in informative regions while maintaining efficiency.  This end-to-end trainable system, using Gumbel-Softmax, significantly improves performance in image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art vision models, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

### In-depth insights


#### Quadtree Scanning
Quadtree scanning offers a **novel approach** to processing 2D image data for state space models (SSMs).  Unlike traditional raster scans that destroy spatial locality, or fixed-window methods that lack adaptability, quadtree scanning **dynamically partitions** the image into variable-sized quadrants. This approach is particularly beneficial for vision tasks due to the **inherent spatial dependencies** in visual data and the varying granularity of information across different image regions. By learning to prioritize informative regions, quadtree scanning enhances the model's ability to capture both **local and global dependencies**, leading to improved performance in vision tasks.  The **recursive nature** of the quadtree allows for multi-scale feature extraction, while the **learnable aspect** enables end-to-end training, avoiding the limitations of hand-crafted partitioning schemes.  **Adaptability** is a key advantage, as the scanning process can focus on areas of high information density while ignoring less relevant regions, improving efficiency and effectiveness.

#### Mamba Vision
Mamba Vision, a hypothetical term based on the 'Mamba' State Space Model, likely refers to a novel approach in computer vision that leverages the efficiency and scalability of SSMs.  **The core idea would likely involve representing visual data as a sequence of states**, moving away from traditional methods like raster scans that ignore spatial dependencies. Instead, a Mamba Vision system would focus on capturing the essential information of an image using a dynamic, learned scan pathway.  This pathway might selectively attend to relevant image regions, dynamically adjusting the resolution based on the content and the need for information. Consequently, Mamba Vision promises to improve upon existing vision models by addressing inherent issues of computational complexity and inefficient data representation, especially in high-resolution images.  **The model's adaptability and potential for parallel processing** could lead to advancements in various vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and image classification, ultimately making it a powerful and efficient alternative to traditional vision transformers and CNNs.  **Learned scan pathways** offer a new paradigm for vision tasks, which could prove to be beneficial for processing images of varying granularities and local dependencies.

#### Locality Modeling
Effective locality modeling in visual state space models is crucial for capturing spatial relationships within images.  Approaches like naive flattening, which converts 2D image data into a 1D sequence, fail to preserve critical spatial dependencies, hindering performance.  In contrast, **QuadMamba employs a quadtree-based strategy for adaptive window partitioning**, which allows for the dynamic capture of fine-grained local relationships, particularly within regions of high visual importance. This adaptable approach, coupled with an omnidirectional window shift mechanism, excels at handling various object scales and diverse image content by addressing issues of varying information granularity, significantly improving model performance in visual tasks. The utilization of Gumbel-Softmax ensures the end-to-end trainability of this partition process, enhancing the learning efficiency and model robustness.  **The QuadMamba's locality-aware modeling is a key innovation**, demonstrating how strategic attention to spatial relationships enhances the performance of state-space models in computer vision.

#### End-to-End Training
End-to-end training, a cornerstone of modern deep learning, presents both advantages and challenges.  **Its primary benefit lies in the seamless integration of multiple stages of a process**, eliminating the need for intermediate manual data manipulation or handcrafted feature engineering. This leads to **improved performance by optimizing the entire pipeline jointly**. However, the complexity increases significantly. **Debugging becomes more difficult**, as errors can arise from any component in the integrated system. Additionally, **data requirements are more demanding** as the model needs sufficient data to learn all aspects simultaneously. **Careful architectural design and optimization strategies** such as regularization and appropriate loss functions are crucial for successful end-to-end training. Despite these challenges, the advantages frequently outweigh the difficulties, leading to powerful models that achieve superior results compared to methods involving modular training.

#### Future Vision
A future vision for this research would involve exploring **more sophisticated and adaptive scanning methods** that go beyond the quadtree approach.  This might involve incorporating machine learning techniques to dynamically determine the optimal scanning path based on the image content and task requirements. Additionally, research could focus on **extending the model's capabilities to handle more complex visual data** such as videos and 3D point clouds.  **Improving the model's efficiency and scalability** to handle very high-resolution images and extremely large datasets is another important area for future work. Finally, investigating the **model's robustness to various noise and artifacts** present in real-world images would enhance its applicability in practical scenarios.  The ultimate goal is to create a highly flexible and adaptable visual state space model capable of handling a vast range of visual data types and complex visual reasoning tasks.

It shows how image tokens are divided into quadrants, initially at a coarse level (larger quadrants) and then recursively at a finer level (smaller quadrants) based on a learned prediction of their importance.  A differentiable mask is created to select tokens from these quadrants, and these selected tokens are then flattened into a 1D sequence to be processed by the state space model. This approach allows for capturing both local (within quadrants) and global (across quadrants) dependencies efficiently and in a differentiable manner.
