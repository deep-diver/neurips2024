### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Matrix completion, recovering a low-rank matrix from a small number of its entries, is a significant problem in machine learning and data analysis.  Existing fast algorithms often rely on assumptions about data distribution, and these assumptions do not always hold true for real-world data, a problem known as generative overfitting.   Semi-random models, which allow some degree of adversarial entry selection, provide a more realistic setting, but efficient high-accuracy algorithms for semi-random matrix completion remained elusive. 

This paper introduces a novel, efficient algorithm to solve the semi-random matrix completion problem. The method uses an iterative approach with adaptive reweighting to progressively recover the matrix, using techniques from optimization and graph theory.  Crucially, **the algorithm provides guarantees on accuracy even in noisy settings and achieves nearly-linear time complexity**, substantially improving upon existing solutions.  The new algorithm avoids the polynomial dependence on inverse accuracy and condition number found in previous work, opening up possibilities for high-precision matrix recovery in practical applications.

> Algorithm 7 is a post-processing step in the matrix completion algorithm.  It takes as input a rank-r matrix M that is approximately close to a rank-r* matrix M*, but only on a submatrix. The algorithm aims to recover the full matrix M* by identifying and correcting columns with large errors.  It uses the Sparsify subroutine to find columns with few large errors, and then a Fix subroutine, applying regression, to improve the approximation of M to M*.  The output is a new matrix that is entrywise close to M*.
