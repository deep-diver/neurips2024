The methods are compared using two metrics: \"Identity\", which represents how well the generated image retains the identity of the target concept, and \"Text\", which measures how well the generated image aligns with the text prompt. Higher values indicate better performance. The table shows that while some methods excel in one area, AttnDreamBooth achieves a balance between both metrics.", "section": "5.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "4bINoegDcm/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: User study.

Participants were shown a concept image and a text prompt, along with two generated images: one from AttnDreamBooth and one from a baseline method. They were asked to choose the image that better preserved the identity of the concept and matched the prompt. The table shows the percentage of participants who preferred each method for each baseline method.

Each row shows the performance of a variant of the model where one of the components (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, or the regularization term) has been removed.  The results are measured in terms of Identity Preservation and Text Alignment, both represented as an upward-pointing arrow (\u2191) to denote higher is better. The \"Full Model\" row provides the performance of the complete model. The study demonstrates the importance of each component to the overall performance of the model.
