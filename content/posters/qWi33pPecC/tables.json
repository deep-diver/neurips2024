It shows the accuracy achieved with different combinations of hyperparameters: the width (number of neurons) in the hidden layer, the learning rate (lr), the momentum (\u03b2), and the number of training epochs.  The table helps determine the optimal hyperparameter settings for the model.", "section": "C.3 Details of the MLP training"}]
