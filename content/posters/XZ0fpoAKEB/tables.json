For each setting (recommender systems, symbolic reasoning), it specifies the possible world (the true underlying relationships or preferences), the sample distribution (how data is actually collected, often biased), and the target distribution (the ideal, unbiased distribution we'd like to infer from).  This highlights the discrepancy between how data is collected and what we ideally want to learn from it in social systems, setting the stage for the paper's core argument about the limitations of passive data collection.", "section": "2 Passive data collection and inference tasks in social systems"}, {"figure_path": "XZ0fpoAKEB/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Inference settings based on passive data collection in complex social systems.", "description": "This table presents different inference settings in complex social systems using passively collected data.
