While Mixture of Experts (MoEs) offer scalability, they have larger parameter footprints. This paper introduces Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which addresses these limitations. \n\nMoNE uses a nested architecture where individual experts exhibit an increasing compute-accuracy trade-off.  It dynamically chooses tokens in a priority order, routing redundant tokens through cheaper experts.  Experiments on ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2 demonstrate that MoNE achieves equivalent performance to baseline models while reducing inference time and FLOPs significantly.  **The adaptive nature of MoNE makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios with varying computational budgets.**", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "HbV5vRJMOY/podcast.wav"}
