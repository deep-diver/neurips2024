MetaAd uses a discounting function \u03c6 applied to the remaining budget and bid value of each offline node to determine a score. In contrast, LOBM incorporates machine learning (ML) predictions to adjust the scores. The ML model predicts a discounting factor zu,t for each node, which is then projected onto a competitive solution space to ensure the algorithm maintains a competitive ratio. The final score for each node in LOBM is calculated as Wu,t(1 - zu,t), balancing the benefit of large bids with budget conservation. The figure shows that both algorithms select the node with the highest score.", "section": "D.1 Online Movie Matching"}, {"figure_path": "Vtxy8wFpTj/figures/figures_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Competitive ratio without FLM.
