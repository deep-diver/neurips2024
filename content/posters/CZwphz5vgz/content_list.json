Although our proposed methods are specifically designed to eliminate potential variances when using generative priors, we can still observe some generations are less coherent (e.g. Figure 4 and Figure 8), which may hurt the training of the rendering model on all stages. Moreover, we found that conditioning generative models with 2D poses is weak \u2014 the pose of the generated human does not always align with the condition pose, which may introduce even more uncertainty for training. In future work, we hope to train our own consistency-aware diffusion model specifically finetuned on human data. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Societal Impacts. Being able to reconstruct a human from an occluded monocular video can have a great societal impact.

We hope our work inspires further exploration into the capabilities of diffusion priors to aid in human reconstruction.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
