### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning models often struggle with instability during training due to improper learning rate selection.  A common practice to mitigate this is "learning rate warmup", where the learning rate gradually increases from a small initial value to a target value. However, the reasons behind the success of warmup are not well understood.  There are multiple hypotheses, but none provides a comprehensive explanation.

This paper uses systematic experiments to demonstrate that the primary benefit of warmup is its ability to allow the use of larger target learning rates.  By carefully analyzing the sharpness of the loss landscape (or its preconditioned version for Adam), the authors identify different operational regimes during warmup. They also propose a modified Adam initialization, termed GI-Adam, that eliminates the need for warmup in some cases, and consistently improves performance.

> üîº This figure shows the training loss and sharpness trajectories for two different parameterizations (ŒºP and SP) of Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) trained on a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset using gradient descent (GD) with a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.  The sharpness is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function. The dashed lines in the sharpness plots indicate the instability threshold (Œ∑ > Œ∑c), where Œ∑ is the learning rate.  When the sharpness exceeds this threshold, training becomes unstable. The top row shows the results for the ŒºP parameterization, while the bottom row shows the results for the SP parameterization.  Each parameterization uses a different target learning rate (Œ∑trgt). The figure illustrates how the learning rate warmup impacts the sharpness and loss curves during training, with the goal of preventing the network from entering unstable regions of the loss landscape.

### In-depth insights


#### LR Warmup Benefits
Learning rate warmup, a technique where the learning rate is gradually increased from a small initial value to a target value, offers several benefits in deep learning. Primarily, it enhances the robustness of training by allowing the network to tolerate larger target learning rates.  **This is crucial because larger learning rates can lead to faster convergence, potentially improving overall performance.**  However, excessively high learning rates can cause instability and divergence. Warmup acts as a buffer, easing the transition into this more aggressive training regime.  **It prevents large, destabilizing weight updates in the early stages of training, when the model is still highly sensitive to parameter changes.**  Further, warmup can help to reduce sharpness in the loss landscape, facilitating the model's movement towards flatter regions conducive to effective optimization. This in turn enhances hyperparameter tuning robustness, as the network becomes less sensitive to the precise setting of the learning rate.  **Different initialization schemes and network architectures interact with warmup mechanisms in diverse ways, highlighting the importance of a deeper understanding to tailor the technique effectively for optimal outcomes.**  While increasing warmup duration can improve robustness, the main benefit typically stems from using a suitable target learning rate.

#### Sharpness Dynamics
The concept of sharpness dynamics in the context of deep learning optimization is crucial.  **Sharpness**, often represented as the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function, quantifies the curvature of the loss landscape around a model's parameter values.  **High sharpness** indicates a highly curved landscape, making optimization challenging because small changes in parameters lead to significant changes in the loss. Conversely, **low sharpness** indicates a flatter landscape, making optimization easier and more robust to larger learning rates. The paper explores how sharpness changes during training, specifically focusing on how different optimization techniques and hyperparameter settings impact this evolution.  **Warm-up strategies**, for instance, aim to gradually reduce initial sharpness, allowing the network to learn effectively at higher learning rates later.  The analysis of sharpness dynamics reveals different training regimes (progressive sharpening vs. sharpness reduction), which influences the effectiveness of strategies like warm-up. Understanding these dynamics provides critical insights for tuning hyperparameters and improving the robustness and efficiency of training deep learning models.

#### Adam Improvements
The research explores Adam optimizer improvements focusing on addressing training instabilities, particularly concerning the large pre-conditioned sharpness observed at initialization.  **A novel initialization strategy, GI-Adam, is proposed, which pre-initializes the second moment using gradients (v_0 = g_0).** This simple modification significantly reduces the initial pre-conditioned sharpness, mitigating early instabilities that often lead to training failures.  The study highlights that warmup's primary benefit is to allow for larger target learning rates by gradually decreasing sharpness, thus enhancing the robustness of hyperparameter tuning and improving final performance.  **GI-Adam achieves similar benefits to warmup, sometimes eliminating the need for warmup entirely by pushing the training failure boundary to higher target learning rates.** Furthermore, the analysis suggests that a more principled choice for the initial learning rate (Œ∑_init) can significantly reduce warmup time, sometimes making warmup unnecessary. The research provides compelling experimental evidence across various architectures, datasets, and optimizers, offering valuable insights and practical improvements to the Adam optimizer.

#### Warmup Regimes
Analyzing "Warmup Regimes" in deep learning reveals **distinct phases** during the learning rate warmup period.  These phases are not solely determined by the warmup schedule but are significantly influenced by the network's initialization, architecture, and the loss landscape.  **Progressive sharpening**, where sharpness increases over time, and **sharpness reduction**, where it decreases, represent two key regimes. The initial phase is crucial and dictates the subsequent behavior; whether a model begins in progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction will heavily influence how the learning rate increase affects the model's stability and overall performance.  **Identifying this initial regime** is key to optimizing the warmup process, allowing for tailored strategies to either leverage or mitigate its effects.  Understanding these distinct regimes enables a more nuanced approach to warmup strategies, leading to improvements in training robustness and hyperparameter tuning.

#### Future Work
The paper's lack of a dedicated 'Future Work' section presents an opportunity for insightful expansion.  **Investigating the self-stabilization mechanism in more complex optimizers beyond Adam is crucial**. The current analysis primarily focuses on SGD and Adam; extending this to other adaptive methods or even different optimization families would significantly broaden the understanding of learning rate warmup's impact.  **A deeper investigation into the interplay between the natural sharpness evolution and warmup's impact, particularly for different model architectures and initializations, is warranted.** This could lead to more sophisticated and tailored warmup strategies.  Finally, the paper hints at a parameter-free warmup method using persistent catapults; fully developing and evaluating this approach could lead to more robust and efficient training across various tasks and settings. **Further exploration into the use cases where warmup is not needed and identifying conditions for this would be beneficial**.

> üîº This figure shows the training loss and sharpness trajectories for two different parameterizations (ŒºP and SP) of a fully connected network (FCN) trained on a small subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset using gradient descent (GD) with a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.  The sharpness is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss.  The plots illustrate how the learning rate warmup affects the sharpness and the loss. The dashed lines represent the instability threshold, and when the sharpness exceeds this threshold, the training becomes unstable.  The different initializations (ŒºP and SP) affect the relationship between the learning rate and sharpness.  The figure shows similar results across different architectures, mini-batch sizes, and loss functions, as detailed in Appendix E.

The top row shows the results for a network initialized using the maximal update parameterization (¬µP), while the bottom row shows the results for a network initialized using the standard parameterization (SP).  The sharpness plots illustrate the relationship between the learning rate and the stability of the training process, indicating when the training process becomes unstable and exceeds an instability threshold. The figure shows that the two types of initialization lead to qualitatively different training behaviors and that the stability threshold varies depending on the initialization and learning rate.
