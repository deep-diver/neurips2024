In this paper, we explore AUC optimization methods in the context of pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, a much more complicated scenario. This task introduces two major challenges for AUC optimization techniques. On one hand, AUC optimization in a pixel-level task involves complex coupling across loss terms, with structured inner-image and pairwise inter-image dependencies, complicating theoretical analysis. On the other hand, we find that mini-batch estimation of AUC loss in this case requires a larger batch size, resulting in an unaffordable space complexity. To address these issues, we develop a pixel-level AUC loss function and conduct a dependency-graph-based theoretical analysis of the algorithm\u2019s generalization ability.

Over the past decades, substantial efforts [58, 23, 43, 96] have advanced the field of semantic segmentation. The mainstream paradigm is to develop innovative network architectures that encode more discriminative features for dense pixel-level classifications. Typical backbones include CNN-based [58, 14, 80] and newly emerging Transformer-based methods [108, 83, 65, 15, 32], which have achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Beyond this direction, researchers [24, 66, 48, 41] have recently realized the Pixel-level Long-tail issue in Semantic Segmentation (PLSS), as shown at the top of Figure 1. Similar to the flaws of traditional long-tail problems, the major classes will dominate the model learning process, causing the model to overlook the segmentation of minority classes in an image. Several remedies have been proposed to alleviate this [49, 61, 10, 56, 104, 92, 78]. For example, [77] introduces a category-wise variation technique inversely proportional to distribution to achieve balanced segmentation; [66] introduces a sequence-based generative adversarial network for imbalanced medical image segmentation, and [41] develops a re-weighting scheme for semi-supervised segmentation.

Applying AUC to instance-level long-tail classifications has shown promising progress in the machine learning community [86, 100, 88, 68]. Motivated by its success, this paper starts an early trial to study AUC optimization for PLSS. The primary concern is to study its effectiveness for PLSS from a theoretical perspective. The key challenge is that the standard techniques for generalization analysis [62, 8, 21] require the loss function to be expressed as a sum of independent terms. Unfortunately, the proposed loss function does not satisfy this assumption due to the dual effect of structured inner-image dependency and pairwise inter-image dependency.

In light of this, the primary choice is to adopt the so-called stratified sampling on all images [70, 60, 86] for mini-batch generation (See Equation (7)). Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 3(a) and (b), this is hard to implement under PLSS because pixel-level labels are densely coupled in each image.

As the segmentation tasks become more challenging, some specialized networks have emerged, such as HRNet [75], ICNet [105], and multimodal networks [76, 42]. For the decoder, a series of studies focus on strengthening edge features [23, 107], capturing global context [43, 31, 45], and enhancing the receptive field [96, 67, 12, 13].

The goal of the previous Memory Bank is to facilitate the traditional classifications by storing instance-level or image-level features, while our T-Memory Bank specifically stores the original pixels for each object. This strategy is particularly beneficial for our PLSS task. Additionally, the T-Memory Bank enables AUCSeg without substantially increasing GPU workload as well as the number of samples per mini-batch by selectively replacing non-essential pixels.

For instance, the performance gap for PointRend and OCRNet on the Cityscapes reaches up to $40\\%$ . Second, models using long-tail approaches generally achieve better results than those that do not. However, they still fail to produce satisfactory outcomes. One possible reason is that these long-tail approaches focus on reweighting, giving too much attention to the tail classes and leading to overfitting. Additionally, our proposed AUCSeg method surpasses all competitors in most metrics. This success is due to the appealing properties of AUC. Our method consistently outperforms the runner-up by $+1.21\\%$ , $+0.75\\%$ , and $+0.38\\%$ in tail classes mIoU across the datasets. Overall mIoU also improves by $+1.05\\%$ , $+0.27\\%$ , and $+0.31\\%$ . In some Head/Middle metrics, AUCSeg does not achieve the best performance.

For instance, on the Cityscapes dataset, AUCSeg exhibits a marginal decrease of $0.\\dot{1}7\\%$ in head classes but gains $0.75\\%$ in tail classes compared to the runner-up, SegNeXt. Furthermore, we note that performance decreases in head classes mainly arise from misclassification at the blurry edges of objects. In contrast, gains in tail classes often stem from either the successful detection of smaller objects or the more complete detection of such objects. To summarize, on the Cityscapes datasets, detecting a new tail object like \u2018Traffic Lights\u2019 is far more significant than precisely detecting the edge pixels of a head class like \u2018sky\u2019.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
