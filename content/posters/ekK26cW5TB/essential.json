Existing solutions often neglect the theoretical impact of loss functions, or ignore the high computational demands of pixel-level AUC optimization.  This paper directly addresses these issues. \n\nThe proposed AUCSeg framework tackles this problem using a novel AUC-oriented loss function, theoretically analyzed for generalization.  To address memory limitations, AUCSeg incorporates a Tail-Classes Memory Bank, storing information from less frequent classes. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate AUCSeg's effectiveness, particularly in improving performance on minority classes, significantly outperforming previous approaches.", "affiliation": "Key Lab. of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, CAS", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "ekK26cW5TB/podcast.wav"}
