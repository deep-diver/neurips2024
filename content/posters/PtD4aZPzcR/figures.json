The left panel displays the overall behavior, while the right panel zooms in on the region of small sample sizes.  It compares an algorithm for half-uniform distributions proposed by the authors, an existing algorithm for general distributions, the authors' analytical lower bound, and a numerical evaluation of a tighter lower bound. The figure demonstrates that the query time exponent approaches 1 as the number of samples approaches n,  and that the improvement over linear time in k (number of distributions) is limited.", "section": "Statistical-Computational Trade-offs"}, {"figure_path": "PtD4aZPzcR/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Left: Trade-off between 1/s (samples as a fraction of n) and the query time exponent pq for our algorithm for half-uniform distributions (solid green curve), the algorithm by [1] for general distributions (dashed green curve), our analytic lower bound (solid red curve), and a numerical evaluation of the bound from Theorem 3.2 (dashed black curve).
