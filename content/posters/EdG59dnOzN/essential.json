However, existing methods like AdaGrad suffer from performance degradation when dealing with poorly scaled data.  This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel algorithm. \nThe paper introduces KATE, a scale-invariant version of AdaGrad. Unlike AdaGrad, KATE doesn't use a square root in its step-size calculation, improving robustness to data scaling.  The authors theoretically prove KATE's scale-invariance for generalized linear models and establish its convergence rate, matching state-of-the-art algorithms.  Extensive experiments across various machine learning tasks demonstrate that KATE outperforms AdaGrad and is comparable or superior to Adam.", "affiliation": "MBZUAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "EdG59dnOzN/podcast.wav"}
