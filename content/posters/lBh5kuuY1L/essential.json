Scaffold hopping is a promising strategy to narrow this space, but existing 3D-SBDD generative models are too slow for practical use. \nThis research introduces TurboHopp, an accelerated 3D scaffold hopping model that uses consistency models to achieve up to 30x faster inference speed than existing methods, without sacrificing quality. It also uses reinforcement learning to further optimize the model output.  **TurboHopp addresses the speed bottleneck of 3D-SBDD models**, significantly improving efficiency in drug discovery and enabling new optimization strategies.", "affiliation": "AIGEN Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "lBh5kuuY1L/podcast.wav"}
