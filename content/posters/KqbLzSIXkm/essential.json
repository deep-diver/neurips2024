Existing methods like Mamba, while efficient, often have limitations in designing optimal scanning strategies for 2D image data, especially when aiming for high-quality image generation. Additionally, most approaches primarily focus on spatial information, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating frequency domain information which is rich with long-range relationships.  These limitations hinder their ability to produce high-quality and diverse images efficiently. \nDiMSUM directly tackles these issues by integrating wavelet transformations to process the image data in both spatial and frequency domains. It cleverly fuses this spatial-frequency information through a cross-attention mechanism, thus improving the model's ability to capture both local details and global context. Through extensive experimentation, the researchers demonstrate that DiMSUM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of image generation quality and training speed, opening exciting new avenues for research in efficient and high-quality image generation.", "affiliation": "VinAI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "KqbLzSIXkm/podcast.wav"}
