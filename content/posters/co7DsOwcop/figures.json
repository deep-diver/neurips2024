(b) the detailed structure of the Dynamic GCN module.", "description": "Figure 1(a) shows the overall architecture of the proposed forecasting model, Sumba, which consists of multiple blocks. Each block comprises a Multi-Scale TCN module and a Dynamic GCN module. The Multi-Scale TCN module processes the input data to capture temporal dependencies, while the Dynamic GCN module focuses on generating dynamic spatial structures and fusing spatial information across different series. The final output of the model is the prediction. Figure 1(b) details the inner workings of the Dynamic GCN module.  It takes the output from the previous layer and generates the dynamic spatial structure using a structured matrix basis and a matching mechanism. Then, this dynamic graph structure is employed for graph convolutional operations to integrate spatial information before generating the output for the current block.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "co7DsOwcop/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The change of a over one week.", "description": "This figure visualizes the change in the weight of the matrix basis coefficient 'a' over a week for both the Solar-Energy and Electricity datasets.  The heatmaps show that most weights are concentrated on two basis matrices (matrix 1 and matrix 4), suggesting the existence of two dominant spatial structures. These structures alternate regularly, corresponding to day and night for Solar-Energy data (as expected), and showing a midnight-specific correlation in the Electricity dataset.", "section": "4.4 Interpretable Dynamics"}, {"figure_path": "co7DsOwcop/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The change of a over one week.", "description": "This figure visualizes the changes in the coefficient 'a' over a week for the Electricity and Solar-Energy datasets.
