Existing models often struggle to capture dynamic spatial correlations accurately, resulting in high variance and limited interpretability.  They typically rely on a two-stage process: learning dynamic representations, then generating spatial structures; this is sensitive to small time windows and produces high variance.\nThis paper introduces Sumba, a novel forecasting model addressing these challenges.  **Sumba directly parameterizes spatial structures using a learnable matrix basis and a convex combination**, enabling effective learning of dynamic spatial structures.  **Structured parameterization and regularization enhance efficiency and reduce complexity.**  The model's well-constrained output space results in lower variance, improved expressiveness, and interpretable dynamics through its coefficient 'a'.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "co7DsOwcop/podcast.wav"}
