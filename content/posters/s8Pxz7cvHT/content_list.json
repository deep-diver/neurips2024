AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of regular diffusion models requiring neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example.

The research of adversarial attacks also plays an important role in proactively exposing potential threats, as well as promoting model robustness and corresponding defense methods [4\u201311]. Many attacks [12\u201315] focus on maximizing the attack success rate and transferability under relatively lenient restrictions (i.e., $l_{\\infty}$ or $l_{2}$ norm) of adversarial perturbation, but they could have poor stealthiness and imperceptibility since the crafted adversarial examples can be easily detected by the Human Visual System (HVS) [16].

", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Current imperceptible adversarial attacks could be summarized into two categories: 1) perturbationbased attacks devised on perceptual characteristics, and 2) unrestricted attacks. The first one is motivated by the fact that adding adversarial perturbations to different components of an image has varying perceptual quality levels to the HVS. By studying components such as image color [19], texture complexity [21], frequency spectrum [23, 24], etc., these methods design corresponding perceptual-based loss functions and incorporate them to the optimization process to craft adversarial examples where the adversarial perturbation is constrained and hidden within specific image regions. Instead of injecting noise-like adversarial perturbations, unrestricted attacks heavily but reasonably modify attributes of images like semantic content to perform attacks. Apart from early work that adopts GANs [25], some recent methods combine the prevalent diffusion models [26\u201328] into the adversarial optimization process in an image edition-like way of repeatedly adding noise and denoising to eliminate the noise pattern within the final adversarial examples [29, 30] or optimize the embedding of latent diffusion models [31, 32]. However, due to the uncertainty of generative models and the unrestricted setting itself, some unrestricted adversarial examples inevitably exhibit obvious unnatural texture or semantic changes and lose the imperceptibility, especially for images with complex content. Although previous methods have equipped attacks with imperceptibility utilizing various designs mentioned above, it remains an essential challenge of achieving imperceptible adversarial attacks: How to attack with inherently minimal perturbation strength from a modeling perspective?

Specifically, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy with intrinsically lower perturbation strength by innovatively modeling the attack process as a decomposed diffusion trajectory from an initialized noise to an adversarial example. At each step, a much subtler (for imperceptibility) yet more effective (for attack performance) adversarial guidance is calculated and injected with two cooperating, theoretically grounded non-parametric modules called Attacked Model Guidance (AMG) and Pixel-level Constraint (PC), which gradually leads the end of this trajectory from the original image distribution to a desired adversarially conditioned distribution based on the theory of diffusion models (e.g., deterministic diffusion[27], conditional sampling [33, 34], etc.).

In contrast to another line of attacks aimed at improving the attack success rate and the transferability for black-box models with a more lenient limitation of perturbation strength [13\u201315], imperceptible adversarial attacks are dedicate to accomplish attacks using as minimal perturbation as possible while deceiving human perception. Among them, PerC-AL [19] improves the imperceptibility by alternating between the classification loss and perceptual color difference when updating perturbations. AdvDrop [21] uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to discard details in images that are imperceptible for humans. SSAH [24] limits perturbation to high-frequency components using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to make it undetectable. Similarly, AdvINN [22] also utilizes the DWT and exploits invertible neural networks to specially perform targeted attacks. In addition, with an unrestriced setting [25], some recent works have incorporated the capabilities of generative models (e.g., diffusion models [26]) into common attack frameworks to make adversarial examples more natural and enhance the imperceptibility. DiffAttack [31] and ACA [32] combine the optimization of adversarial losses with the Stable Diffusion [28] to generate unrestricted adversarial examples, while Diff-PGD [30] and AdvDiffuser [29] incorporate the classic PGD method [12] into the diffusion steps to make the adversarial examples undergo denoising processing.

Following the setting of restricted attack, the modeling of AdvAD is theoretically derived from conditional sampling of diffusion models, supporting its attack performance and imperceptibility, and does not require any loss functions, optimizers, or additional neural networks.

It can be observed that adding CA in each step of AdvAD slightly improves impercepbility while maintaining the attack success rate of $100\\%$ . However, the DGI strategy significantly reduces the iterations of performing AMG and PC from 1000 to 3.97, which indicates that our framework theoretically only requires very little injected adversarial guidance to successfully perform attacks, proving the performance of our modeling method as well as the effectiveness of the adversarial guidance. In AdvAD-X, which finally uses both CA and DGI, the guidance strength in each step is further suppressed, resulting in a slight increase in the total number of iterations required adaptively, but the final perturbation strength continues to decrease to a more extreme level.
