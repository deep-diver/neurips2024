However, these methods often struggle with unseen data and real-time performance.  The paper identifies these limitations, emphasizing the need for a more robust and efficient approach. \nTo overcome these challenges, the paper proposes DeTrack, a novel in-model latent denoising learning paradigm.  DeTrack uses a denoising Vision Transformer (ViT) to decompose the denoising process into multiple denoising blocks, enabling real-time tracking.  By incorporating trajectory and visual memory, DeTrack improves tracking stability and achieves competitive results on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of its novel approach.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "ZJjuNF0olj/podcast.wav"}
