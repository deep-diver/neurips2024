Panel (a) shows the diffusion model used in image generation, which involves multiple iterations of a U-Net to denoise an image progressively. Panel (b) shows how the diffusion model is applied to object detection, utilizing multiple decoder iterations for denoising.  In contrast, panel (c) presents the proposed method, where the denoising process is decomposed into multiple denoising blocks within a single model (denoising ViT), enabling real-time performance. The pink box in (c) highlights the denoising module, and '\u00d7 N' indicates the number of denoising iterations.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ZJjuNF0olj/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overview of model architecture.
