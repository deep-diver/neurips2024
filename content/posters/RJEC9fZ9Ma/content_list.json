However, the relationship between these optimal structures at TPT and the classification performance remains elusive, especially in imbalanced learning. Even though it is noticed that fixing the classifier to an optimal structure can mitigate the minority collapse problem, the performance is still not comparable to the classical imbalanced learning methods with a learnable classifier. In this work, we find that the optimal structure can be designed to represent a better classification rule, and thus achieve better performance. In particular, we justify that, to achieve better classification, the features from the minor classes should align with more directions. This justification then yields a decision rule called the Generalized Classification Rule (GCR) and we also term these directions as the centers of the classes. Then we study the NC under an MSE-type loss via the Unconstrained Features Model (UFM) framework where (1) the features from a class tend to collapse to the mean of the corresponding centers of that class (named Neural Collapse to Multiple Centers (NCMC)) at the global optimum, and (2) the original classifier approximates a surrogate to GCR when NCMC occurs. Based on the analysis, we develop a strategy for determining the number of centers and propose a Cosine Loss function for the fixed classifier that induces NCMC. Our experiments have shown that the Cosine Loss can induce NCMC and has performance on long-tail classification comparable to the classical imbalanced learning methods.

(2) at $\\theta=\\pi/2$ , The frame collapses to the classifier, resulting in an accuracy rate similar to SETF [26] where the norm of the gradient is weighted by the class imbalance ratio; (3) Frame that is orthogonal to the classifier does not learn anything in the training since the representation is irrelevant to the classifier, thus providing no useful discrimination information. We compare our method to several classical methods including NC-inspired methods ARB loss and SETF, margin-based LDAM-DRW, contrastive learning method KCL and original CE. The Table 3 shows the methods in comparison. We observe that our method is comparable to or even better than the others. The comparison indicates: (1) Our method has some advantages for heavily imbalanced cases. One of the underlying mechanisms is when the minor classes are underestimated due to the lack of sample, they are likely to display the gaussianity such that the proposition 3.1 and class-aware strategy work fine; as the imbalance ratio $\\tau$ rise, the minor classes lose their randomness during training, where our method fails. (2) Our method does not compete with the KCL and ARBLoss on ImageNet, reflecting the limitations of our method in the flexibility of the direction and magnitude of the classifier weights when learning large datasets. We also compare our method to a recent work RBL [42] in the Appendix H that demonstrates the potential limitation of the fixed classifier and the advantage of CAL. (3) two classical methods LDAM-DRW and KCL do not compete with other NC-inspired methods trained with Mixup training, demonstrating the effectiveness Mixup training strategy. (4) Our method with the parameter chosen in the experiment outperforms CE negligibly or performs worse than CE when the imbalance ratio approaches 1. However, we find picking $f=10$ , $\\theta=0.5$ gives an accuracy rate $92.5\\pm0.2$ on Cifar-10 with $\\tau=0.1$ , which shows the significance of hyperparameter selection for our method.

Then we introduce neural collapse to multiple centers (NCMC) under an MSE-type loss, where the centers play a role similar to the neighbors in GCR. According to the framework of the Unconstrained Features Model, the features of each class collapse to the class mean of the centers in balanced or imbalanced settings for learnable or fixed classifiers. We notice that at NCMC, RCR resembles GCR in terms of the hard-to-predict feature distribution. We then propose the cosine loss, a surrogate regression objective of the MSE-type loss called Cosine Loss, that applies to the fixed classifier; and develop the class-aware strategy for determining the number of centers of each class, inspired by the analysis of the Hard-To-Predict Feature. The cosine loss practically induces the NCMC at the terminal phase of training; the combo of the class-aware strategy and the loss with the fixed classifier demonstrates its effectiveness in long-tailed classification. Our work shows the possibility of obtaining a task-specific classification rule by designing the optimal structure at neural collapse under customized losses; it provides a connection among the optimal structure of the feature-classifier alignment, the classification rule, and the generalization in the learning problem.

Focal loss [68, 69] re-weight each instance according to their hard-to-learn level, i.e., making the model take more care of the wrong-recognized samples. Wang et al.

The representations learned from instance-balancing sampling are believed to be general. Many researchers attempt to separate learning process to two stages.

[71] disentangles the basic feature learning and re-balancing learning via two separated branches.[72, 73] decouple the representation learning and classification. They claim that instancebalanced sampling gives more general representation and originally use instance-balanced sampling to learn the representations at first stage, then fix the feature and retrained the classifier (cRT) by techniques such as label-aware smoothing (LAS) and learnable weight scaling (LWS) in the second.

Contrastive learning is a learning paradigm that learns representation that maximizes the similarity between positive and negative samples [74]. Khosla et al.

For imbalanced classification tasks, Contrastive learning usually faces imbalanced positive/negative pairs of samples. To balance the feature space, KCL [37] balances feature space by using the same number of positive pairs for all the classes; class complement methods [76, 77] are proposed to construct positive and negative pairs for the rebalance of the class.

The reason that our method CAL has lower accuracy compared to RBL in other settings, is three-fold: 1. Imbalanced learning with MSE loss is less effective than CE loss in general; 2. Our experiment setting is chosen as close as possible to that where the theoretical analysis (proposition B.1 and C.1) is conducted, for example, to match the isotropy of the Gaussian, we normalize/batch normalize the feature to ensure it is unit norm and centered before the classification, and the weight are unit vectors through training. This setting possibly harms the learnability and flexibility of our model. 3. Under the class-aware MSE loss, we use the original classifier to be the surrogate classification rule of our general classification rule. However, the rule is designed especially for \u201chard-to-predict\u201d unseen data and thus is not necessarily optimal for the classification of other unseen data. When the hard-to-predict unseen data takes a very small portion of the population, our design may lose its effectiveness.
