### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many computational imaging tasks involve solving inverse problems, where the goal is to reconstruct an image from noisy and incomplete measurements. Traditional methods often rely on simple image priors, limiting their ability to reconstruct complex images accurately.  Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown their potential in generating realistic images, suggesting that they could improve image reconstruction in inverse problems. However, previous attempts to use diffusion models in this context have relied on approximations that can lead to inaccuracies. 

This research introduces a novel method, Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (PnP-DM), that uses diffusion models as image priors within a Bayesian framework.  The key innovation is an algorithm that reduces the problem to a simpler Gaussian denoising problem which is then solved using a general formulation that encompasses a variety of state-of-the-art diffusion models.  The results show that PnP-DM significantly improves the accuracy and fidelity of image reconstructions compared to existing methods, especially in challenging problems like black hole imaging.

### In-depth insights


#### PnP-DM: A New MCMC
PnP-DM, introduced as a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, presents a principled approach to posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems.  **Leveraging diffusion models (DMs) as priors**, it avoids the common approximations found in existing DM-based methods, leading to more accurate posterior estimations.  The core innovation lies in its **rigorous integration of DMs**, using the EDM framework as a unified interface, thereby avoiding approximations in the generative process.  This allows PnP-DM to handle a wide array of DMs, making it adaptable to various inverse problems. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated across diverse linear and non-linear problems, including a real-world black hole imaging application, showcasing its superior performance and robustness compared to existing techniques.  While it presents a significant step forward,  **future work could explore handling large-scale inverse problems** efficiently, possibly through parallelization or stochastic approximations, and further refine theoretical analysis to account for score function approximation errors.

#### EDM Prior Integration
The proposed method's core innovation lies in its principled integration of diffusion models (DMs) as image priors within a Bayesian framework.  Instead of relying on approximations that compromise accuracy, the authors introduce an elegant solution using the Energy-based Diffusion Model (EDM) formulation.  **EDM provides a unified interface to leverage various state-of-the-art DMs**, avoiding the approximations seen in existing methods. This rigorous approach allows for accurate posterior sampling by reducing the inverse problem to a Gaussian denoising problem, where the EDM's generative power is harnessed.  **The EDM's ability to unify diverse DM architectures is crucial**, as it offers flexibility and scalability across various imaging tasks. This innovative method contributes significantly to accurate posterior estimation compared to existing techniques, showcasing its potential in tackling complex inverse problems.

#### Nonlinear Problem Solving
The paper tackles nonlinear inverse problems by leveraging the power of diffusion models (DMs) within a principled Bayesian framework.  **A key innovation is the proposed Plug-and-Play Diffusion Model (PnP-DM), a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that avoids common approximations in existing DM-based methods.** This approach rigorously integrates DMs as priors, enabling accurate posterior sampling for complex, nonlinear imaging tasks. The method‚Äôs effectiveness is demonstrated on challenging real-world problems including black hole imaging, showing **superior performance over existing methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and posterior estimation.**  While the method demonstrates strong empirical results, limitations include the computational cost for large-scale problems and the reliance on accurate score function estimation. Future work will focus on addressing these limitations to further enhance scalability and robustness.  The theoretical analysis partially addresses the non-asymptotic behavior, but  **a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of the algorithm's convergence properties is needed.**

#### Non-Asymptotic Analysis
A non-asymptotic analysis focuses on the **finite-time behavior** of an algorithm or process, unlike asymptotic analysis which examines the behavior as time goes to infinity.  In the context of probabilistic imaging using diffusion models, a non-asymptotic analysis would provide **concrete bounds** on the error or distance between the algorithm's output and the true posterior distribution for a fixed number of iterations. This would be crucial for practical applications because it would allow us to determine how many iterations are required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.  **Key quantities** in such analysis might include the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Fisher information between the estimated posterior and the true posterior.  The analysis might involve establishing a rate of convergence, showing how quickly the error decreases as the number of iterations increases. It would need to account for any approximations or empirical estimations done in the algorithm's steps, especially those involving score functions approximated via neural networks.  **Establishing a stationary guarantee** would be a significant finding, showing that the algorithm eventually settles to a stable solution, which is especially important for sampling-based approaches.

#### Black Hole Imaging
The research demonstrates a novel approach to black hole imaging using diffusion models.  **It overcomes limitations of existing methods by rigorously integrating diffusion models as priors within a Bayesian framework**, avoiding approximations in the generative process.  This is achieved through a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that reduces the problem to posterior sampling of a Gaussian denoising problem, efficiently solvable using the proposed method. The approach is validated on real-world data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the M87 black hole, achieving high-quality reconstructions and demonstrating the method's robustness and accuracy in posterior estimation compared to existing DM-based methods.  **A key strength is the use of a unified DM interface**, allowing seamless integration of various state-of-the-art diffusion models. The results highlight the power of principled probabilistic methods for tackling complex inverse problems like black hole imaging, showcasing superior accuracy and robustness.
