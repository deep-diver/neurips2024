In the context of probabilistic imaging using diffusion models, a non-asymptotic analysis would provide **concrete bounds** on the error or distance between the algorithm's output and the true posterior distribution for a fixed number of iterations. This would be crucial for practical applications because it would allow us to determine how many iterations are required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.  **Key quantities** in such analysis might include the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Fisher information between the estimated posterior and the true posterior.  The analysis might involve establishing a rate of convergence, showing how quickly the error decreases as the number of iterations increases. It would need to account for any approximations or empirical estimations done in the algorithm's steps, especially those involving score functions approximated via neural networks.  **Establishing a stationary guarantee** would be a significant finding, showing that the algorithm eventually settles to a stable solution, which is especially important for sampling-based approaches."}}, {"heading_title": "Black Hole Imaging", "details": {"summary": "The research demonstrates a novel approach to black hole imaging using diffusion models.  **It overcomes limitations of existing methods by rigorously integrating diffusion models as priors within a Bayesian framework**, avoiding approximations in the generative process.
