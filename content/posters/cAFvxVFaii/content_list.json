Probabilistic time series forecasting with deep learning (DL) has attracted attention for its ability to capture complex, nonlinear dependencies and provide the probability distribution of target variables [1, 2]. In multivariate time series, autoregressive models are widely used for probabilistic forecasting [3\u20135], modeling the joint one-step-ahead predictive distribution and generating multistep-ahead predictions in a rolling manner. To enable scalable learning, these models often assume that errors are independent over time. Typically, time series variables follow a Gaussian distribution $\\mathbf{z}_{t}=m(\\mathbf{h}_{t})+\\eta_{t}$ , where $m(\\cdot)$ is the mean function and $\\pmb{\\eta}_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\pmb{\\Sigma}_{t})$ is a stochastic error process with contemporaneous covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{t}$ .

A notable innovation is the batch training method introduced by Zheng et al.

This approach parameterizes a dynamic covariance matrix to capture error autocorrelation, which is then used to calibrate the predictive distribution of time series variables.

In multistep-ahead forecasting, since the predicted values are used as inputs for subsequent predictions within the prediction range, the residuals accumulate the effects of inaccuracies from previous steps. Therefore, the performance improvement depends not only on our modeling of error correlations but also on the properties of the residuals. These properties can be influenced by the absolute and relative time of the forecast and the seasonality of the data. For data without strong seasonality, residuals tend to be larger when predicting further ahead, making error accumulation more apparent. Conversely, for data with strong seasonality, the impact of error accumulation can vary. We observe that, in most scenarios, $\\mathrm{CRPS}_{\\mathrm{sum}}$ is reduced at the early forecasting stages.
