### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current instruction tuning methods focus solely on optimizing model outputs, potentially leading to overfitting, especially with limited training data.  This paper addresses this limitation by proposing INSTRUCTION MODELLING (IM), a novel approach that also incorporates loss calculation for instructions or prompts. This method is particularly beneficial when working with datasets characterized by lengthy instructions and short outputs, or in low-resource scenarios.

IM was evaluated on 21 diverse benchmarks, showcasing substantial performance improvements in many cases.  The study identifies two key factors influencing IM's effectiveness: the ratio between instruction and output lengths, and the number of training examples.  Analysis suggests that IM's improvements result from a reduction in overfitting to the instruction tuning dataset. The paper concludes by not suggesting IM as a replacement for existing methods, but rather as a helpful addition for improving the current instruction tuning techniques.

### In-depth insights


#### IM: Loss Over Instructions
The proposed method, Instruction Modelling (IM), introduces a novel approach to instruction tuning by incorporating loss over instructions, in addition to the loss over outputs. This is a significant departure from traditional Instruction Tuning (IT), which focuses solely on output loss. **IM's core innovation lies in its ability to improve the model's understanding of both instructions and their corresponding outputs**, leading to better performance across various NLP tasks and open-ended generation benchmarks.  The experiments demonstrate that **IM is especially beneficial in scenarios with lengthy instructions and short outputs, as well as under data-scarce conditions**, showcasing its robustness and efficiency in low-resource settings.  By considering loss over both instructions and outputs, IM effectively mitigates the problem of overfitting to training datasets, a common issue with IT, resulting in improved generalization capabilities.  **IM is not presented as a replacement for IT, but rather a complementary technique**, offering valuable guidance in resource-constrained scenarios. Further investigation into the influence of instruction length and output length ratios, combined with the exploration of IM's interaction with other instruction tuning techniques, promises further valuable insights in advancing language model training.

#### IM Effectiveness Factors
Analyzing the effectiveness of Instruction Modelling (IM), two key factors emerge: **the ratio between instruction and output lengths in the training data**, and **the number of training examples**.  Longer instructions paired with shorter outputs, as seen in datasets like Code Alpaca, significantly benefit from IM, likely due to reduced overfitting to instruction-specific patterns. Conversely, IM's advantage diminishes when output lengths are comparable to instruction lengths.  **The number of training examples also plays a crucial role**.  IM proves particularly effective in low-resource scenarios (Superficial Alignment Hypothesis), showcasing its robustness when training data is scarce. This suggests IM's ability to mitigate overfitting, which is more pronounced with limited data, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.  Therefore, tailoring the dataset based on these factors is crucial for maximizing IM's performance.

#### Overfitting Mitigation
The concept of overfitting mitigation is central to the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in language models.  The paper explores this, showing how simply applying a loss function to the instruction and prompt, rather than just the output (INSTRUCTION MODELLING or IM), helps reduce overfitting, particularly in low-resource scenarios. **IM's effectiveness is linked to the ratio of instruction to output length and the number of training examples**: lengthy instructions paired with short outputs or fewer training examples, aligns better with the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis and shows significant improvements with IM.  **The mitigated overfitting is demonstrated through lower test losses despite higher training losses, lower BLEU scores (indicating less memorization of training data), and improved performance stability across training epochs.**  This suggests IM enhances generalization capabilities by encouraging the model to focus less on mimicking training data and more on understanding and following the instructions themselves.  **The findings underscore that while IM isn't a replacement for IT, it offers a valuable strategy, especially when resources are limited, for better instruction tuning outcomes.**

#### Low-Resource Tuning
Low-resource tuning in NLP focuses on adapting large language models (LLMs) to perform well with limited training data. This is crucial because acquiring substantial, high-quality datasets can be expensive and time-consuming.  **Effective low-resource techniques are essential for democratizing access to advanced NLP capabilities**, especially in low-resource languages or domains.  Methods often involve techniques like **data augmentation**, to artificially increase the size of the training set, and **transfer learning**, leveraging knowledge from models trained on larger, related datasets.  **Careful selection of training data** is also paramount to maximize performance with limited resources; this often involves filtering for high-quality examples and prioritizing informative instances.  **Instruction tuning**, a popular method, helps align the model's output to specific user instructions using a smaller number of examples.   Successful low-resource methods generally involve a combination of these approaches to achieve satisfactory performance, which is vital to bridge the gap between resource-rich and resource-poor environments in NLP.

#### Future Work: KL Divergence
Future research exploring KL divergence as a regulariser in instruction tuning presents exciting possibilities.  **Initial findings suggest that while KL divergence can mitigate overfitting on traditional NLP tasks, it can detrimentally impact performance on open-ended generation benchmarks.** This highlights the nuanced relationship between regularisation strength and the specific characteristics of instruction-tuning datasets. Future work should investigate optimal KL divergence weighting strategies for various datasets, possibly incorporating adaptive methods that adjust weighting based on factors such as instruction and output length ratios.  **A more comprehensive exploration of the impact of KL divergence on model calibration and robustness is needed.**  It's crucial to understand how different KL divergence implementations affect the balance between model fidelity to instructions and its ability to generate creative, diverse outputs. Furthermore, **research could explore combining KL divergence with other regularisation techniques** to achieve a superior balance between mitigating overfitting and preserving model capabilities.
