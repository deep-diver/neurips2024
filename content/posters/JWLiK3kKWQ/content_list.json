From this perspective, the prototype information plays the same role as text prompts in visual language models to some extent. Thus, our work provides a direction that we can extract some abstract concept information from the available single modal data and then train/adapt models with such information in some appropriate way, such as contrastive learning, to learn more discriminative and useful representation for downstream tasks. Since visual information is more diverse than texts, we think it will be a promising and feasible way of developing general models for various kinds of visual tasks.

Cross-domain few-shot classification is a learning paradigm that aims at learning to perform classification on previously unseen data and domains by merely fast training a model on several labeled training data. Generally, the cross-domain few-shot classification problem can be seen as an extension of conventional few-shot classification problem [52, 14, 47, 6]. The main difference between conventional and cross-domain few-shot classification lies in the domains for evaluation. In the conventional few-shot classification setting, a model is trained and evaluated on the same dataset (domain), where the distribution is invariant. However, in the crossdomain few-shot classification setting, a model is trained on the training sets of several datasets with different distributions and then evaluated on the test sets of datasets that are used for training as well as the datasets that have never been observed during the training/adaptation phase. Thus, compared with the conventional few-shot classification task, the cross-domain few-shot classification task is much more challenging since there exist distribution gaps between the training and previously unseen test datasets. Currently, all existing works regarding cross-domain few-shot classification are mainly based on conventional meta-learning methods, such as Prototypical Networks [47] and MAML [14]. The former is famous for its strong ability to learn effective inductive bias while the latter is impressive for its flexibility of adaptation to new tasks. Generally, the existing works can be divided into two different types according to their ways of training the backbones and classifiers. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Some of the existing works train the model from scratch with a sequence of few-shot tasks in the same way as conventional few-shot learning frameworks. A typical case of this kind of learning paradigm is Proto-MAML [49]. Specifically, Proto-MAML proposes to train a model with the modified Prototypical loss in the same way as MAML to take advantage of the strengths of the two frameworks. We would like to note that Prototypical loss plays an important role in current cross-domain few-shot classification research. The reason behind this is that the tasks adopted in cross-domain few-shot classification tasks are usually sampled with varied numbers of classes and shots [49]. In this case, it is infeasible to train a classifier in the same way as the conventional meta-learning framework, where a parameterized classifier is initialized with a fixed number of classes. In addition to Proto-MAML, more works are proposed to solve cross-domain few-shot classification tasks. CNAPs [43] proposes to generate parameters with feature-wise linear modulation (a.k.a., FiLM [41]) for task-specific modules in their model. However, a potential problem of CNAPs is that the Euclidean distance adopted in the loss implicitly assumes that each cluster is distributed according to a unit normal. This may further result in misclassification of data points. Based on this observation, SimpleCNAPs [3] further proposes a non-parametric classifier from the perspective of class-covariance-based distance metric to improve the classification performance of the original CNAPs method. Moreover, Doersch et al. [10] notice that the representations learned via the Prototypical Network framework may only represent the observed data yet discard the information that might contribute to the recognization of out-ofdistribution classes. Thus, in order to solve this problem, they further propose CrossTransformer to leverage query image information in pixel-level during the adaptation steps via an attention module. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Different from the learning frameworks that train the entire pipeline from scratch, the other kinds of methods usually respectively pre-train one or several domain-specific backbones on all available datasets during the training phase in a conventional supervised learning paradigm. Then, during the evaluation phase, the prior knowledge in these pre-trained backbones is transferred to the new tasks through representation fusion or representation adaptation. In cross-domain few-shot classification community, SUR [12] firstly proposes to select relevant features from the 8 pre-trained backbones to represent the data of the given new task via a vector. Later, URT [34] further proposes to quickly train a multi-head transformer on top of 8 pre-trained backbones to learn to select features for unseen data. Besides, Triantafillou et al. [50] proposes to treat the convolutional layers in a model as universal templates while treating the batch normalization layers as the domain-specific modules. Thus, FLUTE is proposed to pre-train a set of universal weights and several domain-specific BN modules and then train a small model to learn to combine these BN layers and transfer the prior knowledge to the new tasks. Although leveraging pre-trained backbones is able to take advantage of high-quality representations learned from previous domains, it is quite time-consuming to perform several forward passes during both training and evaluation phases. In order to solve this concern, Li et al. [29] proposes URL to distill the prior knowledge of all 8 pre-trained backbones in one single backbone. Then, during the test phase, a simple linear layer is fast fine-tuned on top of the distilled multi-domain backbone to transfer the priori to the unseen domains. Later, TSA [30] is proposed to enhance URL via plugging more learnable residual modules into the frozen pre-trained backbone to learn more task-specific features for unseen data. Meanwhile, recent work $\\mathrm{\\dot{T}A^{2}}$ -Net [16] notices that different tasks prefer different learnable modules and proposes to train an Action Generation Network in the way of reinforcement learning to learn to select the optimal module for each task.

[31] further explores an alternative loss from the perspective of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion measure. Different from conventional unsupervised contrastive learning, Khosla et al. [23] proposes a fully supervised contrastive learning paradigm, SupCon, via leveraging label information. To be specific, in conventional unsupervised contrastive learning, only the augmented counterparts of an image are treated as positive images. However, in supervised contrastive learning, all images that share the same \u201cgeneral\u201d concept are treated as positive samples. The ultimate goal of SupCon is to pull normalized embeddings from the same class closer than embeddings from different classes. Then, with the emergence of pre-trained vision language models, such as CLIP [42], embeddings that are generated from other modalities are treated as supervised information and have shown impressive power in multi-modality learning fields. From our perspective, SupCon and CLIP share the same core. The key difference is that SupCon learns representations by comparing each sample with all other samples within the same class while CLIP learns to align the representations of each image sample with the representations of text information that are more \u201cgeneral\u201d than a set of images.

[32] argues that there exists a modality gap between different modal data and theoretically demonstrates this from the perspective of cone effect [38, 13]. Further, Liang et al. [32] demonstrates that such a modality gap contributes to the downstream performance on zero-shot learning tasks. In this work, following Liang et al. [32], we find that such kind of \u201cmodality\u201d gap also exists between prototype and instance embeddings in the context of single modality data, and applying the same transformation to both of these two kind of embeddings shrinks such a gap.

The text prompts describe the general and representative information of a category. Thus, we conjecture that the prior information respectively contained in prototypes and image instances is at different levels. To be specific, image instance representations are encoded with instance-level information closely related to the contents in the given image while prototype representations are a set of class-specific representations. According to the visualizations in [32], the image and text prompt embeddings extracted from visual language models are located in completely separated areas of the feature space.

Then, the prototype for each class in the task is calculated as a mean of all support data within the class following previous works [47, 49, 43, 3, 12, 34, 29, 30]. By respectively applying URL [29] and our proposed CoPA methods on the extracted embeddings, the corresponding representations are obtained. Finally, we reduce the dimension of the prototype and image representations via some dimension reduction tools, such as UMAP [37], and visualize the results.

This phenomenon is consistent with what happens in visual language models [32]. It also demonstrates the aforementioned intuition that prototype and image instance data describe the information at different levels and should be treated differently during the adaptation. \u2022 Then, according to Figs. 1(b), 7(b), 7(e) and $7(\\mathrm{k})$ , we can observe that the \u201cmodality\u201d gap is shrunken after applying URL, which imposes an assumption that the same representation transformation is applied to both prototype and image instance embeddings. This phenomenon demonstrates that sharing the same transformation between prototypes and image instances potentially damages the distribution differences between the prototypes and image instances and in turn removes the differences of semantic information between them. \u2022 Finally, according to Figs. 5(a), 7(c), 7(f) and 7(l), we can observe that the representations learned from our proposed CoPA method preserve the \u201cmodality\u201d gap and the gap is further enlarged compared with the gap between the embeddings.
