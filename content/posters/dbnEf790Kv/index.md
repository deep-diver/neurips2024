### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many physical systems are modeled by PDEs where both the continuous fields and discrete parameters are unknown.  Traditional methods solve these problems separately, leading to inconsistencies.  This often involves computationally expensive simulations. Furthermore, assessing uncertainty propagation through these separate processes is difficult. 

This paper introduces FUSE, a unified framework that jointly predicts continuous quantities and infers discrete parameter distributions. This significantly improves accuracy and robustness by amortizing computational cost through a pre-training step.  The framework is demonstrated on two complex test cases: full-body haemodynamics and atmospheric large-eddy simulation, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.  The key is to unify forward and inverse problems within a single framework, thus improving both prediction and inference.

It shows how finite-dimensional parameters (Œæ) are used to predict both continuous functions (u) and (s) using a combination of neural operators and flow-matching posterior estimation. The figure highlights the flow of information through the model: From finite-dimensional inputs to infinite-dimensional outputs and back again, with the use of band-limited Fourier transforms to bridge the gap between the finite and infinite dimensional spaces.

Band-limited Fourier transforms and a lifting operator act as a bridge between finite and infinite dimensions for the forward problem. Likewise, as inference models such as FMPE or NPE require fixed-size inputs, the operator layers are conjoined with a band-limited Fourier transform to learn a fixed-size representation of the input function.

### In-depth insights


#### Unified Forward-Inverse
A unified forward-inverse approach in PDE modeling is a powerful strategy, **combining the prediction of continuous fields (forward) with the estimation of underlying parameters (inverse)**.  This joint approach promises significant gains in accuracy and robustness compared to tackling these problems separately. By amortizing the computational cost through a joint pre-training step, the method offers an efficient solution for various applications.  The key lies in building a flexible framework that consistently estimates both continuous quantities and the distributions of discrete parameters.  **The success relies on the synergy between forward and inverse models**, with propagated uncertainty playing a critical role.  This unified approach is particularly effective when dealing with incomplete or noisy data, as it can effectively handle uncertainty propagation. Therefore, it has the potential to be highly beneficial for various domains requiring both prediction and parameter estimation from limited information.

#### FNO and FMPE
The research paper section on "FNO and FMPE" likely details the integration of two powerful deep learning architectures to solve a unified forward-inverse problem for parametric PDEs. **FNO (Fourier Neural Operator)** excels at learning mappings between function spaces, making it ideal for handling the continuous nature of PDE solutions.  **FMPE (Flow-Matching Posterior Estimation)**, on the other hand, is a powerful technique for efficiently estimating the probability distribution of parameters, addressing the inverse problem.  The combination is innovative because it leverages FNO's ability to create accurate surrogates and FMPE's strength in uncertainty quantification. By jointly training these models, the method aims to achieve **significantly improved accuracy and robustness** in both the forward prediction and parameter inference tasks. The authors likely present a novel mathematical framework, a unified objective function for joint training, and possibly showcase the approach's effectiveness through experiments involving complex PDE systems.

#### ACB and PWP tests
The ACB (Atmospheric Cold Bubble) and PWP (Pulse Wave Propagation) tests in this research paper serve as crucial validation experiments.  They showcase the model's ability to handle complex, realistic physical systems governed by PDEs. **ACB tests, modeling a turbulent atmospheric phenomenon, assess the model's predictive accuracy for highly nonlinear dynamics involving sharp velocity gradients**.  Meanwhile, **PWP tests, simulating blood flow in the human arterial network, demonstrate its capability for accurate parameter inference and uncertainty quantification in a complex biological system**. The choice of these two distinct test cases highlights the model's versatility and robustness, extending beyond simple, idealized scenarios to real-world applications. The results from these experiments, quantified using appropriate metrics, offer convincing evidence of the model's effectiveness in both forward surrogate modeling and inverse parameter estimation tasks.  The comparisons to various baseline models further strengthen the claims of improved performance and robustness. The thoughtful inclusion of ACB and PWP tests significantly enhances the credibility and impact of the research findings.

#### Uncertainty Propagation
The concept of **uncertainty propagation** is central to the paper's methodology.  The authors highlight the importance of understanding how uncertainties in input parameters (e.g., those characterizing the system conditions or model parameters) affect the accuracy of predictions from the forward model.  They argue that tackling this issue through joint pre-training of inverse and forward models provides a more robust and accurate approach than conventional methods, which typically address these two problems separately. **By integrating both problems within the same framework, inconsistencies are reduced, and the accuracy and reliability of both inverse estimation and surrogate predictions are improved.** The paper demonstrates this improvement empirically with results on pulse wave propagation and atmospheric cold bubble simulations.  **The method, by its design, quantifies the uncertainty in predictions by propagating input uncertainty through the models to obtain an ensemble of predictions.** This is important for evaluating the reliability of a model's outputs in contexts where exact values of input parameters are unknown.

#### Future Work
The authors suggest several promising avenues for future research.  **Extending FUSE to handle scenarios with measurement errors and non-physical parameters** is crucial for real-world applications.  The current framework assumes perfect measurements, a limitation that needs addressing.  Incorporating uncertainty from measurement errors into the model would enhance robustness.  Also, exploring parameterizations where parameters are functions (e.g., space-time dependent) would be relevant. This extension would require a more sophisticated representation of the latent space, potentially using neural operators or other function-valued representations, to account for these complexities.  **Investigating different forward and inverse models within the FUSE framework** would improve its performance and flexibility. The FNO and FMPE used are just examples, and others might be more suitable for specific problems.  Finally, **extending FUSE to higher-dimensional spaces** (e.g., 3D) and more complex PDEs is a necessary step toward broader applicability. Scaling the model to larger datasets and more computationally intensive problems will require efficient implementation and potentially algorithmic modifications.

Likewise, as inference models such as FMPE or NPE require fixed-size inputs, the operator layers are conjoined with a band-limited Fourier transform to learn a fixed-size representation of the input function.

> üîº This figure shows the pressure time series at different locations in the human arterial network for three different levels of input information (information levels 1, 2, and 3).  The true values are shown in black, the mean prediction by the FUSE model is in red, the standard deviation is shown in pink, and the min/max range is depicted in light red.  The plot shows how well the FUSE model predicts the pressure at various locations with varying amounts of available input data.  Lower information levels mean less input data is used for the prediction, which would result in higher uncertainty (larger pink regions) and less accurate predictions (larger difference between red and black curves).

Histograms illustrate the probability distribution of each parameter given the input data for the sample that yielded a median CRPS (continuous ranked probability score) across all samples at each information level. The closer the distributions are to the true parameter values (represented by vertical dashed lines), the better the model's ability to infer the parameters.
