It displays the peak horizontal velocities at a specific location (15 km, 50 m) for different combinations of model parameters.  Two plots are shown: one for the FUSE model and one for the numerical ground truth.  Each plot illustrates how peak velocities vary with changes in the model's parameters.", "section": "A.4 Atmospheric Cold Bubble"}, {"figure_path": "dbnEf790Kv/figures/figures_35_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure A.19: ACB, sensitivity analysis: Peak horizontal velocities u at location 1 (x = 15 km, z = 50 m), sampled for pairwise combinations of the parameters, while keeping all others at their default value. For the neural model (a), 100 samples are drawn for each parameter, corresponding to 150,000 evaluations. For the numerical model (b), four simulations were run per pair of parameters, with each taking values corresponding to 1/6 and 5/6 of the parameter range, corresponding to 60 model evaluations.", "description": "This figure shows the sensitivity analysis of the ACB model.
