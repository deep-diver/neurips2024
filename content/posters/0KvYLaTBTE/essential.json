Existing methods like Decision Transformer (DT) rely on return-to-go (RTG) estimations, which can be unreliable in such scenarios.  This leads to inconsistencies in credit assignment and difficulties in learning temporally consistent policies.  Furthermore, DT can struggle with trajectory stitching, combining suboptimal trajectories to achieve better overall results.\nThe proposed Latent Plan Transformer (LPT) tackles these issues by using **a latent variable to represent a 'plan'**, connecting trajectory generation and the final return.  Instead of relying on RTGs, LPT learns the joint distribution of trajectories and returns, allowing it to infer the plan from the expected return before policy execution. The method utilizes a Transformer-based architecture and posterior sampling, demonstrating the effectiveness of planning through latent space inference.  LPT shows **strong empirical results across diverse benchmarks**, outperforming existing methods in tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, showcasing its capability in credit assignment, and trajectory stitching.", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "0KvYLaTBTE/podcast.wav"}
