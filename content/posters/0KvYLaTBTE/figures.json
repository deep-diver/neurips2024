The left panel shows the overall architecture, highlighting the latent variable z connecting the trajectory generator and return predictor. The latent variable is generated from a prior distribution (z = Ua(zo)). Given z, the trajectory and return are conditionally independent. The right panel focuses on the trajectory generator, illustrating how it uses a causal transformer and cross-attention with z to generate the trajectory sequence.", "section": "3 Latent Plan Transformer (LPT)"}, {"figure_path": "0KvYLaTBTE/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) Maze2D-medium environment (b) Maze2D-large environment.

The left panels display example trajectories from the original training data, illustrating their suboptimal nature and frequent failures to reach the goal. In contrast, the right panels showcase trajectories generated by the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT) model, demonstrating its ability to generate more efficient and successful paths to the goal state.

The x-axis represents the length of the trajectory, and the y-axis represents the density. Two distributions are shown, one for trajectories with a return of 0 and another for trajectories with a return of 1. The distribution for trajectories with a return of 0 is heavily concentrated near a length of 1, while the distribution for trajectories with a return of 1 is concentrated around a length of 1000. This indicates a strong correlation between trajectory length and return in this dataset, with longer trajectories more likely to result in a successful return.", "section": "A.3 Discussion on data quality of Antmaze medium and large"}, {"figure_path": "0KvYLaTBTE/figures/figures_14_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Trajectory length and return distribution in dataset Maze2D-Large", "description": "This figure shows the distribution of trajectory lengths and returns for the Maze2D-Large dataset.  The top panel is a histogram of the returns, showing that most trajectories have a relatively low return, but there are some trajectories with much higher returns. The bottom panel is a histogram of the trajectory lengths, showing that the trajectory lengths are approximately normally distributed, with a mean around 250 steps.  The combination of the two panels shows the relationship between trajectory length and return, with longer trajectories often yielding higher returns.", "section": "6.3 Trajectory stitching"}]
