### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial but faces challenges. Current RL methods, primarily relying on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), often struggle with suboptimal performance and distribution collapse, especially when dealing with the vast action spaces inherent in LLMs.  This instability hinders the exploration of the vast parameter space and leads to over-optimization, resulting in biased behavior. 

To overcome these issues, the paper introduces CORY, a novel framework that extends LLM fine-tuning to a sequential cooperative multi-agent RL setting. **CORY duplicates the LLM into two agents: a pioneer and an observer**. These agents work cooperatively, exchanging roles periodically. The pioneer generates a response, and the observer uses both the query and the pioneer's response to generate its own.  The framework employs a collective reward function, encouraging mutual improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate CORY's superiority over PPO, showcasing improved policy optimality, robustness, and resistance to distribution collapse across various reward functions.

> This figure illustrates the framework of the CORY method and compares it to traditional RL fine-tuning.  The left side shows the standard approach where a single LLM agent interacts with a reward model to generate a response.  The right side shows the CORY method which duplicates the LLM into two agents (pioneer and observer). The pioneer generates a response, which is then used by the observer to generate another response. Both responses contribute to the overall reward.  The roles of pioneer and observer are periodically exchanged during training to enhance co-evolution. This figure visually demonstrates how the CORY approach builds upon and extends traditional RL fine-tuning with multi-agent learning and role exchange.

> This table details the hyperparameters used for fine-tuning GPT-2 models on the IMDB Review dataset using both the single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the proposed Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (CORY) methods. It lists hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, gradient accumulation steps, initial KL coefficient, discount factor, GAE parameter, gradient clipping range, value clipping range, value loss coefficient, and the period of role exchange (only applicable to CORY). These settings are crucial for achieving the balance between maximizing task reward and minimizing KL divergence during the training process.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM Fine-tuning
LLM fine-tuning techniques are crucial for adapting large language models to specific tasks, improving their performance and addressing limitations.  **Reinforcement learning (RL)** has emerged as a powerful approach, offering a more direct optimization path compared to supervised fine-tuning. However, traditional RL methods like PPO often struggle with the unique challenges of LLMs, such as high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, leading to suboptimal performance and distribution collapse. This paper introduces **CORY**, a novel sequential cooperative multi-agent RL framework that leverages the inherent co-evolutionary capabilities of multiple agents to overcome these challenges.  By employing mechanisms like **knowledge transfer** and **periodic role exchange**, CORY fosters collaboration and enhances the robustness of the fine-tuning process. The experimental results demonstrate CORY's superiority over PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and overall training stability.

#### CORY Framework
The CORY framework presents a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging **sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**.  Instead of relying on single-agent methods like PPO, CORY duplicates the LLM into two agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates a response, and the observer, using both the query and the pioneer's response, generates its own.  This **knowledge transfer** mechanism fosters collaboration.  Periodically switching roles through **role exchange** enhances both agents' adaptability and prevents bias.  CORY's collective reward function, summing both agents' individual rewards, further promotes cooperation. The framework is **algorithm-agnostic**, making it compatible with various RL algorithms, and demonstrates improved policy optimality, robustness, and resistance to distribution collapse compared to traditional single-agent methods, as evidenced by experiments on different datasets and reward functions.  This makes CORY a promising method for efficiently refining LLMs in real-world applications.

#### MARL for LLMs
The application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to large language models (LLMs) presents a compelling avenue for enhancing their capabilities.  **MARL's inherent ability to foster cooperation and competition among agents could unlock emergent behavior and improved performance in LLMs, surpassing traditional single-agent RL approaches.**  By structuring the LLM fine-tuning process as a cooperative game between multiple agents, each potentially specializing in different aspects of language understanding, a more robust and efficient learning process could be achieved. **This distributed approach could potentially mitigate the challenges of distribution collapse and instability frequently observed in single-agent LLM fine-tuning.**  Furthermore, the diverse strategies employed by the agents within the MARL framework could lead to more creative and nuanced language generation.  However, **the scalability and computational costs of MARL pose significant hurdles.**  Carefully designed agent architectures and efficient training algorithms are crucial to overcome these challenges and realize the full potential of MARL for advancing LLM capabilities.  Investigating various MARL methodologies and their applicability to different LLM architectures would be essential to further the development of this promising research area.

#### CORY Evaluation
A thorough evaluation of CORY, a novel method for fine-tuning LLMs using sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, would involve a multifaceted approach.  **Benchmark datasets** like IMDB Reviews and GSM8K, representing subjective and objective reward scenarios, respectively, are essential.  The evaluation should compare CORY's performance against established baselines like PPO, focusing on metrics such as **task reward**, **KL divergence**, and **training stability**.  Beyond standard metrics, an analysis of the quality and characteristics of the generated text by the LLM, paying close attention to the presence or absence of distribution collapse, is crucial. The impact of key CORY mechanisms, including **knowledge transfer** and **role exchange**, should be isolated through ablation studies. Analyzing the trade-off between optimizing task performance and maintaining proximity to the original LLM distribution, potentially through the lens of **multi-objective optimization**, is key to understanding CORY's strengths.  Finally, the scalability and computational efficiency of CORY compared to baselines need to be evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation should provide both quantitative results and qualitative analyses to fully assess CORY's effectiveness and its potential for advancing LLM fine-tuning techniques.

#### Future of LLMs
The future of LLMs hinges on several key factors.  **Addressing the limitations of current RL fine-tuning methods** is crucial, as these methods often struggle with instability and distribution collapse, especially when applied to LLMs.  Exploring cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks offers a promising avenue for improvement, potentially leading to more robust and efficient fine-tuning techniques.  Furthermore, **research into more effective reward functions**‚Äîboth subjective (human-aligned) and objective (rule-based)‚Äîis vital for guiding the training of LLMs towards desired outcomes.  **Addressing ethical concerns** surrounding the potential misuse of powerful LLMs is paramount; responsible development and deployment will require careful consideration of societal impact and the implementation of robust safeguards.  Finally, **continued exploration of algorithm-agnostic approaches** that can leverage various RL algorithms will ensure the flexibility and adaptability of LLM fine-tuning methodologies.  These research directions, taken together, point to a future where LLMs are significantly more capable, reliable, and ethically sound.
