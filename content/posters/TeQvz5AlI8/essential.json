Existing adversarial training methods struggle to address this vulnerability, leading to models that are easily fooled by cleverly disguised inputs. This paper introduces a novel Dual Adversarial Training (DAT) method to improve the robustness of DNNs. \n\nDAT leverages a new Adversarial Amplitude Generator (AAG) to create a more effective adversarial training strategy.  By mixing the amplitude of training samples with those of distractor images, the model learns to focus on phase information, which is less susceptible to manipulation. This technique, combined with an efficient adversarial example generation procedure, leads to a significant improvement in model robustness against various attacks. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that DAT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "TeQvz5AlI8/podcast.wav"}
