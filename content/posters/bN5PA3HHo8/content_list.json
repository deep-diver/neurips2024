This technique effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art token-level methods.

However, these models can also pose risks by generating malicious content, including malware, instructions for creating hazardous items, and leaking sensitive information from their training data [22, 46, 25]. As LLMs become increasingly powerful and widespread, managing the risks linked to their misuse is crucial. In response, the practice of red-teaming LLMs has been introduced to evaluate their safety mechanisms [4, 40]. The LLM jailbreak attack, which emerged from this process, involves blending malicious questions (e.g., how to make explosives) with a jailbreak prompt. This strategy can deceive safety-aligned LLMs, causing them to bypass safety measures and potentially produce harmful, discriminatory, or sensitive responses [40].

These attacks fall into two main categories: prompt-level jailbreaks [20, 26, 5] and token-level jailbreaks [46, 15, 24]. Prompt-level jailbreaks use semantically meaningful deception to undermine LLMs, which can be crafted manually [3], through prompt engineering [29], or generated by another LLM [5]. The key advantage of prompt-level jailbreaks is that the attack queries are in natural language, which ensures they are interoperable. However, this same characteristic makes them susceptible to alignment training, as training examples to counter these methods are relatively easy to produce [8, 3]. For example, prompt-level jailbreaks tend to perform poorly against the Llama2-chat series [36] (see Harmbench [25]), which, although not specifically designed to counter these attacks, fine-tuned with ${\\sim}2000$ adversarial prompts.

These jailbreaks allow for more precise control over the LLM\u2019s output due to their finer-grained optimizable space compared to prompt-level jailbreaks. A representative example of this is GCG [46], which demonstrates the effectiveness of token-level jailbreaks across LLMs (see Harmbench [25]). However, this method suffers from query inefficiency.

While transitioning to continuous space is straightforward, converting the optimized vectors back to discrete token space remains challenging. Direct projection onto the discrete space [42] is ineffective, as it significantly alters the optimized vectors and leads to performance drops. To address this, we propose ADC, an Adaptive Dense-to-sparse Constraint for dense token optimization. Initially, we relax the discrete tokens into dense vectors, and the optimization takes place in the full continuous space $\\mathbb{R}^{V}$ . As optimization progresses and the loss decreases, we gradually constrain the optimization space to a highly sparse space. This progression is adaptive to the optimization performance, ensuring that the constraint does not significantly hinder optimization. By the end of the process, the optimization space is constrained to a nearly one-hot vector space. Our approach minimizes the gap between the relaxed continuous space and the one-hot space, reducing the performance drop when transitioning the optimized vectors to discrete tokens.

While image inputs can be approximated as continuous values due to their ordered, fine-grained pixel values, text does not share this characteristic. One approach optimizes directly over discrete tokens [9, 15, 33, 46], ensuring that all updated results remain valid inputs for language models. However, this method of discrete optimization tends to be slow, as it cannot fully utilize gradient information (the update has to be from one discrete token to another). Another strategy involves optimizing in a continuous embedding space before projecting the solutions back into discrete space [18, 42, 13]. Additionally, some researchers use Langevin dynamics sampling to generate discrete prompts from continuous embeddings [30]. Above approaches involve projecting optimized soft embeddings onto their closest one-hot embeddings, ensuring that optimization occurs within the discrete token space. However, if the nearest neighbors are far from the optimized embeddings (which often happens without specific constrains), the effectiveness of the optimization significantly decreases.

Our experimental results demonstrate that ADC surpasses existing token-level techniques in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. On Harmbench, ADC achieves the highest attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs, outperforming current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods. A limitation of this approach is the requirement for whitebox access to the LLMs, which restricts its applicability to closed-source models.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
