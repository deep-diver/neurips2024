Even without the open release of weights, weight stealing and fine-tuning APIs make closed models vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks (HFAs). While safety measures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails are important, such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In this work, we propose Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defence mechanism that operates even when attackers have access to the weights. RepNoise works by removing information about harmful representations such that it is difficult to recover them during finetuning. Importantly, our defence is also able to generalize across different subsets of harm that have not been seen during the defence process as long as they are drawn from the same distribution of the attack set. Our method does not degrade the general capability of LLMs and retains the ability to train the model on harmless tasks. We provide empirical evidence that the efficacy of our defence lies in its \u201cdepth\u201d: the degree to which information about harmful representations is removed across all layers of the LLM.

Such risks are not isolated to only open-source models, weights of proprietary models expose fine-tuning APIs [49] which can be used for constructing harmful models and for reconstructing weights at inference time [10]. The risk of LLMs assisting in harmful tasks is exacerbated by their increasing ability to follow instructions, carry out sophisticated tasks, and the ease with which they can be trained and run. Developers attempt to mitigate these risks [55] by developing safety guardrails that prevent LLMs from performing harmful tasks at inference time. However, these guardrails are easily circumvented either through back doors [33], adversarial attacks [45], or harmful fine-tuning [51].

In this section, we will formally define the notions important to understanding the RepNoise algorithm and it\u2019s theoretical analysis. First, we consider the weights of a deep neural network denoted $\\theta$ as the parameters which are learned using some optimization procedure like that of the harmful fine-tuning procedure described in the main text in eq. (1), typically using stochastic gradient descent which we will return to shortly. We rely on the information bottleneck [59] view which states that neural networks form a Markov chain between the following random variables: the inputs of the network $X$ , the representation of those inputs $Z$ , and the outputs $Y$ which can predicted only from the representations $Z$ . Here, we draw on the notion of representation from [2] which states that $Z$ is a representation of $X$ if in the chain described above $Z$ provides desirable properties for tasks involving $Y$ . Here, the task of interest is predicting tokens $\\bar{Y}$ such that those predicted tokens minimize some loss function $\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{Y},Y)$ over a reference token distribution $Y$ . In this paper, the representations $Z$ will take the form of intermediate activations that are built up through linear transformations and activation functions in the transformer models that we use. Precisely, the neural network is the function $f_{\\theta}(x)=\\hat{y}$ parameterized by $\\theta$ composed of activation functions $z_{i+1}=h(\\theta_{i}\\cdot z_{i})$ where $z_{i=0}$ is an initial embedding of $x$ such as through the use of a learned token embedding matrix common to LLM architectures and the final layer consists of an unembedding layer such as a weight matrix over a vocabulary space with a softmax function. In this process, since $\\hat{y}$ is predicted through the intermediate $z_{i}$ activations then $z_{i}$ meets the criteria of being a representation of the initial input $x$ . While the subspace that these activations span is completely determined by the weights $\\theta$ themselves, we will not be referring to weights as representations in this paper. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "To connect these representations back to an information-theoretic perspective, we will say that the information of any given representation $Z$ is the typical Shannon entropy measure of discrete random variables $H(Z)=\\mathbf{\\bar{E}}[-\\log p(Z)]$ where $p(x)=\\mathbf{\\dot{\\alpha}}P(X=x)$ . In this paper, we are concerned not with the information content of representations themselves but with the notion of mutual information: the amount of information one random variable gives us about another random variable. Formally, the (shannon) mutual information $I(X;Z)$ is given by the information content $H(X)$ minus the conditional entropy (or information content) $H(X|Z)$ for the formula $I(X;Z)=H(X)-H(X|Z)$ . An equivalent distributional view of mutual information, which will will use later, can be given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence $I(X;Z)=\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim P_{x}}[D_{K L}(P(z|x)||P(z)]$ . ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Given these tools we can represent a neural network as an information bottleneck which means that there is a Markov chain $Y\\leftarrow Z\\leftarrow X$ that has what is called a data processing inequality given by: $I(Y;X)\\leq I(X;Z)$ . We can also derive two ideal properties [2] of representations: sufficiency - the representations $Z$ have the same essential information in $X$ to pick out $Y$ i.e. $I(Z;Y)=I(\\dot{X};Z)$ ; and minimality - the representations $Z$ should contain as little information of the input space as possible $\\operatorname*{min}I(X;Z)$ . Finally, we present one more notion to formalize the idea of removing information from a representation. We say that a representation $Z$ has no information about a random variable $Y$ when the mutual information $I(Z;Y)$ is 0. The process of removing information more precisely means reducing the mutual information between these two random variables. As long as the sufficiency condition is met, removing information of representations $Z$ and outputs $Y$ doesn\u2019t reduce the predictive capabilities of a neural network. In the context of unlearning and the mitigating learning harmful text sequences, we want to remove mutual information between representations $Z$ and outputs $Y$ such that the sufficiency condition is not met and this is what we will mean precisely when we say removing information in the paper.

The transition probability model will consider the likelihood of transitioning between one set of model parameters $\\theta_{1}$ to another set of parameters $\\theta_{2}$ during the process of stochastic gradient descent over some loss function $L_{\\theta_{i}}$ .

We experimented with incorporating activations at various parts such as post-attention but the pre-residual activations were most effective.

In the future, we could mitigate this issue by projecting the harmful representations down to a much smaller space that preserves the most important information such as by taking the top-k singular values.
