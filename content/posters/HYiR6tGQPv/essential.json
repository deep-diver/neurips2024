This leads to suboptimal performance.  Many existing works attempt to solve this with heuristics, but this paper addresses the root issue.\nThis paper introduces a novel probability-based CL framework. It uses Bayesian modeling to learn a weight distribution for each pair, automatically mitigating false pairs.  The model is trained via stochastic expectation-maximization.  Experiments show significant improvements over existing methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on average in multiple datasets.", "affiliation": "University at Buffalo", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HYiR6tGQPv/podcast.wav"}
