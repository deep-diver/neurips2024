Existing citation methods primarily focus on teaching models to explicitly cite sources, failing to address the underlying issue of how models actually utilize the context. This paper tackles the problem of 'context attribution' \u2013 identifying the specific parts of the context that influence a model\u2019s generation.  The issue of correctly identifying the contextual information used by LLMs is important as it impacts reliability, quality, and security. \nThe paper introduces CONTEXTCITE, a novel and scalable method for context attribution. CONTEXTCITE learns a surrogate model to approximate how a model's response changes when parts of the context are removed.  The model's weights directly provide attribution scores.  The researchers demonstrate CONTEXTCITE's effectiveness in three key applications: verifying the accuracy of generated statements, improving response quality by pruning contexts, and detecting malicious context poisoning attacks.  **CONTEXTCITE provides a valuable tool for researchers to better understand and improve LLMs.**", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "7CMNSqsZJt/podcast.wav"}
