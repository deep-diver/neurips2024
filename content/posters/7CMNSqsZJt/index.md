### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately use contextual information, leading to unreliable or inaccurate outputs.  Existing citation methods primarily focus on teaching models to explicitly cite sources, failing to address the underlying issue of how models actually utilize the context. This paper tackles the problem of 'context attribution' ‚Äì identifying the specific parts of the context that influence a model‚Äôs generation.  The issue of correctly identifying the contextual information used by LLMs is important as it impacts reliability, quality, and security. 

The paper introduces CONTEXTCITE, a novel and scalable method for context attribution. CONTEXTCITE learns a surrogate model to approximate how a model's response changes when parts of the context are removed.  The model's weights directly provide attribution scores.  The researchers demonstrate CONTEXTCITE's effectiveness in three key applications: verifying the accuracy of generated statements, improving response quality by pruning contexts, and detecting malicious context poisoning attacks.  **CONTEXTCITE provides a valuable tool for researchers to better understand and improve LLMs.**

> üîº The figure shows a simple example of how CONTEXTCITE works. Given a context (a PDF about the 2024 solar eclipse), and a query ('I live in Boston, MA. When and where should I go to see the eclipse?'), a language model generates a response.  CONTEXTCITE then highlights the portion of the context that was used by the model to generate a specific part of the response. In this case, the response's statement about Maine being on the path of totality is linked to the relevant section in the provided PDF.

### In-depth insights


#### Context Attribution
The concept of 'Context Attribution' in the research paper is crucial for understanding how language models utilize contextual information.  It addresses the challenge of determining which specific parts of the provided context directly influence a model's generated output. This moves beyond simply verifying accuracy by delving into the causal relationships between the input context and the generated response. **A key contribution is the formalization of context attribution**, providing a standardized framework for evaluating different methods. The proposed method, CONTEXTCITE, offers a practical and scalable approach for identifying contributing context segments by learning a surrogate model that predicts the effects of context ablation.  This allows for a deeper investigation into misinterpretations or fabrications by the model, improving response quality and aiding in the detection of adversarial attacks. **The effectiveness of CONTEXTCITE is demonstrated through multiple applications**, showcasing its utility in verification, context pruning, and poisoning attack detection.  Overall, context attribution is a significant step towards greater transparency and reliability in language model outputs.

#### CONTEXTCITE Method
The hypothetical 'CONTEXTCITE Method' section would delve into the specifics of their proposed approach for context attribution.  It would likely begin by outlining the **surrogate model** employed ‚Äì a crucial component for efficiently estimating the impact of context alterations on model output. The details of this model's architecture, training process (**dataset creation and ablation strategies**), and the selection of a suitable loss function are all key elements to be described.  Further discussion would encompass the **attribution score calculation** (how the model's weights are interpreted as attribution scores) and the method's **scalability**, addressing how well it handles large contexts and models. A crucial aspect would be a detailed explanation of how the method accounts for potential interactions between different parts of the context, a significant challenge in context attribution.  Finally, the section should detail the **evaluation metrics** used, including justifications for their choice and interpretations of results, providing insights into the method's effectiveness and limitations.

#### Applications
The 'Applications' section of a research paper is crucial for demonstrating the practical value and impact of the presented work.  It showcases how the research findings can be used to solve real-world problems or improve existing technologies. A strong 'Applications' section goes beyond merely listing potential uses; it provides concrete examples, possibly with specific data or metrics to support the claims.  **It might explore various applications that leverage the core methodology in different contexts,** highlighting the flexibility and generalizability of the approach. The depth of the examples in the section determines how convincing the argument of the paper's practical utility is; simple mentions of potential use cases are weaker than detailed case studies or quantitative evaluations of application performance.  **A particularly insightful 'Applications' section might also highlight unexpected or innovative applications** of the research, expanding beyond the initially anticipated uses and showcasing the research's potential for broader impact.  **Furthermore, a strong emphasis on the positive societal benefits** of these applications and the discussion of potential risks or ethical considerations related to their deployment should be included, rounding out a comprehensive and responsible presentation of the research's overall value.

#### Limitations
The research paper's section on limitations acknowledges the **linearity assumption** inherent in CONTEXTCITE's surrogate model, admitting that it might not always accurately represent complex relationships between context and response.  The method's reliance on **ablation studies** is also noted as a potential weakness; misinterpretations or oversimplifications from removing context elements could affect the accuracy of attributions.  Furthermore, the paper highlights the **challenge of attributing statements** derived from prior statements or implicitly held knowledge, which are not directly traceable to specific context sources.  The computational expense associated with the ablation process, particularly when dealing with longer documents, is also recognized.  Finally, the **validity of the ablation method** itself is questioned, as straightforward removal of context segments may fail to account for complex interdependencies within the text, potentially leading to inaccurate or unintuitive attribution results.

#### Future Work
The heading 'Future Work' in a research paper typically outlines potential avenues for extending the current research.  In the context of this paper on ContextCite, future work could logically involve several key areas.  **Improving the scalability of ContextCite** for even larger language models and more complex contexts would be crucial for broader applicability.  **Investigating alternative methods for source identification**, perhaps moving beyond linear surrogate models or exploring different granularities of context segmentation, would enhance the technique's robustness and accuracy.  A particularly interesting area would be **exploring the relationship between contributive and corroborative context attribution**.  Currently, the paper focuses on contributive attribution, identifying sources that *cause* generation. Future work could investigate the interplay with corroborative methods, which identify sources that *support* generation.  Finally, **exploring practical applications beyond verification, response quality improvement, and poisoning attack detection** is vital.  This could include integrating ContextCite into real-world applications or examining its utility in other contexts such as bias detection or model explainability.

> üîº This figure demonstrates how inducing sparsity in the surrogate model improves sample efficiency for context attribution.  It shows that even with many sources, only a small subset is truly relevant in predicting model responses for both summarization and question answering tasks.  LASSO regularization effectively identifies these crucial sources with fewer ablations, leading to a more efficient and accurate surrogate model.

Therefore, inducing sparsity via LASSO yields an accurate surrogate model with just a few ablations (Figure 3b). See Appendix A.4 for the exact setup.

We find that CONTEXTCITE using just 32 context ablations consistently matches or outperforms the baselines-attention, gradient norm, semantic similarity and leave-one-out-across benchmarks and models. Increasing the number of context ablations to {64, 128, 256} can further improve the quality of CONTEXTCITE attributions in this setting as well.

> üîº The figure displays the results of evaluating CONTEXTCITE and several baseline methods for context attribution.  It shows the top-k log-probability drop and linear datamodeling score for each method across three different benchmarks (HotpotQA, TyDi QA, and CNN DailyMail) using two language models (Llama-3-8B and Phi-3-mini).  The results demonstrate that CONTEXTCITE, even with a small number of context ablations (32), performs competitively with or better than the baseline methods.

We evaluate attributions of responses generated by Llama-3-8B and Phi-3-mini on up to 1,000 randomly sampled validation examples from each of three benchmarks. We find that CONTEXTCITE using just 32 context ablations consistently matches or outperforms the baselines-attention, gradient norm, semantic similarity and leave-one-out-across benchmarks and models. Increasing the number of context ablations to {64, 128, 256} can further improve the quality of CONTEXTCITE attributions in this setting as well.

The evaluation is performed on the Llama-3-70B model for CNN DailyMail and HotpotQA datasets.  It compares CONTEXTCITE against baselines (Average Attention and Similarity). The top-k log-probability drop measures the impact of removing the top-scoring words on the generation probability, indicating the relevance of identified words. The linear datamodeling score assesses how well the attribution scores predict the effect of random word ablations.  The figure shows that CONTEXTCITE generally outperforms the baselines in both metrics.

Two metrics are used for evaluation: Top-k log-probability drop (measures how much the probability of generating the original response decreases when removing the top-k highest-scoring sources) and Linear Datamodeling Score (measures how well attribution scores predict the effect of randomly removing sources).  The results show that CONTEXTCITE consistently outperforms the baselines, particularly when using only 32 context ablations. Increasing the number of ablations improves performance further.
