It begins by using labeled scRNA-seq data to inject semantic knowledge into the model. It addresses the challenge of label scarcity by expanding the scRNA-seq dataset using optimal transport (OT) to generate pseudo-labels. The scATAC-seq data is then divided into source-like and target-specific subsets, and different methods are applied for each subset. The source-like samples utilize consistency regularization with random perturbations, while the target-specific samples use an iterative approach to eliminate incorrect labels. Finally, to mitigate the cell heterogeneity between the two datasets, a cross-omic multi-sample mixup technique is employed.
