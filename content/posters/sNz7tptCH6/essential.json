Existing attacks often struggle with transferability \u2013 the ability to fool unseen models.  The challenge lies in the complex interactions between layers and the attention mechanism within ViTs, making it hard to generalize adversarial examples effectively.  This paper addresses these issues.\nThis research introduces Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT), a novel approach. ATT uses three key strategies: adaptive gradient re-scaling to reduce variance, a self-paced patch-out method to improve input diversity, and attention gradient truncation to mitigate overfitting.  Experiments show that ATT significantly improves the transferability of attacks against both undefended and defended models, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its importance for advancing research in adversarial robustness for ViTs.", "affiliation": "Chongqing University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Adversarial Attacks"}, "podcast_path": "sNz7tptCH6/podcast.wav"}
