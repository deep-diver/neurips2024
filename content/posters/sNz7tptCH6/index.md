### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision Transformers (ViTs), while powerful, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  Existing attacks often struggle with transferability ‚Äì the ability to fool unseen models.  The challenge lies in the complex interactions between layers and the attention mechanism within ViTs, making it hard to generalize adversarial examples effectively.  This paper addresses these issues.

This research introduces Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT), a novel approach. ATT uses three key strategies: adaptive gradient re-scaling to reduce variance, a self-paced patch-out method to improve input diversity, and attention gradient truncation to mitigate overfitting.  Experiments show that ATT significantly improves the transferability of attacks against both undefended and defended models, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its importance for advancing research in adversarial robustness for ViTs.

> This figure shows the overall framework of the proposed Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) attack method.  The process starts with a clean image and its corresponding ground-truth label.  A self-paced patch out strategy is used to dynamically discard patches in the adversarial perturbation. The adaptive variance reduced token gradient method then adjusts the token gradients within and across the ViT layers, mitigating overfitting and improving transferability. This gradient correction involves re-scaling the largest token gradient(s) and applying a hybrid token gradient truncation method to weaken the attention mechanism. The process culminates in the generation of adversarial examples.

The table highlights the best performing attack method for each ViT model.





### In-depth insights


#### Adaptive Token Tuning
Adaptive token tuning presents a novel approach to enhancing the transferability of adversarial attacks against vision transformers (ViTs).  Instead of aggressively zeroing out gradients, as in previous methods, **adaptive token tuning refines the gradient update process**. This refinement involves three key strategies:  adaptive gradient rescaling to manage variance, a self-paced patch-out strategy to promote input diversity, and a hybrid token gradient truncation to mitigate overfitting from complex attention mechanisms.  The adaptive nature allows the algorithm to dynamically adjust its approach based on the model's behavior, increasing robustness. The self-paced learning aspect ensures efficient and effective update, while the attention mechanism manipulation targets the source of overfitting. The combination of these strategies leads to significantly improved attack success rates across various ViT and CNN models, highlighting the effectiveness of this nuanced, adaptive approach.  **The adaptive nature of the method is key to its success**, particularly its ability to balance feature preservation with effective gradient adjustments.

#### Transferability Boost
The concept of "Transferability Boost" in adversarial attacks centers on enhancing the effectiveness of attacks trained on one model (the surrogate model) against unseen target models.  **Improved transferability is crucial for black-box attacks**, where the target model's architecture and parameters are unknown.  The core idea is to develop attack strategies that generalize well, minimizing overfitting to the surrogate model.  This often involves techniques that **reduce the reliance on specific features or model internals** of the surrogate. Approaches might involve manipulating gradients, regularizing the attack process or leveraging input diversity, thereby creating perturbations that are more robust and effective across a range of target models.  **Adaptive techniques** that adjust the attack strategy based on feedback from the target model are particularly promising for achieving strong transferability.  Ultimately, a "Transferability Boost" aims to bridge the gap between white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, making adversarial robustness significantly more challenging to achieve.

#### ViT Attack Method
The core of this research paper revolves around a novel approach to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks against Vision Transformers (ViTs).  The proposed **Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT)** method tackles the limitations of existing ViT attacks by addressing three key areas. Firstly, it employs an adaptive gradient re-scaling strategy to effectively reduce the overall variance of token gradients without sacrificing crucial feature information.  Secondly, it introduces a self-paced patch out strategy that leverages feature importance to selectively discard perturbation patches, enhancing diversity and mitigating overfitting. Lastly, it incorporates a hybrid token gradient truncation strategy to intelligently weaken the influence of the attention mechanism, thereby further improving transferability.  The ATT method is **evaluated extensively** across various ViT architectures and CNN models (both defended and undefended), demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in generating highly transferable adversarial examples, showcasing its potential significance in assessing the robustness of ViT models and inspiring future research in adversarial defense strategies.

#### Semantic PatchOut
Semantic PatchOut is a novel approach to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks against Vision Transformers (ViTs).  Traditional PatchOut methods randomly remove patches, potentially discarding important information. **Semantic PatchOut leverages feature importance maps to guide patch selection.** This ensures that less crucial patches are preferentially removed, preserving more critical information for effective attacks. **By incorporating a self-paced learning strategy, Semantic PatchOut dynamically adjusts the number of discarded patches during training**.  This prevents early overfitting and allows the attack to converge towards a more transferable solution. The semantic guidance and self-paced learning contribute to improved attack success rates, especially under black-box attack scenarios where limited information about the target model is available.  **The method's strength lies in its ability to balance perturbation diversity and efficiency** by intelligently discarding less informative patches, resulting in higher transferability.

#### Attention Weakening
The concept of 'Attention Weakening' in the context of adversarial attacks against Vision Transformers (ViTs) presents a novel approach to enhancing the transferability of attacks.  Standard gradient-based attacks often overfit to the specific surrogate model used for crafting adversarial examples.  **Attention mechanisms**, central to ViTs, can exacerbate this overfitting by creating complex feature interactions.  'Attention Weakening' aims to mitigate this overfitting by strategically reducing the influence of the attention mechanism, particularly in deeper layers where overfitting is most pronounced.  This might involve techniques like **gradient truncation** or **attenuation** within the attention modules, allowing the adversarial perturbations to learn more robust and transferable features, thereby improving the attack success rate against unseen, black-box ViT models.  **The key insight** is that selectively weakening attention can improve generalization without completely disabling the mechanism's beneficial properties.
