Until now, no tabular method has consistently outperformed classical supervised learning, which ignores these shifts. To address temporal distribution shifts, we present Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context Learning with a Prior-Data Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm itself: it accepts the entire training dataset as input and makes predictions on the test set in a single forward pass. Specifically, it learns to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from a prior that specifies the model\u2019s inductive bias. This prior is based on structural causal models (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts of these causal models, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary model parameters. The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen data, runs in seconds on small to moderately sized datasets and needs no hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across 18 synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate large performance improvements over a wide range of baselines, such as XGB, CatBoost, TabPFN, and applicable methods featured in the Wild-Time benchmark. Compared to the strongest baselines, it improves accuracy from 0.688 to 0.744 and ROC AUC from 0.786 to 0.832 while maintaining stronger calibration.

Specifically, we suggest shifting edge weights between nodes that affect causal relationships while sampling instances in each dataset. To accurately model these edge shifts, we propose using a $2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$ -order SCM, a secondary model that adjusts the primary SCM, that takes a time indicator as input and outputs the weight shifts.

Compared to TabPFN and GBDTs, the NN-based methods in the Wild-Time Benchmark (Section A.4.4.3) show a substantial drop in performance, likely due to the limited training data. Since our method focuses on enhancing OOD robustness rather than optimizing ID tasks, we find lower predictive performance on ID tasks. While performance gains are observed on both, real-world and synthetic data, we observe stronger improvements on synthetic datasets. This can be partly attributed to the, on average, stronger distribution shifts between ID and OOD data in our synthetic benchmark.
