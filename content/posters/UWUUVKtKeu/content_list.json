In imitation learning, diffusion models [13, 35, 7] are often employed to capture the intricate distributions found within expert datasets. Furthermore, in offline RL, certain works replace unimodal policies with diffusion models to enrich the diversity in sampled actions or decision sequences. This success can be largely attributed to the robust expressiveness and multimodality inherent in diffusion models [13, 35]. Such methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in practical scenarios like robotic navigation [36, 43], robot arm manipulation[6, 17, 33, 23], dexterous hand and legged robot locomotion control [14].

In online RL, value estimation varies with policy changes [45], posing a significant challenge. While diffusion models can effectively capture data distribution, they cannot directly improve the policy due to their training objectives [42]. Consequently, integrating diffusion models into traditional online RL framework [34, 10, 9, 38] is challenging. Some works, such as DIPO [42], propose leveraging Q-function gradients to update actions for higher rewards, followed by employing diffusion models to fit the updated action distribution. However, relying on gradient updates constrains the algorithm\u2019s exploration capability. QSM [31] directly aligns the score and the gradient of the Q-function under the perspective of score-matching.

This new objective, termed Q-weighted VLO loss, is complemented by Q-weight transformation functions, allowing it to be applied to general RL tasks.

Calculating the exact entropy is intractable due to the inaccessibility of the probability density function (PDF) of diffusion policies. Therefore, we design an entropy regularization term from another perspective. Moreover, while diffusion policies offer advantages like multimodality, they also introduce large policy variance, leading to inefficient interaction with environments. To address this, we develop an efficient behavior policy through action selection to improve sample efficiency.

Online RL faces a more challenging problem in that it requires algorithms to learn the policy and make decisions in real-time interaction with the environment. DIPO [42] is the first to employ diffusion policies in online RL and proposes a novel policy improvement method. During diffusion policy updates, each action in the reply buffer is updated via action gradient to receive higher rewards. However, the action of gradient updating may deviate from the behavior policy, and the paradigm of gradient updating limits the algorithm\u2019s ability of global exploration and raises computational costs. QSM [31] introduces a new update role for diffusion policy by aligning the score of the diffusion model with the gradient of the Q-function to increase the Q-value of state-action pairs. However, it overlooks the impact of inaccuracies in the value function gradient and biases introduced during the alignment process when updating the policy. This can lead to the policy being influenced by suboptimal data within the buffer. Compared with these existing diffusion-based online RL algorithms, QVPO performs policy optimization with the Q-weighted VLO loss which can be theoretically proven to be the tight lower bound of the policy objective of online RL. This means QVPO does not incur additional errors in policy optimization.
