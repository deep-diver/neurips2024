Diffusion models, known for their expressiveness and multimodality, show promise in addressing this but their integration in *online* RL remains less explored. Existing methods either suffer from the unavailability of 'good' samples or inaccurate Q-function gradients, hindering performance. \nThis research introduces QVPO, a novel model-free online RL algorithm. **QVPO uses a Q-weighted variational loss**, which provides a tight lower bound of the policy objective, and **addresses the issue of exploration** with a special entropy regularization term.  To reduce variance, it employs an efficient behavior policy for action selection.  Experiments on MuJoCo continuous control tasks demonstrate QVPO's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in cumulative reward and sample efficiency.", "affiliation": "ShanghaiTech University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "UWUUVKtKeu/podcast.wav"}
