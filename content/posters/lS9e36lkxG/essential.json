This scarcity presents a major challenge for few-shot learning, particularly in tabular data due to the heterogeneity of the features and lack of spatial relationships commonly leveraged in image and text data. Existing methods often struggle to handle this data type effectively. \nThis paper introduces D2R2, a novel framework addressing the challenges of tabular few-shot learning.  D2R2 uses a **diffusion model** to extract semantic knowledge, crucial for denoising and improving the effectiveness of few-shot learning.  It also incorporates a **random distance matching** technique to preserve the distance between samples in the embedding space. Finally, to handle the potential multimodality of embeddings, it uses an **iterative prototype scheme** to improve classification. Experiments show that D2R2 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lS9e36lkxG/podcast.wav"}
