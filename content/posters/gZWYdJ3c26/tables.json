The table shows that the playback performance (Ours-Playback) is better than both the baseline and the first run of TALOS (Ours), indicating that the gradual model adapts to the scene over time.  The improvement suggests that TALOS effectively learns a representation of the scene through gradual model updates, rather than relying on a single pass through the data.", "section": "4.6 Additional experiments"}, {"figure_path": "gZWYdJ3c26/tables/tables_9_3.jpg", "caption": "Table 6: Impact of the number of iterations.", "description": "This table shows the impact of the number of iterations for updating FM on the performance of TALOS.
