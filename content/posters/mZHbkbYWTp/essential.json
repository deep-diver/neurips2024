Stochastic optimal control theory offers a mathematical framework for understanding these loops, but existing methods struggle to model realistic sensorimotor noise, especially internal noise.  The seminal work of Todorov(2005) proposes a commonly used algorithm but has some critical flaws. \nThis paper addresses these limitations by proposing a new, efficient algorithm that minimizes cost-to-go while only requiring control law linearity. It demonstrates significantly lower overall costs than state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the presence of internal noise.  The authors provide both numerical and analytical solutions, thereby offering broader applicability.  This enhanced algorithm offers a refined approach for understanding how the brain's sensorimotor system efficiently operates under noisy conditions.", "affiliation": "Pompeu Fabra University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "mZHbkbYWTp/podcast.wav"}
