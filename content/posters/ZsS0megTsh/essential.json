Many methods overfit to specific low-level features in training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.  This limits their real-world applicability in scenarios with diverse forgeries and common image processing effects.\nSpeechForensics addresses these issues by utilizing the synergy between audio and visual speech.  It learns robust audio-visual speech representations from real videos using a self-supervised masked prediction task, encoding both local and global semantic information. This model is then directly applied to the forgery detection task, identifying inconsistencies between audio and visual speech in fake videos.  Experiments demonstrate that the approach significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-dataset generalization and robustness, even without training on fake videos.  **This approach showcases the effectiveness of high-level semantic learning for improving the generalization capabilities of face forgery detection systems.**", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "ZsS0megTsh/podcast.wav"}
