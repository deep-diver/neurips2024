The resolution is obtained from the default cryoSPARC workflow.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of different methods for particle picking on three datasets: Human HCN1, 70S Ribosome, and LetB.  For each dataset and method, the precision, recall, F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), and resolution of the 3D reconstruction are shown.  Higher precision, recall, and F1 scores are better, indicating more accurate particle picking. Lower resolution is better, reflecting a higher quality 3D reconstruction from accurately picked particles. The resolution is determined using the standard cryoSPARC workflow.", "section": "5.1 Particle Picking"}, {"figure_path": "u1mNGLYN74/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative comparison of denoising results.
