An arrow pointing from one concept to another indicates that the former is a subset of the latter.  The concepts shown include Nash Equilibrium (NE), Mixed Nash Equilibrium (MNE), Correlated Equilibrium (CE), Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE), Local Nash Equilibrium, and various types of \u03a6-equilibria (Finite-\u03a6, Conv(\u03a6(\u03b4)), Proj(\u03b4), Int(\u03b4)).  The dashed arrow highlights a special case where a Conv(\u03a6(\u03b4))-equilibrium is a subset of a Finite-\u03a6-equilibrium if \u03a6(\u03b4) is finite.

Given a point x and a direction vector -v, \u03a6Proj,v(x) projects x along -v until it hits the boundary of the feasible set. \u03a6Beam,v(x) moves from point x along the direction of -v to the maximum extent possible within the feasible set.
