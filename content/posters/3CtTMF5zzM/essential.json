This creates significant challenges for analyzing and predicting multi-agent interactions, especially when agent strategies are parameterized by neural networks.  Existing solution concepts like Nash equilibria may not exist, or if they do, are hard to compute due to infinite support. \nThis research focuses on a classical solution concept called \u0278-equilibria, guaranteed to exist even in non-concave games. The authors investigate the tractability of \u0278-equilibria by considering various types of strategy modifications.  They propose efficient uncoupled learning algorithms that approximate the \u0278-equilibria for finite and specific types of infinite strategy modifications, including cases with local modifications.  The algorithms\u2019 efficiency is proven theoretically, and they demonstrate the possibility of efficiently approximating \u0278-equilibria in non-trivial scenarios where traditional methods fail.", "affiliation": "Yale University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "3CtTMF5zzM/podcast.wav"}
