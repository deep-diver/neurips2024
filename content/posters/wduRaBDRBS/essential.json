Existing solutions like token dropping or sampling cause information loss.  This paper addresses this by exploring video token merging, which combines similar tokens to reduce computation.  The challenge lies in deciding which tokens to merge, as relying solely on similarity ignores token saliency.\nThe authors propose a novel learnable VTM that dynamically merges tokens based on their saliency. This approach outperforms naive token merging methods by dynamically adjusting the merging strategy based on the importance of the tokens.  Experiments on various datasets demonstrate improved accuracy and significantly reduced memory usage and increased throughput, achieving a 6.89x speedup and an 84% memory reduction. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their learnable VTM algorithm.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "wduRaBDRBS/podcast.wav"}
