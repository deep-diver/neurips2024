### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current LLM alignment techniques primarily use pairwise human preference comparisons, neglecting distributional aspects. This leads to suboptimal alignment and a lack of robustness.  The reliance on paired data also limits applicability.  Furthermore, existing methods often lack theoretical guarantees on their convergence and sample complexity. 

This paper proposes Alignment via Optimal Transport (AOT), a novel method for distributional preference alignment of LLMs.  **AOT cleverly uses optimal transport to align models on unpaired preference data**, by making the reward distribution of positive samples stochastically dominant over the negative samples. This approach, surprisingly, has a closed-form solution and demonstrates superior empirical performance compared to existing methods, especially for models of size 7B.  **The sample complexity analysis provides theoretical guarantees on the method's convergence rate.**

### In-depth insights


#### Optimal Transport
The concept of Optimal Transport (OT) is a powerful mathematical framework for measuring the distance between probability distributions.  In the context of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), OT offers a unique approach to **distributional preference alignment**. Unlike traditional methods that focus on pairwise comparisons, OT enables the direct comparison of reward distributions obtained from positive and negative samples. By formulating the alignment problem as an OT problem, the authors leverage the inherent structure of OT to **penalize the violation of first-order stochastic dominance**.  This framework offers a **smooth and convex cost function** leading to closed-form solutions and efficient fine-tuning. The use of OT in this context provides a strong theoretical grounding for distributional alignment, enabling the development of novel and effective LLM alignment strategies.  **Sample complexity analysis** is also performed, highlighting the efficiency and convergence properties of the proposed method. This innovative application of OT showcases its potential as a powerful tool for achieving robust and principled LLM alignment.

#### Distributional Alignment
Distributional alignment in LLMs seeks to move beyond pairwise comparisons of model outputs and instead focuses on aligning the entire probability distributions of model responses.  **This is a crucial step because pairwise methods only address point estimates and ignore the broader uncertainty inherent in LLM generation.**  Aligning distributions ensures that the model's outputs not only satisfy individual preferences but also maintain a consistent level of quality and safety across diverse situations.  Methods like optimal transport provide a powerful framework for achieving distributional alignment by minimizing the discrepancy between the distributions of positive and negative samples.  **The success of distributional alignment hinges on having adequate and representative datasets that capture the nuances of desired behaviors and avoiding undesirable ones.**  This approach promises more robust and generalizable alignment than pointwise methods, leading to LLMs that are less prone to unexpected or harmful outputs.

#### LLM Fine-tuning
LLM fine-tuning, as discussed in the research paper, is a crucial technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.  The paper explores various methods, particularly focusing on distributional preference alignment, contrasting it with traditional pairwise approaches. **Optimal Transport (OT)** is presented as a novel and efficient method to address the challenge of aligning reward distributions, allowing for stochastic dominance of positive samples over negative ones.  This approach offers a significant advancement by moving beyond sample-level alignment to a distributional level, leading to more robust and generalizable results.  The implementation details, including the choice of loss functions and the use of sorting or soft-sorting algorithms for computational efficiency, highlight the practicality and scalability of the proposed method. **Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance**, surpassing other alignment strategies on benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the distributional approach. The analysis of sample complexity further solidifies the theoretical foundation of the proposed method, offering insights into the generalization capabilities of the fine-tuning process.  **The study also investigates the impact of various hyperparameters**, such as batch size and loss function, providing valuable guidance for practitioners. Overall, the research significantly advances LLM fine-tuning techniques by introducing a novel, efficient, and theoretically well-founded distributional alignment approach, setting a new standard for aligning LLMs with human preferences.

#### Stochastic Dominance
The concept of stochastic dominance is crucial to the paper's methodology. It provides a **distributional comparison** of reward distributions between positive and negative samples generated by an LLM.  Instead of merely comparing average rewards (as in many previous methods), the authors use stochastic dominance to ensure the positive samples' rewards are consistently higher across all quantiles. This is a **more robust measure** of preference alignment, as it considers the entire distribution and not just the mean. **First-order stochastic dominance** is specifically employed, guaranteeing that the cumulative distribution function of positive rewards is always above that of negative rewards. This is computationally efficient to implement using a sorting-based method because the optimal transport problem simplifies due to the one-dimensional nature of the reward space.   The use of stochastic dominance is **innovative** in the context of LLM alignment, ensuring that the alignment is distributional and not merely a consequence of achieving high average reward. The strength of the proposed approach is directly linked to the strength and robustness of this distributional criterion. 

#### AOT: Unpaired Setting
The unpaired setting in Alignment via Optimal Transport (AOT) presents a significant advancement in large language model (LLM) alignment.  Unlike paired approaches that rely on comparing chosen and rejected responses for a given prompt, AOT's unpaired setting leverages separate distributions of positive and negative samples. This is crucial because **real-world preference data is rarely neatly paired**.  The method elegantly addresses this limitation by focusing on the distributional dominance of positive reward samples over negative ones. Using optimal transport, AOT ensures that the quantiles of reward distribution in positive samples are stochastically dominant over those in negative samples. This **distributional perspective provides a more robust and generalizable alignment** than pointwise comparisons. The technique's computational efficiency is enhanced by the one-dimensional optimal transport problem's closed-form solution via sorting, making it scalable for practical LLM alignment. The theoretical analysis of the AOT unpaired setting demonstrates its convergence properties, offering a strong foundation for its practical applications. The overall approach promises **more robust and efficient LLM alignment** in scenarios with unpaired or limited preference data.

> This figure shows the effect of the hyperparameter beta (Œ≤) on the performance of different LLM alignment algorithms, including AOT (paired and unpaired), KTO, DPO, and IPO.  Beta controls the divergence of the optimized LLM policy from the initial reference policy; a lower beta allows for greater divergence, while a higher beta enforces closer adherence to the reference policy. The results indicate a general trend of decreasing alignment performance as beta increases. Therefore, a default value of Œ≤ = 0.01 was selected for subsequent experiments. The plot displays the AlpacaEval (Llama3-70B) scores for each algorithm across different beta values.
