This can result in a selection bias, especially in medical practice. For example, patients with a more severe health state will also receive a more aggressive treatment. As a result, when treatment $A$ is selected based on the covariates $X$ , the propensity score $\\pi(X)$ is not constant, implying that the distributions of covariates in treatment and control groups differ. Formally, we have a distribution shift in the covariates, i.e., $p(X\\mid A=0)\\neq p(X\\mid A=1)$ . If not adjusted for, this distribution shift may result in a selection bias and thus an inflated variance in the estimates of POs (and thus the causal effects), especially in low-sample settings [12, 29, 54].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
