Existing methods often localize each time point independently, neglecting temporal relationships between observations. This can lead to inaccurate and unreliable estimations, especially in complex scenes with many similar-looking landmarks.  Learnable particle filters have shown promise for global localization but have been primarily limited to simulations or simplified real-world scenarios.  Additionally, most methods only use past observations. \nThis paper introduces MDPS, a new differentiable particle smoother that overcomes these limitations. **MDPS integrates forward and backward particle streams, leveraging both past and future observations for more accurate state estimation.**  The method uses stratified resampling to provide low-variance gradient estimates, enabling effective end-to-end training of neural network dynamics and observation models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of MDPS compared to state-of-the-art methods and search-based baselines, showcasing its potential for applications in various fields.", "affiliation": "UC Irvine", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "WdMhbqCoqW/podcast.wav"}
