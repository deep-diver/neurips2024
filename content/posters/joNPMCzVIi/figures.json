Subplots (a) through (e) illustrate the impact of different hyperparameters (number of tasks (m), number of concurrent tasks (L), hyperparameter \u03c3q, hyperparameter \u03c3\u03bf, and noise standard deviation \u03c3) on the cumulative regret of the HierTS algorithm.  These plots demonstrate how the regret changes as each hyperparameter is varied, holding the others constant. Subplot (f) compares the performance of HierTS against other algorithms (OracleTS, TS, HierBayesUCB) under a specific hyperparameter configuration, providing a benchmark comparison.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "joNPMCzVIi/figures/figures_28_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Regrets of HierTS algorithm with respect to (w.r.t.) different hyper-parameters.", "description": "This figure shows the results of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the HierTS algorithm under various hyperparameter settings.
