Existing algorithms, like HierTS, offered regret bounds that were not optimal.  The problem is that these existing algorithms do not sufficiently exploit shared information between the tasks and are thus not efficient in practice. This paper addresses this issue by refining the analysis of existing algorithms and proposing a novel algorithm, HierBayesUCB, designed for the multi-task setting.\nThis paper improves existing Bayes regret bounds, particularly for HierTS (reducing the bound from O(m\u221an log n log (mn)) to O(m\u221an log n) for infinite action settings). For finite action settings, it introduces HierBayesUCB, achieving a logarithmic regret bound.  The algorithms are then extended to combinatorial semi-bandit settings, providing improved bounds.  Empirical results validate the theoretical findings, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness of these improved algorithms.  The results have important implications for applications using multi-task bandit learning.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "joNPMCzVIi/podcast.wav"}
