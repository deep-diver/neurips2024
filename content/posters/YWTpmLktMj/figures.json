[{"figure_path": "YWTpmLktMj/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Depiction of variables L and functions R which model transductive learning, for a sequence of unlabeled datapoints |S| = 3 such that H|s contains the behaviors (0,0,0), (1, 0, 0), and (0,1,0). Arrows denote functional dependence, i.e., each r\u2208 R depends upon its incident variables.", "description": "This figure shows a bipartite graph representing the variables and functions in a transductive learning model. The left side (L) represents variables that can take values in the label space Y. The right side (R) represents functions, each of which depends on a subset of the variables and outputs a value in R\u22650. The edges indicate the dependencies between the variables and the functions.  The example demonstrates a case with 3 unlabeled data points, leading to a specific set of possible hypothesis behaviors.", "section": "3.1 Realizable Learning With Proper Loss Functions"}]
