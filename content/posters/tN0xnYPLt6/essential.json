This is because the LUT size increases exponentially with the convolution kernel size, making it impractical to deploy complex models on such devices.  Existing solutions, while improving accuracy, fail to mitigate this storage issue sufficiently.\n\nTinyLUT introduces an innovative solution by employing a separable mapping strategy, decoupling the kernel and activation to transform the storage from exponential to linear dependence on kernel size.  Furthermore, it incorporates a dynamic discretization mechanism to further reduce storage. This combined approach leads to a dramatic reduction in LUT storage\u2014over 7x from separable mapping and an additional 4.48x from dynamic discretization\u2014while maintaining accuracy comparable to or exceeding existing methods and significantly reducing inference latency.  The result is efficient image restoration even on low-power edge devices.", "affiliation": "School of Integrated Circuits, Xidian University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "tN0xnYPLt6/podcast.wav"}
