### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many scientific fields rely on the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing.  This is critical in applications where false positives are costly. However, this paper investigates whether BH is robust against adversarial attacks, where an attacker may try to manipulate data or the testing process to produce undesired outcomes.

The researchers found that BH's FDR control can be significantly compromised by relatively few test score perturbations. They introduced a class of easily implementable adversarial algorithms that can break BH's FDR control. The analysis connects the BH procedure to a "balls into bins" process, facilitating a new information-theoretic approach for analyzing the adversary's effect.  **The paper provides non-asymptotic guarantees on how much the FDR is affected by these adversarial attacks and shows through simulations that this impact can be substantial.**

### In-depth insights


#### BH's Adversarial Weakness
The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, while robust in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) under various distributional assumptions, exhibits significant vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.  **The core weakness lies in its reliance on the ordering of p-values.**  A small number of strategically perturbed p-values can drastically inflate the FDR, effectively breaking BH's control.  This is especially true when the alternative distributions are not strongly separated from the null distribution. The authors demonstrate that this adversarial vulnerability isn't just a theoretical concern; they present algorithms that empirically showcase this susceptibility with both synthetic and real-world data, highlighting the **importance of considering adversarial robustness when relying on BH for critical safety and security applications.** The research underscores the need for developing more robust multiple testing procedures capable of withstanding intentional data manipulation.

#### INCREASE-c Algorithm
The INCREASE-c algorithm, designed for adversarial attacks against the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing procedure, strategically perturbs c null p-values to inflate the false discovery rate (FDR).  Its core mechanism involves identifying a stopping time k, representing the BH procedure's rejection count, and increasing it by at least c.  **The algorithm's effectiveness hinges on the distribution of alternative p-values:** when alternatives are highly sub-uniform (concentrated near 0), the impact is minimal because BH already rejects many of them. However, **when alternatives are less sub-uniform, or close to uniform, the INCREASE-c algorithm can significantly break BH's FDR control, even with few perturbations.** The algorithm's simplicity and effectiveness, particularly in situations where alternatives are barely dominated by the null distribution, highlights a vulnerability in the BH procedure's robustness against adversarial manipulations. The algorithm provides a practical demonstration of how easily a seemingly robust statistical procedure can be compromised when subjected to cleverly designed attacks.

#### FDR Control Limits
The concept of 'FDR Control Limits' in multiple hypothesis testing revolves around **setting boundaries for the acceptable rate of false discoveries**.  The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a crucial metric, representing the expected proportion of false positives among all rejected null hypotheses.  Establishing these limits is paramount, as it directly impacts the reliability and validity of the results. **Setting limits too leniently can inflate the FDR, leading to an unacceptably high number of false positives**. Conversely, **limits that are too stringent might lead to an excessive number of false negatives**, thus potentially missing true discoveries.  Therefore, the determination of optimal FDR control limits involves a careful balance between these two extremes, often guided by the specific context and the associated risks and costs associated with making incorrect conclusions. The choice of these limits often depends on **predefined thresholds**, **statistical power considerations**, and the **overall goal** of the research.  A deeper analysis of the procedure employed and its underlying assumptions (statistical dependence, distributions) is necessary to gauge the effectiveness of the FDR control and determine the reliability of the conclusions drawn.

#### Synthetic Data Tests
Synthetic data tests are crucial for evaluating the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, especially in scenarios with limited real-world data.  These tests allow researchers to systematically assess model performance under controlled conditions, manipulating various aspects of the data to understand their impact on the model's predictions. **A key advantage is the ability to generate data sets with specific characteristics**, including carefully controlled levels of noise, outliers, and adversarial examples, which enables targeted investigations of model vulnerabilities.  **Well-designed synthetic tests can highlight weaknesses** that might be missed or obscured in real-world data analysis due to confounding variables or insufficient data volume. However, a **critical consideration is the representativeness of the synthetic data to the real-world phenomenon**. If the synthetic data generation process doesn't accurately capture the essential characteristics of real data, the resulting analysis may lead to misleading conclusions.  Therefore, rigorous validation and comparison of model performance across synthetic and real-world datasets are essential to ensure that findings obtained using synthetic data tests are meaningful and applicable in practice.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **extensions to more complex adversarial models**.  The current analysis focuses on an omniscient adversary; investigating the robustness of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure against more realistic adversaries with limited knowledge or computational power would be valuable.  Additionally, the study could be **expanded to other multiple testing procedures**, such as those based on different error rates or handling different dependency structures, to determine the extent to which adversarial vulnerabilities are common to various approaches.  Further research could also delve into **mitigation strategies**, developing methods to enhance the adversarial robustness of multiple testing procedures or designing robust alternatives. A promising direction is to analyze how various data preprocessing or regularization techniques affect adversarial resilience.  Finally, **empirical studies on diverse real-world datasets** across multiple domains are critical for validating theoretical findings and guiding the development of practically effective methods for safeguarding hypothesis testing against adversarial attacks.

The conformal p-values used were derived from a one-class SVM classifier on a test set containing outliers. The parameter 'a' controls the level of separation between the inliers and outliers, with a=1.5 indicating a moderate level of separation.  The x-axis represents FDP before applying INCREASE-5, and the y-axis represents FDP after applying INCREASE-5. Each point represents a single simulation, and the color intensity reflects the frequency of observations in that region. The black line represents the theoretical FDR control level (0.1).  The plot shows that INCREASE-5 significantly increases the FDP in many simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in breaking the FDR control of BHq even with relatively simple adversarial perturbations.
