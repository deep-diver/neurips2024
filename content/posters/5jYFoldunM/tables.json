It shows the average false detection proportion (FDP) before and after applying the INCREASE-c algorithm with different values of c (corruption budget).  The table also displays the average number of alleged frauds before and after the adversarial attack.  The results illustrate how INCREASE-c can increase the FDR (false discovery rate) beyond the control level.", "section": "5.2 Real-Data Experiment: Credit Card Fraud Detection"}, {"figure_path": "5jYFoldunM/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Sample Average (104-batch) estimates of EzFDP[BHq;z'] under MOVE-1 and INCREASE-1 (in parentheses) when \u03bc\u2081 = 0,1,2 and N = 103, q = 0.10, \u03c0\u03bf = 0.90, and all \u03c3\u00b2 = 1.", "description": "This table compares the average performance of the optimal algorithm MOVE-1 and the INCREASE-1 algorithm.  It shows the average estimated false discovery proportion (FDP) under both algorithms,  across 104 simulation batches, for three different values of \u03bc\u2081 (1, 2, and 0).  The table also reports the average distance between the original z-scores and the perturbed z-scores under each algorithm.  It demonstrates that INCREASE-1 achieves nearly identical performance to MOVE-1 in terms of FDP adjustment; however, the perturbation distance is larger for INCREASE-1 on average.", "section": "7.2 MOVE-1"}]
