{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in statistics, machine learning, and related fields because it **highlights a vulnerability in a widely-used statistical method** (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure).  This vulnerability is particularly relevant in safety-critical applications where false positives are costly. The findings necessitate a **re-evaluation of the method's reliability in adversarial environments**, and provide researchers with new tools to assess and enhance the robustness of their statistical methods, including novel perturbation algorithms.", "summary": "Even a few data changes can break the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, a widely used multiple testing method, highlighting a critical vulnerability.", "takeaways": ["The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, commonly used in multiple hypothesis testing, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks.", "Simple, effective adversarial algorithms can significantly increase the false discovery rate (FDR) of BH.", "The study provides theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrating the vulnerability of BH under various conditions."], "tldr": "Many scientific fields rely on the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing.  This is critical in applications where false positives are costly. However, this paper investigates whether BH is robust against adversarial attacks, where an attacker may try to manipulate data or the testing process to produce undesired outcomes.\nThe researchers found that BH's FDR control can be significantly compromised by relatively few test score perturbations. They introduced a class of easily implementable adversarial algorithms that can break BH's FDR control. The analysis connects the BH procedure to a \"balls into bins\" process, facilitating a new information-theoretic approach for analyzing the adversary's effect.  **The paper provides non-asymptotic guarantees on how much the FDR is affected by these adversarial attacks and shows through simulations that this impact can be substantial.**", "affiliation": "Operations Research Department Naval Postgraduate School", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "5jYFoldunM/podcast.wav"}
