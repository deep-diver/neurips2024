Existing methods often struggle due to limitations in learning highly multi-modal mappings and conservatism, making it difficult to find optimal solutions.  Many methods focus on generating a single design from the data, limiting the potential for exploration of the design space.  This hinders the ability to generate high-performing designs that lie beyond the scope of the initial dataset. \nThis paper introduces Guided Trajectory Generation (GTG), which tackles these problems by using a conditional diffusion model to generate a sequence of designs towards high-scoring regions.  The model is trained on synthetic trajectories created from the original data by injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. By combining this trajectory generation with classifier-free guidance, GTG efficiently explores the design space and discovers high-scoring solutions, even beyond the original dataset. This novel approach significantly improves upon existing methods, setting a new standard for effectiveness in offline MBO.", "affiliation": "Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ioKQzb8SMr/podcast.wav"}
