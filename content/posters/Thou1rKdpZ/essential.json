While previous research focused on linear self-attention models, their limitations in handling scenarios with shared signals among tasks remained unaddressed. This paper explores these shortcomings in ICL of linear regression tasks, showing that the existing models incur irreducible errors.\nThis research introduces the Linear Transformer Block (LTB), demonstrating that it significantly improves ICL performance by implementing one-step gradient descent with learnable initialization. The study highlights the crucial role of the MLP component in reducing approximation errors and achieving near-optimal ICL, even when tasks share a common signal.  The findings provide valuable insights into how Transformers perform ICL and suggest new avenues for optimization and model improvement.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Thou1rKdpZ/podcast.wav"}
