### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but their training data is often opaque, hindering the assessment of their biases and vulnerabilities. This paper tackles this issue by focusing on a previously underutilized source of information: the byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer.  These tokenizers are used by most LLMs to break down text into smaller units;  the researchers found that the order in which the tokenizer merges these units reveals patterns related to data frequencies. 

The authors developed a method that uses these patterns along with some sample data to estimate the proportions of different types of data within the LLM's training set.  They tested their method on several publicly available tokenizers, uncovering new information such as the significant multilingual composition of some models' training data and the unexpected prevalence of code in the training of others. Their approach provides a new way to analyze and understand the hidden properties of LLMs' training data.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial because **it introduces a novel method to infer the composition of language models' training data** which is typically kept secret by developers. This opens avenues for research into data bias, model vulnerabilities, and the overall design choices in creating these models.  Understanding training data is **key for evaluating and improving the reliability and safety of language models**, a growing concern in the AI research community.

Two BPE tokenizers are trained on different ratios of English and Python code. The figure shows how the order of merge rules learned by the BPE algorithm directly reflects the proportion of each language in the training data.

During training, the BPE algorithm iteratively finds the pair of tokens with the highest frequency in the training data, adds it to the merge list, then applies it to the dataset before finding the next highest-frequency pair. To encode text at inference time, the learned merge rules are applied in order. The resulting order of merge rules is extremely sensitive to the proportion of different data categories present. Our goal is to solve for these proportions, a task which we call data mixture inference.

### In-depth insights


#### BPE Tokenizer Attacks
The concept of "BPE Tokenizer Attacks" revolves around exploiting the inherent properties of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers to infer the composition of training data used for large language models (LLMs).  **BPE tokenizers, a crucial component in many LLMs, learn merge rules based on the frequency of token pairs in the training data.**  This ordered list of merge rules serves as a hidden signature reflecting the data's statistical properties.  An attack leverages this by formulating a linear program that estimates the proportions of different data categories (languages, code, domains, etc.) present in the training set, given the tokenizer's merge rules and sample data representing each category.  **The attack's effectiveness lies in its ability to recover mixture ratios with remarkable precision**, even for tokenizers trained on diverse and complex mixtures of data sources.  Therefore, analysis of these merge rules presents **a novel and effective approach to gain insight into the often opaque training data of LLMs**, which could have significant implications for understanding model behavior, assessing biases, and evaluating the representativeness of the training data itself.

#### Data Mixture Inference
The concept of 'Data Mixture Inference' in the context of large language models (LLMs) centers on **deconstructing the composition of training datasets**.  It's a significant area of research because the exact makeup of LLM training data is often proprietary and opaque.  This lack of transparency hinders efforts to understand model behavior, identify biases, and assess potential risks.  Methods for data mixture inference aim to estimate the proportions of various data types (e.g., languages, code, domains) present in the training data by analyzing readily available artifacts, such as the model's tokenizer.  **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers**, commonly used in LLMs, offer a unique avenue for this analysis because the order in which they merge byte pairs reflects the frequency of those pairs in the training data.  By carefully analyzing this 'merge list' and comparing it to known data distributions, researchers can infer the mixture ratios within the training data with surprisingly high accuracy. This is a **powerful technique** for shedding light on the often hidden ingredients driving LLM performance and characteristics.

#### Linear Program Solver
A linear program solver is a crucial component in the proposed data mixture inference attack.  The core idea is to formulate the problem of estimating the proportions of different data categories in a tokenizer's training set as a linear program.  **The constraints of this linear program are derived directly from the ordered list of merge rules produced by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm.**  Each merge rule represents the most frequent token pair at a specific stage of the training process; this information is used to create inequalities that constrain the possible proportions of data categories.  **The objective function of the linear program is to minimize the total constraint violations**, effectively finding the mixture proportions that best match the observed merge rule ordering.  The choice of solver will depend on the scale of the problem; for large-scale tasks, specialized solvers with techniques like simultaneous delayed row/column generation might be necessary to manage computational costs and complexity effectively. **The solution to the linear program yields estimates of the proportions of different data categories present in the original training data.** This approach leverages the subtle yet informative nature of the merge rule ordering within the BPE tokenizer to infer properties of the data used for training, allowing for analysis of the data composition of language models.

#### Commercial Tokenizers
The section on 'Commercial Tokenizers' presents a crucial empirical evaluation of the proposed data mixture inference attack.  The authors apply their method to several widely-used commercial language model tokenizers, **revealing insights into the composition of their training datasets that were previously unknown or only vaguely understood.** This analysis goes beyond simply verifying known information; instead, it provides quantitative estimates of the proportions of different languages and data types (code, books, web data) present in the training data. **The results confirm some existing intuitions (e.g., GPT-3.5's reliance on code) but also offer surprising new findings** (e.g., the unexpected multilingualism of GPT-40 and MISTRAL NEMO). This real-world application of their method effectively demonstrates its power and utility in understanding the opaque nature of LLM training data, raising important questions about the design choices made by model developers and the implications for future model transparency and safety.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this data mixture inference work could focus on several key areas.  **Improving the robustness of the attack** against various data distribution shifts and unaccounted-for data categories is crucial. This could involve developing more sophisticated linear programming techniques or incorporating additional information sources beyond BPE tokenizer merge rules.  **Exploring alternative tokenizer architectures** and investigating whether similar inference attacks can be mounted against them would broaden the applicability and implications of this research.  **Extending the attack to encompass other model properties** such as model weights or activations would provide a more holistic view of training data influence.  Finally, **developing effective defenses against these types of attacks** is vital for responsible language model development and deployment. This could involve designing new tokenization methods or incorporating data obfuscation techniques into the training process.  Ultimately, the goal should be to encourage a balanced approach that allows for insights into training data composition while mitigating potential vulnerabilities.

Each constraint reflects the most frequent pair at each step. Solving the linear program estimates the proportion of each language in the original training data.

The encoding efficiency is calculated as the ratio of bytes to tokens, normalized against a tokenizer trained solely on that language.  While higher proportions generally correlate with greater efficiency, the relationship isn't strong enough to accurately predict language proportions in the training data, unlike the approach presented in the paper. The figure highlights the superior accuracy of the proposed attack compared to a baseline approach that uses encoding efficiency.

The encoding efficiency is defined as the byte-to-token ratio of a given tokenizer on a given language, normalized by that of a tokenizer trained only on that language. While more training data leads to better encoding efficiency, the correlation is not strong enough to recover a prediction nearly as precise as our attack. A baseline based on this relationship achieves log10 MSE of -2.22, compared to our attack's -7.66.
