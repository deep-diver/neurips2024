However, research in this area has been limited by the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available datasets and the inadequacy of existing models, which often only consider limited factors. This has led to suboptimal performance in handling complex and dynamic traffic scenarios. \nThis research addresses these limitations by introducing a new large-scale dataset called TOI, which provides a substantial increase in the volume of data compared to existing datasets.  Moreover, the paper proposes a novel model that integrates multi-fold top-down guidance (driver intention, semantic context, traffic rules) with bottom-up visual features.  This innovative approach allows the model to more effectively handle the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this new model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving a 23.1% improvement in average precision.", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, Chongqing University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "xvTMc9Ovx3/podcast.wav"}
