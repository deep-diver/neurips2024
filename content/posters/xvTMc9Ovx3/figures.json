(a) Driver Intention: Shows that objects which risk colliding with the ego-car's intended driving path or are located on this path, are considered more important. (b) Semantic Context: Highlights that objects in drivable areas are generally deemed more important than those outside. (c) Traffic Rule: Demonstrates that the presence of a lane marking between the ego-car and an oncoming vehicle can influence importance, with an oncoming vehicle deemed less important if a lane marking separates them. The image uses red boxes to indicate important objects and green boxes for less important ones.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "xvTMc9Ovx3/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overview of multi-fold top-down guidance aware model.", "description": "This figure presents a detailed overview of the proposed model architecture for multi-fold top-down guidance aware object importance estimation. It illustrates the flow of information processing through various modules, starting from video input and ego-car velocity information. The model integrates bottom-up feature extraction with multiple top-down guidance factors such as driver intention, semantic context, and traffic rules.  Key modules shown are: Object Feature Extraction, Driver Intention and Semantics Guidance, Traffic Rule Guidance, and Object Importance Estimation.  The diagram showcases the interplay between bottom-up and top-down pathways in determining object importance.", "section": "4 Approach"}, {"figure_path": "xvTMc9Ovx3/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The crucial factors considered by human drivers when estimating on-road object importance.", "description": "This figure shows three crucial factors considered by human drivers when estimating on-road object importance.  These are driver intention (a), semantic context (b), and traffic rules (c).  (a) shows that objects that are close to the driver's intended path or that pose a collision risk are considered more important. (b) illustrates how the context of the entire scene influences the importance of objects - objects in drivable areas are considered more significant than those in undrivable areas. Finally (c) demonstrates the role of traffic rules: the presence of lane markings between the ego-vehicle and an oncoming vehicle, for example, decreases the perceived importance of the oncoming vehicle.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "xvTMc9Ovx3/figures/figures_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Qualitative comparison with baselines (i.e., Goal (8), Ohn-Bar (33), and Zhang (50)).

Red boxes highlight objects deemed important by the model, while green boxes indicate unimportant objects.  The ground truth (GT) is also shown for comparison.  Four different driving scenarios are visualized to showcase the models' ability to handle various conditions.", "section": "B Additional Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "xvTMc9Ovx3/figures/figures_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Visualization of object-lane interaction weighting.", "description": "This figure visualizes the output of object-lane interaction weighting (pc in equation 13). Objects with blue masks are penalized (object-lane interaction is disabled, pc=a), while objects with yellow masks are not penalized (object-lane interaction is enabled, pc=1).  The examples show how the weighting mechanism considers the relevance of lane markings to object importance. Static cars on roadsides are penalized because they have weak interaction with lanes. In contrast, oncoming cars and the car in the current lane are not penalized because they show strong interaction with lanes. Note that the yellow mask does not indicate object importance; instead it indicates whether object-lane interaction is enabled.", "section": "4.4 Traffic Rule Guidance"}]
