Solutions to this multi-video generation problem could enable large-scale 3D scene generation with editable camera trajectories, among other applications. We introduce collaborative video diffusion (CVD) as an important step towards this vision. The CVD framework includes a novel cross-video synchronization module that promotes consistency between corresponding frames of the same video rendered from different camera poses using an epipolar attention mechanism. Trained on top of a state-of-the-art camera-control module for video generation, CVD generates multiple videos rendered from different camera trajectories with significantly better consistency than baselines, as shown in extensive experiments.

Recent models like SORA [7] exhibit the ability to generate long highquality videos with complex dynamics. Yet, these methods typically leverage text or image inputs to control the generation process and lack precise control over content and motion, which is essential for practical applications. Prior efforts explore the use of other input modalities, such as flow, keypoints, and depths, and develop novel control modules to incorporate these conditions effectively, enabling precise guidance of the generated contents [60, 63, 67, 26, 56, 9].

However, these methods are limited to single-camera trajectories, leading to significant inconsistencies in content and dynamics when generating multiple videos of the same scene from different camera trajectories. Consistent multi-video generation with camera control is desirable in many downstream applications, such as large-scale 3D scene generation.

Specifically, we first generate 1000 videos from randomly sampled camera trajectory pairs (two camera trajectories with the same starting transformation) and text captions. All baselines generate one video at a time; our model generates two videos simultaneously. For each generated video, we apply the state-of-the-art image matching algorithm SuperGlue [47] to extract the correspondences between its first frame and following frames and estimate their relative camera poses using the RANSAC [13, 42] algorithm. To evaluate the quality of correspondences and estimated camera poses, we adopt the same protocol from SuperGlue [47], which 1) evaluates the poses by the angle error of their rotation and translation and 2) evaluates the matched correspondences by their epipolar error (i.e., the distance to the ground truth epipolar line).

To the best of our knowledge, there is no available large video diffusion model that is designed to generate multi-view consistent videos for generic scenes. Hence, we modify the CameraCtrl [18] and MotionCtrl [60] to generate video pairs as baselines. Here, we use the text-to-video version of each model to generate a reference video first, then take its first frame as the input of their image-to-video version (i.e., their combination with SparseCtrl [16] and SVD [5]) to derive the second video.

Following the standard practice of prior works [17, 61, 29, 9, 10, 8], we report CLIP [41] embedding similarity between 1) each frame of the output video and the corresponding input prompt and 2) pairs of frames across video pairs. The former metric, denoted as CLIP-T, is to show that our model does not destroy the appearance/content prior of our base model, and the latter, denoted as CLIP-F, is aimed to show that the cross-view module can improve the semantic and structural consistency between the generated video pair. For these purposes, we randomly sample 1000 videos using camera trajectory pairs from RealEstate10K, along with text captions from WebVid10M (2000 videos generated in total). To further demonstrate our method\u2019s ability to maintain high-fidelity generation contents, we report FID [20] and KID [4] $\\times100$ using the implementation [38], and FVD [57]. We do not compare against models that do not share the same base model as us for FID [20], KID [4] and FVD [57], since these metrics are strongly influenced by the abilities of the base models. Following prior work [18], we evaluate these two metrics on RealEstate10k [68] because of the strong undesired bias, e.g., watermarks, on WebVid10M [1]. As shown in Tab. 2, our model surpasses all baselines for the CLIP [41]-based metrics. This proves our model\u2019s ability to synthesize collaborative videos that share a scene while maintaining and improving fidelity according to the prompt.

The ablation study indicates that while we can get semantically consistent outputs without epipolar constraints, they are essential to gain geometrical consistency. We also observe that the mixed training strategy and homography augmentation greatly improve all metrics, including semantic consistency, further verifying their purpose of closing the gap between static training scenes and desired dynamic outputs. We believe there are two reasons why our full model outperforms the model trained on RealEstate10K [68]. The first reason is our epipolar attention design. In the WebVid10M [1] training stage, while there are no camera poses available, we use pseudo-gt epipolar lines (i.e. lines calculated from homography matrix H. The line of pixel x in the warped frame goes through the pixel Hx) to describe the spatial relationship between video frames. This enhances the model\u2019s ability to generate videos that satisfy the given line conditions. Hence, in a camera-control setting, the full model is more constrained to the epipolar lines and generates videos that align better with the camera poses. Secondly, since RealEstate10K [68] mostly consists of static indoor scenes, models trained on RealEstate10K [68] may suffer from data bias and may not perform well on general scenes, thus resulting in poor evaluation performance in this experiment.

The core innovation of CVD is its utilization of epipolar geometry, derived from reconstruction pipelines, as a constraint. This geometric framework fine-tunes a pre-trained video diffusion model. The training process is enhanced by integrating dynamic, single-view, in-the-wild videos to maintain a diverse range of motion patterns. During inference, CVD employs a multi-view sampling strategy to facilitate efficient information sharing across videos, resulting in a \"collaborative diffusion\" effect for unified video output. To our knowledge, CVD represents the first approach to tackle the complexities of multi-view or multi-trajectory video synthesis.

As a result, issues such as uncanny shape shifting and dynamic inconsistencies that are presented in the base models may persist, affecting the overall consistency across the video outputs.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
