### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Generating high-quality videos from various viewpoints is a challenge in current video generation models. Existing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across different camera angles, resulting in inconsistencies in the content and dynamics. This limits the applicability of video generation in many downstream tasks requiring consistent multi-view videos, such as large-scale 3D scene generation and virtual reality.

This paper introduces Collaborative Video Diffusion (CVD), a novel framework that addresses this issue. **CVD uses a novel cross-video synchronization module that leverages epipolar attention to maintain consistency across videos.**  The model is trained on video pairs with individually controllable camera trajectories and then extended to generate an arbitrary number of videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate CVD's superior performance in generating high-quality and consistent multi-view videos compared to existing baselines.

> This figure illustrates the difference between conventional video generation and collaborative video diffusion.  Conventional methods generate videos independently, leading to inconsistencies in content and dynamics across videos.  Collaborative video diffusion, on the other hand, generates videos with shared underlying content, ensuring consistency despite different camera angles. The figure shows how this approach can be scaled from pairs of videos to multiple videos.

> This table presents a quantitative comparison of different video generation models in terms of geometry consistency.  It uses the SuperGlue metric to assess the accuracy of predicted camera rotations and translations, evaluating performance across various error thresholds.  The models are tested on two datasets: RealEstate10K (static scenes) and WebVid10M (dynamic scenes), with SuperGlue scores calculated for the original RealEstate10K frames as a reference.  The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on all metrics.





### In-depth insights


#### CVD Framework
The CVD framework, as implied by its name, centers on **collaborative video diffusion**.  It tackles the challenge of generating multiple videos of the same scene from diverse camera viewpoints while maintaining high consistency.  This is achieved through a novel **cross-video synchronization module**, leveraging an epipolar attention mechanism to align corresponding frames across different views. **This module promotes consistency in geometry and semantics** by focusing on epipolar relationships between pixels, enhancing structural coherence. A **hybrid training strategy** employing both static and dynamic datasets further boosts performance. The framework is designed for scalability, extending beyond pairs of videos to handle multiple video generation using a collaborative inference approach. Overall, the CVD framework presents a significant advancement in multi-view video generation, surpassing limitations of existing single-view techniques by explicitly addressing the need for cross-video consistency and achieving highly coherent multi-video outputs.

#### Cross-View Sync
A crucial aspect of multi-view video generation is ensuring consistency across different viewpoints.  A module focused on 'Cross-View Synchronization' would be essential for achieving this.  The core challenge lies in aligning features and ensuring that the generated videos share the same underlying content and dynamics, despite originating from disparate camera perspectives. **Effective cross-view synchronization necessitates a mechanism to bridge the gap between distinct views and establish correspondences between frames from various viewpoints.** This might involve techniques such as epipolar geometry, where the geometric relationships between corresponding points in different images are leveraged to establish pixel-level correspondence. Another approach could utilize attention mechanisms, where the model is trained to attend to relevant features in other views based on context. **Advanced architectures could incorporate learned feature embeddings, capturing semantic relationships across views, beyond simple geometric alignment.** Successfully synchronizing multiple views requires careful consideration of the training process as well, and employing a dataset comprising multiple synchronized views, or developing smart data augmentation techniques, would be paramount for effective learning.  Ultimately, the effectiveness of cross-view synchronization hinges on the ability to achieve robust feature alignment while maintaining both geometric and semantic consistency, creating videos that appear as though they were captured simultaneously from multiple positions within a shared 3D scene.

#### Hybrid Training
The hybrid training strategy is a **key innovation** enabling the model to learn from diverse data sources, overcoming limitations of existing datasets.  By combining static, multi-view data from RealEstate10k with dynamic monocular data from WebVid10M, the model effectively learns camera control and motion, addressing the scarcity of large-scale, multi-view dynamic scene data.  **This two-phase approach** leverages the strengths of each dataset: RealEstate10k provides geometric consistency and camera pose information, while WebVid10M offers rich dynamic content. This hybrid strategy is **crucial for generating multi-view videos with consistent content and motion**, a task significantly hindered by the absence of comprehensive training data.  The model's capability to seamlessly integrate data from these disparate sources demonstrates its robust learning capacity and adaptability.

#### Multi-View Inference
Multi-view inference, in the context of video generation, presents a significant challenge and opportunity.  The goal is to generate consistent video content from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, requiring sophisticated coordination between individual video streams.  **Successful multi-view inference necessitates a model's ability to understand and maintain scene consistency across different perspectives.** This implies a deep understanding of 3D scene geometry, object interactions, and camera movements.  A key aspect is dealing with the inherent ambiguity of multiple viewpoints, where occlusion and perspective differences can lead to inconsistencies.  **Effective techniques may involve cross-view attention mechanisms or epipolar geometry constraints to ensure consistent geometry and semantics**. The availability of training data poses a major hurdle, as large-scale multi-view datasets are scarce. **Clever data augmentation strategies, such as utilizing existing monocular data in conjunction with novel methods for pseudo-view generation, are important for addressing this shortage**. Multi-view inference promises advancements in large-scale 3D scene generation, novel-view synthesis, and other applications demanding consistent multi-perspective content.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Extending CVD to handle more complex scene dynamics and longer video sequences** is crucial for broader applicability.  This might involve investigating more sophisticated temporal modeling techniques or incorporating additional conditioning signals beyond camera poses and text prompts. Another direction would be **improving the efficiency and scalability of CVD**, potentially through architectural optimizations or leveraging more efficient training strategies.  The current model relies on paired videos; developing techniques to generate consistent multi-view videos from a single source or fewer inputs would significantly increase usability.  Additionally, **exploring the use of CVD in applications beyond video generation** warrants further exploration. The model‚Äôs ability to generate consistent content across multiple viewpoints opens up exciting possibilities in large-scale 3D scene reconstruction, virtual reality, and other domains. Finally, while the model demonstrates strong performance, **a more comprehensive analysis of its limitations and failure modes** is needed to better understand its capabilities and limitations.  Addressing these points will significantly improve and expand the utility of CVD.

> This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed CVD model against several baselines across various metrics.  The metrics are grouped into two categories: semantic consistency (CLIP-T and CLIP-F) and fidelity (FID, KID, and FVD). CLIP-T measures the similarity between the generated videos and the input text prompts, assessing the semantic consistency of the generated content.
