For each method, it shows the win rate (percentage of times the method's response was better than the opponent's), lose rate (percentage of times it was worse), and tie rate (percentage of times they were equally good).  The \u0394 column represents the difference between the win rate and lose rate, indicating the overall superiority of one method over another. A larger positive \u0394 indicates a more significant performance advantage.", "section": "5.3 ADVPO results in an improved policy"}, {"figure_path": "kYio3xH6eb/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Pearson correlation between the estimated uncertainty and the reward differences.", "description": "This table presents the Pearson correlation coefficients between the estimated uncertainty and the reward differences for three different methods: CI (the proposed lightweight uncertainty estimation method), ENS-7B (ensemble of three LLama 7B reward models), and ENS-3B (ensemble of three 3B reward models).  The correlation is calculated separately for the Anthropic HH and TL;DR datasets.  Higher positive correlations indicate a stronger relationship between uncertainty and the magnitude of reward differences.", "section": "5.1 Empirical effectiveness of lightweight uncertainty estimation"}]
