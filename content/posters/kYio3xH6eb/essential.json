This happens because the reward model, used as a proxy for human feedback, is imperfect, leading to LLMs exploiting flaws in the reward model instead of truly aligning with human values.  Existing solutions often involve training multiple reward models which is computationally expensive. \nThis paper introduces ADVPO, which uses a **lightweight uncertainty quantification method** to estimate the reliability of the reward model using only its last-layer embeddings. This efficient method is incorporated into ADVPO, a novel **distributionally robust optimization procedure** that mitigates overoptimization.  Experiments showed that ADVPO significantly improves the performance of LLMs in aligning with human values compared to existing methods on the Anthropic HH and TL;DR summarization datasets. The method is more efficient than existing solutions and has theoretical backing.", "affiliation": "ByteDance Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "kYio3xH6eb/podcast.wav"}
