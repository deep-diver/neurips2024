It shows the results for several metrics (NDCG, Recall, Top@20, Top@100) across three different memory settings (11GB, 24GB, and 80GB).  The methods compared include DPR, GradAccum, GradCache, and the proposed CONTACCUM.  The table highlights the best performance achieved in each setting and indicates when a method surpasses the performance of the original DPR method in the high-resource setting.
