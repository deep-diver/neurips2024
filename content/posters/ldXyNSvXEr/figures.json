The results show that the proposed method consistently yields a shorter prediction interval than the weighted conformal prediction while maintaining adequate coverage.  The figure also includes a table summarizing the average and median width for various maximum depths of the prediction interval in each method. These results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively balances coverage and width, especially as the model complexity (depth) increases.", "section": "5 Application"}, {"figure_path": "ldXyNSvXEr/figures/figures_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Experiments on real estate data", "description": "This figure shows the histograms of coverage and average bandwidth for three different methods: the proposed method, weighted quantile conformal, and weighted variance-adjusted conformal methods.

The figure displays histograms of bandwidth and coverage for four different methods: the proposed method (with and without optimal transport), Weighted Quantile Conformal, and Weighted Variance-Adjusted Conformal.  Each histogram visually compares the distribution of bandwidths and coverages produced by these different methods. This allows for a comparison of the methods' performance in terms of both the precision and accuracy of their prediction intervals.", "section": "5 Application"}]
