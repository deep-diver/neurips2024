This affects model performance and makes it difficult to quantify the uncertainty of predictions. Prediction intervals, showing the range of likely outcomes, are crucial for addressing this challenge, but creating reliable intervals under distribution shifts remains an open problem. Existing methods focus on coverage guarantees but often fail to minimize interval width. \nThis research proposes a novel method to address this limitation.  It combines different prediction interval methods to achieve a prediction interval with minimal width and strong coverage guarantees on the target domain, even without labeled target data. This approach is based on model aggregation techniques and has rigorous theoretical guarantees. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing methods, showcasing improvements in both interval width and coverage.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ldXyNSvXEr/podcast.wav"}
