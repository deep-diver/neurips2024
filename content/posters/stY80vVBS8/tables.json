It shows the number of queries and the function value achieved by each algorithm under various conditions. Specifically, it explores how these metrics change as the prediction error (\u03b7), cardinality (k), and window size (w) vary, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms' efficiency and effectiveness across different settings.", "section": "7 Experiments"}]
