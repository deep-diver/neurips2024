These uncertainties affect model reliability and prediction accuracy, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI systems. Existing methods often fail to address these issues comprehensively, leading to unreliable models and predictions. \nThis paper introduces ZORRO, a novel method that leverages abstract interpretation and zonotopes to manage data uncertainty. ZORRO compactly represents all possible dataset variations, enabling simultaneous symbolic execution of gradient descent.  It provides sound over-approximations of all possible optimal models and prediction intervals, offering a robust and reliable framework for predictive modeling and statistical inference in scenarios with data uncertainties.  The efficacy of ZORRO is demonstrated through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, showcasing its superior performance over existing methods.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "v9RqRFSLQ2/podcast.wav"}
