The experiment varies the uncertainty radius (percentage of instances with uncertain features/labels) and measures the percentage of test data points for which each method provides robust predictions (within a specified threshold).  It also reports the average prediction interval length. ZORRO consistently achieves 100% coverage, outperforming the other methods, particularly at higher uncertainty radii.", "section": "M.4 Comparing with Bayesian Regression"}, {"figure_path": "v9RqRFSLQ2/tables/tables_39_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Bayesian approach on sampled possible worlds.", "description": "This table presents the results of a Bayesian approach on sampled possible worlds for different uncertainty radii (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%).  For each radius, it shows the coverage percentage and average interval width achieved by the Bayesian method on three different possible worlds, along with the coverage and average interval achieved by the ZORRO approach.  The comparison highlights ZORRO's superior performance in terms of coverage, providing 100% coverage across all cases, while the Bayesian method's coverage varies significantly and underestimates the true prediction intervals.", "section": "M.4 Comparing with Bayesian Regression"}]
