The integration of parallel cascaded Hybrid State Space (HSS) blocks and multi-kernel convolutions is particularly noteworthy. The HSS blocks, leveraging the efficiency of state space models, are enhanced with hybrid scanning methods and multiple scanning directions (e.g., Hilbert scans), bolstering their ability to model feature sequences effectively.  This sophisticated approach to feature encoding and decoding, combined with the incorporation of local information through multi-kernel convolutions, enables MambaAD to achieve a holistic understanding of both global patterns and fine-grained details within the input data, crucial for accurate and efficient unsupervised anomaly detection."}}, {"heading_title": "HSS Block Mechanics", "details": {"summary": "The hypothetical \"HSS Block Mechanics\" section would delve into the detailed functioning of the Hybrid State Space (HSS) blocks, a core component of the proposed MambaAD architecture.
