It compares different algorithms and their sample complexity bounds, highlighting the influence of various complexity measures, such as the mixing time (t<sub>mix</sub>), diameter (D), and optimal bias span (H). The table also includes lower bounds which demonstrate the inherent complexity of the problem.  The \"Setting\" column specifies which parameters are assumed to be known to the algorithm.", "section": "Related work"}]
