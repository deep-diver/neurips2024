Average-reward MDPs are particularly challenging as the agent's long-term performance is measured, making it sensitive to minor changes in the MDP. Existing algorithms require knowledge of the MDP's complexity (e.g., diameter or optimal bias span), which is unrealistic in practice. This lack of prior knowledge poses a significant hurdle for practical RL applications. \nThis paper tackles this challenge by focusing on (\u03b5, \u03b4)-Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) policy identification in average-reward MDPs.  The authors demonstrate the difficulty of estimating the MDP's complexity measures.  They propose a novel algorithm called Diameter Free Exploration (DFE), which doesn't need any prior knowledge and achieves near-optimal sample complexity in a generative model setting. For the online setting, they derive a lower bound implying that polynomial sample complexity in H is unattainable and also provide an online algorithm. **The paper's contributions are groundbreaking as they provide the first near-optimal algorithm that works without prior knowledge of MDP complexity**, offering significant advancements in the field of reinforcement learning.", "affiliation": "Inria", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HPvIf4w5Dd/podcast.wav"}
