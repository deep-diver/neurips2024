Its goal is to learn, or to act according to, a good policy, that is a mapping from state to actions which maximizes cumulative rewards. However, there are different ways to define this notion of (expected) cumulative reward: in the finite horizon setting, one should maximize the expected sum of rewards up to a certain fixed horizon; in the discounted setting, each consecutive reward is $\\gamma$ times as important as the previous one, with $0<\\gamma<1$ . In this paper, we focus on the average reward setting, in which the value of a policy is measured by its asymptotic mean reward per time step. This setting is ideal for long-term learning, as there is no need to tune the horizon or discount parameters.

Indeed, it hinges on the fact that selecting at random one of the policies played during the regret-minimizing algorithm should yield a good enough policy: the more time steps there are, the smaller the regret induced by the most recent policy is, thus the better the policy is. However, in our setting, we know that the empirical mean reward of a policy converges towards the gain of this policy, but the speed of this convergence is determined by the mixing time. Moreover, as shown in [22], this mixing time can be arbitrarily large. However, the regret is not defined asymptotically.

While the dashed-line policy is asymptotically best, the full-lined policy is better for at least $N$ time steps, and is not even $\\varepsilon$ -optimal, as we show in Appendix C.1. An algorithm guaranteeing low regret (over a slightly modified version of the MDP to guarantee ergodicity) could therefore take the full-line action for a number of steps independent of the known parameters $S$ and $A$ , and the knowledge of $N$ would be required to know how many samples are necessary for best policy identification. This means that a wrapper turning any regret minimization algorithm into a best policy identification algorithm would require estimating and incorporating this measure $N$ somewhere, which argues against the existence of a straightforward wrapper as in the episodic setting.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
