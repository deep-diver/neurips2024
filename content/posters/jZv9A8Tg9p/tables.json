The scenario involves a simplified model to illustrate how unobservable confounders lead to errors in feature attribution. The values represent the expected values of different functions of the input features (x, x) given different conditioning subsets of features. The values are used to compute the Shapley values to demonstrate the misattribution caused by the unobservable confounders.", "section": "Example of Errors for Data-Faithful Feature Attribution"}, {"figure_path": "jZv9A8Tg9p/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Relative error of each attribution algorithm.", "description": "This table presents the mean and standard deviation of the relative error for five independent runs of four different feature attribution methods (SHAP, IV-SHAP, IG, IV-IG) across five different years.  The relative error quantifies the difference between the attribution values produced by each method and a benchmark attribution value, providing a measure of the accuracy of each method in capturing the true impact of the feature.

These statistics provide insights into the data distribution and help in evaluating the results of the proposed feature attribution methods.  The features represent an unobserved confounder, a variable influenced by the confounder, collaborative variables, and the target feature, respectively.  The values show how the characteristics of these variables change with the variation in the parameter p, which controls the level of noise in the data generation process.", "section": "5.1 Experiments on Synthetic Datasets"}, {"figure_path": "jZv9A8Tg9p/tables/tables_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: MSE of the SHAP values estimation.", "description": "This table presents the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Shapley value estimations using different approximation methods (MC, CC, CCN, and OURS) with varying numbers of samples (56*100, 56*200, 56*300, 56*400, 56*500).  The MSE is calculated against a benchmark obtained from extensive sampling using the CC method. Lower MSE values indicate better estimation accuracy.
