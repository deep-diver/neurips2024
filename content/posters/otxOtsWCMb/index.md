### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for 3D scene understanding from videos face challenges: limited real-world data, difficulties in finding corresponding frames across different viewpoints, and high computational costs. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel approach. 

The proposed approach involves collecting a large-scale dataset of one million 360¬∞ videos. A new method efficiently identifies corresponding frames with diverse viewpoints. A diffusion-based model named ODIN is trained on the dataset. ODIN surpasses existing methods in novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction benchmarks. Notably, ODIN handles complex real-world scenes effectively.

### In-depth insights


#### 360¬∞ Video Dataset
The creation of a large-scale, high-quality **360¬∞ video dataset** is a significant contribution to the field of computer vision.  This dataset addresses the limitations of existing multi-view datasets by offering **scalable corresponding frames** from diverse viewpoints, which is crucial for training robust 3D understanding models.  The use of 360¬∞ videos allows for the acquisition of multiple views from a single recording, overcoming the challenges associated with traditional videos that have fixed camera viewpoints.  **Efficient correspondence search** techniques are employed to overcome the computational cost associated with finding corresponding frames across a large dataset.  The dataset's size and diversity are key features, enabling the training of models capable of imagining the world from a multitude of perspectives, going beyond the limitations of existing datasets.  The availability of such a dataset allows researchers to improve upon existing novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction methods.  Furthermore, the open-sourcing of this dataset will significantly accelerate research in the field.

#### Diffusion Model
Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that have shown remarkable success in image generation.  They work by gradually adding noise to an image until it becomes pure noise, then learning to reverse this process to generate new images.  The paper leverages a diffusion-based model for novel view synthesis, **demonstrating its ability to generate realistic and coherent novel views of real-world scenes from a single input image.**  This is a significant achievement, as existing methods often struggle with this task, particularly for complex scenes. The use of diffusion models is particularly well-suited to this problem due to their ability to learn complex data distributions. The model's performance is further enhanced by the use of a large-scale, real-world dataset of 360¬∞ videos. **This multi-view dataset is crucial for training the model, as it allows the model to learn the 3D geometry of the scene from diverse viewpoints.**  However, the paper also highlights limitations such as the difficulty of handling dynamic elements in video data.  Overall, the use of diffusion models represents a significant advancement in novel view synthesis, paving the way for more realistic and immersive 3D experiences.

#### Novel View Synth
Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is a core focus, aiming to generate realistic images from viewpoints unseen during training.  The paper highlights the limitations of existing NVS methods, particularly their reliance on limited, often synthetic datasets.  **The introduction of 360-1M, a massive real-world dataset of 360¬∞ videos, is a crucial contribution**, enabling training of a diffusion-based model, ODIN, which overcomes prior limitations.  **ODIN's ability to freely move the camera and infer scene geometry is a significant advancement**, producing more realistic and coherent novel views than previous methods.  The approach tackles challenges like scale ambiguity and handling dynamic scenes through innovative techniques, such as motion masking.  **The results demonstrate superior performance on established benchmarks**, showcasing the effectiveness of leveraging large-scale real-world data for training NVS models.

#### 3D Reconstruction
The paper's section on 3D reconstruction highlights a novel approach enabled by its large-scale 360¬∞ video dataset.  Instead of relying solely on multi-view image datasets, **the method leverages the temporal consistency inherent in videos** to generate multiple views of a scene.  This approach uses a trajectory-based sampling technique, ensuring geometric consistency across generated images, which are then used to perform 3D reconstruction.  The model's performance is compared against existing 3D reconstruction methods on standard benchmark datasets, showcasing improvements particularly for complex real-world scenes. **The ability to handle dynamic elements in real-world videos** is addressed via a motion masking technique, showing that the model can generate plausible reconstructions of scenes with movement. The success suggests a viable alternative for large-scale, realistic 3D modeling, moving beyond the limitations of static, limited datasets that are common in existing methods.

#### Motion Masking
The concept of 'Motion Masking' addresses a critical challenge in training novel view synthesis (NVS) models on real-world videos: the presence of dynamic elements.  **Standard NVS datasets often focus on static scenes**, limiting the applicability of trained models to real-world scenarios.  Motion masking tackles this by introducing a mechanism to filter out dynamic portions of a scene during training.  This is achieved by predicting a dense mask that assigns weights (between 0 and 1) to each pixel, effectively emphasizing static elements in the loss function and mitigating the effects of moving objects. **The mask is learned alongside other model parameters**, allowing the network to adaptively focus on stable parts of the scene for view synthesis.  An auxiliary loss is also introduced to prevent the model from trivially setting the mask to zero, ensuring that a sufficient amount of the scene is still considered.  This approach enables training on diverse and complex real-world video data, leading to improved performance on novel view synthesis tasks.  **The novelty lies in its applicability to in-the-wild videos**, overcoming limitations of previous methods that either rely on static datasets or require manual filtering of dynamic content.  The result is a more robust and realistic model capable of handling the complexities of real-world scene generation.

The left panel shows a standard video, where the camera's viewpoint is fixed, resulting in a limited range of views and making it difficult to find corresponding frames with significantly different perspectives.  The right panel depicts a 360¬∞ video, where the camera's viewpoint is controllable, enabling the capture of a much wider range of views and greatly facilitating the identification of corresponding frames from diverse perspectives. This difference in viewpoint control is highlighted as a key advantage of using 360¬∞ video for creating multi-view datasets for novel view synthesis.
