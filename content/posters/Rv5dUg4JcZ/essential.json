Existing approaches often fail or rely on restrictive assumptions such as convexity, limiting their applicability.  This paper tackles these issues.\nThe paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm based on a primal-dual framework to overcome these challenges.  **This algorithm directly addresses the non-convex nature of the problem, achieving approximation guarantees without strong distributional assumptions**.  The proposed method utilizes a novel technique to bound the risk, leading to theoretical guarantees of convergence to solutions within a desired error margin of the optimal solution. **This represents a significant advance for robust machine learning, particularly in the context of distributionally robust optimization.**", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "Rv5dUg4JcZ/podcast.wav"}
