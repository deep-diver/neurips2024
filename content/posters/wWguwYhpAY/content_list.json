Instead of storing discretely sampled signals (e.g., on a uniform grid), INRs approximate signals using a continuous function defined by a neural network. Given an input coordinate, the network is optimized to estimate the signal value at that coordinate. These neural representation networks have gained popularity because they can effectively fti even complex or high-dimensional signals for various tasks, including 3D reconstruction [31, 27, 2, 3, 14, 5], novel-view synthesis [28, 4], neural rendering [43], and pixel alignment [34].

The second is a locality limitation: a desirable property of INRs is for features to change rapidly (to allow modelling of sharp boundaries) which does not arise naturally in optimized MLPs due to spectral bias [41]. Consequently, pure-MLP networks inhibit the ability to scale, fit the signal, and perform local operations on signals represented by the network.

MoEs provide inherent parallelizability, enabling efficient computation across different computation hardware. Additionally, MoEs inherently subdivide the input data, allowing the network to focus on distinct regions or features for more effective and specialized learning.

One intuitive explanation for the effectiveness of MoEs for INRs is that while traditional INRs approximate using continuous functions, MoEs can naturally represent using piecewise continuous functions, facilitated by the gating function of the manager network which has a global perspective of the signal throughout training.

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are continuous function approximators often based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Their continuous nature beneftis many reconstruction tasks but is particularly advantageous when dealing with irregularly sampled signals, such as point clouds [31, 2, 14]. However, standard MLPs have been shown to perform poorly when ftiting signals with high frequencies [41, 39]. A common method to address this is to apply frequency encoding in the MLP, where frequencies are explicitly provided to the network. This can either be done by Fourier feature encoding [28, 41] or by using activation functions such as sinusoidal [39], Gaussian [32], wavelet [35] and sinc [37] functions. However these approaches are sensitive to the frequency bandwidth at initialization, and lack control of the bandwidth [5, 22]. Thus improvements include supplying a large bandwidth and reducing it over optimization using regularization [5] or explicit frequency decomposition [48, 22]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another approach is to specialise subsets of the parameters for certain regions of the domain. This can be done by specialising parameters for each cell in a grid of the domain [7], which can be improved by making it hierarchical [40], adaptive [26] or operate on Laplacian pyramids [36]. Another method is to have a set of weights that get chosen based on the input\u2019s spatial position with a predetermined pattern [15, 23], or by hashing [29].

This allows for improved parallelization and scaling [21], but cannot use the original MoE loss and requires a balancing loss to ensure load balancing and sparsity.

We experiment with several different manager pretraining options including none, grid, random, kmeans segmentation, and SAM segmentation [19] pretraining, presented in Figure 6. The pretraining aims to give a specific and predetermined expert assignment by the manager at initialization, so grid means that each pixel is assigned to the same expert based on a grid pattern, random uses a fixed sample from a uniform distribution for each expert, and the segmentation variants use a segmentation algorithm to determine the assignment. As an additional baseline we also report a constant manager that does not train at all and defacto acts as a constant routing component. Figure 6 also shows the manager assignment after the full training procedure. It can be seen that the manager is able to move away from its initialization and learn to cluster regions based on the input signal. The results, presented in Table 6, show that pretraining the manager is crucial for the convergence of the proposed Neural Experts and that random pretraining performs best. It seems that a balanced assignment plays an important role, as highlighted by the grid and random results. Surprisingly, semantic segmentation does not provide a significant benefit for the reconstruction task, however, may still be useful for other tasks since it provides an INR per semantic entity (the expert).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
