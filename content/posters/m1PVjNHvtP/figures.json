It starts with a dataset (d) which is processed by a neural network to produce outputs (c).  These outputs (c) are then passed through the GLinSAT layer, which projects the outputs onto a feasible region defined by constraints (represented by the polyhedron). The resulting feasible outputs (x) are then used to calculate a loss, which is used in the training process to optimize the network parameters.  The dashed lines represent the flow of gradients used for optimization during backpropagation.", "section": "2 Methodology"}]
