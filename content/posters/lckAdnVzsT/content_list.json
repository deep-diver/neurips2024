While previous works [15, 32, 33] have shown promising results, they often recover 3D shapes independently and thus do not leverage the scene context nor inter-object relationships. This leads to unrealistic and intersecting object arrangements. Additionally, common feed-forward reconstruction methods [48, 77, 37] struggle with heavy occlusions and weak shape priors, resulting in noisy or incomplete 3D shapes, which hinders immersion and hence limits the applicability in downstream tasks. To address these challenges and to advance 3D scene understanding, we propose a novel generative approach for coherent 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image. Specifically, we introduce a new diffusion model that learns a generative scene prior capturing the relationships between objects in terms of arrangement and shapes. When conditioned on a single image, this model simultaneously reconstructs poses and 3D geometries of all scene objects. By framing the reconstruction task as a conditional synthesis process, we achieve significantly more accurate object poses and sharper geometries. Publicly available 3D datasets [47, 62] typically only provide partial ground-truth annotations, which complicates joint training of shape and pose. To overcome this, we propose a novel and efficient surface alignment loss formulation $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{align}}$ that enables joint training of shape and pose even under the lack of full ground-truth supervision. Unlike previous methods [48, 77] that involve costly shape decoding and point sampling on the reconstructed surface, our approach employs an expressive intermediate shape representation that enables direct point sampling from the conditional shape prior.

Since the foundational work by Roberts [54], numerous methods have been developed to learn cues for deriving 3D object structures, thereby bridging the gap between 2D perception and the 3D world. These methods typically involve an image encoder network that processes the input image of a single object, capturing its features. The extracted features are either correlated with an encoded shape database to retrieve a suitable shape [32, 33, 17], or used by a 3D decoder to reconstruct the object in a specific 3D representation, such as voxel grids [8, 72], point clouds [14, 43], meshes [70, 66], or neural fields [73, 27].

Early works formulated single-view scene reconstruction as 3D scene completion from given or estimated depth information [63, 10, 78, 9] in a volumetric grid. While these methods have produced promising results, their representational power to model fine details is limited by the spatial resolution of the 3D grid. Multi-object reconstruction and scene parsing methods represented objects using primitives [13, 23], voxel grids [68, 35, 52], or CAD models [26, 24], while also considering the relation between the objects [31]. The approach presented by Nie et al. [48] is particularly relevant, proposing a holistic method for joint pose and shape estimation from a single image. Zhang et al. [77] extended this idea by incorporating an implicit shape representation and an additional pose refinement using a graph neural network. Although these methods provided significant advances in holistic scene understanding, they struggled with accurate pose estimation and produced noisy scene objects, leading to intersecting or incomplete objects. In contrast to these previous works, we are proposing a generative method to obtain a strong scene prior and formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional synthesis task. This allows for more robust reconstruction that is less prone to object insections or implausible object geometries.

This method ensures stable training and has the ability to capture diverse modes while producing detailed outputs. Several approaches have utilized diffusion models to learn the distribution of individual 3D shapes using various 3D representations, including volumetric grids [6, 7, 25], point clouds [42, 74], meshes [2], implicit functions [30], neural fields [45, 58, 29] or hybrid representations [80, 76].

While these methods can synthesize high-quality 3D shapes, they typically focus on single objects in canonical space.

Recently, several works proposed to leverage multi-view consistency within pre-trained text-conditional 2D image diffusion models to reconstruct individual 3D objects [38, 51, 57]. Similar to our work, Tang et al. [67] use a diffusion model to learn scene priors from synthetic data, showing unconditional scene synthesis of a single room type and text-conditional generation. However, their approach does not support image-based scene reconstruction. Furthermore, it depends on clean synthetic data, which provides full 3D ground truth supervision and CAD model retrieval, thereby limiting shape diversity. While these existing methods have shown promising results on single objects or synthetic scenes, our approach targets real-world scenes.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
