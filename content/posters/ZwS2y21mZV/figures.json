(a) shows the distribution of singular values for mh=64. (b) shows how the singular value distribution changes as the attention head size (mh) increases during training. (c) shows how the training error changes as mh increases. The findings show that as mh increases to a sufficiently large value, the decaying pattern of the singular values converges, suggesting the presence of a low-rank structure. The error decreases with mh following a power law decay, consistent with the approximation rate in Theorem 4.2.", "section": "Numerical Demonstrations"}, {"figure_path": "ZwS2y21mZV/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (a) is the estimated singular value of the attention matrix over a set of inputs for mh = 64.
