Standard simulations struggle to cross these barriers, leading to slow sampling and incomplete exploration of the state space.  To overcome this, researchers often employ biased simulations. However, extracting accurate, unbiased information from such biased data remains challenging. This research addresses this limitation. \nThis paper proposes a novel framework for learning from biased simulations using the infinitesimal generator and the associated resolvent operator. The method is shown to effectively learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. Experiments highlight the advantages over traditional transfer operator methods and recent generator learning approaches.  Importantly, the method demonstrated effectiveness even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing.", "affiliation": "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "TGmwp9jJXl/podcast.wav"}
