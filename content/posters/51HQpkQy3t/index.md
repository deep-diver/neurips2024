### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) excel at image and video generation but suffer from the high computational cost of self-attention. The quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant challenge for generating high-resolution images and videos; it makes the process slow and expensive. This paper introduces DiTFastAttn, a post-training compression method designed to overcome these limitations. 



DiTFastAttn identifies and addresses three key redundancies in the attention computation: spatial, temporal, and conditional redundancy. To mitigate these redundancies, three novel techniques are proposed: Window Attention with Residual Sharing, Attention Sharing across Timesteps, and Attention Sharing across CFG. When applied to state-of-the-art diffusion transformer models, DiTFastAttn shows significant improvements. It achieves a reduction of up to 76% in attention FLOPs and delivers a speedup of up to 1.8x for high-resolution image generation. The method also shows positive effects for video generation, indicating that it's a versatile approach applicable to different LLMs and applications.

### In-depth insights


#### Attn Compression
The concept of 'Attn Compression' in the context of large language models centers on **reducing the computational cost** associated with the self-attention mechanism, a core component of transformer architectures.  Self-attention's quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length makes processing long sequences computationally expensive.  **Attn Compression techniques aim to mitigate this by identifying and exploiting redundancies** within the attention mechanism. This might involve focusing on local attention windows instead of global attention, sharing attention computations across similar inputs or time steps, or employing various pruning or quantization methods to reduce the number of parameters and computations. **The ultimate goal is to improve the efficiency and scalability** of transformer models, enabling them to handle longer sequences and higher resolutions with reduced computational resources and latency, thus broadening their applicability to more demanding tasks.

#### Redundancy Types
The concept of 'Redundancy Types' in the context of diffusion transformer models is crucial for optimizing computational efficiency.  The authors likely identify several key areas where redundancy occurs: **Spatial redundancy**, arising from many attention heads focusing on local information rather than processing the entire image; **Temporal redundancy**, where similar attention patterns emerge across consecutive denoising steps, leading to duplicated computations; and **Conditional redundancy**, where similarities exist between the attention mechanisms used for conditional and unconditional image generation.  Understanding and addressing these redundancies is essential to creating more efficient and scalable diffusion models, **especially at high resolutions**. By targeting these specific areas of redundancy, the authors aim to develop compression techniques that minimize the computational overhead without compromising the quality of generated images.

#### WA-RS Method
The WA-RS (Window Attention with Residual Sharing) method cleverly addresses the spatial redundancy inherent in self-attention mechanisms within diffusion transformer models.  **It leverages the observation that many attention heads focus primarily on local spatial information**, with attention values diminishing for distant tokens.  Instead of solely employing window attention, which can lead to performance degradation, WA-RS **caches the residual difference between the output of full attention and window attention at a given step**. This residual, representing the information lost by using a window, is then added to the window attention output in subsequent steps. This ingenious technique effectively retains long-range dependencies while significantly reducing computational cost by only focusing on the necessary computations within the window. **The key insight lies in exploiting the high similarity between residuals across consecutive steps**, enabling this training-free method to effectively compress attention computations without retraining the model and maintain model performance.

#### AST & ASC
The proposed methods, AST (Attention Sharing across Timesteps) and ASC (Attention Sharing across CFG), target temporal and conditional redundancies in diffusion models.  **AST leverages the similarity between attention outputs of consecutive timesteps**, reducing computation by reusing earlier step's results where similarity is high. This is a significant optimization as diffusion models involve many iterative denoising steps.  **ASC exploits the similarity between conditional and unconditional attention outputs in classifier-free guidance (CFG)**. By sharing attention outputs between these two inference paths, redundant calculations are avoided, especially in cases where the conditional and unconditional outputs exhibit high similarity. **Both AST and ASC are training-free post-processing methods**, making them easily applicable to pre-trained diffusion models. Their effectiveness relies on the presence of temporal and conditional redundancies, which should be carefully assessed for different model architectures and task settings.  The combination of AST and ASC with other compression methods, as shown in the paper, demonstrates potential synergy, further improving efficiency.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Extending DiTFastAttn to other diffusion models** beyond the ones evaluated is crucial to establish its general applicability and effectiveness.  Investigating **more sophisticated redundancy detection methods** could further refine the compression strategy, leading to even greater performance gains.  **Adaptive techniques** that dynamically adjust the compression level based on the input or generation stage could optimize the balance between speed and quality. A deeper investigation into **the interaction between DiTFastAttn and different sampling methods** would be valuable to understand its effects on both speed and image/video quality.  Finally, research into **combining DiTFastAttn with other compression techniques** such as quantization or pruning might yield synergistic improvements, creating even more efficient and effective diffusion models.
