Adversarial linear mixture Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) model these scenarios, but existing algorithms struggle with unknown transitions and non-stationary rewards.  This creates limitations in achieving optimal performance. \nThis research introduces a new algorithm that effectively addresses these challenges. By cleverly combining occupancy-measure-based and policy-based approaches, it achieves near-optimal dynamic regret. This means the algorithm performs exceptionally well even when rewards change adversarially and the environment's dynamics are unknown. The algorithm's optimality is rigorously proven, providing a strong theoretical foundation and setting a new benchmark for future research in this domain.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LPyPRS2XcF/podcast.wav"}
