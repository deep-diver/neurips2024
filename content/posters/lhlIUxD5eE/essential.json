Estimating the soft Q-function, essential in MaxEnt RL, often requires computationally expensive Monte Carlo approximations, leading to inefficiencies and approximation errors.  These limitations motivate the search for more efficient and accurate approaches. \nThis paper introduces MEow, a new MaxEnt RL framework that addresses these issues. MEow uses energy-based normalizing flows (EBFlow) to unify policy evaluation and improvement.  This unified approach allows for the exact calculation of the soft value function, eliminating the need for computationally expensive Monte Carlo methods. The proposed framework also supports multi-modal action distributions and enables efficient action sampling, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that MEow outperforms existing baselines on MuJoCo and Omniverse Isaac Gym benchmarks.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA Corporation", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lhlIUxD5eE/podcast.wav"}
