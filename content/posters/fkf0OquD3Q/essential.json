Existing techniques struggle to attain optimal performance in high-privacy settings, often resulting in significantly increased regret.  This necessitates improved algorithms. \nThis research introduces a novel transformation, termed L2P, that effectively translates lazy (low-switching) online learning algorithms into their differentially private counterparts. Applying L2P to existing lazy algorithms yields significantly improved regret bounds for both online prediction from experts and online convex optimization. These improved bounds are nearly optimal for a natural class of algorithms, showcasing the approach's efficiency.  The new transformation, therefore, offers a powerful tool for building state-of-the-art private online learning systems.", "affiliation": "Apple", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "fkf0OquD3Q/podcast.wav"}
