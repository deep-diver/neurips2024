### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Private online learning, crucial for applications needing both accuracy and data protection, faces challenges in balancing privacy and regret (cumulative loss compared to the best model).  Existing techniques struggle to attain optimal performance in high-privacy settings, often resulting in significantly increased regret.  This necessitates improved algorithms. 

This research introduces a novel transformation, termed L2P, that effectively translates lazy (low-switching) online learning algorithms into their differentially private counterparts. Applying L2P to existing lazy algorithms yields significantly improved regret bounds for both online prediction from experts and online convex optimization. These improved bounds are nearly optimal for a natural class of algorithms, showcasing the approach's efficiency.  The new transformation, therefore, offers a powerful tool for building state-of-the-art private online learning systems.

> üîº This figure compares the regret bounds of different differentially private online learning algorithms (L2P, [AKST23b], [KMS+21]) against the non-private regret bound.  The x-axis represents the privacy parameter (Œµ = T<sup>-Œ±</sup>), and the y-axis represents the exponent of the regret (T<sup>Œ≤</sup>). Each subplot shows the results for a specific problem (DP-OCO with different dimensionality d and DP-OPE). The figure illustrates how the proposed L2P algorithm achieves better regret bounds compared to the prior work in the high-privacy regime.

> üîº This table compares the regret bounds achieved by prior work and the proposed work for differentially private online prediction from experts (DP-OPE) and differentially private online convex optimization (DP-OCO).  The regret is a measure of the algorithm's performance compared to the best possible outcome in hindsight.  The table shows that the new algorithms significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art, especially in the high-privacy regime where Œµ is small.
