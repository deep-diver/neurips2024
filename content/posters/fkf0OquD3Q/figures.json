We denote the privacy parameter \u03b5 = T-\u03b1 and regret T\u03b2, and plot \u03b2 as a function of \u03b1 (ignoring logarithmic factors).", "description": "This figure compares the regret bounds of different differentially private online learning algorithms (L2P, [AKST23b], [KMS+21]) against the non-private regret bound.  The x-axis represents the privacy parameter (\u03b5 = T<sup>-\u03b1</sup>), and the y-axis represents the exponent of the regret (T<sup>\u03b2</sup>). Each subplot shows the results for a specific problem (DP-OCO with different dimensionality d and DP-OPE). The figure illustrates how the proposed L2P algorithm achieves better regret bounds compared to the prior work in the high-privacy regime.", "section": "1.1 Our contributions"}]
