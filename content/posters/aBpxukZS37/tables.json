For a set of 188 common occupations, the model generated images using prompts that included the occupation paired with either \"male\" or \"female.\" The table shows the redundancy values, which are normalized across the entire dataset to the range [0, 1], for each gender and occupation. High redundancy indicates that the model strongly associates a particular gender with a given occupation, suggesting gender bias.  Lower redundancy suggests less association.", "section": "4.1 Gender Bias"}, {"figure_path": "aBpxukZS37/tables/tables_5_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ethnicity Bias: Redundancy between ethnicity and occupation", "description": "This table presents the results of an experiment evaluating ethnic bias in a diffusion model. It shows the redundancy values for different ethnic groups (Black, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic) associated with various occupations. High redundancy values indicate a strong association between the ethnicity and occupation in the model's perspective. For example, a high redundancy value for \"Black\" and \"Athlete\" might suggest that the model strongly associates Black individuals with the occupation of athlete.", "section": "4.2 Ethnic Bias"}]
