The step sizes used are from both existing theoretical bounds and the bounds proposed in this paper.  The results are averaged over 20 runs to account for randomness in the algorithm. The error bars are not visible due to the low variance observed in the results.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "qcPlGtzwW9/figures/figures_41_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: An illustration of the convergence behaviour of shuffled SGD for logistic regression problems on LIBSVM datasets luke, leu and a9a, where we use step sizes from existing bounds and our work.

The step sizes used are derived from existing bounds and from the authors' proposed theoretical work.  The plots show the optimality gap versus the number of data passes.  Averaging across 20 runs helps smooth out the inherent randomness of the algorithm.
