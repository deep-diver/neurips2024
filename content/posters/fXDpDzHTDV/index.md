### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current large multimodal models (LMMs) process visual data sequentially, leading to high computational costs, especially for high-resolution images.  This limits the scalability and efficiency of LMMs for various applications.  Many prior works try to solve the problem using token compression or other trade-off solutions, but the fundamental issues of sequentially processing remain unsolved.

DeepStack offers a novel solution by vertically stacking visual tokens and feeding them into different transformer layers, a bottom-up approach in contrast to the existing left-to-right structure.  This allows processing multiple times more visual tokens than conventional methods with the same context length, significantly improving performance across multiple benchmarks.  **The simple yet effective DeepStack architecture demonstrates significant improvements with minimal additional cost, making it a promising direction for future multimodal model development.**

> This figure compares three different approaches for handling visual tokens in large multimodal models (LMMs).  The left panel shows the conventional method, where visual tokens are linearly concatenated into a sequence and fed into the LLM. The middle panel illustrates the DeepStack approach, which stacks visual tokens in a grid-like structure and feeds them into different transformer layers of the LLM using residual connections. The right panel presents the performance comparison of DeepStack with the conventional method, showing significant improvements. DeepStack uses fewer visual tokens and context length to surpass the sequential LMM and match the one using much longer contexts.

> This table compares the performance of DeepStack with other Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on nine benchmark datasets.  It shows the effective resolution, number of visual tokens, context length, and performance metrics (VQAv2, GQA, TextVQA, DocVQA, InfoVQA, SEED, POPE, MM-MU, MM-Vet) for various models.  Noteworthy is the comparison of DeepStack with different configurations (DeepStack-V, DeepStack-L, DeepStack-L-HD) and the impact of finetuning the vision encoder.





### In-depth insights


#### DeepStack's Design
DeepStack's design ingeniously tackles the computational burden of processing numerous visual tokens in large multimodal models (LMMs). **Instead of the conventional sequential approach**, where visual tokens are strung together as a linear sequence, DeepStack adopts a layered stacking strategy.  This involves grouping visual tokens into sets and feeding each set into a corresponding transformer layer within the LLM, proceeding from bottom to top. This approach is **surprisingly effective** because it leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of LLMs, distributing the processing of visual information across multiple layers.  By intelligently stacking high and low resolution visual tokens, DeepStack enhances both local and global context understanding, resulting in significant performance gains, especially on tasks involving high-resolution images. This design is particularly noteworthy for its **simplicity and efficiency**. It requires minimal architectural changes to existing LLMs and yet achieves impressive results, making DeepStack a promising and practical approach for improving LMM performance.

#### Improved Tokenization
Improved tokenization in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for effectively processing visual information.  This involves efficiently encoding images into numerical representations that LLMs can understand.  **Traditional methods often suffer from limitations in capturing fine-grained details or handling high-resolution images**, leading to reduced accuracy and increased computational costs.  **DeepStack, however, addresses this by proposing a hierarchical stacking of visual tokens**, which are infused into the LLM at various layers. This method allows the model to process significantly more visual tokens than traditional sequential approaches without dramatically increasing context length.  The improved tokenization strategy enables the LLM to effectively model complex visual interactions and relationships across layers, leading to **substantial performance improvements on a range of benchmarks**.  **Key to this success is the inherent hierarchical structure of the LLM itself**, which DeepStack leverages rather than attempting to flatten visual inputs into a 1D sequence.  Furthermore, DeepStack shows how strategically sampling high-resolution features and integrating them into deeper layers significantly boosts performance, demonstrating the importance of understanding not just the quantity but also the quality and placement of visual tokens within the LLM architecture.

#### Benchmark Results
A dedicated 'Benchmark Results' section would ideally present a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepStack model against state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).  **Quantitative results**, presented in tables and charts, should clearly show performance across various benchmarks, including general image understanding tasks (like VQA) and specialized ones (e.g., document analysis, video understanding).  The choice of benchmarks should be justified, demonstrating their relevance to the model's capabilities.  Crucially, **clear comparisons** with baseline models and other LMMs are needed, highlighting DeepStack's advantages.  The discussion should not merely list numbers, but **interpret the findings** thoughtfully.  For instance, it should analyze whether DeepStack's gains are consistent across different image types or task complexities, and explain the potential reasons for its success or limitations.  **Statistical significance** should be rigorously addressed.  Finally, the inclusion of qualitative results or analysis could further strengthen the section, providing concrete examples of the model's performance and its limitations in specific scenarios.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model to understand their individual contributions.  In the context of a research paper on a novel multimodal model, such studies would be crucial.  For example, removing the high-resolution visual token stream might reveal whether this is essential for the model's performance improvements. Similarly, one could analyze the effect of removing the DeepStack strategy altogether. **A comparison between the full model, the model without the high-resolution stream, and the model without DeepStack would highlight the impact of each component.**  Ideally, the paper would quantify the impact of these ablations using metrics relevant to the task(s) the model is designed for.  **The results of these ablation studies will determine the importance and effectiveness of each component**, revealing the core contributions of the proposed model, and helping to validate design decisions.  Furthermore, ablation studies can reveal potential redundancies or areas for future improvements, directing research towards more efficient or robust architectures.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **DeepStack's effectiveness on various LLM architectures** beyond those tested (e.g., applying it to decoder-only or encoder-decoder models) warrants investigation.  Further exploration of **optimal visual token sampling and stacking strategies** is crucial for maximizing performance and efficiency.  This includes investigating different sampling methods and the impact of varying the number of stacked layers.  **Combining DeepStack with other LMM improvements** such as advanced token compression techniques, multi-modal pre-training methods, or improved vision encoders could yield significant performance gains.  Additionally, **exploring DeepStack's applications in diverse multimodal tasks** beyond those examined is essential to establish its broad applicability.  Finally, in-depth analysis on the **theoretical underpinnings of DeepStack** and a more comprehensive understanding of why this simple method is surprisingly effective would contribute valuable insight to future LMM design.

> This figure illustrates the DeepStack architecture applied to both LLMs and Vision Transformers (ViTs).  For LLMs, a low-resolution image is processed, and its tokens are fed to the input layer. High-resolution tokens are extracted from the same image, organized into a stack, and infused into subsequent LLM layers via residual connections. The ViT version uses a similar strategy, feeding the visual tokens into various ViT layers instead of LLM layers.  This demonstrates how DeepStack integrates multi-resolution visual information across multiple layers for improved multimodal understanding.

> This figure illustrates the DeepStack architecture. It shows how visual tokens are processed in two different ways: one for Large Language Models (LLMs) and one for Vision Transformers (ViTs). In both cases, DeepStack enhances the input visual tokens by dividing image feature extraction into two streams: a global-view stream and a high-resolution stream.  The global-view stream provides an overview of the image, while the high-resolution stream adds fine-grained details by stacking dilated high-resolution image features across different layers. This dual-stream approach increases the efficiency and improves understanding of fine-grained details.
