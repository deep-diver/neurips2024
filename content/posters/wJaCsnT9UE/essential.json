However, recent studies highlight that the sharpness of individual models' loss landscapes and the diversity among these models are key factors influencing the ensemble's performance. This paper investigates the complex relationship between sharpness and diversity, revealing a trade-off: minimizing sharpness tends to reduce diversity, limiting the potential gains from ensembling. This poses a significant challenge for optimizing ensemble performance.\nTo address this challenge, the authors propose SharpBalance, a novel training approach.  SharpBalance strategically balances sharpness and diversity by training each individual model on a carefully selected subset of the training data focusing on reducing sharpness while maintaining overall diversity. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that SharpBalance effectively improves ensemble performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by a significant margin.  This work significantly advances the understanding and optimization of deep ensembles.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wJaCsnT9UE/podcast.wav"}
