Prior works showed uniform-in-time propagation of chaos but with bounds that depend exponentially on regularization parameters which can be problematic.  The issue is that these errors depend on the Logarithmic Sobolev Inequality (LSI) constant, which can deteriorate exponentially with regularization. \nThis paper proposes an improved particle approximation error that is free from the LSI constant.  This leads to a more efficient and accurate MFLD, achieving improved convergence, sampling guarantee for the mean-field stationary distribution, and uniform-in-time Wasserstein propagation of chaos with better particle complexity bounds. The method leverages the problem structure in risk minimization to achieve this significant improvement.", "affiliation": "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "76NKidadct/podcast.wav"}
