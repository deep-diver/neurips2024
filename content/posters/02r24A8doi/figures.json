The experiment was repeated 16 times with different random seeds to get an average performance and reduce the impact of randomness on the results.  The x-axis represents the misspecification level (\u03b6), and the y-axis represents the average cumulative regret. Two lines are plotted in each subplot, one is the algorithm with the certified estimator and quantization, and the other is without the certified estimator. The plot shows how the cumulative regret increases with the misspecification level.", "section": "I Numerical Simulation"}, {"figure_path": "02r24A8doi/figures/figures_37_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Cumulative regret over 2000 episodes with respect to different misspecification level \u03b6. The result is averaged over 16 individual environments.", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between the average cumulative regret and the misspecification level (\u03b6) of the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP).  Two lines represent the average cumulative regret with and without quantization.  The x-axis represents the misspecification level \u03b6, and the y-axis represents the average cumulative regret. The figure shows that as the misspecification level increases, the average cumulative regret also increases. It also shows that the quantization has minimal effect on the regret.", "section": "I Numerical Simulation"}, {"figure_path": "02r24A8doi/figures/figures_38_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Cumulative regret with respect to the number of episodes.
