In this paper, we propose opponent modeling based on subgoal inference, which infers the opponent\u2019s subgoals through historical trajectories. As subgoals are likely to be shared by different opponent policies, predicting subgoals can yield better generalization to unknown opponents.

A self-interested agent [37, 12] operates with the primary goal of maximizing its own benefits, even when interacting with other agents. When the objectives of a self-interested agent align with those of the team, this scenario falls under ad-hoc teamwork [21, 8, 39]; however, in more general cases, these interactions are framed as noncooperative games [34, 23, 45]. A key technique for self-interested agents in such settings is opponent modeling[24, 3], which enables them to analyze and predict the actions, goals, and beliefs of other agents. By modeling the intentions and policies of other agents, the training process of the agent might be stabilized [27]. Many studies rely on predicting the actions [14, 16, 13, 25, 26], goals [32, 31], and returns [42] of opponents during training.

Generally, modeling an opponent\u2019s actions just predicts what it will do at the next step. Intuitively, it is more beneficial for the agent to make decisions if it knows the situation of the opponent several steps ahead. Predicting the actions over a few steps has high uncertainty. For example, to reach the goal point of $(2,2)$ , an opponent moves from $(0,0)$ following the action sequence $\\mathrm{<}\\uparrow$ $\\langle\\uparrow,\\uparrow,\\rightarrow,\\rightarrow$ by four steps (Cartesian coordinates). But, there are also 5 other action sequences, i.e., $<\\uparrow,\\rightarrow,\\uparrow,\\rightarrow>,<\\uparrow,\\rightarrow,\\rightarrow,\\uparrow>,<\\rightarrow$ $,\\uparrow,\\uparrow,\\rightarrow,<\\rightarrow,\\uparrow,\\rightarrow,\\uparrow>,<\\rightarrow,\\rightarrow,\\uparrow,\\uparrow>$ , that can lead to the same goal. Obviously, the complexity and uncertainty of predicting the action sequence are much higher than the goal itself. Other methods that claim to predict the opponent\u2019s goal [31, 32], but without explicitly making a connection to the opponent\u2019s goal or just predicting the goal at the next step, are essentially as shortsighted as modeling actions.

To address this challenge, one straightforward method involves equipping the agent with the ability to incorporate information about its opponent, including aspects like the opponent\u2019s behavior, goals, and beliefs [3], i.e., opponent modeling.

The subgoal hit rate gradually improves during training, which indicates that the subgoal-based opponent modeling is able to predict the future state of the opponent. OMG tends to predict the opponent\u2019s future state several steps ahead as the subgoal, rather than focusing solely on the next step. This kind of prediction requires validation over multiple steps, and the agent policy conditioned on the predicted subgoal may also influence the behavior of the opponent. These make it challenging to verify the predicted subgoal. Consequently, the overall hit ratio remains at a moderate level at the end of training. There is a small gap between the subgoal hit rates of OMG-conservative and OMG-optimistic, which leads to a longer episode length for OMG-optimistic than OMG-conservative, as illustrated in Figure 8(b).

OMG is a simple and efficient opponent modeling method and can be combined with various RL algorithms. Unlike most opponent modeling methods, which primarily focus on predicting the opponent\u2019s actions, OMG focuses on modeling the opponent\u2019s subgoals. Specifically, it leverages the value function of the policy to guide the selection of subgoals, which yields two variants of OMG for cooperative and general-sum games, respectively. Empirical results demonstrate the remarkable performance achieved by OMG, as compared to baselines based on action modeling, and that OMG exhibits better generalization when cooperating with opponents with unknown policies. We analyze the subgoals obtained by the inference model, and the results show they closely correlate with the opponent\u2019s trajectory. The limitation of OMG is it cannot handle open multi-agent systems where agents may enter and leave during the interaction. This is left for future work.
