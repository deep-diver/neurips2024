The x-axis represents the possible values of a random variable v(s') conditioned on state s and action a. The y-axis represents the probability density of v(s'). The curve shows the probability density function of v(s').  The shaded regions represent the lower and upper tails of the distribution, which correspond to CVaR\u207b(s, a) and CVaR\u207a(s, a), respectively.  The values \u03b2\u207b(s, a) and \u03b2\u207a(s, a) are the quantiles that define the boundaries of these tail regions.

The box plots show the distribution of estimated policy values for each estimator across four values of the sensitivity parameter A and 10 replications. The table provides the mean squared error (MSE) and standard deviation for each estimator and A value, relative to the true worst-case policy value. The results illustrate that the orthogonal estimator (Orth) generally performs better than the individual Q-function only and importance sampling only estimators.", "section": "6 Empirical Evaluation"}]
