Most previous approaches addressed these tasks separately, either by designing highly specialized social gaze models that do not generalize to other social gaze tasks or by considering social gaze inference as an ad-hoc post-processing of the gaze following task. Furthermore, the vast majority of gaze following approaches have proposed models that can handle only one person at a time and are static, therefore failing to take advantage of social interactions and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we address these limitations and introduce a novel framework to jointly predict the gaze target and social gaze label for all people in the scene. It comprises (i) a temporal, transformer-based architecture that, in addition to frame tokens, handles personspecific tokens capturing the gaze information related to each individual; (ii) a new dataset, VSGaze, built from multiple gaze following and social gaze datasets by extending and validating head detections and tracks, and unifying annotation types.

In particular, the ability to decode people\u2019s gaze, including communicative behaviors like eye contact and shared attention on a particular object, is highly related to our capacity to connect with or learn from others (44). In contrast, the absence or impairment of these skills is often indicative of developmental disorders such as autism (42). Thus, designing social gaze prediction algorithms and systems has attracted considerable attention from different communities, ranging from medical diagnosis to human-robot interactions (42; 43; 36).

This requires: (i) A new architecture capable of jointly modeling these tasks, (ii) A large-scale dataset with annotations for all the tasks. Specifically, we focus on the LAH, LAEO and SA social gaze tasks (illustrated in Fig. 1). Methods for social gaze prediction in the literature adopt one of two approaches. The first one focuses on the design of dedicated networks to process pairs of head crops and potentially other scene information (31; 30; 11; 5; 12; 46). While their specialization makes them effective, they offer little room for generalization to other gaze-related tasks. The second one first address the gaze following tasks (40), defined as predicting the 2D location people\u2019s gaze targets, and then uses the predicted gaze points to infer social gaze through ad-hoc post-processing schemes. For instance, combining gaze following heatmaps from multiple people to predict shared attention (9).

Besides geometric aspects, the task requires understanding and establishing a correspondence between top-down information related to the person\u2019s state, activity, cognitive intent, and bottom-up saliency related to the scene context (salient items like objects or talking people). Furthermore, gaze following performance, as measured by distance, does not always translate to similar social semantic performance (e.g. when evaluating if the predicted gaze point falls on a person\u2019s head or not (48)). ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Motivation. Existing methods for gaze following suffer from several drawbacks. First, most of the methods perform prediction for a single person (40; 41; 9; 14; 17; 48), requiring multiple inference passes on the same image to process multiple people in the scene. In contrast, a multi-person gaze following architecture processes the image only once and has to capture salient items for all people in the scene, while maintaining the ability to infer the gaze target of each individual. This is inherently more complex and challenging. Another drawback of the single-person formulation is that it does not explicitly model people\u2019s interactions, thereby preventing the possibility of jointly inferring people\u2019s gaze target and social gaze attributes. Secondly, the majority of proposed models for gaze following are static, using only a single image at a time. This is partly due to the absence of large and diverse video datasets, and the difficulty of leveraging large-scale static ones like GazeFollow (41). This is a limitation, as temporal information can capture head and gaze coordination patterns (43) which can help gaze direction inference, especially when the eyes are not completely visible (34).

Typical methods for this task exploit a two-branch architecture: one for processing the scene and the other for processing the person of interest (40; 9; 14; 17; 22; 23; 26). They have distinguished themselves by the addition of other relevant modalities like depth (14; 17; 23), pose (17), and objects (20), or by potentially leveraging scene geometry (19; 23; 14). However, only a few efforts have addressed the multi-person case. (22) first proposed a simple architecture relying on a scene backbone to get a person-agnostic image representation that is subsequently fused with the head crop features of each individual obtained using another backbone. While this reduces computation, the model does not account for person interactions, as each head is processed separately. In another direction, (52; 51) rely on a transformer-based architecture to perform multi-person gaze following. Their methods borrow from DETR (6), taking the image as input and simultaneously predicting the head bounding box and gaze target for every person in the scene. While these methods can implicitly model person interactions, an important limitation is that they compute performance on detected heads which are matched to the ground truth. Given that both the head detection and matching steps are error-prone, it precludes comparing their results to others. We provide examples in the supplementary (Fig. 8) where (51) makes incorrect head detections. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Temporal gaze estimation. Temporal information has proven effective for 3D gaze estimation. Previous research developed models to learn from various inputs, including face, eyes, and facial landmarks using a multi-stream recurrent CNN (37); eyes and visual stimuli or raw RGB frames from in-the-wild settings using convolutional RNNs or LSTMs (38; 25); and the temporal coordination of gaze, head, and body orientations using LSTMs (34). However, the use of such methods for the gaze following task in arbitrary scenes has been underexplored. The only exceptions are (9) who introduced a convolutional LSTM block at the bottleneck of the heatmap prediction architecture, and (32) who leveraged temporal attention over aggregated frame-level features. However, both approaches only showed a slight improvement compared to their static versions, highlighting the challenge of exploiting temporal information for this task. Conceptually, the methods did not model 2D gaze direction dynamics, and can not be extended for multi-person gaze inference. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Social gaze prediction. Several research papers in the literature are dedicated to the study of looking at each other (LAEO) and shared attention (SA) tasks. For LAEO, most methods rely on processing the head crops to obtain some gaze directional information, and then combining it with 2D or inferred 3D geometric information to predict the LAEO label (31; 11; 30; 5). Drawbacks include processing pairs of persons independently and, as they only process heads and do not address gaze following, lacking global image context and not extending easily to other social tasks like SA. Similarly to (52; 51), a recent paper (15) proposed an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to predict heads and the LAEO labels, and while achieving good results, suffers from the same drawbacks. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Regarding shared attention, the first method to address it in the wild was (12), which framed the problem as 2 tasks: the binary classification of whether SA occurs in a frame, and the inference of the location of the SA target object. Their method combined predicted 2D gaze cones of people in the scene with a heatmap of object region proposals, while others (46) directly inferred SA from the raw image. Since then, several methods leveraged combining gaze following heatmap predictions of all people (9; 52) and improved performance. Nevertheless, the above task formulation (12) used by all papers suffers from two main issues: (i) it cannot distinguish between multiple SA instances if they occur in the same frame; (ii) it does not determine which specific people are sharing attention. Our work solves both problems by framing the task as a binary classification between pairs of people. This formulation is more natural and has the benefit of extending to other social gaze tasks.

However, as it predicts a single gaze \u2019state\u2019 for each person, it is problematic as it does not allow for simultaneous LAEO and SA. It also does not identify the other person involved in the social gaze interaction. The second is (7) who addressed dyadic communication by proposing a gaze following style 2-branch architecture processing order-dependent pairs of people. However, inference using (7) is inefficient because the model needs $\\frac{N_{p}!}{(N_{p}{-}2)!}$ forward passes to consider all pairwise relationships for a given scene with $N_{p}$ people.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
