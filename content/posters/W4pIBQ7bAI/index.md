### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Most LLM benchmarks use a static, single-turn format, ignoring real-world interactive scenarios. This is problematic for high-stakes applications, where incomplete information is common and follow-up questions are crucial for reliable decision-making.  The unreliability stems from LLMs' training to answer any question, even without sufficient knowledge.

To address this, the paper introduces MEDIQ, an interactive benchmark that simulates clinical interactions. It features a 'Patient System' providing partial information and an 'Expert System' (LLM) that asks clarifying questions before making a diagnosis.  Results show that directly prompting LLMs to ask questions decreases performance, highlighting the difficulty of adapting LLMs to interactive settings. However, using abstention strategies to manage uncertainty improves accuracy, demonstrating the importance of developing LLMs that can proactively seek more information.

> This figure compares three scenarios of medical question answering. The first is a standard setup where all necessary information is given at once. The second scenario shows a realistic scenario where LLMs are given partial information at the start and only provide general responses. Finally, the third scenario illustrates the desired information-seeking behavior where the model proactively asks questions to gather more information before providing a response. This last scenario is the one that MEDIQ is trying to achieve.

> This table presents the accuracy of different LLMs under various information availability conditions (Full, Initial, None) and interactive settings (BASIC, BEST). The results demonstrate that even with the same initial information, interactive settings lead to a decrease in performance compared to the non-interactive setup with initial information.  However, improved interactive systems, particularly the 'BEST' ones, achieve higher accuracy than the non-interactive model with only initial information, though still falling short of the accuracy achieved when full information is provided.





### In-depth insights


#### Interactive LLM Eval
Interactive LLM evaluation presents a significant advancement in assessing large language model capabilities, moving beyond the limitations of static, single-turn benchmarks.  **The key insight is the recognition that real-world interactions with LLMs are dynamic and iterative, involving a continuous exchange of information.** This contrasts sharply with traditional evaluations that provide complete information upfront.  Interactive evaluation necessitates the development of new methodologies to assess not only the accuracy of the LLM's final response but also its ability to strategically ask clarifying questions and process partial or ambiguous input.  This requires careful design of simulated interactive environments, often involving a 'patient' and 'doctor' simulation to mimic real-world scenarios.  **Metrics should go beyond simple accuracy to include measures of efficiency, such as the number of questions asked, and the quality of questions posed by the LLM.** Furthermore, evaluating the ability of LLMs to effectively manage uncertainty, perhaps through strategies like selective abstention, is crucial for robust evaluation of interactive performance. This dynamic evaluation approach opens exciting new avenues for research, allowing for a deeper understanding of how LLMs reason and learn in complex settings.  It also fosters the development of more reliable and safe LLMs for critical applications.

#### MEDIQ Benchmark
The MEDIQ Benchmark is an **interactive evaluation framework** designed to assess the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in realistic clinical reasoning scenarios. Unlike traditional single-turn benchmarks, MEDIQ simulates a dynamic clinical consultation involving a Patient System that provides information and an Expert System (LLM) that asks clarifying questions.  This **interactive setting** mirrors actual clinical interactions where initial information is often incomplete, forcing the LLM to actively seek additional data to reach a reliable diagnosis. **MEDIQ's novelty** lies in its ability to measure LLM's proactive information-seeking behavior, which is crucial for high-stakes applications.  By converting existing medical QA datasets into an interactive format, MEDIQ offers a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation.  The benchmark's modular design allows for flexibility and extensibility, paving the way for future improvements in LLM reliability and clinical decision support systems.

#### Abstention Strategies
The effectiveness of various abstention strategies in improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks is a crucial area of research.  **The core idea is to have the LLM refrain from answering when its confidence is low, instead prompting for more information.** This approach directly addresses the issue of LLMs confidently answering even with incomplete or insufficient knowledge.  Different strategies for estimating confidence and determining when to abstain are explored, including numerical scores, binary decisions, and Likert scales.  **The integration of rationale generation and self-consistency further enhances the performance of these strategies,** leading to more accurate confidence estimates and improved decision-making accuracy.  These methods demonstrate a promising path towards building more reliable and trustworthy LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis where confidence is critical.  Further research should focus on refining these strategies and developing more nuanced approaches to model uncertainty.

#### LLM Limitations
Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting remarkable capabilities, possess inherent limitations that hinder their reliability, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare.  A primary limitation is their tendency to **generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information**, often referred to as hallucinations.  This is exacerbated by the models' training on vast datasets containing inconsistencies and biases, leading to outputs that may be confidently presented but ultimately unreliable.  Furthermore, LLMs typically lack the ability to **explicitly represent uncertainty** or admit to knowledge gaps. They answer confidently even when faced with incomplete or ambiguous information, potentially leading to erroneous decisions.  Another critical limitation is the difficulty in **controlling the LLM's reasoning process** and ensuring transparency in its decision-making.  The black-box nature of these models makes it challenging to understand why a specific output was generated, hindering efforts to debug errors or identify biases. Finally, many LLMs struggle with **proactive information seeking**, instead relying on information provided upfront. This limits their ability to engage in truly interactive and investigative tasks, especially those requiring iterative clarification and the elicitation of missing details.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Improving LLM's ability to identify and request relevant information proactively** is crucial; current methods struggle with this.  Developing more sophisticated **confidence estimation techniques** is essential for reliable abstention strategies; current methods don't perfectly capture uncertainty.  The impact of **different question-asking strategies** on both accuracy and efficiency needs deeper investigation.  **Expanding the MEDIQ benchmark to include more diverse datasets and clinical scenarios** is key to enhancing its generalizability and relevance.   Furthermore, research should explore methods to **mitigate biases** present in LLMs and datasets, including fairness considerations across various demographics and specialties. Finally, incorporating **human-in-the-loop elements** within the MEDIQ framework might offer additional insights into effective clinical reasoning, providing a richer understanding of the interaction between humans and AI systems in real-world scenarios.

> This figure illustrates the MEDIQ benchmark's framework, which simulates a realistic clinical interaction.  The Patient System, possessing the complete patient record, responds to questions from the Expert System.  The Expert System, starting with incomplete information, determines if it has sufficient data to answer the medical question; if not, it asks follow-up questions to the Patient System. This process continues iteratively until the Expert System has enough information to answer the question confidently. The figure visually represents the information flow and decision-making process within the MEDIQ framework.
