### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Digital watermarking protects copyrights and source identification of images. Existing methods, especially content-agnostic ones (embedding fixed patterns), are vulnerable to attacks that remove watermarks with minimal distortion.  These attacks often exploit the embedded patterns to remove or forge watermarks, threatening image authenticity and copyright protection. This is a significant issue as content-agnostic methods are commonly used due to their simplicity and computational efficiency. 

This research introduces a novel steganalysis attack that uses simple averaging of multiple watermarked images to reveal the underlying watermark pattern.  This method is effective against various content-agnostic watermarking techniques, even under black-box conditions (without knowing the algorithm's details). The researchers demonstrated the attack's effectiveness on several watermarking methods and propose security guidelines advocating for content-adaptive methods and multi-key assignments to enhance resilience against steganalysis vulnerabilities.

> This figure illustrates the process of watermark steganalysis, a method to extract, remove, or forge watermarks.  The top half shows the greybox scenario, where the adversary has access to both watermarked and clean images. These images are averaged separately, and then subtracted to reveal the watermark pattern (Œ¥w). This pattern is then used to remove the watermark from a watermarked image by subtracting it from the image.  The bottom half shows the blackbox setting, where the adversary only has access to watermarked images and a collection of unrelated clean images.  The process is similar, with unrelated clean images being used instead of paired clean images for the extraction of watermark pattern. The extracted watermark pattern is then used to remove the watermark, or even create a forged watermark on a clean image by adding it to the clean image.

> This table presents the performance of 12 watermarking algorithms (6 content-agnostic and 6 content-adaptive) under a steganalysis-based watermark removal attack.  It shows the Area Under the Curve (AUC), bit accuracy, and detection accuracy of each method before and after the attack, along with the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) as a measure of the image quality degradation after removal.  The results demonstrate the vulnerability of content-agnostic watermarks to steganalysis compared to the robustness of content-adaptive watermarks.





### In-depth insights


#### Watermark Averaging
Watermark averaging, as a novel steganalysis technique, reveals vulnerabilities in content-agnostic watermarking methods. By averaging multiple watermarked images, the underlying watermark pattern emerges, enabling its extraction.  This **extracted pattern facilitates effective watermark removal and even forgery**. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated across various watermarking algorithms, highlighting the threat posed by simple averaging. The findings underscore the **importance of designing content-adaptive watermarking strategies**, as they exhibit greater resilience against this steganalysis technique.  Furthermore, the research explores the implications for watermark security, advocating for security evaluations against steganalysis, and suggesting **multi-key assignments as a potential mitigation strategy**.  The study's impact extends beyond image watermarks to include other multimedia forms, underscoring the broader significance of steganalysis in protecting digital content.

#### Steganalysis Attacks
Steganalysis attacks target the hidden information embedded within digital media using watermarking techniques.  These attacks aim to detect, extract, or even remove the embedded data without significantly impacting the perceived quality of the media. **Content-agnostic watermarking**, which embeds fixed patterns regardless of content, proves especially vulnerable.  **Steganalysis exploits the inherent patterns** introduced by such methods.  This could involve statistical analysis to identify deviations from expected patterns or the use of machine learning models trained to distinguish watermarked from unwatermarked data.  The efficacy of steganalysis varies widely depending on the robustness of the watermarking technique used, the amount of data embedded, and the sophistication of the attack.  **Simple averaging of multiple watermarked images** has been demonstrated as an effective black-box steganalysis attack against specific techniques, revealing the underlying pattern and enabling watermark removal or forgery. The development of more robust and secure watermarking methods that are resilient to advanced steganalysis techniques is crucial, particularly in the age of generative AI.

#### Content Agnostic Risks
Content-agnostic watermarking, while computationally efficient, introduces significant security risks.  **The core vulnerability stems from embedding fixed patterns independent of image content.** This predictability allows adversaries to employ steganalysis techniques, effectively revealing and removing the watermark with minimal perceptual distortion.  **Averaging multiple watermarked images reveals the underlying pattern**, facilitating both watermark removal and forgery. This threat is amplified by the fact that many existing content-agnostic methods are highly susceptible to these attacks, despite claims of robustness against traditional distortions.  **The reliance on fixed patterns fundamentally weakens their security**, highlighting a critical need for a shift toward content-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust watermark placement and strength based on the image content itself. This adaptive approach offers superior robustness against steganalysis, though it comes at the cost of increased computational complexity.

#### Security Guidelines
The proposed security guidelines emphasize the critical need for **robustness against steganalysis** in watermarking techniques.  The authors advocate for shifting towards **content-adaptive methods**, which dynamically adjust watermark placement and strength based on image content, thereby enhancing resilience against analytical attacks.  While acknowledging that content-agnostic techniques offer computational advantages, the paper highlights their vulnerability and suggests mitigating strategies, such as **assigning multiple watermarks per user**, to enhance security. The guidelines underscore the importance of performing security evaluations against steganalysis during the development and design phases, emphasizing a proactive security approach for watermarking algorithms.  **Multi-key assignments** and thorough testing are presented as key recommendations for improving the security and robustness of watermarking schemes in the age of increasingly sophisticated attacks.  Ultimately, the guidelines advocate for a paradigm shift in watermarking design, moving away from easily exploitable patterns towards more secure content-adaptive approaches.

#### Future of Watermarking
The future of watermarking hinges on addressing the vulnerabilities exposed by steganalysis.  **Content-adaptive techniques**, which embed watermarks dynamically based on image content, are crucial for improved robustness against sophisticated attacks.  **Multi-key assignments** offer a temporary mitigation strategy for content-agnostic methods, but these are ultimately insufficient for long-term security.  Further research should focus on developing new algorithms that are inherently resistant to steganalysis, potentially integrating advanced techniques from areas like AI security and cryptography.  **Security evaluations** against steganalysis must become standard practice for all new watermarking methods.  The development of efficient and effective counter-steganalysis methods will also be essential to maintaining the integrity of digital watermarks.  Finally,  **establishing comprehensive guidelines and standards** for watermarking techniques, promoting both robustness and security against evolving threats, is key to ensuring the long-term viability of this important technology.

The bottom half shows similar histograms for forged watermarks, illustrating how the method alters clean images to mimic watermarked ones.  The red dashed lines indicate the thresholds for successful watermark detection (at 1% False Positive Rate). The plots reveal that as more images are averaged, the distribution of distances for the watermark removal (top) shifts toward higher distances from the true watermarked images; simultaneously, the distances for forgery (bottom) shift toward lower distances, making it easier to remove and forge the watermarks.
