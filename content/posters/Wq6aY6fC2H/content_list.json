The transformation is called \u201cwhitening\u201d because it changes the input vector to white noise. Due to rotational freedom, there are infinitely many possible whitening methods, and consequently there is a diverse range of whitening procedures in use such as PCA whitening, Cholesky whitening, and Mahalonobis or zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) whitening among others. In the latter, the matrix used for the procedure of whitening is $\\dot{\\bf W}^{Z C A}=[\\Sigma^{1/2}]^{-1}$ , where $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of the original data.
