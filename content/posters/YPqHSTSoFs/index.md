### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The sheer number of large language models (LLMs) with diverse parameter scales and vocabularies presents significant challenges, particularly concerning cost-effective optimization for specific applications (like instruction following or removing sensitive information).  Existing methods address each model individually, increasing training costs. This research tackles this problem.

This paper proposes Cross-model Control (CMC), a method to improve multiple LLMs using a single, small, portable model trained alongside a frozen template LLM.  This approach leverages the similarity of logit shifts before and after fine-tuning across models, enabling the small model to effectively alter the output logits of other LLMs.  A novel token mapping strategy (PM-MinED) further extends the method's applicability to models with different vocabularies. **CMC demonstrates significant performance improvements in instruction tuning and unlearning tasks, achieving remarkable efficiency gains and reduced computational requirements.**

> This figure illustrates the core idea of Cross-model Control (CMC). A single, small portable tiny language model is trained alongside a larger template language model.  After training, the tiny model's ability to modify the output logits is shared with other user LLMs, regardless of their parameter scales or vocabularies.  This allows efficient improvement of multiple models in a single training process.

> This table presents the results of instruction tuning experiments using the AlpacaEval benchmark.  It compares the performance (Win %) of four large language models (LLMs): LLAMA2-7B, LLAMA2-13B, LLAMA2-70B, and MISTRAL-7B.  The results are shown for three different methods: a vanilla base model, LORA (a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique), and the proposed Cross-model Control (CMC) method.  CMC uses a shared, smaller 'delta model' trained on LLAMA2-7B to improve multiple LLMs simultaneously. The numbers in parentheses show the improvement achieved by each method over the Vanilla Base Model.





### In-depth insights


#### Cross-Model Control
The concept of 'Cross-Model Control' presents a novel approach to enhance multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) simultaneously.  Instead of individually fine-tuning each LLM, which is resource-intensive, **a single, lightweight "delta model" is trained to modify the output logits of diverse LLMs**. This delta model learns to capture the commonalities in the logit shifts observed during individual LLM fine-tuning, enabling it to transfer optimization outcomes effectively.  **A key innovation is the PM-MinED token mapping strategy**, which addresses the challenge of applying the delta model to LLMs with different vocabularies.  By leveraging the inherent similarities in fine-tuning effects, this approach promises **significant cost savings and efficiency gains**, making it a valuable technique for LLM developers facing constraints on data and computational resources. The effectiveness is demonstrated on instruction tuning and unlearning tasks, highlighting its broad applicability and potential impact on improving various LLM capabilities.

#### Portable Tiny LM
The concept of a "Portable Tiny LM" within the context of a large language model (LLM) research paper is intriguing.  It suggests a **smaller, more efficient model** trained to modify the output logits of larger, more resource-intensive LLMs. This approach addresses the high cost and computational demands associated with fine-tuning massive LLMs for various downstream tasks.  The "portability" aspect highlights its **adaptability** across LLMs with different architectures and vocabularies. This is achieved through innovative token mapping strategies such as PM-MinED, designed to bridge vocabulary discrepancies between the tiny model and the target LLMs.  **This modularity** enables a single training process to enhance performance across diverse LLMs, resulting in significant cost savings and resource efficiency. The effectiveness of this method relies heavily on the observation of similar logit shifts in various LLMs after fine-tuning, suggesting a shared underlying mechanism that the tiny model can effectively capture and leverage to improve performance.

#### Token Mapping
The effectiveness of cross-model control hinges on **robust token mapping** between the portable tiny language model and the larger user LLMs.  A naive approach of direct matching would severely limit applicability due to vocabulary discrepancies across different models. The paper cleverly addresses this by proposing PM-MinED, a strategy that combines **prefix matching** with **minimum edit distance**.  Prefix matching ensures semantic relevance by prioritizing tokens with shared prefixes, minimizing the risk of mismatched tokens with similar spelling but different meaning. Minimum edit distance is then applied to the subset of prefix-matched candidates, to find the most similar token. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of mapping across diverse LLMs, significantly improving the overall performance of the cross-model control framework.

#### Instruction Tuning
Instruction tuning, a crucial technique in adapting large language models (LLMs) for real-world applications, focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained models to better understand and follow user instructions.  **It bridges the gap between general language capabilities and specific task performance.**  The process involves training the LLM on a dataset of instruction-response pairs, enabling it to learn the mapping between instructions and appropriate outputs.  **Success hinges on the quality and diversity of the training data.**  A well-curated dataset with varied instructions and accurate responses is key to achieving high-quality performance.  However, instruction tuning is computationally expensive, especially for large models, and it can be challenging to ensure generalization to unseen instructions.  **Techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) aim to mitigate these challenges by optimizing only a subset of model parameters, reducing computational costs and preventing overfitting.**  Furthermore, ongoing research explores efficient methods to leverage instruction tuning outcomes across different LLMs, reducing the need for retraining each model individually.   **The effectiveness of instruction tuning is consistently evaluated through benchmarks that assess its ability to correctly interpret and respond to complex and nuanced instructions.**

#### Unlearning Limits
The heading 'Unlearning Limits' suggests an exploration of the boundaries and challenges inherent in the process of removing or mitigating learned information from large language models (LLMs).  A thoughtful analysis would delve into the **technical difficulties** of unlearning, such as the potential for incomplete removal of unwanted information or the unintended consequences of such modifications on the model's overall performance.  **Ethical implications** are also critical; the paper might examine the difficulty of completely erasing sensitive data, ensuring its absence from future outputs, and maintaining user privacy.  **Practical limitations** on the feasibility and scalability of unlearning methods within existing LLM architectures could also be explored, considering computational costs and the potential for retraining complexities.  The discussion should also acknowledge that **data biases** embedded during initial training are very difficult to erase and might require extensive retraining or architectural modifications. Overall, a comprehensive look at 'Unlearning Limits' requires a multi-faceted perspective, examining both the technical and societal challenges of removing unwanted knowledge from powerful and increasingly pervasive LLMs.

> This table presents the results of the unlearning experiments using the TOFU benchmark.  It compares various methods (vanilla model, LoRA, 8-UNLEARNING, and the proposed CMC method) across three LLMs (LLAMA2-7B, LLAMA2-13B, and MISTRAL-7B) in their ability to forget information from a forget set while retaining information from a retain set.  The performance is measured using ROUGE-L (recall-oriented understanding for gisting evaluation), Probability (likelihood of correct answers), and Truth Ratio (ratio of correct to incorrect answers).  The results show how effectively each method prevents the model from outputting information from the forget set while maintaining accuracy on the retain set and other knowledge domains.  Bold values indicate better performance.
