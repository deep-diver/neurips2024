It compares different analyses (risk characterization, estimator equivalence, risk equivalence), feature structures (Gaussian, linear, general, random, kernel), weight structures (subsampling, bootstrapping, general), and provides references for each combination. The current paper extends this prior work by establishing implicit regularization paths for general weighting and feature structures.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "oXCmwwkQTZ/tables/tables_30_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Summary of pretrained features from different real datasets.", "description": "This table presents the datasets used in the paper's experiments, along with the corresponding model used to extract pretrained features, the number of training samples, the number of test samples, and the number of pretrained features.  It provides a concise overview of the experimental setup and the dimensionality of the data used in the empirical validation.", "section": "Validation on real-world datasets"}]
