### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current online platforms heavily rely on algorithmic recommendations, but these can negatively impact multiple stakeholders (platform, items, users).  Existing fairness methods usually focus on only one group, ignoring the trade-offs. This creates unfair outcomes and limits platform sustainability. This paper tackles this issue by introducing a novel fair recommendation framework and a new algorithm. 

The proposed framework, Problem (FAIR), considers the unique objectives of all stakeholders, offering a flexible approach to defining and enforcing fairness. It then introduces FORM, a low-regret online algorithm that concurrently learns user preferences and enforces fairness. The researchers validated the method with real-world data, showcasing improved fairness while preserving platform revenue.  Their findings show that **a balanced approach to multi-sided fairness significantly improves platform sustainability**.

> This table lists several fairness notions commonly adopted in practice for multi-stakeholder problems, along with their corresponding social welfare functions.  The social welfare function is a mathematical function that combines efficiency and fairness metrics into a single objective. Maximizing this function allows the selection of a solution that balances fairness and overall efficiency. Different notions are presented: maxmin fairness, Kalai-Smorodinsky fairness, Hooker-Williams fairness, Nash bargaining solution, and demographic parity. Each notion prioritizes fairness differently, and the choice depends on the specific context and stakeholder needs.





### In-depth insights


#### Multisided Fairness
Multisided fairness in recommendation systems addresses the inherent complexities of balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders‚Äî**users, items (sellers), and the platform itself**‚Äîeach with potentially conflicting objectives.  A key challenge is defining what constitutes fairness across these groups.  **Simple approaches** that prioritize one stakeholder (e.g., maximizing platform revenue) can severely disadvantage others, creating inequitable outcomes. Therefore, a flexible framework is needed that allows for configurable trade-offs between competing interests and the definition of fairness is context-dependent. Effective solutions involve **algorithmic approaches** that simultaneously optimize for multiple fairness metrics and platform goals. **Data uncertainty** in dynamic online settings adds further complexity; algorithms must be robust enough to learn user preferences and ensure fairness despite noisy or incomplete data.  Successful multisided fair recommendation demands a thoughtful integration of optimization techniques, fairness metrics, and robust online learning, all tailored to the specific context and goals of the platform.

#### FORM Algorithm
The FORM (Fair Online Recommendation algorithm for Multi-sided platforms) algorithm is a crucial contribution of the research paper, addressing the challenge of creating fair and efficient recommendations in a dynamic, online setting with data uncertainty.  **It cleverly integrates real-time learning with fairness constraints**, unlike existing methods that often treat these aspects separately.  **The algorithm's novelty lies in its ability to handle uncertain fairness constraints**, a limitation inherent in online environments where full data is unavailable.  FORM employs a novel relaxation-then-exploration approach to balance exploration of less-seen items with the need to meet fairness criteria for all stakeholders. This approach includes incorporating randomized exploration to prevent an overemphasis on high-performing items and simultaneously solve a relaxed version of the main optimization problem.  **Theoretical analysis demonstrates FORM achieves sublinear regret bounds for both revenue and fairness**, providing a strong guarantee of its efficacy. The algorithm's flexibility and adaptability to various settings are significant, making it highly applicable to real-world online recommendation platforms.

#### Online Fairness
Online fairness in recommendation systems presents unique challenges compared to offline settings.  The dynamic nature of online data streams necessitates **real-time adaptation** of fairness algorithms, demanding efficient and low-regret approaches. **Data uncertainty** introduces additional complexity, as the system must make fair recommendations while simultaneously learning about user preferences and item characteristics. **Balancing exploration and exploitation** becomes crucial, preventing the system from prematurely converging on unfair solutions while also maintaining platform revenue.  **Defining appropriate fairness metrics** in an online environment that satisfy multiple stakeholder goals is also a key challenge.  Algorithms must be robust to **concept drift** and evolving user behaviour while still maintaining theoretical fairness guarantees.  Finally, **scalability** becomes critical as systems handle massive datasets and high-volume user traffic.

#### Amazon Case Study
The Amazon case study section likely demonstrates the framework's real-world applicability by testing it on a real-world e-commerce dataset.  It probably involves using Amazon product reviews to simulate a multi-sided recommendation platform, where items compete for visibility and user attention. The study likely measures the algorithm's effectiveness in maximizing revenue while upholding fairness criteria for both items and users. **Key performance indicators (KPIs)** might include revenue generated, item exposure, and user satisfaction metrics, comparing the proposed algorithm against established baselines.  **Results likely showcase the algorithm's ability to balance platform revenue with fairness**.  The study might also analyze how different fairness parameters impact the trade-off between fairness and revenue, illustrating the algorithm's flexibility.  **A crucial aspect is the discussion of the challenges** faced in applying the theoretical framework to real-world data, including noisy data and limitations in measuring fairness, thereby highlighting the practical significance of the proposed approach. Finally, the study likely concludes with insights into algorithm parameter tuning and the trade-offs involved in different fairness-revenue objectives.

#### Future Work
The "Future Work" section of this research paper presents exciting avenues for extending the current research.  **Addressing the limitations** of the online setting, such as data sparsity and uncertainty, is crucial.  **Investigating long-term fairness** impacts and adapting fairness notions to evolving user preferences and item attributes is vital for practical application.  **Expanding the framework beyond recommender systems** to dynamic pricing and advertising scenarios would significantly broaden the impact.  Finally, **rigorous empirical evaluations** on various datasets with different user populations and item characteristics are necessary to fully validate the approach's generalizability and robustness, ideally including controlled A/B tests with real-world platforms to assess the trade-offs between fairness and revenue.
