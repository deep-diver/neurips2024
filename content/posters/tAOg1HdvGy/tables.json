The social welfare function is a mathematical function that combines efficiency and fairness metrics into a single objective. Maximizing this function allows the selection of a solution that balances fairness and overall efficiency. Different notions are presented: maxmin fairness, Kalai-Smorodinsky fairness, Hooker-Williams fairness, Nash bargaining solution, and demographic parity. Each notion prioritizes fairness differently, and the choice depends on the specific context and stakeholder needs.", "section": "A Example Choices of Outcomes, Fairness Notions and Fair Solutions"}]
