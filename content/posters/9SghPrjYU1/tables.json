It compares the results of three algorithms in the standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting and two novel algorithms (DRPVI and VA-DRPVI) proposed in the paper for the distributionally robust Markov Decision Process (DRMDP) setting.  The algorithms are compared based on the suboptimality gap, which quantifies the difference between the value function of the learned policy and the optimal robust value function. The table highlights the key differences in the upper bound achieved by each algorithm and the settings under which they are applicable. Notably, the results for DRMDP algorithms reveal the impact of considering model uncertainty on the computational complexity and performance.", "section": "4 Warmup: Robust Pessimistic Value Iteration"}]
