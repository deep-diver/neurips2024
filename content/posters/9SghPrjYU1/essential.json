Robust offline RL aims to solve this by learning policies that perform well under various environmental conditions.  However, **introducing uncertainty adds nonlinearity and computational complexity**, especially when using function approximation techniques to handle large state-action spaces. This study focused on a linear model setting where both nominal and perturbed environments are linearly parameterized, which allows for efficient computations while maintaining robust performance.\n\nThe researchers propose two novel algorithms: **Distributionally Robust Pessimistic Value Iteration (DRPVI)** and its variance-aware variant (VA-DRPVI).  These algorithms leverage a novel function approximation mechanism incorporating variance information and instance-dependent suboptimality analysis to achieve a **minimax-optimal solution**.  The algorithms' efficiency is demonstrated, and theoretical guarantees are provided.  A new information-theoretic lower bound shows the algorithms are near-optimal.", "affiliation": "Duke University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "9SghPrjYU1/podcast.wav"}
