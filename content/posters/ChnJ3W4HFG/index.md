### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many existing methods for ensuring fairness in machine learning models struggle with noisy labels, leading to inaccurate and unfair outcomes.  This issue is particularly significant in real-world applications where data is often imperfect.  Previous attempts to solve this problem required computationally expensive full model retraining, limiting their practicality.

This research tackles the problem of noisy labels in fair machine learning by introducing a novel label-correction method. This method uses label spreading on a nearest-neighbors graph built from model embeddings.  This approach significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art last-layer retraining methods, achieving the best accuracy while maintaining efficiency and minimal computational overhead. The method also works across a wide range of datasets and noise levels, making it applicable to various settings and problems in fair machine learning.

> This figure shows the accuracy of KNN label spreading on three different datasets (CelebA, Waterbirds, and CMNIST) under 20% symmetric label noise.  The x-axis represents the number of nearest neighbors considered, and the y-axis represents the accuracy. The plots show that CelebA and Waterbirds achieve high accuracy with a large number of neighbors, indicating that the embeddings are well-separated.  CMNIST, however, shows decreased performance as the number of neighbors increases, likely due to less well-separated embeddings in this dataset.

### In-depth insights


#### Noise Robustness
The research explores methods for enhancing the robustness of fairness-focused machine learning models against noisy labels.  A core challenge addressed is the vulnerability of existing last-layer retraining techniques to noisy data, impacting their ability to achieve fair outcomes across different subgroups.  The proposed solution leverages label spreading via a nearest neighbors graph, acting as a preprocessing step to correct for noisy labels before the fairness correction methods are applied. **This novel approach demonstrably improves the worst-group accuracy**, a key metric for fairness,  **achieving state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and noise levels**.  The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to effectively clean noisy labels using the inherent structure in the data embedding space while adding minimal computational overhead. **The study highlights the critical need for noise-robust fairness-aware techniques and offers a practical and effective solution**.

#### LLR Corrections
Last-layer retraining (LLR) methods offer an efficient approach to correct pre-trained models for subgroup fairness, either using or without group membership information.  **LLR's efficiency stems from modifying only the final layer**, minimizing computational costs and data requirements compared to full model retraining. However, a significant limitation of LLR methods is their vulnerability to noisy labels, which can severely impact accuracy and fairness.  **Existing LLR methods often struggle with noisy labels because the error set, used for retraining, becomes heavily skewed by misclassified majority group samples**. This masks minority group samples and hinders fairness.  **Proposed solutions involving robust loss functions or intricate error set selection techniques have only limited success**. Addressing this challenge is crucial for the widespread adoption of LLR, ensuring fairness while maintaining efficiency even with imperfect data.

#### Label Spreading
The core idea behind label spreading is to **improve the robustness of last-layer retraining methods** against noisy labels by leveraging the information from a point's nearest neighbors. This approach assumes that noisy labels are randomly distributed and that, for a given point, a majority of its nearest neighbors will have clean labels. By iteratively updating label estimates based on a weighted majority vote of a point's neighbors, the method effectively smooths out the noise. The key insight lies in its simplicity and computational efficiency.  The method's **effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the latent space embeddings**, which must be well-separated to ensure accurate propagation of clean labels.  The choice of the number of nearest neighbors (k) is crucial, as a larger k is needed to mitigate higher noise levels, although this can lead to performance degradation in certain scenarios where clusters are not well-separated. **Domain label spreading, on the other hand, appears less effective**, likely due to a less clean and tightly-clustered latent space representation for subgroup membership compared to class labels. Despite this limitation, applying label spreading to the target labels before last-layer retraining significantly improves the robustness and worst-group accuracy of the overall approach.

#### Experimental Setup
The "Experimental Setup" section of a research paper is crucial for reproducibility and assessing the validity of the results.  It should meticulously detail all aspects of the experiments, including **datasets used**, their preprocessing steps, **model architectures**, hyperparameter choices and optimization strategies.  The rationale behind parameter selections must be clearly articulated, highlighting the methods employed (e.g., grid search, cross-validation).  **Metrics used for evaluation** should be explicitly stated along with their significance.  Furthermore, the experimental setup needs to describe the computational resources used, allowing others to gauge the feasibility of replicating the study. Transparency regarding the specific software, hardware, and libraries employed is equally crucial for reproducibility.  A robust experimental setup ensures the work is verifiable and allows researchers to build upon the foundation laid by the study, fostering scientific progress and reducing the likelihood of spurious results due to unclear methodology.

#### Future Work
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the label spreading technique to handle more complex noise models** beyond symmetric noise is crucial for real-world applications.  Investigating the **optimal selection of the number of nearest neighbors (k) in the label spreading process** warrants further study, potentially incorporating adaptive methods that adjust k based on local data characteristics.  Furthermore, a deeper analysis is needed to **understand how different group structures and data distributions affect the performance of the proposed approach**, including developing strategies to mitigate its limitations in challenging scenarios such as highly imbalanced datasets or those with weak spurious correlations.  Finally, the **integration of the proposed label-noise correction methodology into other fairness-enhancing techniques** to create a robust, modular fairness pipeline would significantly expand its practical applicability and impact.

> The figure shows the accuracy of KNN label spreading on three datasets (CelebA, Waterbirds, and CMNIST) under 20% symmetric label noise.  The x-axis represents the number of rounds of label spreading, and the y-axis represents the accuracy. Each line represents a different number of nearest neighbors (k) used in the KNN algorithm. CelebA and Waterbirds show high accuracy with a large number of nearest neighbors, while CMNIST shows lower accuracy and is more sensitive to the number of neighbors and rounds.

> This figure shows the t-SNE visualization of 2048-dimensional latent embeddings reduced to 2 dimensions for three different datasets: CelebA, Waterbirds, and CMNIST.  The visualization reveals the different clustering patterns for each dataset. CelebA and Waterbirds exhibit clear separation between classes, while CMNIST shows a more hierarchical and less clearly separated structure. This difference in clustering patterns can explain why label spreading, which relies on neighbor information, might perform differently on these datasets. The less well-separated clusters in CMNIST could hinder the effectiveness of label propagation because noisy labels from neighboring clusters are more likely to negatively impact the accuracy.

> This figure visualizes the effect of label noise on the RAD algorithm's error set selection and subsequent upweighting.  The left panel (a) shows the error set, where points are colored according to their true class labels. We can see that noisy examples are incorrectly included in the error set. The right panel (b) illustrates the upweighted points from this error set. The upweighting process disproportionately emphasizes noisy majority class samples, leading to a biased retraining set that hurts the worst group accuracy. This demonstrates how RAD fails under sufficient symmetric label noise (SLN) in imbalanced settings.
