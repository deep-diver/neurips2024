The left side displays results for box inpainting, where a square region of the image is masked out and the model attempts to fill it in realistically. The right side presents super-resolution results, demonstrating the ability of the models to upscale lower-resolution images.  Each column represents a different method: Measurement (the input), DPS, DPS+DSG, LGD-MC, Trust (the proposed method), and Ground Truth.
