Traditional methods typically involve a coupled learning and anti-forgetting process, often using knowledge distillation or replay techniques, as shown in (a). In contrast, ZAF (b) decouples these processes, using a zero-shot antidote on unlabeled wild data to stabilize zero-shot predictions and prevent forgetting, while maintaining efficiency with an EMA-LORA architecture.", "section": "4 Theoretical Foundation and Our Approach"}, {"figure_path": "C4zmR2kyP8/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of FAA and CAA metrics for ZAF across various \u03b1 values against 3 baselines.", "description": "This figure compares the Final Average Accuracy (FAA) and Cumulative Average Accuracy (CAA) of the proposed ZAF method against three baseline methods (Joint Learning, ConStruct-VL, and Continual-FT) across three different continual vision-language learning benchmarks (7 Task VG+VAW, 7 Task VG, and 5 Task VAW).
