The competitive ratio is a measure of how well an algorithm performs compared to the optimal solution. The x-axis represents the parameter YD, which quantifies the value that can be recovered from a rejected item. The y-axis represents the competitive ratio. The figure shows that the competitive ratio increases as YD increases, indicating that the lookback mechanism improves the performance of the algorithm. The figure also shows that the competitive ratio is higher in the adversarial order model compared to the random order and IID models. This is because in the adversarial order model, the adversary can choose the order in which the items are observed, which can make it more difficult for the algorithm to select the best item. In the random order model, the order in which the items are observed is random, which makes it less likely that the algorithm will be able to select the best item. In the IID model, the items are sampled independently from the same distribution, which makes it easier for the algorithm to select the best item.", "section": "4 The y-prophet inequality"}]
