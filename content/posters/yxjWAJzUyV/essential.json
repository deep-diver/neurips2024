However, PPO's reliance on heuristics and sensitivity to implementation details hinder its efficiency and scalability.  Existing minimalist approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) lack the performance of PPO.\nThis paper introduces REBEL, a novel RL algorithm that addresses these issues. REBEL elegantly reduces policy optimization to regressing relative rewards, thereby eliminating the need for complex components such as value networks and clipping.  The algorithm's simplicity leads to increased computational efficiency and stability.  Theoretical analysis demonstrates REBEL's equivalence to established algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), inheriting their theoretical guarantees.  Empirical evaluations on various tasks, including language and image generation, show that REBEL either matches or surpasses the performance of PPO and DPO.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "yxjWAJzUyV/podcast.wav"}
