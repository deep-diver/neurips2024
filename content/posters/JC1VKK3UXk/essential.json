Traditional numerical methods often struggle with sample efficiency and generalization to unseen data.  Machine learning offers potential solutions but existing operator learning methods also face limitations like requiring massive datasets for effective training. \n\nThe paper introduces POSEIDON, a foundation model addressing these issues.  It uses a multiscale operator transformer with a novel training strategy to significantly improve sample efficiency and accuracy.  POSEIDON's success is demonstrated on diverse downstream tasks, showcasing its generalizability to a wide range of PDE types.  The availability of open-source code and datasets further advances its potential usage in PDE-related research.
