The right half shows a comparison of generalization ability between SeeX and other methods by comparing performance on Driving-car and Random-video datasets, highlighting the percentage drop in performance due to the distribution shift.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Osh7u2E1kC/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Uncertainty estimation of SeeX and Plan2Explore on the Driving-car dataset.
