It shows the Actual Optimality Gap (AOG) and Perceived Optimality Gap (POG) for both methods, alongside theoretical bounds for the conformal IO method.  The results illustrate how conformal IO significantly outperforms classic IO in terms of both AOG and POG, especially as 'u' increases.", "section": "Numerical Studies"}, {"figure_path": "Y2NWKlrDrX/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Average (std) computational time of classic and conformal IO in seconds.", "description": "This table shows the average and standard deviation of the computational time in seconds for both training and prediction phases of the Classic IO and Conformal IO methods. The training time is for the entire dataset, while the prediction time is reported per decision.  The table breaks down the timing for both the forward optimization problem (FO) and the robust forward optimization problem (RFO) for the Conformal IO method.  It gives a comparison of computational costs between the two approaches for different problem types (shortest path and knapsack).", "section": "5 Numerical Studies"}, {"figure_path": "Y2NWKlrDrX/tables/tables_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Mean (std) AOG and POG by conformal IO when varying point estimate quality.", "description": "This table shows the mean and standard deviation of the actual optimality gap (AOG) and the perceived optimality gap (POG) achieved by the conformal inverse optimization method across different levels of point estimate quality. The point estimate quality is represented by the angular deviation (\u03b4) from the ground truth parameter. As can be seen from the table, the performance of the conformal IO method degrades as the point estimate quality worsens (i.e., as \u03b4 increases).", "section": "5 Numerical Studies"}]
