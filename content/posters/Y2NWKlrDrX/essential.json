This paper tackles this challenge by introducing conformal inverse optimization, a novel method that involves learning an uncertainty set for the unknown parameters and solving a robust optimization problem to make decisions. This approach results in decisions that are both of high quality and consistent with human intuition. \nThe core contribution of conformal inverse optimization lies in its ability to provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the prescribed decisions. The method demonstrates strong empirical performance, outperforming classic inverse optimization methods. This work significantly advances inverse optimization techniques, especially in situations with uncertainties in parameter estimation.  The proposed framework also offers valuable insights into decision-making under uncertainty and opens up exciting new directions for future research in both optimization and machine learning.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Y2NWKlrDrX/podcast.wav"}
