Parameter-efficient techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed, but their performance often lags behind full parameter fine-tuning. This limitation hinders broader access to LLM training, especially for researchers with limited computational resources.  The paper addresses this challenge by examining layer-wise weight norms in LoRA during fine-tuning and discovers a skewed distribution. This observation motivates the proposed method.\n\nThe paper introduces Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a novel optimization method that leverages the concept of importance sampling. LISA selectively updates essential LLM layers while freezing most middle layers, significantly reducing memory consumption. Experiments demonstrate that LISA outperforms LoRA and, in some cases, full parameter fine-tuning across various datasets and model sizes. The results suggest LISA provides a practical alternative to LoRA for memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning, improving accessibility for researchers with limited resources and opening up new avenues for research in parameter-efficient training strategies for large-scale LLMs. **LISA's superior performance and reduced memory requirements are significant contributions**.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "L8ifDX5XNq/podcast.wav"}
