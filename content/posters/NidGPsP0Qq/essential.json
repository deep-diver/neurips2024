However, existing IGL algorithms struggle with personalized rewards, which are context-dependent feedback, lacking theoretical guarantees.  This significantly limits real-world applicability.\nThis paper introduces the first provably efficient algorithms for IGL with personalized rewards.  The key innovation is a novel Lipschitz reward estimator that effectively underestimates the true reward, ensuring favorable generalization properties.  Two algorithms, one based on explore-then-exploit and the other on inverse-gap weighting, are proposed and shown to achieve sublinear regret bounds.  Experiments on image and text feedback data demonstrate the practical value and effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "affiliation": "University of Iowa", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "NidGPsP0Qq/podcast.wav"}
