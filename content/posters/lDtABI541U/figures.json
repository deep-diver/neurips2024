Each molecule is tested with two different neural network ansatzes (LapNet and Psiformer), with and without the Q2VMC optimization method. The graphs illustrate the energy and variance of the wave function over the training steps. The results show that Q2VMC converges faster and achieves lower energies for all tested molecules compared to conventional QVMC methods.", "section": "2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "lDtABI541U/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Optimization curves for different molecules", "description": "This figure displays the optimization curves for six different molecules (Li2, NH3, CO, CH3NH2, C2H6O, C4H6) using both the traditional QVMC method and the proposed Q2VMC method with two different neural network ansatzes (Psiformer and LapNet).

For each molecule, there are two curves, one for QVMC and one for Q2VMC, using two different neural network ansatzes (Psiformer and LapNet). The x-axis represents the number of steps in the optimization process, and the y-axis represents the energy variance.  The figure illustrates the faster convergence of Q2VMC compared to QVMC across all molecules and ansatzes.", "section": "Results"}]
