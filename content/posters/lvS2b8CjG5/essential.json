Existing self-supervised learning methods for EEG often struggle with these issues, leading to suboptimal performance in various applications such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This necessitates more effective methods for extracting universal and reliable EEG representations. \nThis paper introduces EEGPT, a 10-million parameter pretrained transformer model designed to address these challenges. EEGPT employs a novel dual self-supervised learning approach combining spatio-temporal representation alignment and mask-based reconstruction. This method effectively mitigates issues related to low SNR and inter-subject variability while capturing rich semantic information.  The hierarchical structure of EEGPT processes spatial and temporal information separately, enhancing flexibility and computational efficiency.  Experimental results demonstrate that EEGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, showcasing its effectiveness and scalability.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lvS2b8CjG5/podcast.wav"}
