It maintains a version space of classifiers consistent with the observed data and selects a classifier that maximizes the Littlestone dimension of the version space.  This ensures that the algorithm makes progress in reducing the size of the version space with each mistake.", "section": "2.2 Classical Littlestone Dimension"}]
