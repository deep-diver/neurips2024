It begins with an initialization of the weight matrix and iteratively updates weights based on the performance of base classifiers. These classifiers are factorized, meaning they are composed of an input-independent code vector and a label-independent scalar classifier. The algorithm outputs a final discriminant function that combines the results of multiple base classifiers. Each iteration involves selecting a base classifier and adjusting weights to focus more on misclassified data points. The output is a linear combination of base classifiers.", "section": "A The pseudocode of the factorized ADABOOST.MH"}]
