Existing pre-training methods often require extensive interactions to adapt to new tasks. This paper introduces MGPO, a method that uses pre-trained transformer-based policies to model sequences of goals.  **MGPO's pre-training phase uses hindsight multi-goal relabeling and behavior cloning to enable modeling of diverse, long-horizon behaviors.** This efficient online adaptation is achieved through prompt optimization, where the goal sequence (prompt) is optimized to improve task performance. \nMGPO uses a multi-armed bandit framework to enhance prompt selection based on online trajectory returns.  **Experiments across diverse environments show MGPO's significant advantages in sample efficiency, online adaptation, robustness, and interpretability compared to existing methods.** This highlights the potential for efficient online adaptation in various real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "DHucngOEe3/podcast.wav"}
