Note that methods like SPSA (poor convergence aside) can produce RMSNE scores larger than the reported setting prior due to noise in the starting sample. The \u201csetting prior\u201d value is an average RMSNE score over many \u03b8 draws from the shifted prior. Reported errors are empirical standard deviations computed over the five trial runs.", "description": "This table presents the Root Mean Squared Normalized Error (RMSNE) scores achieved by different methods on the Munich traffic network for OD calibration.  It compares SPSA, PC-SPSA, MC-ABC, SNPE, and ASNPE across different congestion levels and time intervals, using two different prior distributions.  The results show the RMSNE values and their standard deviations over five trial runs, highlighting the performance of each method in terms of accuracy and convergence.", "section": "4 Experimental results"}, {"figure_path": "fkuseU0nJs/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Results comparing SNPE-C and ASNPE for various metrics on the Bernoulli GLM, SLCP distractors, and Gaussian mixture tasks from [28]. Experimentation details, metrics, and associated plots can be found in Appendix B.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of SNPE-C and ASNPE on three benchmark tasks from the SBI literature.  It shows the performance of each method across four metrics: C2ST, MMD, MED-DIST, and MEAN-ERR.  Lower values generally indicate better performance.  The results suggest that ASNPE outperforms SNPE-C on most of the metrics across the different tasks.", "section": "4.4 Performance on common SBI benchmarks"}]
