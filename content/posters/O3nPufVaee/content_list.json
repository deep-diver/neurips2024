Image denoising aims to recover a clean (noise-free) image from its noisy counterpart, serving as an important technique in many low-level vision tasks. Recently, deep learning has prominently driven advancements in image denoising; see e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Early works typically take a supervised learning approach to train a neural network (NN) on a dataset with paired noisy and clean images, where noisy images are synthesized by corrupting clean images with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). As observed in [6, 12], a denoising NN trained on AWGN fails to generalize well on real-world noisy images due to the statistical distribution gap between AWGN and real-world noise.

The concept of BSNs has played a significant role in self-supervised learning for various denoising-related tasks. In principle, through specific architectural design, a BSN estimates each output pixel from the surrounding noisy pixels, excluding the corresponding one. This design prevents the network from converging to an identity mapping when trained to minimize the distance between the output of the NN and the input noisy image, as no clean image is available. Note that pixel-wise noise independence is critical for BSN to work effectively.

(a) DSA $\\rightarrow$ Grid SA: The effectiveness of DSA is tested by replacing it with grid SA in SelfFormer-D and reducing the branch number to one, resulting in a true Siamese pair structure similar to SelfFormer-S. Despite some performance gain from mutual learning, this baseline performs significantly worse than the original model. This is due to the arbitrary feature flow, which loses the blind-spot property. (b) w/o CA: We replace all BSCA (CA) modules with DSA (Grid SA) modules. (c) Only SelfFormer-D: We train SelfFormer-D without ${\\mathcal{L}}_{\\mathrm{mutual}}$ and test with it. Without the Siamese structure and mutual learning, the performance noticeably decreases due to the limitations of the constrained attention grids in SelfFormer and the loss of regularization from mutual learning. (d) Only SelfFormer-F: We train SelfFormer-F only using $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{self}}$ and test with it. Lacking any blind-spot mechanism and regularization from mutual learning, this network performs very poorly, indicating overftiting to noisy image. (e) w/o DSA: All DSA (Grid SA) modules are replaced with the BSCA (CA) modules. Since the blind spot property is preserved, the performance remains better than \u201cOnly SelfFormer- $\\cdot\\mathrm{F}^{\\bullet}$ , which lacks this property. (f) w/o WeightShare: In this case, the SelfFormer-D and SelfFormer-F do not share weight, leading to a performance loss.

By improving the signal-to-noise ratio of images, our research can facilitate deeper insights and more effective interventions in these fields. In surveillance, higher clarity images can enhance public safety by providing more detailed visual information. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. In scientific research, improved image quality can lead to better data and more significant discoveries, though there is a risk that overly processed images could misrepresent the original data. In digital media restoration, while the technique helps preserve cultural heritage, it also poses the risk of altering historical records. Despite these possible concerns, our goal is to contribute to enhancing image clarity in critical areas such as public safety, scientific research, and cultural preservation. We emphasize the responsible application and continuous improvement of this technology to mitigate potential risks and maximize its positive impact.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
