### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) struggles with non-Euclidean distance matrices, often discarding valuable information from negative eigenvalues.  This limitation hinders accurate dimension reduction in applications dealing with complex data like graph networks or those arising from physics models, where non-Euclidean geometries are common.  Previous attempts to improve upon classical MDS haven't fully addressed these core issues, resulting in suboptimal solutions and a 'dimensionality paradox' where increasing dimensions can worsen results.

This research introduces Non-Euclidean MDS (Neuc-MDS), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations.  Neuc-MDS cleverly generalizes the inner product to symmetric bilinear forms, effectively utilizing both positive and negative eigenvalues of the dissimilarity Gram matrix.  Through rigorous error analysis and optimal algorithms, Neuc-MDS significantly reduces STRESS (sum of squared error) and avoids the dimensionality paradox. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements over classical MDS and other state-of-the-art techniques.

### In-depth insights


#### Non-Euclidean MDS
The concept of "Non-Euclidean MDS" extends classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) by addressing its limitations when dealing with non-Euclidean distance matrices.  **Classical MDS assumes Euclidean geometry**, which restricts its applicability to datasets where distances conform to the properties of Euclidean space.  **Non-Euclidean MDS generalizes the underlying geometric assumptions**, enabling the analysis of datasets exhibiting dissimilarities that violate the triangle inequality or include negative values.  This generalization is achieved by replacing the standard inner product with symmetric bilinear forms, allowing the algorithm to leverage both positive and negative eigenvalues of the dissimilarity Gram matrix.  This approach enhances the accuracy and interpretability of the results, effectively resolving the dimensionality paradox‚Äîa phenomenon where increasing the dimensionality in classical MDS can unexpectedly worsen the error.  **By incorporating the complete spectrum of eigenvalues**, Non-Euclidean MDS provides a more robust and informative representation of complex relationships within the data.

#### Bilinear Form
The concept of a bilinear form is central to the paper's approach to non-Euclidean multidimensional scaling (MDS).  Instead of relying on the standard Euclidean inner product, which assumes Euclidean geometry, **the authors generalize to symmetric bilinear forms**. This allows them to handle datasets with dissimilarities that are non-Euclidean and non-metric, including those with negative eigenvalues in their Gram matrix.  By optimizing over the choice of bilinear forms (specifically, via eigenvalue selection), the method effectively captures the underlying geometry of the data, overcoming limitations of classical MDS which only considers positive eigenvalues and thus imposes a Euclidean structure inappropriately.  The bilinear form allows for more flexibility in representing the relationships between data points, leading to potentially more accurate and insightful low-dimensional embeddings. The use of bilinear forms is a key innovation that provides a theoretically grounded extension of MDS to a broader class of datasets.

#### STRESS Error
The concept of STRESS error is central to the paper's evaluation of multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques.  **STRESS, or the sum of squared differences between input dissimilarities and embedded distances, quantifies the accuracy of the embedding**.  The paper introduces non-Euclidean MDS (Neuc-MDS) to address limitations of classical MDS, particularly its suboptimal performance and the dimensionality paradox (STRESS increasing with added dimensions) when dealing with non-Euclidean data.  A key contribution is the in-depth analysis of the STRESS error, decomposing it into three terms to gain a deeper understanding of its behavior.  Neuc-MDS leverages this analysis to **optimally select eigenvalues**, not discarding the negative ones as classical MDS does, resulting in lower STRESS. The theoretical analysis examines the asymptotic behavior of STRESS for both classical and Neuc-MDS on random matrices, **demonstrating Neuc-MDS's superior performance** in reducing the error, especially for high-dimensional embeddings.  This theoretical analysis, along with extensive empirical evaluation on diverse datasets, ultimately validates the effectiveness of Neuc-MDS in achieving lower STRESS and resolving the dimensionality paradox.

#### Eigenvalue Selection
The eigenvalue selection process is critical for the success of Non-Euclidean Multidimensional Scaling (Neuc-MDS).  The core idea is to select a subset of eigenvalues from the dissimilarity matrix's eigendecomposition to minimize the STRESS error, which quantifies the discrepancy between the input dissimilarities and the embedded distances.  **Optimal selection isn't simply choosing the largest k eigenvalues**, as classical MDS does.  Instead, Neuc-MDS leverages both positive and negative eigenvalues.  A key contribution is the development of an efficient algorithm to solve this eigenvalue selection problem, which is shown to be solvable in polynomial time, despite the NP-hard nature of general quadratic integer programming. The algorithm cleverly balances positive and negative eigenvalues to minimize the STRESS error's lower bound. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm demonstrates its effectiveness in achieving a better approximation than classical MDS, especially for high-dimensional data, effectively resolving the dimensionality paradox of classical MDS. **The approach moves beyond a binary selection to consider general linear combinations of eigenvalues**, leading to an even more refined algorithm (Neuc-MDS+), achieving even lower STRESS errors in many cases.

#### Dimensionality Paradox
The "Dimensionality Paradox" in classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) highlights a critical limitation: **increasing the dimensionality of the embedding does not always lead to improved accuracy**.  In fact,  STRESS, a common measure of embedding error, can paradoxically *increase* as more dimensions are added, especially when dealing with non-Euclidean data. This counterintuitive behavior stems from the inherent assumptions of Euclidean geometry within classical MDS, which are violated by non-Euclidean distances. **Classical MDS attempts to force non-Euclidean data into an inappropriate Euclidean framework**, leading to suboptimal and unstable solutions.  The authors of the paper address this by proposing Neuc-MDS, which generalizes MDS to non-Euclidean spaces, enabling better handling of negative eigenvalues and ultimately resolving the paradox.  Neuc-MDS leverages symmetric bilinear forms, providing a more robust embedding that avoids the pitfalls of the Euclidean constraints and achieves lower STRESS even with higher dimensionality.
