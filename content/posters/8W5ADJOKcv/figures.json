Eigenvalues Distribution of Renal", "description": "This figure shows the distribution of eigenvalues for the Renal dataset.  The x-axis represents the eigenvalue values, and the y-axis represents the count of eigenvalues within each bin. The distribution is bimodal, showing a significant number of both negative and positive eigenvalues. The red bars represent negative eigenvalues, while the blue bars represent positive eigenvalues.  This bimodal distribution highlights the non-Euclidean nature of the data, as Euclidean data would primarily exhibit positive eigenvalues.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "8W5ADJOKcv/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Neuc-MDS and Neuc-MDS+ consistently produce lower STRESS on all dimensions.", "description": "The figure shows the STRESS values for four different methods (Neuc-MDS, Neuc-MDS+, cMDS, and Lower-MDS) across different target dimensions.

It demonstrates that Neuc-MDS and Neuc-MDS+ consistently achieve lower STRESS than the other methods across various dimensions. The plot for Lower-MDS is shorter because its target dimension k is limited by the number of positive eigenvalues, unlike Neuc-MDS and Neuc-MDS+. This figure visually highlights the advantage of Neuc-MDS and Neuc-MDS+ in addressing the dimensionality paradox, where increasing the dimension in classical MDS can sometimes lead to higher STRESS.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
