Existing solutions like increasing training data or using sophisticated positional encodings (PE) are resource-intensive and time-consuming.  This paper explores the limitations of existing approaches and highlights the critical role of meticulously designed PE in addressing the extrapolation issue.\nThe paper introduces Mesa-Extrapolation, a novel method that utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and a new weave PE strategy, Stair PE.  **This approach achieves improved extrapolation performance** without additional training.  **Key findings reveal a significantly reduced memory footprint and faster inference speed** compared to other techniques.  The paper also provides a theoretical analysis, confirming that weave PE enables extending the effective length of LLMs.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "zaXuMqOAF4/podcast.wav"}
