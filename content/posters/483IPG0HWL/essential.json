Automating this process has been a longstanding challenge, with traditional hyper-heuristics limited by pre-defined heuristic spaces.  Large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities but often lack reasoning and sample efficiency. \n\nReEvo addresses these issues by integrating evolutionary search with LLM reflections. This enables efficient exploration of open-ended heuristic spaces and provides verbal gradients for improved LLM guidance.  ReEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple COPs and algorithmic types, demonstrating superior sample efficiency.  Its application to diverse problems showcases its potential to transform the field of combinatorial optimization, paving the way for more automated and efficient solution generation.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "483IPG0HWL/podcast.wav"}
