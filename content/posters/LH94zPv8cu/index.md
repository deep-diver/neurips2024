### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for video inverse problems using image diffusion models often lead to issues like flickering and temporal inconsistencies in the generated videos. This is mainly because these methods treat each frame independently, ignoring the inherent temporal correlations within a video sequence.  The paper argues that a more effective approach is to consider frames as continuous functions and videos as sequences of warping transformations. 



The proposed solution, named Warped Diffusion, uses function space diffusion models to overcome these challenges.  It introduces a simple yet powerful test-time guidance mechanism to ensure temporal consistency.  By viewing videos as sequences of continuous warping transformations, the method leverages state-of-the-art image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion XL to generate temporally consistent video outputs.  Experimental results show Warped Diffusion outperforms existing approaches, showcasing enhanced performance on video inpainting and super-resolution tasks.

> This table presents the quantitative results of single-frame evaluation for super-resolution and inpainting models. The models were trained with either independent noise or correlated noise from a Gaussian Process.  The evaluation metrics include FID, Inception Score, CLIP Text Score, CLIP Image Score, SSIM, LPIPS, and MSE.  Higher scores for Inception, CLIP Text Score, CLIP Image Score and SSIM indicate better performance; lower scores for FID, LPIPS and MSE indicate better performance. The results show that finetuning with correlated noise does not compromise performance, and GP models slightly outperform models trained with independent noise in the inpainting task.





### In-depth insights


#### Function Space DMs
Function space diffusion models (DMs) offer a powerful approach to video generation and manipulation by treating video frames as continuous functions.  This contrasts with traditional frame-by-frame methods, which often suffer from temporal inconsistencies. **The key advantage lies in the inherent ability to model temporal correlations directly within the function space**, leading to smoother, more realistic videos.  By employing techniques like Gaussian processes to sample noise functions, these models elegantly handle the infinite-dimensional nature of continuous image representations.  Furthermore, ensuring equivariance under warping transformations is crucial for temporal consistency and this can be achieved through specialized sampling mechanisms like self-guidance during inference. **Equivariance guarantees that the model's output is consistent with the warping of the input**, preventing flickering and other artifacts. Although computationally more expensive than some traditional methods, the gains in temporal coherence and the potential for leveraging pre-trained image DMs make function space DMs a promising direction for video processing tasks.

#### Equivariance Guidance
The concept of 'Equivariance Guidance' in the context of video generation using diffusion models addresses a critical challenge: maintaining temporal consistency.  Naively applying image diffusion models frame-by-frame often results in flickering artifacts and temporal inconsistencies.  **Equivariance Guidance aims to enforce temporal coherence by ensuring the generated frames behave consistently under warping transformations**‚Äîa key aspect of video, representing movement and deformation.  This is achieved by guiding the diffusion model's sampling process toward solutions that remain consistent across frames when subjected to these transformations, as defined by optical flow.  **The method cleverly leverages the power of existing image diffusion models without requiring extensive retraining on video data**, making it a practical and efficient approach. By ensuring equivariance, the method aims to generate videos that are temporally coherent, resolving the flickering and texture inconsistencies frequently seen in naive frame-by-frame applications of image diffusion models to video. The core idea is to seamlessly incorporate temporal consistency during inference, leading to improved visual quality and more realistic video results.  **This technique fundamentally addresses a core limitation of directly applying image models to video, improving the quality and robustness of video generation.**  The effectiveness of this approach highlights the potential of cleverly adapting image-based methods for video processing tasks.

#### GP Noise Warping
The proposed method of 'GP Noise Warping' offers a novel approach to address temporal inconsistencies in video generation using image diffusion models.  Instead of relying on simplistic noise transformations like resampling or interpolation which often lead to blurry or unrealistic results, this method leverages the power of Gaussian Processes (GPs).  **GPs allow for continuous evaluation of the noise function at arbitrary locations**, overcoming limitations of methods that operate solely on discrete grid points.  By defining images and noise as functions and the generator as a mapping between functional spaces, **the warping is done directly in the function space**, leading to a more principled and robust handling of spatial transformations inherent in video sequences.  This approach elegantly tackles both interpolation and inpainting challenges, resulting in superior video quality. **Equivariance self-guidance**, a post-hoc sampling mechanism, further enhances the temporal coherence by enforcing consistency under warping transformations.  This eliminates the need for extensive video data training, making the approach versatile and practical.

#### Video Restoration
Video restoration, a crucial aspect of video processing, aims to recover degraded video quality.  **Effective restoration tackles various issues, including noise reduction, blur mitigation, and artifact removal.**  Current approaches leverage advanced techniques like deep learning models, particularly diffusion models, to achieve high-quality results. These models can learn complex mappings between degraded and pristine video frames. However, **naive applications often struggle with temporal consistency, leading to flickering artifacts and inconsistencies across frames.**  Advanced methods address this challenge by incorporating temporal information, for instance, using optical flow to align frames or employing recurrent neural networks to capture temporal dependencies.  **The choice of model architecture significantly impacts the quality and computational cost** of the restoration process.  Equivariance, the property of a model to maintain consistent output under transformations, is also important to ensure smooth, natural-looking restorations. Future directions include **developing more efficient models capable of handling high-resolution videos in real-time, as well as addressing more challenging degradation types.**  Furthermore, investigating the integration of other modalities, such as audio and text, could lead to further improvements in the accuracy and fidelity of video restoration.  Ultimately, the goal is to develop **robust and versatile video restoration methods that can seamlessly integrate into various video applications.**

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on Warped Diffusion could explore several promising avenues. **Improving efficiency** is paramount; the current method's computational demands limit its applicability to longer videos.  Investigating more efficient optical flow estimation techniques or exploring alternative warping strategies could significantly reduce processing time.  **Extending the model's capacity** to handle more complex transformations and scenarios, such as those involving occlusions or significant viewpoint changes, is crucial. The current approach relies heavily on accurate optical flow estimation; robustness to noisy or incomplete flow fields needs further development.  **Generalizing the approach** beyond inpainting and super-resolution to encompass other video inverse problems, like denoising or deblurring, represents another valuable direction. Finally, **a deeper theoretical analysis** of the relationship between equivariance and temporal consistency in function space diffusion models could yield significant insights and potentially lead to more principled and robust methods.  The investigation into alternative functional representations beyond Gaussian processes could enhance model flexibility and performance.
