The models were trained with either independent noise or correlated noise from a Gaussian Process.  The evaluation metrics include FID, Inception Score, CLIP Text Score, CLIP Image Score, SSIM, LPIPS, and MSE.  Higher scores for Inception, CLIP Text Score, CLIP Image Score and SSIM indicate better performance; lower scores for FID, LPIPS and MSE indicate better performance. The results show that finetuning with correlated noise does not compromise performance, and GP models slightly outperform models trained with independent noise in the inpainting task.", "section": "4.1 Training with correlated noise"}, {"figure_path": "LH94zPv8cu/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Mean-frame evaluation of inpainting models for the translation task.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for video inpainting, specifically focusing on the task of frame translation.  It shows the average performance across several frames, evaluating the performance of each method with respect to several metrics commonly used for image quality assessment. The metrics include FID, Inception score, CLIP text/image scores, SSIM, LPIPS and MSE. Additionally, it reports a warping error, measuring the temporal consistency of the model's predictions across frames.", "section": "4.2 Noise Warping and Equivariance Self Guidance"}, {"figure_path": "LH94zPv8cu/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Mean-frame evaluation of super-resolution models for real videos.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different super-resolution models on real videos.  It evaluates the performance of several methods across various metrics, including FID, Inception Score, CLIP scores (text and image), SSIM, LPIPS, and MSE.  The methods are categorized into noise warping baselines and the proposed Warped Diffusion model. The warping error is also included as a measure of temporal consistency.  The results highlight the performance gains achieved by Warped Diffusion in terms of both restoration quality and temporal consistency.", "section": "4.3 Effect of Sampling Guidance for more general transformations"}]
