Our approach is consistently competitive across the experiments.", "description": "This figure presents the sample complexity results for different algorithms tackling the Confounded Pure Exploration Transductive Linear Bandit (CPET-LB) problem, categorized by whether the structural model parameter \u0393 is known or unknown.  The algorithms are compared across different experimental settings, including a 'Jump-Around' instance and an 'Interpolation' instance.  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CPEG algorithm in achieving consistently competitive sample complexity compared to baseline methods, irrespective of whether \u0393 is known or not.  The chart visually represents the sample complexity, providing a clear comparison of performance across various scenarios.", "section": "E Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "2mqiTiJKrx/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Sample complexity for algorithms on CPET-LB problems.
