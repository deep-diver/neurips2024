{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in online services and causal inference because it addresses the critical issue of **confounding in A/B testing**.  It offers a novel methodology for **adaptive experimentation** when direct randomization isn't feasible, presenting valuable algorithms and theoretical guarantees. The findings are particularly relevant to those working with **encouragement designs** and instrumental variables, broadening the scope of effective online experimentation.", "summary": "Adaptive experimentation tackles confounding in online A/B tests using encouragement designs and a novel linear bandit approach, achieving near-optimal sample complexity.", "takeaways": ["Introduced the confounded pure exploration transductive linear bandit (CPET-LB) problem, addressing biased treatment effect estimates due to self-selection.", "Developed novel algorithms using experimental design and finite-time confidence intervals for efficient treatment effect estimation in CPET-LB settings.", "Provided nearly minimax optimal sample complexity upper bounds for proposed algorithms."], "tldr": "Many online services cannot directly A/B test due to business constraints.  Instead, they use encouragement designs, but comparing treatment and control groups based on self-selection can lead to biased results. This study addresses this \"confounded pure exploration\" problem, which arises when user engagement is influenced by unobserved factors related to treatment response. \nThe paper proposes a novel approach using transductive linear bandits and encouragement designs, formulated as the CPET-LB problem.  It introduces elimination-style algorithms that adapt to the confounded data, incorporating a new finite-time confidence interval to estimate treatment effects.  The researchers provide theoretical guarantees on sample complexity, showing that their method achieves performance close to the theoretical optimum, and demonstrate efficacy via experimental results.", "affiliation": "University of Arizona", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "2mqiTiJKrx/podcast.wav"}
