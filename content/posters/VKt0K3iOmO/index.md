### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) suffer from high computational costs and energy consumption. Spiking GNNs, inspired by the brain's energy efficiency, offer a promising alternative, but existing models primarily focus on Euclidean spaces and face challenges with high latency during training. This paper addresses these limitations by developing a novel Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG) that operates on Riemannian manifolds, thereby capturing the inherent geometric properties of graph data. 

The MSG utilizes a newly designed spiking neuron which incorporates structural information into spike trains through graph convolution.  Unlike prior approaches, MSG employs 'Differentiation via Manifold', an alternative training method that avoids the limitations of backpropagation. This method replaces the traditional back-propagation-through-time (BPTT) with a novel technique that is recurrence-free and computationally efficient. Theoretical analysis shows that MSG approximates a solver of manifold ordinary differential equations, providing a strong theoretical foundation. Experimental results demonstrate MSG's superior performance and energy efficiency compared to existing spiking GNNs and traditional GNNs on various datasets.

> üîº This figure illustrates the architecture of the Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG).  The input is a graph G represented as spike trains S<sup>0</sup>. These spike trains are processed by multiple Manifold Spiking Layers (MS Layers). Each MS Layer contains a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a Manifold Spiking Neuron. The GCN incorporates structural information from the graph into the spike trains. The Manifold Spiking Neuron emits new spike trains and updates manifold representations using a diffeomorphism and exponential map. This process repeats across multiple layers, resulting in the final manifold representation Z<sup>L</sup> and spike trains S<sup>L</sup>, which are then used for downstream tasks.

### In-depth insights


#### Riemannian SNNs
Riemannian SNNs represent a significant advancement in neural network research, combining the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with the ability of Riemannian geometry to handle complex, non-Euclidean data structures.  **This approach directly addresses limitations of traditional SNNs**, which often struggle with data that cannot be easily embedded into Euclidean space. By leveraging Riemannian manifolds, these networks can naturally model data with inherent hierarchical or non-linear relationships, like those found in graph data. **The key innovation lies in the development of new spiking neuron models** that operate directly on Riemannian manifolds and enable efficient backpropagation through time. This avoids the computational burden and high latency often associated with surrogate gradients used in conventional SNNs.  The theoretical underpinnings of Riemannian SNNs often involve elegant mathematical formulations, including diffeomorphisms and geodesic flows, to ensure robust and efficient learning.  **The potential applications of Riemannian SNNs are broad**, ranging from graph neural networks for complex data analysis to more energy-efficient hardware implementations of artificial intelligence systems.  However, **challenges remain in developing efficient algorithms** and optimizing the training process, especially for high-dimensional manifolds. Further research in this field could significantly impact various areas of machine learning and neuroscience.

#### Manifold Spiking
The concept of "Manifold Spiking" blends **two distinct fields**: the geometry of Riemannian manifolds and the dynamics of spiking neural networks (SNNs).  It suggests representing and processing information within the complex, non-Euclidean spaces of manifolds, using the energy-efficient and biologically plausible communication method of SNNs. This approach presents several advantages: **increased representational power** by capturing the inherent geometric relationships of data, improved **energy efficiency** due to SNN's inherent low-power operation, and potentially novel computational capabilities.  However, it also poses significant challenges.  The non-differentiable nature of spikes in SNNs requires novel training algorithms, and implementing operations within manifolds necessitates sophisticated mathematical techniques.  Therefore, "Manifold Spiking" research would likely focus on designing new neuron models suitable for manifold spaces, developing efficient training methods (possibly bypassing backpropagation), and exploring applications where the inherent geometry of the data is crucial.

#### DvM Training
The proposed DvM (Differentiation via Manifold) training method presents a novel approach to address the limitations of traditional backpropagation methods in spiking neural networks (SNNs).  **Unlike conventional BPTT (Backpropagation Through Time) which suffers from high latency due to its recurrent nature,** DvM leverages the geometric properties of Riemannian manifolds to enable a more efficient and direct computation of gradients. By decoupling the forward and backward passes, and employing the concept of diffeomorphism, DvM avoids the time-consuming iterative calculations of BPTT, leading to significantly faster training times. The theoretical foundation of DvM is rooted in differential geometry, particularly in the concepts of pullback and pushforward, ensuring the method's rigorousness. **This allows the replacement of the non-differentiable spike trains with differentiable manifold representations**, simplifying the gradient computation. The resulting algorithm showcases superior performance compared to existing spiking GNN training techniques, with improvements in both accuracy and energy efficiency.

#### MSG Neural ODE
The heading 'MSG Neural ODE' suggests a novel approach that merges Manifold-valued Spiking GNNs (MSGs) with the framework of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  This implies a significant departure from traditional GNNs.  **Instead of discrete graph convolutions, the model likely uses continuous-time dynamics described by ODEs on Riemannian manifolds.**  This could provide improved expressiveness for modeling complex relationships in non-Euclidean graph data.  The spiking aspect suggests an energy-efficient architecture, capitalizing on the biological inspiration of SNNs.  **The Riemannian manifold setting addresses the limitation of Euclidean-space GNNs by incorporating geometric information inherent in graph structures,** enabling better handling of hierarchical or hyperbolic relationships often present in real-world networks. Combining this with the ODE framework offers a powerful tool for modeling dynamic processes on graphs. This approach's theoretical underpinnings potentially involve rigorous mathematical analysis and could lead to more stable and efficient training algorithms. However, this sophistication may also present challenges in terms of computational cost and model interpretability.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore extending the Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG) to handle **dynamic graphs**, a significant challenge in current spiking neural network research.  This would involve adapting the model to process evolving graph structures and relationships, which could lead to breakthroughs in applications with dynamic data streams. Another promising avenue is investigating the performance of MSG on **larger-scale, real-world graphs**.  Scaling the model efficiently remains a crucial aspect of practical application.  Furthermore, research into **different Riemannian manifolds** beyond those already considered could uncover improved model performance for specific graph topologies and relationship types. The use of **different spiking neuron models**  should also be investigated to better understand the trade-offs between model complexity, computational cost, and accuracy. Finally, exploring the implications of MSG's theoretical connections to manifold ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for advanced model design and interpretation warrants further investigation.

It shows how the layer processes both spike trains (representing temporal information) and manifold representations (representing spatial/structural information) in parallel.  The forward pass involves graph convolution (GCN) and a manifold spiking neuron (MSNeuron). The backward pass, however, deviates from standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) by employing a novel method called Differentiation via Manifold (DvM), represented by the red dashed line. This DvM method is designed to improve efficiency and overcome latency issues associated with BPTT in spiking neural networks.

The logarithmic map is used to create these charts, mapping points on the manifold to corresponding points in tangent spaces that are locally Euclidean. The figure shows the process of using a series of charts to approximate a continuous path (the red dotted line) on the manifold, which is a common technique in solving manifold ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  This visual helps explain the theoretical foundation of how the proposed model approximates a dynamic chart solver for manifold ODEs.
