It shows various metrics (mAP, NDS, mIoU, FPS, GFLOPS) for different model configurations, including single-modal (LiDAR or Camera only), multi-modal, and models using knowledge distillation with VeXKD. The results illustrate the effectiveness of VeXKD in improving performance and closing the gap between single-modal and multi-modal models.
