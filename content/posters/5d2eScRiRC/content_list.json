Despite the widespread perspective of RL for aligning and fine-tuning language models (via RLHF), supervised learning via maximum likelihood estimation for next token prediction remains the dominant component of our imitation learning pipelines due to its simplicity and scalability. However, pure MLE for next token prediction (including \u201cteacher forcing\u201d [64]) can create challenges in autoregressive models, many of which being related to classic challenges with behavior cloning [8], its equivalent in the context of sequential decision making. Compounding errors can occur due to iterative model application creating data sequences which further shift from the training distribution [56, 30], growing increasingly likely for longer sequences [16]. In particular, a model\u2019s own samples can cause such distribution shifts and exposure bias [52, 6, 5]. Taking the RL perspective to imitation aims to mitigate these issues via dynamics-aware optimization, where each action is optimized for the impact on the whole future trajectory. It further enables a shift from passive to active learning, where the system actively generates data. Furthermore, best performance of the fine-tuned model is only one metric of importance. Indeed, continued alignment of language models to human preferences requires sampling for a given prompt, collecting human preferences over these completions, and finally aligning the model via preference fine-tuning. Improving the diversity of sampled completions via temperature sampling [7], or using mixtures of past models [61] has been linked to performance improvements.

Imitation learning assumes a dataset of expert demonstrations, and the aim is to train a policy that matches the expert. There are two broad categories of imitation learning approaches: behavioral cloning (BC) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In BC, a policy is trained using regression to directly mimic the expert demonstrations [49]. This is analogous to supervised fine-tuning of language models via MLE. BC requires sufficient data coverage to perform well, and suffers from compounding errors at evaluation time, as the policy deviates from the state distribution covered by the demonstrations. This can be alleviated by additionally querying the expert for the correct action in the states visited by the agent [56]. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Inverse reinforcement learning. In contrast, IRL jointly infers the policy and reward function, such that the provided expert demonstrations are optimal under the reward function, and the learned policy maximizes this reward function [44]. By using additional environment interactions beyond the demonstrations, IRL can in theory overcome the compounding errors observed with BC [70]. Note that IRL is related to RL from human feedback (RLHF) but differs in key aspects: IRL also learns both a reward and policy, but extracts information from demonstration and agent data rather than paired preference data [31]. The game-theoretic approach to IRL treats the optimization problem as a zero-sum two-player game [60]. A subset of recent IRL methods can be seen as combining game-theoretic IRL with entropy regularization of the policy, where the doubly-nested optimization is implemented with a classifier (GAIL [25], DAC [35], AIRL [19]), implicit reward functions (ValueDICE [36], IQLearn [20]), or a Lagrangian dual objective (PPIL [62]). The stable, large-scale application of inverse RL methods has been a persistent goal throughout these developments. The classical requirement for complete RL optimization before updating the reward function has presented a limitation [75] which can be overcome via abstracted [68, 9] or linearized models [18], iterative adversarial training [25, 19] or lastly saddlepoint-based value function based formulations [20]. We expand on the insights of the latter to evaluate the competitive performance of computationally cheap offline IRL and emphasise the connection between MLE and IRL [48].

Indeed, the link can already be made from MLE, commonly referred to as Behavioral Cloning (BC) [8] from an imitation perspective. Although the link to imitation has been made explicit recently, either theoretically [59], or in the case of distillation and divergence minimisation [1, 28, 40, 26, 39], some works had already tackled the issues of MLE with imitation-like techniques. For example, adversarial training of text generation an alternative to MLE was first proposed in SeqGAN [71], and followed-up by a series of work using GANs for text generation [32]. These methods have been shown to work only in the temperature 1 regime [11], a possible shortcoming that we address in Section 3. Then, leveraging the literature of imitation learning, GAIL was successfully adapted to language [65], showing an improvement over MLE. Closer to our contributions, IQLearn is utilized for language in SequenceMatch [15]. Key differences to our work include the reformulation as temporal difference regularized MLE, large-scale analysis including other inverse RL methods and focus on computational costs via the application of offline IQLearn. Indeed, SequenceMatch requires the use of online data, via the introduction of the \"backward\" token, that allows the model to change a previously chosen token during sampling.
