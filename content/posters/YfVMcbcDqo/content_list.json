One such application is tumor treatment planning, which relies on accurately estimating the spatial distribution of tumor cells within a patient\u2019s anatomy. While medical imaging can detect the bulk of a tumor, it cannot capture the full extent of its spread, as low-concentration tumor cells often remain undetectable, particularly in glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor. Machine learning approaches struggle to estimate the complete tumor cell distribution due to a lack of appropriate training data. Consequently, most existing methods rely on physics-based simulations to generate anatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these approaches face challenges with complex and unknown initial conditions and are constrained by overly rigid physical models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that integrates data-driven and physics-based cost functions, akin to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, our approach parametrizes the solution directly on a dynamic discrete mesh, allowing for the effective modeling of complex biomechanical behaviors. Specifically, we propose a unique discretization scheme that quantifies how well the learned spatiotemporal distributions of tumor and brain tissues adhere to their respective growth and elasticity equations. This quantification acts as a regularization term, offering greater flexibility and improved integration of patient data compared to existing models. We demonstrate enhanced coverage of tumor recurrence areas using real-world data from a patient cohort, highlighting the potential of our method to improve model-driven treatment planning for glioblastoma in clinical practice.
