[{"heading_title": "Gradient Sketching", "details": {"summary": "Gradient sketching is a crucial technique for scaling machine learning algorithms to massive datasets.  It addresses the memory bottleneck inherent in storing and manipulating high-dimensional gradient vectors by projecting them into lower-dimensional spaces. This projection, while lossy, preserves essential geometric properties of the gradients, allowing for efficient computation of quantities like training data attribution and Hessian information. **The key challenge lies in designing efficient sketching algorithms that balance dimensionality reduction with accuracy and computational speed.**  The paper explores this design space, highlighting the limitations of existing methods like the Fastfood Transform and proposing novel algorithms like AFFD and AFJL, which are optimized for modern hardware. **These novel algorithms offer robust theoretical guarantees and demonstrate superior performance on GPUs and TPUs.** They offer new possibilities for training data analysis, and enable the investigation of Hessian properties in large language models, leading to a deeper understanding of these complex systems. **The findings challenge prevailing assumptions about intrinsic dimensionality and Hessian structure in LLMs**, suggesting the need for new theoretical tools and algorithmic approaches."}}, {"heading_title": "TDA Scaling", "details": {"summary": "The paper delves into the challenges of scaling training data attribution (TDA) for large neural networks.
