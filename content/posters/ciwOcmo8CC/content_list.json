IF-Font significantly surpasses competitors in all reference glyph number settings for both datasets. Notably, IF-Font\u2019s performance on FID metric is exceptionally low, reaching a single-digit score, thanks to the high quality and clarity of the samples it generates. FS-Font [47] relies heavily on the predefined content-reference mapping, whereas the reference glyphs in all our experiments are randomly selected. Especially, when only one reference glyph is provided, covering all components of the target character becomes challenging, leading to poor performance of FS-Font, as shown in Fig. 10a. NTF [10] also struggles to imitate the target style, the layout of its generated samples often resembles that of the source font. In cases where there\u2019s a significant disparity between the source and target styles, NTF is prone to missing strokes.

This is achieved by formulating legal IDSs, which is a salient advantage over other methods that typically require the character to be present in at least one font as a precondition for generation.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
