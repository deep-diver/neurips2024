The left side shows the traditional style-content disentangling method, which separates a glyph's content and style features.  The right side illustrates the proposed IF-Font method, which uses an autoregressive model to predict target tokens based on the Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) and reference glyphs, then decodes these tokens to generate the final glyph. The key difference highlighted is the use of IDS instead of relying on source glyph content disentanglement, which is prone to artifacts.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ciwOcmo8CC/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of our proposed method.

The IHA module processes the input target character to extract its Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS). The SSA module takes the reference characters and their corresponding glyph images as input, extracts style features, and aggregates them based on the similarity between the target character's IDS and the reference characters' IDSs. Finally, the decoder uses both semantic and style features to generate the target glyph using a VQGAN decoder.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "ciwOcmo8CC/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The illustration of equivalent IDSs.", "description": "This figure shows that a single Chinese character can have multiple equivalent Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS).  The figure illustrates this by showing three different but equivalent IDS representations for the characters \"\u6811\" (tree) and \"\u514b\" (gram).
