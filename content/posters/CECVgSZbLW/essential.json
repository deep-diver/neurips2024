Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL), which models value functions as distributions rather than single values, shows promise but hasn't been fully integrated into MCTS.  This is a significant limitation because many real-world problems are inherently stochastic.\nThis paper introduces two novel algorithms, CATS and PATS, which address this gap.  **CATS and PATS leverage distributional RL to model uncertainty within MCTS**, using categorical and particle-based distributions respectively. They also incorporate Thompson Sampling for action selection, improving exploration and exploitation. The paper offers theoretical guarantees on the algorithms' performance and provides empirical evidence supporting their effectiveness across various stochastic and deterministic environments.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "CECVgSZbLW/podcast.wav"}
