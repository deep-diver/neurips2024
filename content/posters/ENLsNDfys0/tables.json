The comparison uses five metrics: DINO-I (image similarity), CLIP-T (text-image similarity), AES (aesthetic score), HPS (human preference score), Fscore (a novel similarity score combining text and image similarities), and Bsim (balance similarity). Higher scores are better for all metrics except Bsim, where a lower score indicates better balance between text and image features in the generated images. The results show that ATIH achieves the best performance in AES, HPS, Fscore and Bsim metrics, suggesting superior visual appeal, human preference, and harmonious integration of text and image features compared to other models.
