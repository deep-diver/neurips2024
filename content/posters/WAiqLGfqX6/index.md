### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) are effective surrogate models for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they often struggle to accurately approximate solution derivatives, especially when training data is scarce. This paper introduces Derivative-enhanced DeepONets (DE-DeepONets) to address this limitation.  The key issue is that existing neural operators do not provide accurate estimates of the derivative of the output with respect to the input, which is necessary for many downstream tasks.

DE-DeepONets improve upon DeepONets by incorporating derivative information into the training process and using a dimension reduction technique to reduce computational cost and improve training efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DE-DeepONets outperform existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly when the amount of training data is limited.  Furthermore, the approach can easily be generalized to other neural operators such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO).

### In-depth insights


#### Derivative DeepONets
Derivative DeepONets represent a significant advancement in the field of neural operators by leveraging derivative information to enhance accuracy and efficiency.  **The core idea is to incorporate derivative information explicitly into the DeepONet architecture**, moving beyond simply approximating the solution to also accurately approximating its derivative with respect to input parameters. This is particularly beneficial when training data is scarce, a common challenge in many scientific applications of DeepONets.  **The enhanced accuracy comes from a better representation of the solution manifold**, allowing for more accurate predictions, especially concerning derivatives crucial for downstream tasks like optimization or uncertainty quantification.  By incorporating derivative loss into the training process, the model is further guided towards approximating both the solution and its derivative effectively, resulting in improved performance with potentially fewer training samples. While computationally more expensive in training due to derivative calculations, the resulting enhanced accuracy and efficient evaluation, particularly regarding derivatives, makes Derivative DeepONets a powerful tool in a variety of applications,  **especially when the cost of acquiring high-fidelity solutions and derivatives is substantial.**

#### Dimension Reduction
The concept of dimension reduction is crucial for handling high-dimensional data, a common challenge in many-query problems involving parametric PDEs.  The paper explores this challenge, particularly in the context of enhancing DeepONet's performance.  **Two primary dimension reduction techniques are investigated: Karhunen-Lo√®ve Expansion (KLE) and Active Subspace Method (ASM).** KLE, an established method, provides an optimal basis for minimizing mean-square error, while ASM focuses on identifying input directions with the most significant impact on output variability.  The paper **highlights the computational advantages of ASM**, showcasing its ability to reduce the dimension of the parameter input vector 'm' (from Nin to r, with r < Nin), thereby minimizing the computational burden of the loss function.  This reduction significantly improves efficiency without compromising prediction accuracy, especially when training data is limited.  **The choice between KLE and ASM is presented as a trade-off**, with KLE offering simplicity but potentially lower accuracy in comparison to the more computationally intensive ASM which captures essential input-output sensitivity.

#### Active Subspace
Active subspace methods are powerful dimension reduction techniques particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional parameter spaces in partial differential equations (PDEs).  **They identify the most influential directions in the parameter space that significantly impact the output variance**, effectively reducing computational complexity and improving model efficiency.  The method leverages the gradient information of the output with respect to the input parameters, constructing a sensitivity matrix.  **Eigen-decomposition of this matrix reveals the active subspace, a low-dimensional subspace that captures most of the output variability.**  By projecting the high-dimensional input into this active subspace, one drastically reduces the dimensionality of the problem while retaining crucial information for accurate model predictions.  **The efficiency gains are particularly significant when solving computationally expensive PDEs repeatedly for various parameters**, as often encountered in uncertainty quantification, optimization, and Bayesian inference problems.  The primary advantage is the **ability to substantially lower the computational cost** without sacrificing too much accuracy. While computationally more intensive than other methods like Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion (KLE), ASM's ability to capture sensitivity provides superior performance in high-dimensional, nonlinear scenarios.  However, **the computational cost of ASM remains relatively high**, especially for complex models and large datasets, presenting a limitation to its applicability in some real-world situations.

#### Derivative Loss
The concept of 'Derivative Loss' in the context of neural operators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is a crucial innovation.  It addresses the limitation of standard neural operator architectures, which often struggle to accurately predict not only the solution but also its derivatives with respect to parameters. By explicitly incorporating a derivative loss term into the overall loss function, the training process is guided to learn a more accurate representation of the solution's sensitivity. This is particularly valuable when training data is scarce because accurate derivative information can significantly boost the model's performance and generalization capabilities. **The inclusion of derivative loss enhances the quality of the solution itself**, as the model is forced to capture the underlying functional relationships more precisely.  **It also proves beneficial for various downstream tasks** requiring sensitivity information, such as Bayesian inference or PDE-constrained optimization.  However, implementing derivative loss presents challenges, especially with the high dimensionality often associated with PDEs.  This is addressed by utilizing dimension reduction techniques, which reduces computational complexity and addresses the problem of storing and manipulating large Jacobian matrices. The effectiveness of derivative loss is further demonstrated through numerical experiments, showcasing its advantage over traditional methods in several case studies.  In conclusion, derivative loss is a powerful technique that improves the accuracy and applicability of neural operators solving PDEs, particularly where data is limited.

#### PDE Enhancements
The heading 'PDE Enhancements' suggests improvements made to the solution or approximation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).  A thoughtful analysis would explore how these enhancements are achieved, focusing on their novelty and impact. This might involve **novel numerical methods**, **machine learning techniques**, or a combination of both.  For example, enhancements could focus on improving accuracy, efficiency (faster computation times), or handling of complex scenarios such as high dimensionality or uncertainty.  **Specific examples** might include using derivative information to improve model training data or employing dimension reduction methods to speed up calculations.  The effectiveness and limitations of the approach must also be critically evaluated, comparing it to existing methods.  **Key insights** would lie in understanding what types of PDE problems benefit most from these enhancements and the underlying reasons for their success.  Finally, future research directions suggested by the enhancements would be a valuable contribution.  Overall, a thorough discussion of 'PDE Enhancements' necessitates a detailed explanation of the methods, their advantages, limitations, and implications for the broader field of PDE research.
