Existing methods, like branch-and-bound, struggle to scale effectively or offer flexible control over this trade-off.  Greedy methods are faster but often produce suboptimal results. \nThis research proposes a novel approach called Dynamic Programming Decision Tree (DPDT), which formulates decision tree learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).  DPDT uses a dynamic tests generating function to efficiently explore a reduced search space, making it more scalable than existing optimal methods. By solving the MDP for various regularization parameters, it offers multiple solutions representing different complexity-performance trade-offs, providing greater control than current branch-and-bound methods, and often outperforming greedy approaches in generalization.
