Existing theoretical analyses, often based on correlational statistical queries, suggested limitations on gradient descent algorithms like SGD. These analyses pointed to a gap between the computationally achievable performance and the information-theoretic limit.  This paper focuses on single-index models, a class of functions with low intrinsic dimensionality. \nThis research demonstrates that **SGD, when modified to reuse minibatches, can overcome the limitations highlighted by the correlational statistical query lower bounds**. By reusing data, the algorithm implicitly exploits higher-order information beyond simple correlations, achieving a sample complexity close to the information-theoretic limit for polynomial single-index models. This significant improvement is attributed to the algorithm\u2019s ability to implement a full statistical query, rather than just correlational queries. The findings challenge conventional wisdom about SGD\u2019s limitations and suggest new avenues for enhancing learning efficiency.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "qK4iS49KDm/podcast.wav"}
