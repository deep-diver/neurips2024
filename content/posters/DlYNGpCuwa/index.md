### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many applications utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as language agents; however, aligning these agents to individual user preferences remains a challenge.  Traditional fine-tuning approaches are costly, challenging to scale, and may degrade performance.  This paper introduces PRELUDE, a framework that infers user preferences from their edits to the agent's responses.  This avoids the need for costly and complex fine-tuning.

The core of PRELUDE is CIPHER, a simple yet effective algorithm that utilizes an LLM to infer user preferences based on edit history.  CIPHER retrieves similar contexts from the history to aggregate preferences, which are used to improve future responses.  Evaluated on summarization and email writing tasks using a GPT-4 simulated user, CIPHER significantly outperformed baselines in terms of lower edit distance while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost. The learned user preferences also showed significant similarity to ground truths.

#### Visual Insights

> This figure illustrates the interactive learning process from user edits.  The process starts with the user providing context (such as an article to summarize) to an LLM agent.  The agent then generates a response. The user can then edit this response, and the edit is considered feedback for the agent. The agent incurs a cost based on the edit distance between the original response and the edited response. The goal is to minimize the cumulative cost of edits over time.  The color coding in the example edit is just for visualization; the agent processes only the plain text.

> This table presents the quantitative results of the experiments, comparing different methods (including the proposed CIPHER algorithm and baselines) across two tasks (summarization and email writing). Three metrics are reported for each method: cumulative edit distance cost, accuracy in predicting the user preference, and the expense in terms of the number of tokens processed by the LLM.  The results show that CIPHER outperforms the baselines in terms of edit distance cost while having competitive LLM expense.





### In-depth insights


#### Latent Pref Learning
Latent preference learning, in the context of large language models (LLMs), focuses on inferring a user's hidden preferences from their interactions with the system, specifically by analyzing edits made to the LLM's output.  **This contrasts with explicit feedback mechanisms**, such as ranking multiple outputs. The core idea is to **learn a representation of the user's preferences** without needing them to articulate their preferences directly, thus reducing user effort and making the system more adaptive and user-friendly.  **A key challenge lies in the implicit and often subtle nature of user edits**, which can vary depending on context and task.  Successful approaches involve sophisticated techniques that can model the complex relationship between user edits, context, and underlying preferences.  **Effective algorithms require carefully designed methods for data representation, retrieval of similar past interactions, and inference of descriptive preference models using the power of LLMs themselves.** The potential benefits include more personalized and efficient interaction, reduced user effort, and improved interpretability of the learned preferences.  Ultimately, latent preference learning is crucial for building truly adaptive and intelligent LLM agents that can seamlessly align with individual user needs and styles.

#### CIPHER Algorithm
The CIPHER algorithm, as described in the context, is a crucial component of the PRELUDE framework. Its core function is to **infer user preferences** from historical edit data, leveraging the capabilities of a large language model (LLM).  Rather than costly and potentially detrimental fine-tuning, CIPHER works by **analyzing user edits** to generate a descriptive representation of the user's latent preferences.  This description is then used to inform subsequent response generation, effectively tailoring the LLM's output to the individual user's style and needs.  **Efficiency** is a key design goal of CIPHER, and it achieves this by employing a retrieval-based approach, utilizing the LLM only when necessary to aggregate preferences from similar past contexts. The system's ability to learn and adapt to evolving user preferences is also highlighted as a key strength, offering improved performance and a potentially personalized user experience over time.  Crucially, the method's interpretability is explicitly mentioned, allowing users to view and potentially modify the learned preferences, which adds to its user-friendliness.

#### Interactive LLMs
Interactive LLMs represent a paradigm shift in how large language models (LLMs) are used.  Instead of passively receiving prompts and generating outputs, **interactive LLMs foster a dynamic exchange** with users. This engagement often involves iterative refinement, where initial LLM responses serve as a starting point for further interaction.  Users provide feedback ‚Äì edits, clarifications, or additional instructions ‚Äì which the LLM incorporates to produce improved outputs. This iterative process is key, allowing the LLM to adapt to user preferences and generate more personalized and accurate results.  **The feedback loop is crucial for improving the LLM's alignment with user needs**, effectively closing the gap between the LLM's understanding and the user's true intent.  However, challenges remain, particularly in managing the computational cost of this iterative process and ensuring effective feedback mechanisms.  Future research will likely focus on optimizing these interactions and exploring novel ways to leverage human feedback to enhance the LLM's performance and user experience.  **Ultimately, interactive LLMs aim to transcend the limitations of traditional, static interactions, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly interface** for interacting with these powerful language technologies.

#### User Edit Cost
The concept of "User Edit Cost" in the context of a research paper analyzing LLM-based language agents is multifaceted. It likely represents a crucial metric for evaluating the agent's performance and alignment with user preferences.  **Lower edit costs indicate that the generated text better satisfies user needs**, reducing the time and effort required for manual corrections.  The metric likely measures the number of edits made by users (insertions, deletions, substitutions), perhaps weighted by their complexity or impact.   **Cost calculation could incorporate not only the quantity of edits but also the difficulty or time required for each edit.** A thoughtful approach to this metric would likely involve a discussion of its limitations, including potential biases in user editing behavior and the subjectivity of determining edit complexity.  **Furthermore, the study might investigate how user edit cost correlates with other performance metrics such as LLM query cost or response quality**.  Ultimately, the user edit cost serves as a valuable indicator of the agent's overall effectiveness in providing satisfactory and personalized language outputs.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section presents exciting avenues for expansion.  **Extending the framework to more complex language agents** that perform multi-step reasoning would greatly enhance its capabilities.  Currently, the framework relies on a simple prompt-based agent; however, incorporating planning mechanisms could improve performance and expand applicability.  Furthermore, **exploring different context representation functions** beyond MPNET and BERT, and comparing diverse similarity metrics for context retrieval, could optimize performance and address the task-dependent nature of preference learning.  **Investigating the stability and robustness of the learned preferences over time and across varying user interactions** is crucial.  The current work simulates user behaviour; gathering real-world user data and studying long-term usage patterns would validate the model's effectiveness and highlight any unforeseen limitations.  Finally, **analyzing the impact of different retrieval strategies** and evaluating the effectiveness of aggregation techniques using LLMs merit further exploration.  Also, a direct comparison with fine-tuning approaches, quantifying the trade-offs between cost, scalability, and safety guarantees, would provide crucial insights.
