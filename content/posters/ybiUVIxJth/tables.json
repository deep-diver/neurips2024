The scenarios differ in the number of agents and how those agents value the warehouses (symmetric vs. asymmetric valuations). The table presents the Gini index and Nash welfare for each policy and scenario, summarizing the fairness and economic efficiency of the policies generated by each method. The Gini index measures inequality in the distribution of returns across agents (lower is better), while Nash welfare represents the geometric mean of individual returns (higher is better). The mean and standard error of the metrics are reported.", "section": "7 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "ybiUVIxJth/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of policies optimized by different rules in two scenarios based on Gini index and Nash welfare based on their normalized expected return averaged.
