### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current speech enhancement methods struggle with real-world distortions like background noise and reverberation.  While diffusion models offer high quality, their iterative inference process is computationally expensive.  Universal speech enhancement aims to address multiple distortions simultaneously, but finding a balance between speed and quality is challenging. 

This paper proposes FINALLY, a novel GAN-based model that addresses these issues.  It incorporates a WavLM-based perceptual loss function to improve training stability and quality.  The researchers theoretically demonstrate that GANs are naturally inclined to find the most likely clean speech sample, aligning with the goal of speech enhancement.  Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, producing clear, high-quality speech at 48kHz with significantly faster inference compared to diffusion models.

> This figure illustrates two heuristic rules used to evaluate the quality of feature spaces for speech generation. The Clustering rule states that representations of the same speech sound should form distinct clusters in the feature space, while the SNR rule indicates that noisy samples should move away from the cluster of clean sounds as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases. The figure uses visual examples to demonstrate these criteria.

> This table presents the results of evaluating different feature extractors for use in perceptual loss for speech enhancement.  Three criteria were used: Clustering Rule (how well features of the same sound cluster together), SNR Rule (how well features separate by SNR level), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score from a neural vocoding task, measuring the perceptual quality of the generated audio). The results show WavLM-conv features perform best across all criteria.





### In-depth insights


#### GANs for Speech
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a compelling approach to speech enhancement by learning the complex mapping between noisy and clean speech.  **GANs excel at capturing intricate data distributions**, which is crucial for modeling the variability inherent in real-world audio.  A theoretical understanding of GANs reveals their tendency to converge towards the mode of the clean speech distribution, making them naturally suited for tasks prioritizing the most probable clean signal.  However, practical implementation of GANs for speech requires careful consideration of loss functions and network architectures. **Perceptual loss functions, like those leveraging WavLM embeddings, are particularly effective in guiding the GAN towards generating perceptually pleasing audio** rather than simply minimizing numerical distance metrics.  Furthermore, innovative training strategies, such as multi-stage training and the integration of additional regularization losses, can bolster the stability and performance of the GAN model, achieving studio-like quality at high sampling rates. The careful choice of loss functions and the use of state-of-the-art self-supervised models as feature extractors significantly influence the effectiveness and quality of speech produced.

#### WavLM Integration
Integrating WavLM, a self-supervised speech pre-training model, significantly enhances speech enhancement.  **WavLM's convolutional encoder features, proven superior to other extractors via proposed selection criteria, form a robust perceptual loss backbone.** This loss function, coupled with MS-STFT adversarial training, stabilizes learning and guides the generator toward high-probability clean speech outputs. **The WavLM integration leads to a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in producing clear, studio-quality speech at 48kHz.**  Crucially, the integration of WavLM doesn't compromise inference speed, unlike computationally expensive diffusion models, thus demonstrating a significant improvement in both accuracy and efficiency.

#### Mode Collapse
Mode collapse, a phenomenon where generative models fail to produce diverse outputs, is a critical concern in generative adversarial networks (GANs).  In the context of speech enhancement, mode collapse would manifest as the model consistently producing a limited range of "enhanced" audio, regardless of the input's diversity.  This limits the model's ability to handle real-world variability in noise and distortions.  **The authors address this by theoretically demonstrating that the least squares GAN (LS-GAN) loss function inherently encourages the generator to predict the most probable clean speech sample, thereby mitigating the risk of mode collapse.** They support this claim with empirical validation, showcasing that their model, FINALLY, avoids mode collapse while achieving state-of-the-art performance.  **The choice of loss function, the careful selection of perceptual features, and a multi-stage training process all contribute to preventing mode collapse in FINALLY**. This contrasts with approaches that attempt to model the entire conditional distribution, which can be more susceptible to mode collapse due to increased complexity.

#### Perceptual Loss
The concept of perceptual loss in the context of speech enhancement is crucial, aiming to bridge the gap between objective metrics and human perception.  **Instead of solely relying on waveform or spectrogram differences**, which may not fully correlate with perceived audio quality, perceptual loss functions leverage higher-level representations extracted from pre-trained models like WavLM.  These models are trained on massive datasets, capturing complex acoustic patterns that are meaningful to human listeners. By using the output of such models as the basis for the loss function, **the generator is guided towards producing speech that sounds more natural and clear**, even if the underlying waveform is not perfectly matched to a ground truth.  **The selection of feature extractor is critical**, influencing the characteristics of the feature space and affecting training stability and the resulting quality of the enhanced speech. Hence, the study carefully considers various feature extractors and propose criteria for selecting features with well-structured and disentangled features to improve the quality of perceptual loss.

#### FINALLY Model
The FINALLY model, presented as a novel approach to speech enhancement, leverages the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while addressing their limitations.  **Theoretically grounded in the mode-seeking behavior of LS-GANs**, it efficiently regresses towards the most probable clean speech sample.  The model incorporates a WavLM-based perceptual loss, chosen based on rigorous analysis of feature space structure, ensuring training stability. This sophisticated loss function, combined with a modified HiFi++ architecture and a novel multi-stage training pipeline, **achieves state-of-the-art performance in producing high-quality, studio-like speech at 48kHz**.  The integration of WavLM significantly improves performance, highlighting the value of self-supervised pre-training in speech enhancement. **Its efficiency is emphasized by a single forward pass inference**, unlike the computationally expensive iterative approach of diffusion models.

Two different waveforms are shown, representing the ground truth and a version synthesized by a HiFi-GAN vocoder.  Although both waveforms represent the same sound, their significant differences illustrate the challenge of achieving accurate speech enhancement using a purely generative approach which aims at capturing the full probability distribution of the clean waveform given a degraded input.

The second shows results using WavLM features and an additional STFT L1 loss, which adds spectral information. The third spectrogram demonstrates the results of adding adversarial loss to the previous two, which aims to improve model stability and quality. Finally, the bottom spectrogram shows the ground truth spectrogram for comparison.

![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/18RdkSv9h9/figures_18_1.jpg)

> This figure shows the results of an investigation into the effectiveness of different WavLM layers for use in a perceptual loss function for speech enhancement.  Two metrics were used to evaluate the feature spaces generated by each layer: Rand Index (a measure of cluster separation for identical sounds) and the negative correlation of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio; a measure of how well the feature space distinguishes between clean and noisy sounds). The heatmap displays the Rand Index and negative SNR correlation values for each layer (convolutional and transformer layers), indicating which layer's features best satisfy the proposed criteria for an effective feature space.  Ideally, high Rand index scores and high negative correlation with SNR indicate that the feature space effectively clusters similar sounds together and separates noisy samples from clean ones.
