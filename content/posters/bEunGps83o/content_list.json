We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one hand, commits to a participation reward to incentivize truth-telling, and, on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round.

", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this paper, we focus on studying the question of fairness in a dynamic mechanism design setting, where a seller allocates an indivisible item through an auction at every round and for $T$ rounds to two groups of buyers, each group including $n$ buyers. At each round, the buyers\u2019 values are realized independently from an underlying distribution (which may differ between the two groups), and the buyers then submit their bids. The seller\u2019s goal is to decide on an allocation rule as a function of the submitted bids that maximizes their total discounted revenue with a discount factor $\\delta$ , while ensuring that each group receives a minimum allocation, or more specifically, that group $i$ \u2019s average discounted allocation is greater than or equal to some $\\alpha_{i}$ . ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "This fairness constraint enforces a proportional notion of fairness regarding the number of items each group wins. There are several advantages to adopting such a fairness notion. First, it is typically more straightforward from a policy perspective compared to, for instance, focusing on the total value won by each group. For example, most regulations concerning fair housing allocation emphasize the percentage of housing allocated to low-income groups as a measure of success [27]. Moreover, a buyer\u2019s value in private-value auctions is not solely determined by the intrinsic value of the item but also depends on the financial constraints of the buyers or asymmetric information about the item\u2019s value. Therefore, a proportional fairness constraint is a suitable choice in cases where one group\u2019s values are systematically lower than another\u2019s. For example, in the context of housing allocation, low-income individuals may assign lower monetary value to homes compared to wealthier individuals, as they are more concerned with basic shelter than with investment or resale value. In such scenarios, the allocation ratio is a more effective approach to mitigate allocation inequality compared to using buyers\u2019 value. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "We start by considering the static case with $T=1$ . In the unconstrained case, it is well-known that the optimal allocation is the second-price auction with a reserve price, which allocates the item to the buyer with the highest bid, conditioned on the bid being above a certain reserve price. Here, we establish that the optimal allocation under the fairness constraint has two main differences: first, the optimal fair mechanism subsidizes one group that would otherwise not meet the target fairness constraint. Second, the optimal allocation may increase the chance of allocating the item to both groups in general by reducing the reserve price (again disproportionately in favor of one group). ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "We next focus on the general dynamic case. Here, we characterize the optimal allocation through a set of recursive functions. At any round $t$ , we define the residual minimum allocation, which, roughly speaking, given the allocation so far, updates the fairness constraint as if we were to start at this round. We establish that, given the residual minimum allocation, we may have to allocate the item to one of the two groups to be on track to satisfy the fairness constraint overall, and that, in this case, we would simply allocate to the highest bidder in the group and charge them the second-highest bid within their group. However, in cases where we have the option to allocate to both groups, the design of the optimal allocation is more complicated because buyers in each group may consider underreporting their value in the current round to keep their chances of winning the item in future rounds higher, especially if they expect their value in future rounds to be higher. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this case, we establish that, as the above reasoning suggests, there is a utility associated with not winning the item. This utility is the difference between a buyer\u2019s expected utility in future rounds if their group does not win the item this round, compared to the scenario where their group wins the item at the current round. We establish that, in the optimal allocation, and to incentivize buyers to report their values truthfully, the seller commits to paying them a participation reward if their group wins the item, and this reward is equal to the aforementioned net utility of not winning the item. On the other hand, the seller charges them an entry fee, which is equal to the expected reward payment that they would miss if they did not participate. Finally, we also prove that the optimal allocation rule is similar to the static case at a high level: when allocating an item to a group, it is assigned to the buyer with the highest bid. Second, the decision regarding which group receives the item takes the form of a subsidy. However, here, the amount of the subsidy depends on the above net utility of not winning the item and the seller\u2019s future utility from allocating the item to one group or the other.

To better understand the other two terms, and for the sake of discussion, suppose $\\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})$ \u2019s are non-negative, indicating a non-negative net future utility associated with not receiving the item at the current time (because it means your chance of receiving it in the future increases). The second term of the payment function is $-\\delta\\dot{\\Delta_{i}^{t}}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\\mathbb{1}(i^{*}=i)$ , which is negative and thus represents a transfer from the seller to the buyers (we call this participation reward). Only the buyers from the group that wins the item receive this payment. To understand why such a reward is needed from the seller, notice that when a buyer\u2019s group wins the item, they are in fact losing an amount of $\\delta\\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})$ in their future utility because their group has a lower chance of winning in the future. Hence, in some sense, this reduces the value of the item in the current round, and the buyers may find it profitable to underreport their value.

Finally, the last term in the payment function is $\\delta\\dot{\\Delta}_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\\zeta_{i}^{t}$ , which is a payment that every buyer should make to the seller.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
