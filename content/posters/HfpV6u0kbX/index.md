### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current LLM serving systems struggle with multi-task scenarios due to limitations in model quantization and scheduling.  Mainstream quantization methods hinder efficient base model sharing across multiple tasks, while existing scheduling algorithms don't account for workload differences. This leads to memory inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks.

LoRA-Inlaid tackles these issues with a novel multi-task quantization algorithm (MLGPTQ) that allows efficient base model sharing. It also introduces a new multi-task scheduling algorithm guided by output length prediction and task grouping, leading to significant improvements in throughput, latency, job completion time, and SLO attainment. The system supports dynamic task addition without sacrificing service stability. **Empirical results demonstrate that LoRA-Inlaid outperforms existing systems by up to 1.58x in throughput, 1.76x in average latency, and 2x in job completion time while improving SLO attainment by 10x.**

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-task LLM Quant
Multi-task LLM quantization presents a significant challenge and opportunity.  **Existing single-task methods are inadequate** because they require task-specific calibration, preventing efficient model sharing.  A key innovation is the development of algorithms capable of performing joint quantization across multiple tasks, enabling a unified, quantized base model for all tasks. This **reduces memory consumption significantly**.  **Dynamic task addition** is also crucial; the system should efficiently incorporate new tasks without requiring a complete requantization, ideally leveraging incremental update techniques.  Finally, a **smart scheduling algorithm is needed** to manage diverse task workloads efficiently. It needs to factor in output length prediction to optimize resource allocation and minimize context switching latency, resulting in improved throughput and reduced average latency.

#### MLGPTQ Algorithm
The core of the paper revolves around the **MLGPTQ algorithm**, a novel multi-task quantization method designed to overcome limitations of existing single-task approaches in large language model (LLM) serving.  The algorithm is **crucial** because mainstream quantization techniques hinder the sharing of a quantized base LLM across multiple tasks, necessitating separate quantized models and increased memory consumption. MLGPTQ addresses this by performing **joint quantization** on multiple tasks simultaneously, using a carefully designed approach to leverage information from all tasks while avoiding information dilution.  The innovation lies in its ability to generate a **single, shareable quantized base model** for all tasks, thereby significantly reducing memory usage and improving efficiency. A key aspect is its capacity for **incremental quantization**, allowing for the dynamic addition of new tasks without disrupting ongoing services, a significant advantage for real-world applications.  This is achieved through a mechanism that efficiently incorporates new tasks‚Äô data into the existing quantized model without the need for complete re-quantization.  Overall, the MLGPTQ algorithm represents a **significant improvement** in multi-task LLM serving by enabling efficient memory usage and seamless task integration, contributing to enhanced overall system performance.

#### Dynamic Task Add
The ability to dynamically add tasks, specifically adding new LoRA adapters in a live system, is a crucial aspect of efficient multi-task LLM serving.  This functionality presents significant engineering challenges, as it requires seamless integration without disrupting ongoing services.  The paper addresses this by proposing an incremental re-quantization approach. **Instead of fully re-quantizing the model each time a new task is added, which would cause significant downtime and resource consumption, the system performs incremental updates**, leveraging previously computed data to minimize the overhead. This allows the system to adapt to changing workloads without requiring a complete restart.  **The authors further claim that this approach maintains stability** and avoids compromising the online service quality during dynamic task addition. The efficiency and stability of this approach are key to the practicality of a multi-task LLM serving system, and this feature is highlighted as a significant improvement over existing systems that lack the capacity for dynamic task management.

#### Multi-task Sched
In a multi-task LLM serving system, efficient scheduling is crucial.  A thoughtful multi-task scheduler should **dynamically adapt** to varying workloads, considering not only the number of tasks but also their individual resource demands (e.g., memory, processing time).  **Prioritizing tasks** based on predicted output length, potentially using a strategy like Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), can significantly reduce average latency and improve throughput.  The scheduler also needs to **effectively manage resources**, especially GPU memory, by grouping related tasks to minimize frequent context switching between LoRA adapters.  **Handling dynamic task addition** without service disruption is also critical; the system should gracefully integrate new tasks by efficiently updating the scheduling logic and resource allocation.  Finally, a sophisticated scheduler might implement mechanisms to **mitigate starvation** and ensure fair resource distribution among all tasks, avoiding situations where some tasks are consistently delayed.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore **robustness to adversarial attacks** within the multi-task framework, ensuring the system's resilience against malicious inputs.  Another crucial area is **fairness and bias mitigation**, investigating techniques to ensure equitable performance across diverse tasks and prevent amplification of biases present in the training data.  Furthermore, scalability to **extremely large language models** and a broader range of tasks beyond those currently tested would be valuable.  Finally, research into **more sophisticated scheduling algorithms** that optimize for diverse task characteristics and resource constraints, potentially incorporating reinforcement learning approaches, could significantly improve system efficiency and performance.  **Exploring alternative quantization methods** and their integration with the proposed framework could lead to further memory efficiency and throughput gains.

> This figure compares the multi-task quantization algorithm MLGPTQ with the single-task GPTQ algorithm. Both algorithms follow a four-step process: Forward, Aggregate Info, Modify Weight, and Quant.  The key difference is in how they handle multiple tasks. GPTQ uses a naive mix-aggregated Hessian matrix, which dilutes task-specific information. In contrast, MLGPTQ uses a max-aggregated Hessian matrix, which effectively captures and highlights critical information for each task, leading to better accuracy.
