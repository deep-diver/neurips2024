However, current neural coding schemes either cause high latency and energy consumption or require complex neuron models and training.  This limits their real-world applicability, especially in resource-constrained applications.\n\nThis research introduces a novel Stepwise Weighted Spike (SWS) coding scheme that enhances information encoding by weighting the significance of spikes at each computation step.  A novel Ternary Self-Amplifying (TSA) neuron with a silent period complements this, minimizing errors.  The proposed method demonstrates high performance and energy efficiency in deep SNNs, outperforming existing techniques.  This opens up promising avenues for designing more efficient and powerful AI systems.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "oW6s6zFYj9/podcast.wav"}
