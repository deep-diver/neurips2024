Observe that {xj}j=1 CN and that {x1, x2} C M1.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of approximating a nonlinear manifold with an affine subspace.  Point y is on manifold M1, and a ball B is drawn around it containing its nearest neighbors. The affine subspace S is constructed from the subset of these neighbors that also lie on M1 (x1 and x2).  The figure shows that although the points x3 and x4 are close to y, they are on a different manifold (M2), highlighting the importance of considering manifold structure during clustering.
