Existing invariance learning approaches rely on specific algorithms.  This paper explores a fundamental question: Can standard training procedures, like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), implicitly lead to invariant solutions? Over-parameterized models are often used in practice, posing challenges with limited data. The paper identifies a critical issue that using pooled data across environments can result in the model learning spurious correlations instead of generalizable patterns.\nThis research uses the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem to study the implicit bias of SGD on heterogeneous data. They theoretically demonstrate that using large batch sizes and sequentially training SGD on data from individual environments results in implicit invariance learning. This approach avoids learning spurious signals by exploiting the heterogeneity-induced oscillation during training.  The analysis shows that the model converges to an invariant solution, showcasing the benefits of heterogeneity for bias mitigation.  This discovery has significant implications for understanding model generalization and building more robust models.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "pMPBxMf8T3/podcast.wav"}
