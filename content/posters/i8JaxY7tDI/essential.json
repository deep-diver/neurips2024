Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a potential solution by dynamically using specialized subnetworks, but they suffer from inefficiencies in inference. This paper introduces Read-ME, a framework that addresses these issues. Read-ME transforms a pre-trained dense LLM into a smaller MoE model, thereby avoiding the high cost of training from scratch.  The key to Read-ME's efficiency is its novel pre-gating router, decoupled from the main model. This allows for system-friendly pre-computation and lookahead scheduling, enabling effective expert-aware batching and caching. The paper demonstrates Read-ME's superior performance over existing methods. \nBy separating the gating network, the paper tackles memory management and suboptimal batching in conventional MoE models. Read-ME uses activation sparsity to extract experts from a pre-trained dense model, avoiding costly training from scratch.  The pre-gating router facilitates pre-computing, lookahead scheduling, and expert-aware batching, significantly enhancing efficiency.  Experimental results show Read-ME outperforms other models on benchmark tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel framework in creating scalable and efficient LLMs for resource-constrained settings.
