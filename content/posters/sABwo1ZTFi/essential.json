This paper focuses on the generalizability of memorization neural networks, a crucial aspect of this complex problem.  Existing studies primarily focus on the number of parameters needed for memorization; however, they lack theoretical analysis of the memorization networks' generalizability, leaving a significant knowledge gap.  The central issue addressed is the need to bridge the gap between memorization and generalization, particularly in the context of over-parameterized models.\nThis research addresses this gap by providing a formal theoretical framework for studying the generalizability of memorization neural networks. The authors introduce the concepts of memorization parameter complexity and efficient memorization sample complexity to analyze the structural conditions and sample size needed for generalizability. They develop algorithms for constructing memorization networks with the smallest number of parameters and provide lower and upper bounds for sample complexity.  Crucially, they demonstrate that commonly used memorization network structures may lack generalizability. This paper's findings provide valuable guidance to researchers in designing efficient and generalizable memorization algorithms and understanding the implications of over-parameterization in deep learning.", "affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "sABwo1ZTFi/podcast.wav"}
