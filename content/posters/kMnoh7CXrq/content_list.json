Depth-wise Attention [4] suggests adding an attention-like layer before Transformer\u2019s final projection layer. This new layer applies attention across the outputs of the Transformer\u2019s blocks for the current token (instead of over different tokens as in the standard attention layer). This operation is similar to the weighted averaging block introduced in this work which mixes the outputs of earlier blocks. However, whereas in our proposal the weights are learned during training, Depth-wise Attention computes the weights using the dot product (similar to the attention) which levies a higher overhead. In our experiments, we also show that only a single DWA step before the last layer does not yield the same performance as a full DenseFormer. In another recent relevant work Mohtashami et al. [17] suggest interleaving current and past representations. This allows current tokens to attend to previous representations of themselves and past tokens. Our DenseFormer can be seen as a crude and much more efficient approximation of this mechanism in which we restrict each token to only attend to past representations of themselves, using static (as opposed to dynamic) attention weights.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
