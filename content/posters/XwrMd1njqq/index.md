### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications involve comparing datasets with different data types, creating **heterogeneous joint distributions**. Existing methods like Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) fall short in handling this complexity, limiting their use.  These methods efficiently compare distributions by projecting them onto one dimension, but they only work on homogeneous domains, which means all aspects of the data have to be similar. This limits their applicability to diverse data types.

This paper introduces a new method called **Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW)**, designed to tackle the problem. It uses a novel slicing method that deals with heterogeneous data by separating and then combining information from different data types.  The authors extensively test H2SW on several applications like comparing 3D meshes, showing better performance than existing methods.  They also provide detailed theoretical analysis of the method, proving that it is a valid metric and is computationally efficient.

> This figure illustrates the Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) and the Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT) applied to a discrete distribution.  The GRT shows a linear projection, while HHRT demonstrates a hierarchical approach.  First, partial generalized Radon transforms (PGRT) with different defining functions are applied to each marginal argument. Then, a partial Radon transform (PRT) is applied to the joint transformed arguments to integrate information across marginals. This highlights the key difference between GRT's linear projection and HHRT's more expressive, hierarchical approach, which is better suited for handling heterogeneous joint distributions.

> This table presents a quantitative comparison of three different methods (SW, GSW, and H2SW) for measuring the distance between meshes during a deformation process from a sphere mesh to an armadillo mesh.  The comparison is done across various time steps (100, 300, 500, 1500, 4000, 5000), and for each method, two different numbers of projections (L=10 and L=100) are used. The results are presented as the mean ¬± standard deviation of the joint Wasserstein distance calculated for each method and parameter setting.





### In-depth insights


#### H2SW: A New Metric
The proposed H2SW metric offers a **scalable solution** for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions, a significant advancement over existing methods like SW and GSW.  **Addressing the limitations** of prior techniques restricted to homogeneous domains, H2SW leverages a novel Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT) to effectively capture the structure of heterogeneous joint supports. This innovative approach enables **meaningful comparisons** across diverse marginal distributions.  The **topological and statistical properties** of H2SW are rigorously examined, establishing its validity as a metric and demonstrating its favorable performance in several applications. The computational efficiency of H2SW, comparable to SW and GSW, makes it a **practical and powerful tool** for various machine learning, statistics, and data science applications.  **Future work** should explore its extension to even more complex heterogeneous distributions and investigate its potential impact on a broader range of problems.

#### HHRT: Novel Slicer
The heading "HHRT: Novel Slicer" suggests a significant contribution to the field of optimal transport.  **HHRT**, likely an acronym for a novel Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform, presents a new approach to compute Wasserstein distances, a crucial metric in comparing probability distributions.  The use of the term "slicer" implies that this transform projects high-dimensional data onto lower dimensions for efficient computation, **overcoming limitations** of existing methods like SW (Sliced Wasserstein) which struggle with heterogeneous data. This "novel slicer" potentially offers **enhanced expressiveness** in handling joint distributions with marginals supported on different domains by using a hierarchical approach, leading to a more accurate and scalable distance computation. The **scalability and efficiency** are crucial advantages as traditional Wasserstein distance calculation is computationally expensive. The effectiveness of this novel technique is further validated by its applicability in various applications such as 3D mesh deformation, deep mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison, demonstrating a substantial advancement in the field.

#### 3D Mesh Experiments
The 3D mesh experiments section would likely detail the application of the proposed Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance to 3D mesh deformation tasks.  This likely involved comparing H2SW against established methods like Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW). Key aspects to analyze would be **how H2SW handles the heterogeneous nature of joint distributions inherent in 3D meshes (combining point cloud and surface normal data).**  The results might show improved accuracy or computational efficiency compared to baseline methods. The authors probably showcase this through quantitative metrics such as the joint Wasserstein distance itself and qualitative visualization of the mesh deformation process. A critical analysis should explore if H2SW offers advantages in scenarios with significant mesh complexity or non-uniform sampling density, and whether these advantages outweigh any potential increase in computational cost.

#### Autoencoder Results
Autoencoder results would ideally present a quantitative evaluation of the model's performance on reconstructing 3D mesh data. Key metrics would include **joint Wasserstein distance**, comparing the original and reconstructed meshes.  Lower distances indicate better reconstruction quality.  **Qualitative results** (visualizations) are also critical, showing examples of reconstructed meshes alongside their originals to assess visual fidelity.  The impact of hyperparameters, specifically the number of projections (L), on both quantitative and qualitative results should be analyzed.  **Comparison to other autoencoders** using traditional distance metrics would strengthen the findings, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed H2SW metric.  A thorough analysis would also consider the computational efficiency of the autoencoder trained with H2SW versus baselines, particularly concerning training time and memory usage. **Statistical significance** of any observed improvements should be rigorously established.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) to handle even more complex data structures, such as those involving time series or graph data.  **Investigating the theoretical properties of H2SW under different choices of slicing distributions and defining functions** would provide deeper insights.  **The development of more efficient algorithms for computing H2SW** is crucial for its broader application to large-scale datasets.  Furthermore, **exploring the use of H2SW in other machine learning tasks**, beyond those studied in the paper (mesh deformation, autoencoders, and dataset comparison), could reveal its full potential.  Finally, **a detailed comparison of H2SW with other state-of-the-art metrics** for heterogeneous data could solidify its position as a powerful tool for comparing complex distributions.
