The challenge lies in minimizing sample complexity while maintaining accuracy and robustness to noisy data. This paper addresses these issues. \nThe researchers developed new algorithms that incorporate predictions about the distribution. These algorithms adjust their sample complexity based on the prediction's accuracy.  Importantly, they perform at least as well as standard methods and are information-theoretically optimal.  **Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate significant improvements exceeding theoretical guarantees.**", "affiliation": "Rice University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "tAlMAcqK9s/podcast.wav"}
