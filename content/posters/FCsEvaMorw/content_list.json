[51] use an LLM and a brute-force approach to automatically discover prompt-level attacks, but this approach can suffer from mode collapse and does not always generate a diverse set of prompts. Meanwhile, Liu et al. [38] propose a white-box method that refines hand-crafted attack prompts using a mix of genetic algorithms and LLM-based mutations. However, they focus on optimising a single solution rather than a diverse population. The closest works to our own are PAIR [8] and Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) [41] \u2014 two black-box methods for automatically discovering prompt-level attacks by using an LLM to iteratively generate candidates. However, both methods are designed to jailbreak the model with respect to a single task rather than across a range of diverse risk categories and attack styles. In contrast, our work uses quality-diversity search to automatically discover attacks covering a diverse set of risks and attack strategies. Although evolutionary algorithms have previously been used for adversarial attacks on LLMs [38, 32, 8], this work is the first to apply a quality-diversity framework [34, 13] in this area. Unlike most evolutionary algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms), which evolve a single optimal solution, quality-diversity approaches generate a wide variety of distinct, high-quality solutions. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Open-Endedness and LLMs. RAINBOW TEAMING builds on the ability of LLMs to act as a powerful mutation operator over language inputs, one that adheres to the underlying structure of natural language [35]. Several recent methods exploit this capability of LLMs in order to perform an efficient novelty-driven evolutionary search in the language space, leading to the discovery of potentially open-ended repertoires of solutions [10, 16, 43]. Closest to our approach is QDAIF [6] which similarly uses LLMs for QD search in order to generate a diverse archive of LLM outputs. RAINBOW TEAMING is different from QDAIF in several important factors. First, we search for and archive diverse prompts for the target LLMs, whereas QDAIF archives diverse responses from it \u2014 a separate problem altogether. While QDAIF focuses purely on generating diverse outputs for creative writing, our method seeks to find a diverse set of adversarial prompts. QDAIF relies on a score-based fitness function (log probability of the token generation), whereas RAINBOW TEAMING uses a preference-based judge for performing updates to the archive. RAINBOW TEAMING additionally incorporates parent-child similarity filtering to preserve the linguistic diversity of the prompts.

Moreover, the synthetic data generated through RAINBOW TEAMING can be utilised for fine-tuning LLMs, thereby enhancing their resilience against further adversarial attacks without compromising their general performance. This illustrates the potential of RAINBOW TEAMING as a means for the continuous, open-ended selfimprovement of LLMs, with minimal human intervention. Future work with RAINBOW TEAMING involves extending its application beyond LLMs to areas such as vision and multi-modal AI systems. Moreover, incorporating RAINBOW TEAMING into the fine-tuning stages of LLM development presents an opportunity to consistently strengthen their defences against adversarial attacks.

First, the features that define the archive and its categories are pre-defined and fixed. In future work, it would be interesting to extend our approach to discover features and categories automatically. Another limitation of RAINBOW TEAMING is that the number of prompts it can generate is constrained by the grid size. While this is due to using MAP-Elites as the base QD algorithm, we note that even the current setting allows generating hundreds of adversarial prompts from a single run and this can be extended by providing additional features or categories or storing several values within the same archive cell.

Furthermore, its undirected, open-ended approach is less likely to produce a prompt for a specific behaviour (e.g., writing a fake news article about a specific public figure). While these attributes can be considered limitations, we highlight that because of them, RAINBOW TEAMING is less likely to be used for malicious purposes.

Such methods originally required white-box access to the LLM [74], but that assumption has since been relaxed using black-box optimisation [33, 40]. Token-level attacks have proven effective, but brittle to perturbations [54].

In reinforcement learning (RL), methods such as active domain randomisation [42, 53] and regret-based unsupervised environment design [14, 29, 50, 56] search for training tasks where the agent performs poorly in terms of absolute task performance or regret, respectively. Regret-based prioritisation has been shown to hold robustness guarantees at convergence and carry the benefit of avoiding unsolvable tasks (which always result in zero regret). The fitness score used by RAINBOW TEAMING coincides with regret [58], as a high fitness here implies the existence of another prompt that elicits a less undesirable response, as evaluated by the Judge. Similarly, many active learning and automatic curriculum learning methods in supervised learning focus training on examples maximising error metrics derived from the model\u2019s predictions [22, 44, 15]. Dynabench [31] extends this paradigm by querying humans-in-the-loop for adversarial examples. Many methods in scenario generation also closely relate to RAINBOW TEAMING, including recent approaches using QD search to find adversarial environments that induce poor behaviour in fully-automated or mixed-autonomy systems [18, 17, 5]. This extends to recent work applying QD to multi-agent RL [57], which inspired our method.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \nWhile NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis  \nsions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the   \nnature of the contribution. For example   \n(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.   \n(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.   \n(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).   \n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
