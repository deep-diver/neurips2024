Current methods for identifying such attacks are limited by factors such as specific domain focus, lack of diversity, or the need for extensive human annotations.  This makes it challenging to thoroughly understand and enhance their robustness. \nThe paper introduces Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach to generate diverse adversarial prompts. This method frames the problem as a quality-diversity search, using open-ended search to generate both effective and diverse prompts.  The approach was tested on various LLMs, demonstrating a high success rate (exceeding 90%) in identifying vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it showed that fine-tuning models with synthetic data created using this method significantly improves their safety without affecting their overall performance. The versatility of this method is also highlighted through its application in question answering and cybersecurity.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "FCsEvaMorw/podcast.wav"}
