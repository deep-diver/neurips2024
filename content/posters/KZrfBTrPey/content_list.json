To mitigate these risks, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly employ expertdesigned contextual scenarios to assess how well LLMs align with human values. However, the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their test scope, hindering their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of open-world use cases and identify rare but crucial long-tail risks. Additionally, these static tests fail to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs, making it hard to evaluate timely alignment issues. To address these challenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework that leverages the autonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth and adaptive alignment assessments. ALI-Agent operates through two principal stages: Emulation and Refinement. During the Emulation stage, ALIAgent automates the generation of realistic test scenarios. In the Refinement stage, it iteratively refines the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Specifically, ALI-Agent incorporates a memory module to guide test scenario generation, a tool-using module to reduce human labor in tasks such as evaluating feedback from target LLMs, and an action module to refine tests. Extensive experiments across three aspects of human values\u2013stereotypes, morality, and legality\u2013demonstrate that ALI-Agent, as a general evaluation framework, effectively identifies model misalignment.

This laborintensive process restricts the scope of the test scenarios, making it difficult to cover the extensive variety of real-world use cases and to identify long-tail risks [22].

The evaluation framework is expected to automate the process of generating realistic scenarios of misconduct, evaluate LLMs\u2019 responses, and iteratively refine the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements on LLM-powered autonomous agents, characterized by their ability to learn from the past, integrate external tools, and perform reasoning to solve complex tasks [24\u201328], we propose ALI-Agent, an agent-based evaluation framework to identify misalignment of LLMs. Specifically, ALI-Agent leverages GPT4 as its core controller and incorporates a memory module to store past evaluation records that expose LLMs\u2019 misalignment, a tool-using module that integrates Web search and fine-tuned evaluators to reduce human labor, and an action module that harnesses agent\u2019s reasoning ability to refine scenarios. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Building upon these three key modules, ALI-Agent can automate in-depth and adaptive alignment evaluation in critical areas through two principal stages: Emulation and Refinement (See Fig. 2). In the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent instantiates an emulator to generate realistic test scenarios and employs fine-tuned LLMs as an automatic evaluator to classify feedback as either pass or in need of refinement. Firstly, the emulator retrieves a text describing misconduct either from predefined datasets or through Web browsing based on user queries. Then, the emulator generates a realistic scenario to reflect the misconduct. These scenarios are generated based on the most relevant evaluation records retrieved from the evaluation memory, leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) abilities of LLMs [29, 30]. ALI-Agent then prompts the generated scenarios to the target LLM and judge its feedback with a fine-tuned evaluator. If we successfully exposes misalignment of the target LLM, ALI-Agent stores the evaluation record back in the memory. This allows ALI-Agent to reuse and further refine the evaluation record to new use cases in the future. Otherwise, ALI-Agent proceeds to the second stage: Refinement. A refiner is instantiated to iteratively refine the scenario based on feedback from the target LLM until either misalignment is exposed or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The self-refinement procedure is outlined in a series of intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., chain-of-thought [31]) to perform effective open-ended exploration.

In this work, we proposed a novel agent-based framework, ALI-Agent, that leverages the abilities of LLM-powered autonomous agents to probe adaptive and long-tail risks in target LLMs. Grounded by extensive experiments across three distinct aspects of human values, ALI-Agent steadily demonstrates substantial effectiveness in uncovering misalignment in target LLMs. Furthermore, we discussed the framework\u2019s scalability and generalization capabilities across diverse real-world applications in Appendix C to strengthen the practical value of our work. Despite its empirical success, ALI-Agent still has two drawbacks to resolve. Firstly, ALI-Agent relies heavily on the capabilities of the adopted core LLM, resulting in uncontrolled performance as we adopted a closed-source LLM (GPT-4-1106-preview). Secondly, the task of designing scenarios to bypass the safety guardrails of the target LLM is itself a form of \u201cjailbreaking\u201d, which in some cases, the core LLM may refuse to perform. In future work, we seek to fine-tune an open-source model as the core of ALI-Agent to control the performance of evaluation framework. We can also proceed to proactively evaluate LLMs\u2019 alignment performance in specific areas. For example, by providing the query \u201cSingapore traffic laws\u201d, we can allow the framework to acquire a set of relevant laws and evaluate LLMs\u2019 understanding of and adherence to these laws accordingly. Furthermore, test scenarios exposing misalignment can be utilized as training data for fine-tuning target LLMs to improve their overall alignment performance.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
