In particular, many real-world goal oriented problems are contextual, where the objective of the agent is to reach a goal set communicated by a context. For example, consider instructing a truck operator with the context \u201cDeliver goods to a warehouse in the Bay area\u201d. Given such a context and an initial state, it is acceptable to reach any feasible goal (a reachable warehouse location) in the goal set (warehouse locations including non-reachable ones). We call such problems Contextual Goal-Oriented (CGO) problems, which form an important special case of contextual Markov Decision Process (MDP) [10].

CGO problems are challenging because 1) the rewards are sparse as in GCRL and 2) the contexts can be difficult to map into feasible goals. Nevertheless, CGO problem has an important structure that the transition dynamics (e.g., navigating a city road network) are independent of the contexts that specify tasks.

Such datasets are commonly available in practice. The typical contextual datasets for imitation learning (IL) (which has pairs of contexts and expert trajectories) is one example, since we can convert the contextual IL data into dynamics data and context-goal pairs. Generally, this setup also covers scenarios where expert trajectories are not accessible (e.g., because of diverse contexts and initial states), since it does not assume goal examples to appear in the trajectories or the contexts are readily paired with transitions in expert trajectories. Instead, it allows the dynamics datasets and the context-goal datasets to be independently collected. For example, in robotics, task-agnostic play data can be obtained at scale [22, 34] in an unsupervised manner whereas instruction datasets (e.g., [25]) can provide context-goal pairs.

Some baseline methods could be easily conceptualized from the literature, but their drawbacks are equally apparent. One intuitive approach is to extend the goal prediction methods in GCRL [26, 27]: given a test context, we can predict a goal and navigate to it using a goal-conditioned policy, where the goal prediction model can be learned from the context-goal dataset and the goalconditioned policy can be learned from the trajectory dataset. However, the predicted goal might not always be feasible given the initial state since our context-goal dataset is not necessarily paired with transitions. Alternatively, the offline problem could be formulated as a special case of missing label problems [41] and we can learn a context-conditioned reward model to label the unsupervised transitions when paired with contexts as in [14]. However, this approach ignores the goal-oriented nature of the problem and the fact that here only positive data (i.e. goal examples) are available for reward learning, which poses extra significant challenges. CGO can be framed as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem with missing labels; However, existing algorithms [42, 14, 21] in family assume access to both positive data (contexts-goal pairs) and negative data (contexts and non-goal examples), whereas only positive data are available here.

The core idea is to convert the context-goal dataset and the unsupervised dynamics dataset to a fully labeled transition dataset of an equivalent action-augmented MDP, which circumvents the drawbacks in other baseline methods by fully making use of the CGO structure of the problem. We give a high-level illustration of this idea in Figure 1. In Figure 1, given a randomly sampled context-goal pair from the context-goal dataset, we create fictitious transitions from the corresponding goal example to a fictitious terminal state with a fictitious action and reward 1, and pair with the corresponding context. Also, we label all unsupervised transitions with reward 0 and non-terminal, and pair with the contexts randomly. Combining the two, we then have a fully labeled dataset (of an action-augmented contextual MDP, which this data augmentation and relabeling process effectively creates), making it possible to propagate supervision signals from the context-goal dataset to unsupervised transitions via the Bellman equation. We can then apply any offline RL algorithm based on Bellman updates like CQL [19], IQL [18], PSPI [37], ATAC [4] etc. In comparison with the baseline methods discussed earlier, our method naturally circumvents their intrinsic challenges: 1) CODA directly learns contextconditioned policy and avoids the need to predict goals; 2) CODA effectively uses a fully labeled dataset, avoiding the need to learn a reward model and extra costs from inaccurate reward modeling.

To label the transition dataset, we need to find some appropriate threshold to label states predicted as goals given contexts. We choose the percentile as $5\\%$ in the reward distribution evaluated by the context-goal set as the threshold to label goals (if a reward is larger than the threshold than it is labeled as terminal), from candidate choices $\\{0\\%,5\\%,10\\%\\}$ . Then we apply it to all environments. Another trick we apply for the reward prediction is that instead of predicting 0 for the context-goal dataset, we let it predict 1 but shift the reward prediction by $^-1$ during reward evaluation, which prevents the model from learning all 0 weights. Similar tricks are also used in other reward learning baselines.
