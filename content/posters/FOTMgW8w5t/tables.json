For each combination of covariate (sex: X=0 for female, X=1 for male) and surrogate outcome (WHO stage: S=1, 2, 3 representing asymptomatic, mild, and advanced symptoms, respectively), the table gives the mean of the potential outcomes under treatment (\u03c4(1,x,s)) and control (\u03c4(0,x,s)), as well as their standard deviations (\u03c3(1,x,s) and \u03c3(0,x,s)). These parameters are estimated from a real HIV trial and used to make the synthetic data realistic.", "section": "Synthetic case study: HIV trial"}]
