The three strategies are: (1) The proposed CARA design incorporating both primary and surrogate outcomes; (2) A complete randomization design using only delayed primary outcomes; (3) A CARA design using only primary outcomes. The x-axis represents the sample size, and the y-axis shows the bias (A) and standard deviation (B) of the ATE estimates. The results demonstrate that the proposed design has smaller bias and variance, indicating better estimation efficiency compared to the other two strategies.", "section": "6 Synthetic case study: HIV trial"}]
