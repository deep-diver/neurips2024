### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current vision-language models for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection use static negative labels, causing semantic misalignment. This leads to suboptimal performance across different OOD datasets because these fixed labels do not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images.



To address this issue, AdaNeg introduces adaptive negative proxies dynamically generated during testing.  These proxies align closely with the specific OOD dataset, improving detection accuracy.  By utilizing both static negative labels and adaptive proxies, AdaNeg effectively combines textual and visual knowledge.  This method outperforms existing methods, notably on ImageNet, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness, while remaining training-free and annotation-free.

> This figure demonstrates the misalignment issue between existing negative proxies (NegLabel) and actual OOD data, and how the proposed AdaNeg method addresses this issue.  The t-SNE visualization (a) shows that AdaNeg proxies are closer to the actual OOD samples than NegLabel proxies. The histogram (b), showing the ID-Similarity to OOD Ratio (ISOR), quantitatively supports this finding; AdaNeg consistently achieves lower ISOR values, indicating better alignment with OOD characteristics.

> This table presents the results of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection experiments using the ImageNet-1k dataset as the in-distribution (ID) data.  It compares the performance of various methods, including those requiring training or fine-tuning, and those that are zero-shot and training-free. The performance is evaluated across four different OOD datasets: iNaturalist, SUN, Places, and Textures.  The metrics used for evaluation are AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% true positive rate). Higher AUROC and lower FPR95 indicate better performance.





### In-depth insights


#### Adaptive NegProxies
The concept of "Adaptive NegProxies" presents a novel approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by dynamically generating negative proxies during the testing phase. This is a significant departure from traditional methods that rely on static negative labels, which often suffer from semantic misalignment with the actual OOD data distribution.  **The adaptive nature of these proxies allows for a closer alignment with the specific characteristics of each OOD dataset**, enhancing the effectiveness of negative proxy guidance. This adaptability is achieved through a feature memory bank that selectively caches discriminative features from test images, creating proxies that are representative of the underlying OOD label space.  **Two types of adaptive proxies are proposed: task-adaptive and sample-adaptive.** Task-adaptive proxies average features across a category to reflect unique dataset characteristics, while sample-adaptive proxies weigh features based on similarity to the individual test sample, capturing finer-grained details. By integrating both static negative labels and these adaptive proxies, the method effectively combines textual and visual knowledge, leading to improved performance in OOD detection.  **The method is notable for being training-free and annotation-free**, thus offering significant advantages in terms of efficiency and speed.

#### VLM-based OOD
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, surpassing traditional vision-only methods.  **VLMs leverage multimodal knowledge**, integrating visual and textual information, which allows for a richer understanding of the input data and better discrimination between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.  This approach is particularly beneficial because **textual information can provide semantic context** that is often missing in image-only representations.  However, challenges remain.  The effectiveness of VLM-based OOD is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the textual information used, and **misalignments between textual proxies and the actual OOD distribution** can significantly impact performance.  Moreover, while VLMs offer improved performance, they typically require substantial computational resources and may introduce new vulnerabilities, such as **sensitivity to adversarial attacks**. Therefore, future research should focus on improving the robustness and efficiency of VLM-based OOD methods, potentially by exploring techniques such as adaptive proxy generation or incorporating uncertainty quantification.

#### Memory Bank
The concept of a 'Memory Bank' in this context is crucial for the adaptive nature of the proposed OOD detection method.  It acts as a **dynamic store of discriminative features** extracted from test images, selectively caching information deemed valuable for distinguishing between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. The memory bank's selectivity is driven by a scoring mechanism based on the confidence of classification and the similarity between the test image and the existing proxies. This selective caching allows the system to **dynamically adapt to the characteristics of specific OOD datasets** without explicit training, effectively building task-specific representations.  The utilization of the memory bank and its interaction with the adaptive proxy generation is a key innovation, showcasing the training-free and annotation-free capabilities of the method. By leveraging this memory bank, the model transcends static label-based approaches, leading to enhanced OOD detection performance.

#### Label Space Issue
The core issue revolves around the **misalignment between the semantic space of pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) negative labels and the actual label space of out-of-distribution (OOD) data**.  Existing methods often rely on static negative labels, which may not accurately represent the visual characteristics of diverse OOD datasets. This **semantic gap** hinders the effectiveness of negative proxy guidance in OOD detection.  The problem manifests as inconsistent performance across different OOD benchmarks, demonstrating the limitations of a fixed, general-purpose negative label set.  Therefore, there's a crucial need for methods that can dynamically adapt to the nuances of the underlying OOD data distributions to improve the accuracy and robustness of OOD detection.  The solution necessitates techniques that bridge this semantic gap, enabling VLMs to better discriminate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples.

#### OOD Benchmarks
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks are crucial for evaluating the robustness of machine learning models.  A robust benchmark should include a diverse range of datasets representing various data distributions and characteristics, such as **ImageNet**, **CIFAR-10/100**, and others.  The selection of in-distribution (ID) and OOD datasets significantly influences the evaluation results, highlighting the importance of carefully chosen benchmarks to reflect real-world scenarios.  **Metrics** like AUROC and FPR95 are commonly used but have limitations.  Future benchmarks should address this by potentially incorporating human evaluation to better capture the nuances of model performance and account for subjective aspects of OOD detection. The development of standardized and widely accepted OOD benchmarks is essential for fostering progress in the field and enabling fair comparisons of different OOD detection methods.  This would promote the development of more generalizable and robust algorithms suitable for real-world deployment.
