The dual certificate is a function that is designed to be +1 around the ground-truth directions (w*1 and w*3) and -1 in between. It shows how the dual certificate, which measures the optimality of a solution, behaves sharply around the true parameters, decaying quadratically as it moves away from them.  This property is crucial for the proof showing neurons concentrate around the ground truth directions.", "section": "6.1 Constructing descent direction requires better understanding of local geometry"}, {"figure_path": "XYw051ZmUn/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Illustration of descent direction", "description": "This figure illustrates the descent direction in the local convergence regime. The descent direction moves neuron wj toward either the ground-truth direction w or 0 depending on whether it is in the neighborhood of the teacher neuron w. Specifically, it moves far-away neurons towards 0 (setting qij = 0) and moves close-by neurons towards its closest minima qijw (the fraction of w that neuron wj should target to approximate).", "section": "Descent direction in local convergence (Stage 3): the benefit of weight decay"}]
