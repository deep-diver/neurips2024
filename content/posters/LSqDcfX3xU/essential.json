Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of similarity-based attacks in reconstructing sensitive edges, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding has been lacking.  This has led to concerns about the safety of deploying GRL models in real-world settings where privacy is a concern.\nThis research addresses the aforementioned issues by providing a principled analysis of the success and failure modes of similarity-based edge reconstruction attacks (SERA). The authors provide a non-asymptotic analysis of SERA's capacity to reconstruct edges and validate their findings through experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs.  They show that SERA is highly effective against sparse graphs but less so against dense graphs.  Furthermore, they show how noisy aggregation (NAG) can mitigate the effectiveness of SERA, providing an effective approach for balancing privacy and utility in GRL. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation makes this a significant contribution to the field.", "affiliation": "Ant Group", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "LSqDcfX3xU/podcast.wav"}
