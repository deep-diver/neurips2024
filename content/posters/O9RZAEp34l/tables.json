The experiment involved replacing the masked elements in a 7x7 rank-2 input matrix with various values (MASK, 0.44, -0.24), then measuring the mean squared error (MSE) at both observed and masked positions. The results show that the model outputs values close to the input values at masked positions, indicating a copying behavior rather than accurate prediction of missing entries.  The experiment was repeated at different training steps (1000, 4000, 14000) to observe how this behavior changes over time.", "section": "3.1 Before the Algorithmic Shift \u2013 Copying Phase"}, {"figure_path": "O9RZAEp34l/tables/tables_14_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Models at different steps before sudden drop implement copying, predicting the value for mask token at missing entries.", "description": "This table presents the results of an experiment designed to verify that a pre-shift model copies the input.  The experiment replaces masked elements in the input matrix with different values (including the \"MASK\" token, which represents no replacement). The results show that the mean squared error (MSE) at observed positions remains low regardless of the replacement token, while at masked positions, the MSE is close to the value of the replacement token.  This confirms that the model is simply copying entries rather than computing them in the pre-shift phase of training.", "section": "3.1 Before the Algorithmic Shift \u2013 Copying Phase"}, {"figure_path": "O9RZAEp34l/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Models at different steps before sudden drop implement copying, predicting the value for mask token at missing entries.", "description": "This table presents the results of an experiment designed to verify that the pre-shift model (the model before the algorithmic shift) simply copies the input matrix.  The experiment tests different scenarios: using the standard mask token, replacing the masked elements with a specific value ('0.44' and '-0.24'), and testing on random matrices (not necessarily low-rank). The MSE (mean squared error) is calculated separately for observed and masked entries. Low MSE values for observed entries in all cases confirm that the model accurately copies the input at these positions. Consistently high MSE values for masked entries demonstrate that the model doesn't make an effort to predict these entries but simply sets them to values close to the input mask token.", "section": "3.1 Before the Algorithmic Shift \u2013 Copying Phase"}]
