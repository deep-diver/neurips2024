These encodings, usually based on structural connectivity, are computationally expensive and may not fully capture temporal dynamics. \nThis paper proposes TPNet, a novel temporal graph neural network. TPNet introduces a temporal walk matrix to efficiently incorporate both structural and temporal information, simultaneously considering time decay effects. It leverages random feature propagation, offering theoretical guarantees and improved computation/storage efficiency. TPNet significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, achieving a maximum speedup of 33.3x.", "affiliation": "CCSE Lab, Beihang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Ti3ciyqlS3/podcast.wav"}
