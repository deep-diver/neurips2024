All these tasks group pixels within an image into multiple semantic segments or groups [35, 44], but assign concepts of different granularity. The segmentation models adopted for different tasks may vary, mostly following a similar architecture. Particularly, existing image segmentation models can be categorized into two types: 1) pixel-based classification models such as DeepLab [9], U-Net [49], PSPNet [65], and SegFormer [55]; and 2) mask-based classification models such as Mask2Former [11] and its variants [61, 26, 34].

Trained on the large-scale interactive dataset SA-1B [31], SAM demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in handling various types of visual segmentation tasks [42, 4, 33, 7].

", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Unlearnable Examples The concept of UEs was first introduced in [25], where small protective noise can be injected into the training dataset to prevent machine learning models from learning useful representations. This was achieved by generating error-minimizing noise that can remove errors from the dataset such that the training model finds no error to minimize (learn). Targeted adversarial poisoning [16] has also been demonstrated to be an effective approach to creating such shortcuts to mislead model training. The working mechanism of UEs was explained by later work as creating a \u201cshortcut\" between the input and output using linearly separable features [58]. They further introduced the Synthetic Perturbations (SynPer) method to craft synthetic patterns as UEs. However, the linear separability has recently been shown by Pedro et al. [52, 51] to be unnecessary for UEs. There exist several remaining key challenges for the practical adoption of UEs for private data protection: 1) robustness to adversarial training [43], 2) transferability from supervised to unsupervised learning, 3) transferability to protect differently labeled data, and more importantly 4) the extension to broad vision tasks beyond image classification. The robustness of UEs to adversarial training has been effectively addressed by the RUE method introduced in [17] which directly minimizes the adversarial training loss. And, the transferability challenges across different learning paradigms and labeling granularities have been effectively addressed by the TUEs [48] and Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) [63] methods. Despite these advances, all existing UE methods are exclusively focused on image classification tasks, limiting their effectiveness to coarse-level vision tasks.

Here, we compare our UnSeg with three SOTA training-free unlearnable methods: SynPer, Autoregressive Perturbations (AR) [51] and Convolution-based Perturbations (CUDA) [50]. For the AR method, we use its AR process to generate sample-wise noise of size $\\epsilon=1$ (L2 constraint) for each category. For the CUDA method, we use filters of size 3 and set the blur parameter to 0.3 to generate the noise for each category. The results reported in Table 2 reveal the following findings. (1) Our method significantly reduces the clean test performance of the models across all tasks and datasets. Specifically, UnSeg can reduce the PQ metric of ResNet50-based models by $28\\%$ , $47.7\\%$ , and $56.4\\%$ across the three datasets, significantly outperforming SynPer and AR. (2) When using Swin-Tiny as the backbone, our method is even more effective at reducing the model\u2019s performance. On the ADE20K dataset, UnSeg reduces the PQ and AP scores of the Swin-Tiny-based model by $37.5\\%$ and $23.8\\%$ , respectively. We believe this is because UnSeg\u2019s surrogate model adopts a Transformer architecture. (3) Our method is particularly effective for large datasets and large objects.

Please refer to Section 4.1 for a detailed description of the datasets and models used in this set of experiments. For the interactive segmentation task, as shown in Figure 5 (a), although SAM-HQ freezes the parameters of the pre-trained SAM during training to leverage its generalization capabilities, our method can still degrade its test performance by a notable margin, especially on the ThinObject dataset [36]. This indicates that our method has the potential to prevent large foundation models from extracting useful information from the protected images. For remote sensing segmentation, RSPrompter is an improved method based on SAM and also freezes the parameters of the pre-trained SAM during training. As illustrated in Figure 5 (b), the test performance of RSPrompter drops significantly after training on the unlearnable training dataset crafted by our method, with the mAP metric on the WHU dataset dropped by $60\\%$ . Our method can even be applied to protect medical images against medical image segmentation models. And, we found that setting $\\epsilon=4/255$ is sufficient to drastically reduce the model performance.

It is also unclear to the defender which object/region has been protected, leading to ambiguity. Using object masks as prompts enables precise specification of the objects to be protected, effectively avoiding the aforementioned ambiguity. In fact, with powerful tools like SAM, it is quite easy to obtain object masks. Here, we provide more experiments in Table 7 with different prompts on the Pascal VOC dataset using DeepLabV1. We report two types of results: making all classes unlearnable and making only some classes unlearnable. It shows that our method is robust across different types of prompts, achieving excellent protection even with point prompts.
