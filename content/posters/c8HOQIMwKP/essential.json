This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the concept of \"unlearnable examples\" \u2014adding noise to images to make them unusable for model training.  Existing methods for generating these unlearnable examples, however, are not efficient or easily transferable to different tasks and datasets.\nThis paper introduces UnSeg, a novel framework that effectively addresses these limitations.  UnSeg leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate universal unlearnable noise.  **Through bilevel optimization, UnSeg finetunes SAM to minimize training error on a surrogate model, creating a generator capable of transforming any image into an unlearnable version.** The effectiveness of UnSeg is demonstrated across multiple segmentation tasks, datasets, and network architectures, showing significant performance reductions on the protected images. This work advances the state-of-the-art in protecting visual data against model training.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Key Lab of Intell. Info.
