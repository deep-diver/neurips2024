Existing end-to-end methods, attempting to optimize multiple tasks simultaneously, often compromise on individual task performance. This paper identifies this recognition limitation as a major bottleneck in VTS. \nGoMatching, a novel approach, tackles this by effectively utilizing an off-the-shelf image text spotter and focusing training on enhancing the tracking aspect.  It introduces a rescoring mechanism to improve the confidence of detected instances and a Long-Short Term Matching (LST-Matcher) module to enhance tracking through effective integration of long- and short-term matching information. This simplified yet powerful approach results in superior performance and efficiency on benchmark datasets, including a newly proposed ArTVideo dataset containing curved texts.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software, and Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "ASv9lQcHCc/podcast.wav"}
