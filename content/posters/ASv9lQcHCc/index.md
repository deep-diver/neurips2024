### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Video text spotting (VTS), a challenging task involving both text detection and recognition, currently suffers from suboptimal recognition capabilities. Existing end-to-end methods, attempting to optimize multiple tasks simultaneously, often compromise on individual task performance. This paper identifies this recognition limitation as a major bottleneck in VTS. 

GoMatching, a novel approach, tackles this by effectively utilizing an off-the-shelf image text spotter and focusing training on enhancing the tracking aspect.  It introduces a rescoring mechanism to improve the confidence of detected instances and a Long-Short Term Matching (LST-Matcher) module to enhance tracking through effective integration of long- and short-term matching information. This simplified yet powerful approach results in superior performance and efficiency on benchmark datasets, including a newly proposed ArTVideo dataset containing curved texts.

> Figure 1: (a) 'Gap between Spot. & Det.': the gap between spotting and detection F1-score. As the spotting task involves recognizing the results of the detection process, the detection score is indeed the upper bound of spotting performance. The larger the gap, the poorer the recognition ability. Compared to the ITS model (Deepsolo [5]), the VTS model (TransDETR [12]) presents unsatisfactory image-level text spotting F1-scores, which lag far behind its detection performance, especially on ArTVideo with curved text. It indicates recognition capability is a main bottleneck in the VTS model. (b) GoMatching outperforms TransDETR by over 12 MOTA on ICDAR15-video while saving 197 training GPU hours and 10.8GB memory. Notice that since the pre-training strategies and settings vary between TransDETR and GoMatching, the comparison is focused on the fine-tuning stage.

### In-depth insights


#### VTS Recognition Bottleneck
The heading 'VTS Recognition Bottleneck' points to a critical issue in video text spotting (VTS): the underperformance of the recognition component compared to its image-based counterpart (ITS).  **The core problem is that VTS models struggle to accurately recognize text within video frames**, lagging behind the detection capabilities. This suggests an imbalance in multi-task optimization, where the focus on tracking may detract from recognition accuracy.  **Addressing this bottleneck is key to improving VTS performance**, potentially through techniques like improved training strategies, specialized model architectures, or better data augmentation to specifically enhance recognition.  The researchers should explore whether integrating advanced ITS recognition models into a VTS framework, while focusing training efforts on the unique tracking aspects of VTS, could be a potential solution. This approach would leverages the robust recognition power of state-of-the-art ITS while minimizing suboptimal performance through specialized training for video text.  Furthermore, investigation into the role of data quality and diversity is crucial.  **Insufficient diverse and complex video text data** could be a significant factor contributing to the recognition bottleneck.  Therefore, creation of robust and diverse benchmark datasets will be essential for future VTS research to overcome this bottleneck.

#### GoMatching Baseline
The proposed GoMatching baseline offers a novel approach to video text spotting by leveraging a powerful, pre-trained image text spotter (DeepSolo) and focusing training efforts on the tracking aspect.  This **two-pronged strategy** avoids suboptimal multi-task optimization often seen in end-to-end models.  By freezing DeepSolo's parameters, GoMatching significantly reduces training costs and time. The addition of a **rescoring mechanism** refines confidence scores, improving tracking performance. Furthermore, a **Long-Short Term Matching (LST) module** enhances tracking accuracy by integrating both short- and long-term temporal information.  The overall system shows impressive results on standard benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of this decoupled, efficient approach.  **Arbitrary-shaped text** recognition is also addressed, demonstrating GoMatching's versatility.  The simplicity of the design allows accommodation of diverse text scenarios (dense, small, etc.) with reduced training overhead.

#### LST-Matcher Module
The LST-Matcher module, a core component of the proposed GoMatching architecture for video text spotting, cleverly integrates long- and short-term matching mechanisms to robustly track text instances across video frames.  Its two-stage design, comprising ST-Matcher and LT-Matcher, addresses the challenges of temporal variations and occlusions inherent in video data. **ST-Matcher efficiently handles associations between adjacent frames**, leveraging the inherent short-term temporal coherence. **LT-Matcher excels in resolving complex tracking scenarios**, such as instances lost due to significant occlusions or abrupt appearance changes. The use of Transformer encoders and decoders in both modules allows for efficient information fusion, enabling robust and accurate trajectory generation.  **Integration of long- and short-term contextual cues** makes the module highly adept at handling scenarios with arbitrary-shaped texts, even under challenging conditions.  The overall effectiveness of the LST-Matcher module is a key factor in achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple video text spotting benchmarks, showcasing its robustness and capability.

#### ArTVideo Dataset
The creation of the ArTVideo dataset is a significant contribution to the field of video text spotting.  The existing datasets largely lack sufficient examples of curved text, limiting the ability to train robust models capable of handling real-world scenarios.  **ArTVideo directly addresses this deficiency by including approximately 30% curved text instances**, a feature absent in comparable datasets like ICDAR15-video and DSText. This inclusion is crucial for advancing the accuracy and generalization capabilities of video text spotting algorithms.  The dataset also benefits from high-quality annotations, with straight text labeled using quadrilaterals and curved text annotated using polygons with 14 points for precise contour definition. This meticulous annotation approach ensures that the dataset is suitable for training advanced models.   Furthermore, the diverse textual content and varied video backgrounds ensure generalizability, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific characteristics.  **ArTVideo's focus on arbitrary-shaped text strengthens its value as a benchmark**, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of video text spotting methods. Its release will undoubtedly spur research and development in this critical area, making it a valuable tool for improving the reliability of video text spotting applications.

#### Future VTS Research
Future research in Video Text Spotting (VTS) should prioritize addressing the limitations of current methods.  **Improving the accuracy and robustness of text recognition in challenging video conditions** (e.g., low resolution, motion blur, varying lighting) is crucial. This may involve exploring more advanced deep learning architectures or incorporating domain-specific knowledge.  **Developing more efficient and scalable tracking algorithms** that can handle dense text and complex scenes is also vital.  The creation of **larger, more diverse, and comprehensively annotated datasets**  containing various text types, shapes, languages, and scene contexts is needed to train and evaluate more robust VTS models.  Finally, research should focus on **developing VTS systems capable of real-time processing** for applications such as autonomous driving and live video captioning, demanding highly optimized models and efficient inference techniques.  The development of **benchmark datasets with arbitrary-shaped texts, multilingual support, and general scene understanding** is essential for pushing the field forward.

> üîº The figure illustrates the architecture of GoMatching, a video text spotting method. It comprises three main components: a frozen image text spotter (DeepSolo), a rescoring head, and a Long-Short Term Matching (LST-Matcher) module. The image text spotter initially processes each frame to detect and recognize text instances; a rescoring head then refines the confidence scores to improve the accuracy of text detection in video context. Finally, LST-Matcher, incorporating both short-term and long-term information, links text instances across consecutive frames to generate complete text trajectories. The overall process aims at mitigating performance degradation between image and video domains while ensuring robust text tracking.
