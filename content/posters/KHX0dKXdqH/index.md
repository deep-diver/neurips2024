### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Imitation learning empowers agents to learn from expert demonstrations without needing explicit reward signals, but faces significant hurdles when unobserved factors (confounders) bias the data. Existing methods often assume complete knowledge of the system, which is unrealistic. This paper tackles this challenge by exploring a partial identification approach within the framework of Markov Decision Processes.This means the algorithms work even if the true system dynamics are only partially known.The core problem is that unobserved confounders make it impossible to perfectly imitate expert performance when both the transition dynamics and reward functions are not identifiable. The paper rigorously proves this and provides solutions to the problem when either the transition dynamics or reward function is partially identifiable. This leads to two new algorithms, CAIL-T and CAIL-R, designed to handle these settings.  These algorithms extend the well-known GAIL framework with a focus on robustness to unobserved confounders. Experiments in simulated and real-world scenarios, such as driving and healthcare, demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers in imitation learning and causal inference.  It **addresses the critical issue of unobserved confounding**, a common problem hindering the effectiveness of imitation learning algorithms. By introducing novel algorithms that leverage partial identification, the research **provides robust solutions for learning effective policies even with incomplete knowledge of the system dynamics**.  This opens up **new avenues for research in robust imitation learning**, which is highly relevant in various domains involving sequential decision-making, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare.

> This figure illustrates a multi-armed bandit model with a binary action X ‚àà {0, 1}, a binary reward Y, and a latent covariate U ‚àà {0, 1} that affects both the action and reward. The reward function is defined as Y ‚Üê X ‚äï U, where ‚äï denotes the XOR operator.  The figure shows two scenarios: (a) represents the joint probability distribution P(X, Y) and (b) the interventional distribution PœÄ(X, Y), where œÄ is a policy. This example demonstrates how unobserved confounding can affect imitation learning.

> This table summarizes the main contributions of the paper.  It shows the different scenarios considered based on whether the transition and reward functions are identifiable or not from the observed data. For each scenario, it indicates whether standard imitation learning methods apply, or if a novel causal imitation learning algorithm (CAIL) is proposed.  The table also highlights the cases where imitation is theoretically impossible due to unobserved confounding.





### In-depth insights


#### Causal IL Challenges
Causal imitation learning (IL), while promising, faces significant hurdles.  **Unobserved confounding**, where latent variables influence both expert actions and outcomes, severely limits the ability of standard IL methods to guarantee performance matching the expert.  This challenge stems from the inability to uniquely identify the underlying causal mechanisms, leading to a lack of robust policy learning.  **Partial identification** offers a potential solution, allowing inference about causal effects despite this non-identifiability.  However, even with partial identification, the problem remains complex.  **The interplay of identifiability of transition dynamics and reward functions** significantly impacts the feasibility of effective imitation. Algorithms must be carefully designed to handle situations with either partially identifiable transitions or rewards, or both.  Furthermore, **the curse of dimensionality** presents a practical barrier; high-dimensional state and action spaces make inference and optimization extremely difficult.  Developing robust and computationally feasible algorithms that address these challenges remains a critical area of ongoing research.

#### Partial ID Approach
The heading 'Partial ID Approach' suggests a methodology that addresses challenges in causal inference and imitation learning where complete knowledge of the system is unavailable. **Partial identification** techniques are employed to overcome the limitations of point-identification methods, which often require strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. This approach allows for the analysis of systems with unobserved confounding and incomplete data by considering plausible ranges of values rather than precise point estimates. The implications are significant in enabling the development of more robust and practical algorithms that can function effectively even under conditions of uncertainty. It offers flexibility in handling complex scenarios where obtaining comprehensive information is impractical. The robustness of algorithms informed by this partial ID approach is a key benefit, leading to greater reliability and applicability in real-world applications where uncertainty is prevalent.  By embracing the uncertainty inherent in these situations, the approach yields adaptable algorithms capable of handling incomplete information while still reaching meaningful conclusions.

#### Robust Imitation
Robust imitation in machine learning focuses on creating agents capable of mimicking expert behavior even under challenging conditions.  **Noise, uncertainty, and distribution shifts** are common issues that can compromise the effectiveness of standard imitation learning techniques.  Robust methods address these issues by designing algorithms that are less sensitive to imperfections in the training data or variations in the environment.  **Techniques** may include regularization, adversarial training, or incorporating domain knowledge to improve generalization.  A key aspect of robust imitation is evaluating an agent's ability to **generalize** to unseen scenarios and maintain performance. **Theoretical guarantees** that bound performance degradation under specific conditions are highly desirable.  The ultimate goal is to develop learning systems that can reliably copy skills and strategies from demonstrations, offering practical applications across various fields.

#### GAIL Algorithm
Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a powerful algorithm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations.  **GAIL's core strength lies in its ability to learn effectively without requiring explicit reward functions**, a significant advantage in scenarios where defining rewards is difficult or impossible. The algorithm frames the learning process as a game between two neural networks: a **policy network** that tries to generate actions similar to the expert's, and a **discriminator network** that tries to distinguish between the agent's actions and those of the expert. This adversarial setup drives both networks to improve, leading to a policy that mimics expert behavior with impressive accuracy.  **A key advantage of GAIL over traditional imitation learning methods is its robustness to noisy or incomplete demonstrations**. The adversarial training process allows it to focus on the most relevant aspects of the expert's behavior and filter out irrelevant details. Despite its effectiveness, **GAIL faces challenges like mode collapse**, where the policy network might converge to a limited set of behaviors, and difficulty in handling high-dimensional state spaces. However, **its capacity for learning complex behaviors in settings with limited information makes it an important algorithm in robotics, autonomous driving, and other fields.** 

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore **mitigating the impact of confounding bias** in more complex scenarios, such as those involving continuous state and action spaces or partially observable environments.  Investigating **alternative causal identification methods** beyond partial identification to enhance policy learning robustness would be valuable.  The development of **more efficient algorithms** for solving the optimization problems presented in the paper, especially for high-dimensional settings, is crucial.  Exploring the **integration of causal imitation learning with other reinforcement learning techniques**, such as reward shaping or curriculum learning, could yield significant improvements in sample efficiency and performance. Finally, **applying these methods to real-world domains** with rich datasets and diverse challenges‚Äîsuch as robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare‚Äîwould further validate their effectiveness and identify new areas for advancement.  **Addressing the ethical implications** of using causal imitation learning, especially in contexts where unobserved confounders might perpetuate existing biases, is also a vital research avenue.
