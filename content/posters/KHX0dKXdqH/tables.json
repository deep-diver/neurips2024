It shows the different scenarios considered based on whether the transition and reward functions are identifiable or not from the observed data. For each scenario, it indicates whether standard imitation learning methods apply, or if a novel causal imitation learning algorithm (CAIL) is proposed.  The table also highlights the cases where imitation is theoretically impossible due to unobserved confounding.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
