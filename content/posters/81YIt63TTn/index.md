### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current model merging methods often struggle with interference between models and performance degradation due to heterogeneous test data.  These methods usually fail to fully leverage both shared and exclusive knowledge across different models, leading to suboptimal results. 

Twin-Merging proposes a two-stage approach: first, it modularizes knowledge into shared and exclusive components, compressing exclusive knowledge for efficiency; second, it dynamically merges this modularized knowledge based on input data.  Extensive experiments demonstrate **substantial performance improvements** across a range of language and vision tasks, exceeding the fine-tuned upper bound on generative tasks.  The method is highly adaptable to diverse data and scales effectively, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment.

### In-depth insights


#### Modular Expertise
The concept of "Modular Expertise" in the context of large language models (LLMs) refers to the **decomposition of an LLM's knowledge into smaller, independent modules**. Each module specializes in a specific task or area of expertise, enhancing efficiency and reducing interference between different tasks. This modularity allows for a more **flexible and adaptable system**, capable of handling diverse test data and minimizing performance degradation in a one-size-fits-all model.  **Twin-Merging**, as described in the paper, leverages this modularity by first separating knowledge into shared and exclusive components and then dynamically merging these components during inference based on the specific input. This approach is crucial because directly merging all expertise can be detrimental due to conflicting or irrelevant information. The effectiveness of Twin-Merging hinges on the successful modularization of expertise, resulting in improved efficiency and adaptability for various tasks and datasets.

#### Dynamic Merging
The concept of "Dynamic Merging" in the context of large language models (LLMs) presents a compelling approach to overcome the limitations of static model merging techniques.  Instead of pre-determining fixed weights for combining multiple models, **dynamic merging intelligently adjusts the contribution of each component model based on the specific input**. This adaptability addresses the heterogeneity of real-world data and significantly improves performance, particularly when dealing with diverse or unseen test data.  The key is the **conditional combination of shared and exclusive knowledge**. A central component is a 'router' network that processes the input to determine the optimal weights for merging shared and task-specific expertise.  This approach enhances both efficiency and accuracy, potentially reducing the need for extensive retraining and resource consumption.  The resulting model exhibits superior flexibility and adaptation to varying inputs, bridging the gap between the performance of individual expert models and those merged statically.  **Dynamic merging is a paradigm shift towards more intelligent and efficient model integration** for multi-task learning scenarios.

#### Knowledge Disentanglement
The concept of "Knowledge Disentanglement" in the context of model merging centers on the crucial idea of **separating shared and task-specific knowledge** within individual models.  This is a significant departure from traditional methods that treat model parameters holistically.  By modularizing knowledge into shared components (applicable across multiple tasks) and exclusive components (unique to a single task), the merging process becomes more precise and less susceptible to interference.  The core insight lies in recognizing that directly merging all knowledge from multiple models often results in **performance degradation** due to redundancy and conflicts.  Disentanglement addresses this by strategically isolating and compressing exclusive knowledge into sparse vectors, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing the adverse effects of conflicting information. This process of **knowledge modularization** is vital for effective integration, paving the way for more accurate and adaptive multi-task models.

#### Performance Gains
The research demonstrates significant performance gains across various tasks.  **Twin-Merging consistently outperforms traditional methods**, achieving an average improvement of 28.34% in absolute normalized scores for discriminative tasks.  This substantial improvement highlights the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge modularization and dynamic merging strategies. Notably, **Twin-Merging even surpasses the fine-tuned upper bound on generative tasks**, showcasing its potential to unlock capabilities beyond those achievable through standard fine-tuning. The gains are consistent across different datasets and model architectures, emphasizing the generalizability and robustness of the approach. **Parameter efficiency is also a key advantage**, with minimal performance degradation even at high sparsity rates, making Twin-Merging a practical solution for resource-constrained environments.  These findings underscore the value of disentangling shared and task-specific knowledge for improved model merging and highlight the benefits of dynamic knowledge integration for enhanced adaptability and performance.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Developing a more robust theoretical foundation** for model merging is crucial; understanding *why* and *when* weight interpolation succeeds is key to improving performance and generalizability.  Investigating different types of knowledge beyond shared and exclusive (e.g., irrelevant or even harmful knowledge) will refine the knowledge modularization process.  **Expanding the dynamic merging mechanism** beyond simple linear combinations could unlock even greater performance gains by incorporating more sophisticated methods that take context and data heterogeneity into account.  Finally, **applying these techniques to broader domains** (beyond NLP and CV) and **exploring their efficacy on even larger models** are vital steps towards unlocking the true potential of model merging.

> üîº This figure shows two graphs illustrating the effects of different ratios of shared and exclusive knowledge on model merging performance. The top graph demonstrates the impact of shared knowledge by varying fine-tuned epochs. As the number of epochs increases, shared knowledge decreases, leading to a drop in merging performance despite good performance on individual tasks. This highlights the importance of shared knowledge in successful model merging. The bottom graph explores the impact of exclusive knowledge by varying the sparsity of task-specific weights when merging a single task-specific model. Even with high sparsity (99%), the single-merged model outperforms multi-model merging, showcasing the contribution of exclusive knowledge. These findings suggest that both shared and exclusive knowledge are crucial, but excessive exclusive knowledge can hinder merging performance.
