C1 and C2 represent two different sets of conditions. A checkmark indicates that the condition is met for that bifurcation type, while an 'X' indicates it is not.  'only Eq22 or 23' indicates that a specific equation or set of equations must be satisfied for that bifurcation to occur.", "section": "S2.3 Structure of the parameter space"}]
