Each mechanism employs a different combination of prediction, planting, and stealing strategies. The x-axis represents the Kendall tau distance (a measure of prediction accuracy), and the y-axis shows the success rate (percentage of instances where both players achieve at least (1-\u03b5) of their MMS values) for three different values of \u03b5 (error tolerance). The plot shows how the success rates of the mechanisms vary with increasing prediction noise and how the inclusion of prediction and stealing components affects the robustness and consistency of these algorithms under different noise levels.", "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "aFB97F8QSF/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Mechanisms: Random (yellow), Random-Steal (cyan), Partition (red), Partition-Steal (green), Partition-Plant-Steal (blue).

The success rate is defined as the percentage of instances where both players receive at least (1-\u03b5) of their MMS value for different values of \u03b5 (0.02, 0.05, and 0.1). The data is generated under two conditions: correlated preferences (where both players have similar rankings of items) and uncorrelated preferences (where preferences are randomly generated).

It shows how, given accurate predictions, agents initially plant their highest-valued predicted items into the tentative allocation of the opposite group.

The process repeats recursively until a final allocation is reached.", "section": "H.1 An Overview"}]
