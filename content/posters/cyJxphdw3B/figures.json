[{"figure_path": "cyJxphdw3B/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: A figure illustrating the proof ideas for Theorem 2. It represents the disconnected components of diffeomorphisms that preserve orientation, notated by diff\u207a, and reverse orientation, notated, diff\u207b. The horizontal axis abstractly represents the two disconnected components of diff for a finite-dimensional vector space V. The vertical axis represents the dimension of V. Observe how the two components of diff connect as dim(V) \u2192 \u221e, and V becomes a Hilbert space H.", "description": "The figure illustrates the proof of Theorem 2 by showing the disconnected components of diffeomorphisms that preserve orientation (diff\u207a) and reverse orientation (diff\u207b) for finite-dimensional vector spaces V.  As the dimension of V increases toward infinity (becoming a Hilbert space H), these components connect. This disconnection in finite dimensions, but connection in infinite dimensions, is key to the proof's contradiction.", "section": "3.1 No-go theorem for discretization of diffeomorphisms on Hilbert spaces"}]
