### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning applications involve mapping between function spaces, often requiring discretization for computation. Neural operators excel at this, but their discretization can be problematic in infinite-dimensional spaces.  This paper investigates the theoretical limits of continuously discretizing neural operators, focusing on bijective operators seen as diffeomorphisms.  It highlights challenges arising from the lack of a continuous approximation between Hilbert and finite-dimensional spaces.

The paper introduces a new framework using **category theory** to rigorously study discretization. It proves that while continuous discretization isn't generally feasible, a significant class of operators‚Äî**strongly monotone operators**‚Äîcan be continuously approximated. Furthermore, the paper shows **bilipschitz operators**, a more practical generalization of bijective operators, can always be expressed as compositions of strongly monotone operators, enabling reliable discretization.  A quantitative approximation result is provided, solidifying the framework's practical value.

> üîº The figure illustrates the proof of Theorem 2 by showing the disconnected components of diffeomorphisms that preserve orientation (diff‚Å∫) and reverse orientation (diff‚Åª) for finite-dimensional vector spaces V.  As the dimension of V increases toward infinity (becoming a Hilbert space H), these components connect. This disconnection in finite dimensions, but connection in infinite dimensions, is key to the proof's contradiction.

> Figure 1: A figure illustrating the proof ideas for Theorem 2. It represents the disconnected components of diffeomorphisms that preserve orientation, notated by diff‚Å∫, and reverse orientation, notated, diff‚Åª. The horizontal axis abstractly represents the two disconnected components of diff for a finite-dimensional vector space V. The vertical axis represents the dimension of V. Observe how the two components of diff connect as dim(V) ‚Üí ‚àû, and V becomes a Hilbert space H.
