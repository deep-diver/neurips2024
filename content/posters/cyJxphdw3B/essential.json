Neural operators excel at this, but their discretization can be problematic in infinite-dimensional spaces.  This paper investigates the theoretical limits of continuously discretizing neural operators, focusing on bijective operators seen as diffeomorphisms.  It highlights challenges arising from the lack of a continuous approximation between Hilbert and finite-dimensional spaces.\nThe paper introduces a new framework using **category theory** to rigorously study discretization. It proves that while continuous discretization isn't generally feasible, a significant class of operators\u2014**strongly monotone operators**\u2014can be continuously approximated. Furthermore, the paper shows **bilipschitz operators**, a more practical generalization of bijective operators, can always be expressed as compositions of strongly monotone operators, enabling reliable discretization.  A quantitative approximation result is provided, solidifying the framework's practical value.", "affiliation": "Shimane University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "cyJxphdw3B/podcast.wav"}
