The \"General abstraction\" provides a detailed representation including the identity and location of each object. This allows answering various questions about the objects and their locations. The \"Count-oriented abstraction\", on the other hand, simplifies the representation by only counting the number of objects in each container, which limits the types of questions it can answer to those related to counts.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "lzfzjYuWgY/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Derivation of abstract predicates and action from raw predicates. Better viewed in color. Predicates represented by multi-colored squares indicate association with multiple abstraction levels. Grey squares represent intermediate predicates, not associated with any abstraction, used to derive abstract predicates.", "description": "This figure shows how abstract predicates and actions are derived from raw predicates in the REPLACE task. The raw predicates represent the basic state of the world, such as the location of objects and the agent.  The abstract predicates represent higher-level concepts, such as the proximity of objects to the agent or the overall goal of the task.
