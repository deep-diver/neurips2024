On the one hand, \u201crelation discovery\u201d is a pivotal part when leveraging the price information of other stocks to achieve accurate stock movement prediction. Given that stock relations are often unidirectional, such as the \u201csupplier-consumer\u201d relationship, causal relations are more appropriate to capture the impact between stocks. On the other hand, there is substantial noise existing in the news data leading to extracting effective information with difficulty. With these two issues in mind, we propose a novel framework called CausalStock for news-driven multi-stock movement prediction, which discovers the temporal causal relations between stocks. We design a lag-dependent temporal causal discovery mechanism to model the temporal causal graph distribution. Then a Functional Causal Model is employed to encapsulate the discovered causal relations and predict the stock movements. Additionally, we propose a Denoised News Encoder by taking advantage of the excellent text evaluation ability of large language models (LLMs) to extract useful information from massive news data. The experiment results show that CausalStock outperforms the strong baselines for both news-driven multi-stock movement prediction and multi-stock movement prediction tasks on six real-world datasets collected from the US, China, Japan, and UK markets.

Thus, causal relations are more appropriate for depicting the impact between stocks, as they identify the direction of information flow and are more informative than correlations. With the development of causal science, many researchers have started to use deep end-to-end networks for causal relations discovery of panel data or temporal data [9, 14], in which the causal relations are defined as directed acyclic graphs, i.e., causal graphs, and the Functional Causal Models (FCMs) are often utilized to optimize the causal graph by simulating the data generation mechanism.

Conventional text representations obtained by using GRU [42] or LSTM [15] exhibit many limitations. Specifically, news text data are often characterized by substantial noise because of the presence of irrelevant or ambiguous information [38, 7, 37]. The effective information for stock movement prediction gets intertwined with this noise, presenting a considerable challenge for these modules to discern meaningful signals accurately.

ALSTM [28] integrated a dual-stage attention mechanism with LSTM.

In recent years, researchers also exploited attention-based mechanisms to model complex interactions. DTML [44] is proposed to predict by using a transformer and LSTM to capture the asymmetric and dynamic correlations between stocks. With the development and prosperity of NLP technology, text from social media and online news has become a new popular source of fundamental analysis. HAN [15] designed two attention networks to recognize both the influential time periods of a sequence and the important news at a given time. Stocknet [42] proposed a deep generative model with recurrent, continuous latent variables. MSHAN [13] exploited a multi-stage TCN-LSTM hybrid model. PEN [21] proposed a Shared Representation Learning module to capture interactions between price data and text data.

MAN-SF [32] constructed a graph attention network with price features, social media, and inter-stock relationships based on the interrelationship between price and tweets.

Causal discovery can be classified into three groups: constraint-based [10, 30, 31], score-based [2, 26, 46], and functional causal models (FCMs) [12, 26]. FCMs define the causal relations by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and identify causal links through nonlinear functions, such as neural networks [14, 9, 47, 18]. Specifically, DECI [9] is a deep end-to-end framework to discover causal relations based on additive noise FCM.
