The causal discovery process (dashed lines) uses variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of the temporal causal graph G, represented by G1 to GL. This graph represents the causal relationships between the past L time lags of stock market information X<T. The prediction process (solid lines) uses a functional causal model (FCM) with parameters \u03b8 to predict the future stock movements yT based on X<T and the learned causal graph G.", "section": "4 CausalStock"}, {"figure_path": "5BXXoJh0Vr/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The structure of CausalStock.

It details the three main components: the Market Information Encoder (MIE), which processes both news and price data; the Lag-dependent Temporal Causal Discovery (Lag-dependent TCD) module, which identifies causal relationships between stocks; and the Functional Causal Model (FCM), which uses this information to predict future stock movements.
