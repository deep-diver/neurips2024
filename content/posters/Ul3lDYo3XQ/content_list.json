The action space $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ corresponds to the LLM\u2019s vocabulary, with each token representing an action. Hence, the LLM serves as the policy model. The agent\u2019s state consists of the (context, memory) pair. Upon predicting a new action $a_{t}$ (i.e., a new token), the LLM transfers control to the executor. The executor applies predefined logic to transition from the current state $s_{t}$ to the next state $s_{t+1}$ , implementing the state transition function $S\\times A\\to S$ in RL, and then returns control to the LLM to predict the next action.

If the action (i.e., the token) matches a function name, the executor will execute the associated function implementation, further mutating the agent state. For instance, if the token is [GetQuestion], the executor will prompt the user for a new question and append it to the context; if the token is [UpdateMemory], the executor will write a specific segment of the context into the memory; if the token is [ClearContext], the executor will reset the context to [BOS]. In summary, the LLM interacts with the memory and tools by predicting function names, relying on the executor to execute these functions.

Numerous research works, as shown in Table 8, utilizing prompt engineering, have constructed remarkable LLM agents capable of autonomously resolving complex tasks across various environments [28, 44, 2, 30, 4]. Furthermore, extensive works identify key components in the design of LLM agents, including planning [22, 39, 10, 32, 51, 35], tooluse [19, 29, 48, 36], and reflection [40, 21].

", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Human-agent interaction Although LLMs face practical challenges, such as hallucination [53] and a lack of long-tail knowledge [16], consulting human experts can help mitigate these issues. Several studies [52, 46] have incorporated human experts into agent workflows relying on passive feedback or predefined rules. However, these approaches do not involve proactively seeking advice, which requires more complex decision-making. While [5, 31] train models to ask questions using behavior cloning, they ignore the fact that the decision to seek advice must be based on the LLM\u2019s own knowledge and capabilities [55, 18, 13]. [34] use a calibrated version of an LLM\u2019s token probabilities as a confidence measure, yet token probabilities tend to be overconfident [47], and existing calibration methods don\u2019t generalize well to our agent setting when the LLM makes multiple decisions in sequence. Ultimately, the challenge of seeking advice is tied to the LLM\u2019s self-evaluation, which is difficult to ground truth or optimize through SFT. In our RL framework, the value and cost of seeking advice can be directly represented as RL rewards, enabling the proactive skill of seeking advice to be optimized as part of the policy model on end-to-end RL training.
