Existing methods for interpreting DNNs often lack faithfulness, failing to accurately reflect the network's internal logic.  This paper addresses these issues by focusing on the concept of 'interactions' between input variables, which represent fundamental inference patterns within the DNN.  Early work empirically observed that DNNs learn interactions in two phases: initially, simpler interactions are favored, followed by the learning of more complex ones, often leading to overfitting.\nThis research rigorously proves the two-phase dynamics of interaction learning.  The authors introduce a mathematical framework that explains how a DNN's generalization power changes throughout training.  They derive an analytic solution that accurately predicts the real dynamics of interactions across different DNN architectures and tasks. This theoretical framework provides deeper insights into DNN behavior, particularly regarding the transition from underfitting to overfitting,  **leading to new approaches for enhancing DNN performance and interpretability.**", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "dIHXwKjXRE/podcast.wav"}
