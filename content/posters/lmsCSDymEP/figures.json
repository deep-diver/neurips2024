(a) shows existing methods that rely solely on linguistic knowledge, using a text encoder and a detector.  (b) depicts the proposed method, DIFFUSIONHOI, which leverages text-to-image diffusion models to generate images based on text prompts, transferring knowledge from the diffusion model to the HOI detector. This includes using the relation between the human and object in the text prompt. (c) illustrates the feature extraction component of DIFFUSIONHOI, which uses the diffusion model to extract features specific to the interaction, conditioned by the relation embeddings. This conditioned feature extraction further assists in HOI detection.  The figure highlights the difference between previous methods that utilize linguistic knowledge alone and the proposed method that integrates image generation and conditioned feature extraction capabilities of diffusion models for improved performance and knowledge transfer.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "lmsCSDymEP/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (Left) Disentanglement-based cycle-consistency learning.

See \u00a73.4 for details.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the DIFFUSIONHOI model, showing the flow of information from image input to HOI detection output.  The model leverages a pre-trained diffusion model (Denoising UNet) for feature extraction, conditioning on relation embeddings and object information from CLIP.  These features are then processed by an HOI decoder (DHOI) to predict human-object interactions and by an instance decoder (Dins) for human and object detection. The relation embeddings are continuously updated during training through a cycle-consistency loss and a relation-centric contrastive loss. The figure highlights the key components of the model: the visual encoder, the diffusion model, the HOI decoder, the instance decoder, and the online update mechanism for relation embeddings.", "section": "3.4 HOI Knowledge Transfer from Diffusion Models"}, {"figure_path": "lmsCSDymEP/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (Left) Disentanglement-based cycle-consistency learning.
