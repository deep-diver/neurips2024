Existing methods, such as using large backbones, often face computational limitations and performance bottlenecks.  This research addresses these issues by proposing a new paradigm. \nThe proposed Frozen-DETR uses frozen foundation models as a plug-and-play module to boost object detection performance. This is done by integrating the class token (representing the global image context) and patch tokens (providing fine-grained details) from frozen foundation models into a query-based detector.  Experiments show significant improvements in accuracy across several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of this novel approach.  This is particularly important for addressing challenges like class imbalance and open-vocabulary scenarios, which highlight the method's versatility and significant contributions to the field.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "erQDc72vyi/podcast.wav"}
