In this work, we show that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature enhancer, even though they are not pre-trained for object detection. Specifically, we explore directly transferring the high-level image understanding of foundation models to detectors in the following two ways. First, the class token in foundation models provides an in-depth understanding of the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object queries in the detector\u2019s decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the patch tokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector\u2019s encoder by providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as plug-and-play modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly enhance the detector\u2019s performance while preventing the problems caused by the architecture discrepancy between the detector\u2019s backbone and the foundation model.

With a global understanding of the image, detectors can recognize different parts of the same object and detect the objects as completely as possible, as shown in Figure 1 (a). Second, the co-occurrence of objects can facilitate finding some missing objects. In Figure 1 (b), a man is sitting on something, from which we can infer that it is a bench with a strange appearance.

Moreover, some salient features can also help us distinguish similar objects, i.e., distinguishing the fish and broccoli from birds as shown in Figure 1 (c).

Training foundation models in a supervised manner need to collect web-scale high-quality datasets, such as image classification dataset ImageNet-22k [17] (DEiT-III [57]), image-text pair dataset WIT [54] (CLIP), grounding dataset GoldG [39] (GLIP), and segmentation dataset SA1B [35] (SAM). Training with gold annotations from humans, these models can be directly applied to many downstream tasks without fine-tuning. However, the human-annotated datasets are hard to scale up due to intensive labor. Self-supervised learning is an alternative. With well-designed pre-tasks, e.g., contrastive learning [11, 4, 60, 65], mask image modeling [27, 1, 61, 10], or their combination [70, 52], models can learn distinctive representations without human annotations.

However, in this paradigm, the detector should use the same backbone as the pre-trained foundation model to transfer the pre-trained weights. Unfortunately, not all backbones are suitable for dense prediction tasks. Thus, many task-oriented designs are introduced to compensate for the structure inadaptability, e.g., ViT-Adapter [13]. Besides, fine-tuning a large foundation model is not always acceptable due to resource constraints. To this end, a few works [58, 44] explore using frozen foundation models as the backbone. To make the frozen backbone work in object detection, modifying the structure (heavy neck and head) and the training recipe (long training schedule) is necessary.
