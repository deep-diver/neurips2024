This research tackles this issue by focusing on improving sampling efficiency. Existing methods often involve complex and computationally intensive steps to achieve high-quality results in image processing tasks like super-resolution. \nThe proposed method introduces Conditional Conjugate Integrators (CCI).  CCI projects the conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more efficient space for sampling, significantly reducing the number of steps needed. The researchers demonstrate its effectiveness across various linear image restoration tasks (super-resolution, inpainting, deblurring) and datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer steps than competitive baselines.
