[{"figure_path": "qxS4IvtLdD/figures/figures_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Illustration of Conditional Conjugate Integrators for Fast Sampling in Inverse Problems. Given an initial sampling latent xt, at time ts, our sampler projects the diffusion/flow dynamics to a more amenable space for sampling using a projector operator \u03a6 which is conditioned on the degradation operator H and the sampling guidance scale w. The diffusion/flow sampling is then performed in the projected space. Post completion, the generated sample in the projected space is transformed back into the original space using the inverse of the projection operator, yielding the final generated sample. We define the form of the operator \u03a6 in Section 2.2. Conditional Conjugate Integrators can significantly speed up sampling in challenging inverse problems and can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 NFEs as compared to existing baselines, which require from 20-1000 NFEs (see Section 3).", "description": "This figure illustrates the Conditional Conjugate Integrators method for fast sampling in inverse problems.
