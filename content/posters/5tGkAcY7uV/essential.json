These limitations often lead to high computational costs and reduced accuracy, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets.  Existing approaches often resort to small group sizes for feature interaction due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms, limiting their ability to capture global context effectively.\nThe paper introduces LION, a window-based framework that leverages linear group recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address these challenges.  **LION allows for much larger group sizes for feature interaction**, significantly reducing computational complexity compared to transformer-based methods while preserving accuracy.  The key innovation lies in incorporating a 3D spatial feature descriptor to improve spatial modeling and a 3D voxel generation strategy to enhance the representation of foreground features in sparse point clouds.  Experimental results demonstrate that LION achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "5tGkAcY7uV/podcast.wav"}
