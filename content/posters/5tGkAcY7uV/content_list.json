Voxel generation is applied to enhance the feature representation of objects in highly sparse point clouds for accurate 3D object detection.

First, we compare our results of IV with II by only replacing the operator of linear group RNN in LION block with 3D sub-manifold convolution to generate the diffused features. We find that the manner of IV (69.3 vs. 66.6) significantly outperforms the performance of II in terms of mAPH/L2. This benefits from the linear group RNN\u2019s ability to model long-range feature interactions, generating a more reliable feature representation through its auto-regressive capacity, demonstrating the superiority of voxel generation with the linear group RNN. To further illustrate that the effectiveness of voxel generation is from its auto-regressive property of LION block rather than a strong feature extractor, we initialize the diffused features of the foreground voxels by K-NN operation (III) instead of the manner of all-zeros features (IV) and then feed them to the same following LION block for voxel generation. In Table 7, we find that the manner of III is inferior to IV by 1.0 mAPH/L2. This clearly illustrates that our voxel generation is beneftiing from its auto-regressive property of LION block.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
