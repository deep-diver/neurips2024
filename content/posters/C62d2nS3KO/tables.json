It shows the number of parameters (# param), number of function evaluations (NFE), Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), and Inception Score (IS) for various methods. Lower FID indicates better image quality, and higher IS indicates better diversity.  The table includes results for various sampling steps for some methods, demonstrating the impact of sampling steps on performance. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different approaches in generating high-quality images.", "section": "5.1 Class-conditional generation on ImageNet"}, {"figure_path": "C62d2nS3KO/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Results on ImageNet 128x128", "description": "This table compares the performance of various methods on the ImageNet 128x128 dataset for image generation.  The methods are compared based on the number of parameters (\"# param\"), number of function evaluations (NFE), Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), and Inception Score (IS). Lower FID indicates better image quality and higher IS indicates better diversity. The table shows that the proposed Moment Matching method, particularly the alternating optimization version, achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of FID, even outperforming its teacher model at higher sampling steps (8).", "section": "5.1 Class-conditional generation on ImageNet"}, {"figure_path": "C62d2nS3KO/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Results on text-to-image, 512 \u00d7 512.", "description": "This table presents the results of applying different methods on a text-to-image model with a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels.  The metrics used are FID30k (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and CLIP Score, which measure the quality of generated images. The table shows the performance of the base model, various comparison models from recent literature, and the two versions (Alternating and Instant) of the proposed Moment Matching method.  Different levels of classifier-free guidance are also tested for some models. Lower FID scores indicate better image quality and higher CLIP scores indicate better alignment of image content with the text prompt.", "section": "5.5 Text to image"}]
