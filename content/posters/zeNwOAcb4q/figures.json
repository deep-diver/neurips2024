Starting from an initial transition matrix T<sub>M</sub>, noise is progressively added through a series of steps represented by the matrices T<sub>m</sub>, until a final noisy matrix T<sub>0</sub> is obtained. The denoising process then reverses this, using a learned model p<sub>\u03b8</sub>(T<sub>m\u22121</sub>|T<sub>m</sub>, f<sub>p</sub>(x)) that incorporates feature information f<sub>p</sub>(x) extracted from the input image x. The process continues until the original transition matrix T<sub>M</sub> is recovered, or a close approximation thereof.", "section": "3.2 Diffusion Model for Transition Matrix"}, {"figure_path": "zeNwOAcb4q/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overall framework of DTM.", "description": "This figure illustrates the overall framework of the proposed method, which is called DTM (Diffusion Transition Matrix). It starts with an input sample (x, \u1ef9), where x represents the input image and \u1ef9 represents the noisy label. The pre-trained encoder fp extracts features from the input image x.  Then, k-means clustering is applied to group similar samples based on their extracted features. This is followed by the estimation of grouped transition matrices (represented by the stacked cubes of different colors) for each cluster using a diffusion model. The diffusion model takes the grouped transition matrices and generates a feature-dependent transition matrix T(x) which is ultimately used for training a classification neural network.", "section": "3 Method"}]
