The properties of the SWFL determine the form of the corresponding SWF, and the informational basis (the level of measurability and comparability of individual utilities) further restricts the possible SWFs.  For example, with only ordinal and non-comparable utilities, no SWF can be derived (Arrow's impossibility theorem). However, under stronger assumptions on measurability and comparability, specific SWFs, such as the power mean, can be derived, and the specific parameter of the power mean depends on the informational basis.", "section": "A.1 Utility and Social Choice Theory"}]
