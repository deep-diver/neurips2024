Transparent elections must be replaced with reliable alignment mechanisms.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of the paper: comparing a traditional democratic government with an AI-powered autonomous government.  In a democracy, policymakers (a small group) are faced with an information bottleneck\u2014they have limited access to the vast amount of information reflecting the society's complex dynamics (social state).  Their policy decisions are therefore slow and informed guesses. In contrast, a properly aligned autonomous government can efficiently process vast amounts of data about the social state and its dynamics, allowing for much faster policymaking. However, this requires a verifiable alignment mechanism to ensure the AI's goals align with societal well-being.", "section": "Introduction"}]
