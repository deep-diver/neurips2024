Diffusion bridge models, designed for coupled data distributions (e.g., image-to-image translation), further exacerbate this issue due to their complex sampling process.  The high computational cost hinders their practical applications. This research introduces Consistency Diffusion Bridge Models (CDBMs) to tackle this problem.\nThe core of CDBMs lies in learning the consistency function of the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) within diffusion bridges. This allows for direct prediction of the solution at a starting step, significantly reducing the number of network evaluations required during sampling.  Two training paradigms (consistency bridge distillation and consistency bridge training) are proposed, enhancing the flexibility of CDBMs across different model designs. Experiments demonstrate that CDBMs achieve a 4x to 50x speedup compared to baseline diffusion bridge models, while maintaining or even improving visual quality.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "FFJFGx78OK/podcast.wav"}
