It compares the traditional diffusion models' probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) with the PF-ODE of diffusion bridges.  The key difference is that diffusion bridges have fixed endpoints (start and end data points), unlike diffusion models which start from pure noise.  Because of this singularity at the end point, the diffusion bridge PF-ODE is only well-defined before the end time, T.  The figure shows how CDBMs use this PF-ODE, requiring an initial step (one-step posterior sampling) to get a point before the singularity, and then using a consistency function to predict the final result directly.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "FFJFGx78OK/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Ablation for hyperparameters of CDBM", "description": "This figure shows the ablation study for the hyperparameters of CDBM (Consistency Diffusion Bridge Models) on the ImageNet dataset. The ablation study focuses on the impact of different settings for the hyperparameters on model performance.  Specifically, it examines the effect of two sets of timestep functions, r(t), and loss weighting functions, \u03bb(t), which govern the training schedule of the CDBM. The first uses a constant timestep interval (\u2206t) and a constant loss weighting of 1, while the second employs a variable timestep interval that gradually shrinks during training and a loss weighting of t\u03bb(t). The results are visualized as FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) plots against training iterations for different hyperparameter choices.
