The metrics used for comparison include FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), IS (Inception Score), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), and MSE (Mean Squared Error). The table shows the performance of various models, including baselines (Pix2Pix, DDIB, SDEdit, Rectified Flow, I2SB, and DDBM), as well as the proposed CDBM models (CBD and CBT) with different numbers of function evaluations (NFE). Lower FID and LPIPS values, and higher IS values indicate better performance.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "FFJFGx78OK/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative Results on the Image Inpainting Task", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different image inpainting methods on the ImageNet dataset.  The metrics used are FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), a measure of the visual quality and diversity of generated images; and CA (Classifier Accuracy), which assesses how well the inpainted images are classified compared to ground truth images using a pre-trained ResNet50 classifier. The results show the FID and CA scores for various methods, including the proposed CDBM (Consistency Diffusion Bridge Model) at different number of function evaluations (NFE). Lower FID scores indicate higher image quality, while higher CA scores show better image classification accuracy.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "FFJFGx78OK/tables/tables_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Specifications of design spaces in different diffusion bridges.
