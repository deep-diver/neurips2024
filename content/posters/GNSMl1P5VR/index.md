### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current multimodal language models lack visual reasoning capabilities, limiting their performance on tasks requiring visual-spatial understanding.  Existing chain-of-thought methods rely solely on text, neglecting the human tendency to sketch for better reasoning. This paper addresses these shortcomings by introducing SKETCHPAD, a framework designed to improve multimodal language model performance.

SKETCHPAD enhances multimodal LLMs by providing them with the tools to create and utilize intermediate sketches during the reasoning process.  By generating visual artifacts such as lines, boxes, and masks, the models can better understand and solve problems.  Experiments across diverse mathematical and visual reasoning tasks reveal substantial performance gains over strong baseline models, demonstrating SKETCHPAD's effectiveness and setting a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

> üîº This figure showcases four examples of how SKETCHPAD, a framework that allows multimodal language models to generate intermediate sketches for reasoning, improves the performance of GPT-4 on various tasks.  Each example demonstrates a different task: geometry (proving angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees), math function (determining convexity/concavity), visual search (identifying the type of a shop from an image), and spatial reasoning (determining if cookies are stacked). In each example, the model utilizes sketching as an intermediary step in the reasoning process. Without SKETCHPAD, GPT-4 fails to solve these problems correctly, whereas SKETCHPAD + GPT-4 solves them accurately.

### In-depth insights


#### Visual Reasoning
Visual reasoning, a crucial aspect of human intelligence, involves understanding and inferring information from visual data.  It's a complex process encompassing several stages such as **visual perception**, **object recognition**, **spatial reasoning**, and **causal inference**.  Research in visual reasoning often focuses on developing computational models capable of mimicking these abilities, particularly within the context of artificial intelligence.  These models, often utilizing deep learning techniques, aim to achieve robust performance on diverse benchmarks that require understanding visual relationships and solving visual puzzles.  **Key challenges** include handling ambiguous or noisy visual input, dealing with varying levels of abstraction, and integrating visual information with other modalities like language.  The development of effective visual reasoning systems holds significant implications for applications such as autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and robotics, where the ability to accurately interpret and reason from visual data is paramount.  Furthermore, **research explores the interplay between visual and linguistic information**, investigating how language can guide and improve visual reasoning processes and vice-versa.  The field is continuously evolving with the goal of building more sophisticated, flexible, and explainable AI systems that can truly reason with the visual world.

#### Sketchpad Framework
A hypothetical 'Sketchpad Framework' in a research paper would likely detail a novel approach for integrating visual reasoning capabilities into multimodal language models.  It would likely emphasize **interactive sketching**, allowing the model to generate visual elements (lines, shapes, annotations) during the reasoning process, mimicking human behavior.  The core idea would be to treat the sketchpad as a dynamic workspace that evolves along with the reasoning steps, facilitating a chain of visual thought analogous to chain-of-thought prompting.  The framework would likely involve a combination of techniques such as **programmatic code generation** to instruct the model's drawing tools and integration of **specialist computer vision models** for advanced visual perception and interpretation.  Evaluation would focus on benchmarks demonstrating improved performance in tasks demanding visual reasoning such as geometry and spatial problems.  Key to success would be the ability to demonstrate that the **visual sketches are integral** to the model's problem-solving process and not just decorative additions.

#### Math & Vision Tasks
A hypothetical research paper section titled 'Math & Vision Tasks' would likely explore the intersection of mathematical reasoning and visual perception.  **The core challenge would be how to leverage visual information to improve mathematical problem-solving in AI models.** This might involve tasks such as solving geometry problems using diagrams, analyzing graphs represented visually, or understanding mathematical functions through their plotted graphs.  The section would likely benchmark different multimodal AI architectures' performance across a range of carefully designed tasks, comparing their accuracy and efficiency against baselines and potentially other state-of-the-art models.  **A key focus would be on the types of visual reasoning mechanisms used by the models to arrive at their solutions**, such as the ability to identify relevant features in images, draw intermediate sketches, or apply specialist computer vision techniques.  The authors would likely discuss the implications of their findings for the design of future multimodal AI systems and the potential for such systems to tackle more complex problems requiring both visual understanding and mathematical reasoning.  **Analysis of model performance might reveal valuable insights into the relationship between visual and mathematical cognition in AI**. The research would also need to address limitations, perhaps focusing on the difficulty of creating robust evaluation datasets and the challenges of interpreting model behaviour within complex, real-world scenarios.

#### Multimodal Reasoning
Multimodal reasoning, at its core, seeks to enable artificial intelligence systems to understand and interact with information presented across various modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video.  **A key challenge lies in effectively fusing information from these diverse sources, each carrying unique representational characteristics.**  Current approaches often involve complex architectures that integrate modality-specific encoders and decoders, aiming for seamless information exchange and joint reasoning.  However, **many existing methods struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationships and contextual dependencies between different modalities.**  Furthermore, evaluating the success of multimodal reasoning remains a significant hurdle, as benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics continue to evolve and improve, reflecting the diverse applications and problem settings.  **The development of more robust and explainable multimodal reasoning models is crucial, enabling more nuanced understanding and interactions with the increasingly multimodal world around us.**  This includes developing methods capable of handling incomplete or noisy data from multiple modalities.  Additionally, research into interpretability and transparency will help us understand decision-making processes in these complex systems.

#### Future of SKETCHPAD
The future of SKETCHPAD lies in **expanding its capabilities** beyond the current mathematical and visual reasoning tasks.  Integrating more sophisticated vision models, particularly those handling nuanced visual cues like depth perception and object relationships, will broaden SKETCHPAD's application in complex real-world scenarios.  **Developing a more versatile sketching interface** is crucial, enabling the model to handle various drawing styles and input modalities, including touch and gesture-based interactions. Furthermore, **improving the interpretability** of SKETCHPAD's reasoning process is important.  Analyzing its intermediate sketches and thought processes could unlock insights into its decision-making mechanism, facilitating more trustworthy and reliable results.  Lastly, **exploring collaborative sketching** will enhance the system's ability to handle more intricate and knowledge-intensive tasks, allowing multiple agents to contribute visual elements and ideas to reach a solution. This opens up possibilities of collaboration between human and AI.
