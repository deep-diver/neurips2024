[{"figure_path": "07N0qoaZ2L/tables/tables_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparisons of settings and regret bounds with most related works, * represents the player-optimal stable regret and bounds without labeling * are for player-pessimal stable regret, # represents the centralized setting. N and K are the number of players and arms with N < K, T is the total horizon, \u0394 corresponds to some preference gap, \u03b5 depends on the hyper-parameter of algorithms, and C is related to the unique stable matching condition which can grow exponentially in N. The definition of \u0394 in different works requires particular care. We use gap\u2081, gap\u2082, gap\u2083, gap\u2084 represent the minimum preference gap between the (player-optimal) stable arm and the next arm after the stable arm in the preference ranking among all players, the minimum preference gap between any different arms among all players, the minimum preference gap between the first N + 1 ranked arms among all players, and the minimum preference gap between arms that are more preferred than the next of the player-optimal stable arm among all players, respectively. Based on the property that the player-optimal stable arm of each player must be its first N-ranked (shown in Appendix), there would be gap\u2081 \u2265 gap\u2084 \u2265 gap\u2083 \u2265 gap\u2082. So our dependence on \u0394 is better than the state-of-the-art works [30, 16] for general markets.", "description": "This table compares the proposed algorithm with existing works in terms of regret bounds and settings.  It highlights the improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm, particularly in scenarios where the number of players is significantly smaller than the number of arms.  Different metrics for the preference gap (\u0394) are defined and compared. ", "section": "2 Related Work"}]
