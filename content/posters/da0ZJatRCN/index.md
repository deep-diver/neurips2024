### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) helps understand how variations in input variables affect the output of a function, crucial for various scientific and engineering domains. However, evaluating these functions can be expensive, especially with limited experimental resources.  This is addressed by using surrogate models, which are approximations of the real functions, but they require a substantial number of evaluations. Furthermore, derivative-based GSA methods can sometimes struggle with functions that are not monotonic (functions that do not always increase or decrease). 

This research tackles these issues by introducing novel active learning acquisition functions that directly target derivative-based GSA measures (DGSMs), using Gaussian processes (GPs).  **The key innovation is to focus directly on learning the DGSMs rather than just the function itself, resulting in a significant improvement in sample efficiency.** The researchers tested the methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods, especially when resources are scarce.  They also show that using information-gain based acquisitions functions yields the best results.

### In-depth insights


#### Active Learning GSA
Active learning for global sensitivity analysis (GSA) offers a powerful approach to efficiently explore complex systems with expensive-to-evaluate functions.  **Traditional GSA methods often require numerous function evaluations**, which can be computationally prohibitive or practically infeasible in many scientific domains. Active learning addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative input points for evaluation.  This targeted approach dramatically reduces the number of evaluations needed while still accurately estimating the sensitivity indices.  **Derivative-based GSA methods leverage the gradient information of the function**, which often provides more accurate sensitivity insights compared to variance-based methods.  The combination of active learning with derivative-based GSA is particularly promising as it focuses evaluation efforts on regions where gradient information is most uncertain, allowing for faster convergence and higher accuracy in sensitivity estimation. The key challenge in this area lies in the design of acquisition functions which optimally balance exploration and exploitation. **Finding acquisition functions that directly target and efficiently estimate derivative-based sensitivity measures is a key area of current research**, as this approach allows for faster and more targeted learning compared to approaches that only target the function itself.

#### Derivative-Based GSA
Derivative-based global sensitivity analysis (DGSA) offers a powerful alternative to variance-based methods.  **Instead of relying on variance decomposition, DGSA leverages the gradient of the function to quantify the impact of input variables.** This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with complex, computationally expensive models where direct variance calculations are impractical.  **A key advantage is that DGSA directly captures the local sensitivity, providing finer-grained insights into how inputs influence outputs, especially useful in non-monotonic relationships where variance-based GSA might miss critical details.** However, accurately estimating DGSA measures often requires many function evaluations, making it computationally costly. The paper explores active learning techniques to alleviate this, which is a crucial contribution. Active learning intelligently selects the most informative input points for evaluation, thus enhancing the efficiency of the DGSM estimation. This methodology is particularly relevant in applications with limited budgets for evaluations or computational resources, where **efficient experimental design is paramount.** By concentrating evaluation efforts on the regions where they yield the most information, active learning significantly improves sample efficiency, making DGSA a more accessible tool for a broader range of applications.

#### GP Surrogate Models
Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate models are crucial for efficient global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of computationally expensive black-box functions.  **GPs offer a probabilistic framework**, providing not only predictions but also associated uncertainties, which are essential for guiding active learning strategies in GSA.  Instead of directly evaluating the expensive function, a GP is trained on a smaller set of evaluations to learn a surrogate model. This surrogate, approximating the original function, is then used for sensitivity analysis calculations, **significantly reducing the computational burden**.  The choice of kernel function in the GP is crucial; it dictates the smoothness and complexity of the surrogate model, and it significantly impacts the accuracy of GSA.  The derivative-based GSA methods presented in this paper rely heavily on the ability of GP surrogates to accurately represent not only the function's value but also its derivatives, making **differentiable kernel functions a necessity**. The accuracy and efficiency of the surrogate model directly influence the quality of the sensitivity indices and hence the effectiveness of the active learning approach used.

#### Acquisition Functions
The core of the active learning strategy lies within the acquisition functions, which intelligently guide the selection of the next data points to evaluate.  **The authors propose novel acquisition functions that directly target key quantities of derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSMs), moving beyond simply optimizing the model fit of the underlying function.**  Instead of focusing solely on minimizing uncertainty in function predictions, these functions directly address the uncertainty and information gain related to the DGSMs themselves.  This targeted approach is crucial because estimating DGSMs requires accurate gradients, and the acquisition functions ensure efficient learning of the necessary information.  **Three strategies are presented: maximum variance, variance reduction, and information gain, each offering a different perspective on prioritizing data point selection.** These strategies are carefully developed to ensure computational tractability under the assumption of a Gaussian process surrogate model, a common approach for handling expensive black-box functions.  **The key to the success of these functions lies in leveraging the mathematical properties of the Gaussian processes to compute tractable estimates of uncertainty and information gain for DGSMs**, thereby making the active learning process both computationally feasible and highly sample-efficient. The efficacy of the proposed functions is rigorously evaluated using a range of synthetic and real-world problems, showcasing a substantial improvement over traditional space-filling methods in sample efficiency, particularly when dealing with limited evaluation budgets.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the acquisition functions to handle non-Gaussian processes** would significantly broaden the applicability of the proposed active learning strategies.  Currently, the reliance on Gaussian Processes limits the applicability to problems where this assumption holds.  Another important direction would be **developing batch active learning methods**, moving beyond the myopic single-point selection.  **Investigating the theoretical properties of the proposed acquisition functions** such as convergence rates and regret bounds would provide a deeper understanding and further improve their sample efficiency.  Finally, **a detailed comparison with variance-based global sensitivity analysis (ANOVA)** methods would be crucial, assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches under various conditions.  This could involve a study on the efficiency, accuracy, and computational cost, potentially leading to hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both derivative-based and variance-based methods.
