However, evaluating these functions can be expensive, especially with limited experimental resources.  This is addressed by using surrogate models, which are approximations of the real functions, but they require a substantial number of evaluations. Furthermore, derivative-based GSA methods can sometimes struggle with functions that are not monotonic (functions that do not always increase or decrease). \nThis research tackles these issues by introducing novel active learning acquisition functions that directly target derivative-based GSA measures (DGSMs), using Gaussian processes (GPs).  **The key innovation is to focus directly on learning the DGSMs rather than just the function itself, resulting in a significant improvement in sample efficiency.** The researchers tested the methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods, especially when resources are scarce.  They also show that using information-gain based acquisitions functions yields the best results.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "da0ZJatRCN/podcast.wav"}
