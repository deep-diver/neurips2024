Furthermore, different feature distributions derived from different domains may increase the uncertainty of models. To overcome these issues, we propose a style adaptation and uncertainty estimation (SAUE) approach for multi-source blended-target domain adaptation (MBDA). Specifically, we exploit the extra knowledge acquired from the blended-target domain, where a similarity factor is adopted to select more useful target style information for augmenting the source features.Then, to mitigate the negative impact of the domain-specific attributes, we devise a function to estimate and mitigate uncertainty in category prediction.

However, most DA approaches are based on a setting that has single source domain and single target domain [1, 2].

MTDA aims to learn a model that can simultaneously utilize information from single source domain and multiple target domains and then perform well in multiple target domains. For instance, HGAN [10] adopts a heterogeneous graph attention network to explore the relations among multiple target domain features. In [11], multiple expert models employed the corresponding source-target domain pair-groups and were then aligned by a student model. Although the existing MTDA approaches have made certain progress, the standard MTDA is still facing challenges because massive amounts of unlabeled data drawn from different distributions are commonly used in real-world settings. It is time-consuming and expensive to divide massive data into multiple corresponding distributions (target domains). For example, for encrypted data stored in a cloud server, due to privacy protection, models cannot directly know the origins of these data (domain labels), which are drawn from different distributions and are blended into a large target domain. Based on the above-mentioned case, blended-target DA (BTDA), which is a more beneficial scenario in real-world settings, has been proposed [12].

Therefore, simply utilizing MTDA or SSDA (single source domain adaptation) methods to handle the BTDA task may lead to negative transfer because the domain labels of target domains are unseen, and the category feature space is a hybrid space. As the first deep learning work focused on the BTDA scenario, AMEAN [12] employs two adversarial learning steps and utilizes meta-learning to minimize the domain gap between the source domain and the blended-target domain. However, insufficient information obtained from single source domain makes models difficult to align the distributions of multiple target domains. Moreover, the presence of different distributions in the blended-target domain may aggravate negative transfer. Recently, multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) [14, 15, 16] has produced impressive results.

The current SSDA methods are mainly divided into two types: distance metric-based approaches [17, 18, 19] and adversarial learning-based approaches [20, 21, 22, 23]. Distance metricbased methods learn domain-invariant representations through feature discrepancy matching by using a distance metric function. DAN [18] utilizes multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to measure the discrepancy between the source and target domains and then minimizes the discrepancy to learn domain-invariant representations. CAF [19] utilizes sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) [24] to measure domain discrepancy. Motivated by the GANs [25, 26], adversarial learning-based SSDA methods have also been widely researched [20, 21, 22, 23]. Adversarial learning methods perform min-max two-player games between the category classifier and domain discriminator to learn domain-invariant representations. DANN [20], which was the earliest work in adversarial learning-based SSDA, successfully achieves domain-level adaptation via a gradient reverse layer. Different from DANN, SCDA [22] and DALN [23] remove the discriminator from their networks and model the adversarial relation between the feature extractor and category classifier.
