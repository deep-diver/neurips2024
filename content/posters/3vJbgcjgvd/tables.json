The feature functions are used as input to a machine learning model to learn the dynamics of the system. FO-CMP uses only first order moments and a simpler set of features, while HO-CMP expands to include second-order moments, enabling better capture of nonlinear dynamics.", "section": "3 Algorithm"}]
