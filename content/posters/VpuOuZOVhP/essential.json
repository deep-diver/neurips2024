Existing solutions like re-balancing or manual data augmentation have limitations, including a limited search space and reliance on manually-designed strategies. This often leads to suboptimal model performance and increased development costs.\n\nThe proposed LLM-AutoDA framework uses large language models (LLMs) to overcome these issues.  By automatically searching for and applying optimal augmentation strategies, **LLM-AutoDA significantly improves model performance** on standard long-tailed learning benchmarks.  The framework's iterative process, guided by performance feedback, continually refines the generated strategies, leading to more robust and effective data augmentation.  This automated approach offers significant advantages in efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VpuOuZOVhP/podcast.wav"}
