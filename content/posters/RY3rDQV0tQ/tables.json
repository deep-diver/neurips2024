The comparison is based on four key metrics derived from experiments using the MNIST digits dataset: the number of parameters in each network, the FLOPS (floating-point operations) per step, the energy consumption per image generated, and the number of images generated per second.  The table provides a quantitative comparison of the computational efficiency and resource requirements of different approaches to denoising diffusion models.", "section": "A.2.1 Scaling with Output Image Resolution"}, {"figure_path": "RY3rDQV0tQ/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Properties of Optical, Convolutional U-Net and Fully Connected Denoising Networks, the same training settings with the main text are used in all experiments with the MNIST digits dataset.", "description": "This table compares the performance of three different denoising network architectures: a fully connected network, a convolutional U-Net, and an optical denoising unit (ODU).
