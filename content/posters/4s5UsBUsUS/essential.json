This necessitates more efficient and adaptable models that can capture long-range dependencies.  The paper addresses this by using Selective State Space Models (S6), which offer a balance of efficiency and modeling power for long sequences.\nThe proposed VFIMamba method introduces the Mixed-SSM Block which combines adjacent frames in an interleaved fashion, enhancing information transmission between frames while maintaining linear complexity.  Additionally, a curriculum learning strategy is implemented to improve the model's ability to handle varying motion magnitudes.  Experiments show VFIMamba achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly for high-resolution video, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "4s5UsBUsUS/podcast.wav"}
