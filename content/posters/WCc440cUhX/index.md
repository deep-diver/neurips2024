### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable proficiency in language tasks, but their internal mechanisms are not well understood. One major challenge is understanding how LLMs use their training data statistics, which is crucial for improving model training and addressing issues like brittleness and bias. This paper attempts to demystify transformer predictions by describing how they depend on their context in terms of simple N-gram based statistics.

The authors develop a novel approach to study this statistical dependence. By analyzing how well a family of functions (based on simple N-gram statistics) approximates transformer predictions, they discover several things. This includes a simple way to detect overfitting, how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules, and when transformer predictions tend to be approximated by N-gram rules. They found high agreement between the top-1 predictions of LLMs and N-gram rulesets, suggesting that N-gram rules can effectively explain a significant portion of LLM behavior.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers working with large language models (LLMs). It offers **novel insights into how LLMs utilize training data**, providing a **new method to detect overfitting without holdout sets** and a **quantitative measure of LLM learning progress**.

> The figure illustrates how different N-gram rules, derived from the training data and applied to a given context, produce different predictive distributions for the next token.  The example shows three rules applied to the context 'the tired dog': one using all three tokens (4-gram), one using only the first and last (3-gram), and one marginalizing over the middle token (also 3-gram). The choice of which rule best matches the transformer's prediction is a key aspect of the paper's methodology.

### In-depth insights


#### Transformer Demystified
A heading titled "Transformer Demystified" suggests an attempt to simplify and clarify the inner workings of transformer models.  This could involve exploring their mathematical foundations in an accessible way, perhaps using analogies or visualizations to illustrate complex concepts like attention mechanisms and self-attention.  **A key aspect would likely be demystifying the 'black box' nature of transformers**, explaining how input data is processed and how predictions are generated.  The discussion might involve contrasting transformer behavior with simpler models to highlight their unique strengths and capabilities.  The exploration could also examine the role of training data in shaping the model's performance, discussing concepts like overfitting, generalization, and bias.  **A successful "Transformer Demystified" section would bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications**, making the technology more approachable for a broader audience while still maintaining scientific rigor.

#### N-gram Approximation
The concept of 'N-gram Approximation' in the context of large language models (LLMs) centers on **using simplified N-gram statistical models to approximate the complex behavior of LLMs**.  This approach offers a valuable way to **gain insights into how LLMs utilize their training data** and make predictions. By comparing the predictions of N-gram models with those of LLMs, researchers can **quantify the degree of LLM reliance on simple statistical rules** derived from N-grams. The method provides a lens through which to analyze various aspects, including the detection of overfitting, the tracking of training dynamics, and a better understanding of how well LLMs can be approximated by N-gram-based rulesets.  The strength of this approach lies in its **simplicity and ability to unveil hidden dynamics** that are otherwise difficult to observe in the intricate workings of LLMs. **Limitations** include the fact that N-gram models are descriptive, not explanatory and that true LLM behavior surpasses simple N-gram statistics.  Despite this, N-gram approximation provides a unique tool to bridge the gap between simple statistical models and the complexity of LLMs, thereby offering crucial insights into their functioning.

#### LLM Learning Dynamics
The section on "LLM Learning Dynamics" would explore how large language models (LLMs) evolve their statistical understanding of the training data during learning.  **Curriculum learning** is a key concept, examining whether LLMs learn simpler statistical rules (e.g., based on shorter N-grams) earlier in training before progressing to more complex rules that capture longer-range dependencies.  The analysis may involve tracking a measure of how well LLM predictions are approximated by rules of varying complexities (such as those based on N-gram statistics) as training progresses.  The study might uncover a **dynamic shift in the types of statistical rules** the model relies on, potentially revealing insights into how LLMs internalize and organize their knowledge. The authors might also investigate whether the learning process displays distinct phases or patterns of rule acquisition and refinement, providing evidence for or against the notion of a learning curriculum. A key aspect to explore would be the potential correlation between the learning dynamics and other phenomena such as overfitting and generalization.

#### Overfitting Detection
The proposed overfitting detection method is quite novel, leveraging the approximation of LLM predictions with N-gram rules.  Instead of relying on holdout sets, **it assesses the model's ability to generalize using only training data**. By analyzing the model variance across different training runs for various N-gram rules, it identifies when a model overfits.  **High model variance indicates overfitting**, suggesting that the model is memorizing training data specifics rather than learning generalizable patterns.  This is because consistent predictions (low variance) often correlate with simple statistical rules that generalize better, while inconsistent predictions (high variance) suggest over-reliance on highly specific training data features. The method's simplicity and lack of reliance on holdout data are particularly valuable, offering a more efficient and practical approach to detecting overfitting during training.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could involve exploring more complex rule sets beyond simple N-grams, potentially incorporating richer linguistic features or incorporating external knowledge sources.  **Investigating the interplay between model size, training data characteristics and the effectiveness of rule-based approximations is crucial.**  A deeper examination of the relationship between model variance and the applicability of N-gram rulesets is warranted. The exploration of whether similar rule-based approximations can be applied to different architectures beyond transformers and their extension to larger, more diverse datasets are important next steps.  **Furthermore, research is needed to bridge the gap between descriptive and explanatory rule-based models.** This would entail developing methods to predict in advance when and why specific rules provide accurate approximations of LLM predictions. Finally, it would be beneficial to investigate the robustness of the proposed methods to variations in dataset biases and to different training methodologies.

> This figure visualizes the relationship between the frequency of 7-gram contexts in the TinyStories dataset, the model variance of LLM predictions for those contexts, and how well those predictions can be approximated by N-gram rules.  Panel (a) shows the distance between LLM predictions and the full-context 8-gram rule versus the context's frequency. Panel (b) shows the same distance versus model variance. Panel (c) shows model variance versus context frequency. Panel (d) shows the distance to the best-fitting N-gram rule (from a set of suffix-based rules) versus model variance. The figure demonstrates that contexts with low model variance tend to be well-approximated by N-gram rules, even when rare.  This supports the paper's approximation criterion.

> This figure shows the learning dynamics of LLMs.  The left panel shows that the distance between LLM predictions and the optimal rules (based on n-gram statistics) decreases as training progresses, with more complex rules being learned later in training. The central and right panels show that while the overall distance between LLM predictions and the optimal rules may plateau, the quality of the optimal rule selection increases over training as measured by top-1 accuracy relative to the ground truth.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/WCc440cUhX/figures_7_2.jpg)

> This figure shows the training and validation loss curves for various LLMs trained on the TinyStories dataset.  The models differ in their context length‚Äîthe number of previous tokens they consider when predicting the next token. The full transformer model exhibits overfitting, showing a decreasing training loss but an increasing validation loss.  In contrast, the models with limited context lengths show nearly identical training and validation loss curves, indicating that they do not overfit.  This suggests that overfitting occurs when LLMs try to memorize long contexts instead of generalizing from shorter sub-contexts.

The scatter plot shows that as the unigram count increases, the variational distance generally decreases for both transformer models, indicating improved approximation of the bigram model by the transformers.  The figure highlights the impact of context length on the ability of transformer models to learn simple bigram statistics.
