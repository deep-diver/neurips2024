Subfigure (a) shows convergence and gradient error, demonstrating F2CBA's accuracy and efficiency compared to cvxpylayer. Subfigure (b) analyzes the tradeoff between accuracy and convergence speed by varying gradient inexactness (a), showing that increased inexactness reduces computation time while maintaining reasonable convergence.
