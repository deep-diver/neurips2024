On the other hand, we can evaluate the empirical risk $\\left(L_{\\mathbf{H}_{s}}\\right)$ by assessing the model\u2019s performance on the validation set. If the generalization error is known, it is possible to estimate the population risk $(L_{\\mu})$ . Therefore, the most challenging aspect is addressing the generalization error. Furthermore, we will illustrate the interpretation of Theorem 2 from the perspectives of pruning methods and the ICL shot numbers. (i) Adjusting the $F$ -norm of $\\left([\\Delta\\mathbf{W}_{t}]_{1}^{L}/[\\mathbf{G}_{t}]_{1}^{L}\\right)$ could enhance performance when utilizing $I C L,$ suggesting that other weight-based pruning methods may also be effective. For example, magnitude-based pruning [52] directly controls the matrix $F$ -norm. Certainly, there are also some layer-based pruning methods (e.g., drop-layer method $I I^{Q}J,$ ), we discuss in detail in Appendix B.6. (ii) Reducing the ICL shot numbers from $N$ to $N^{'}$ can indeed lead to more robust outcomes specifically in the \u201cSVD weight pruning\u201d operation, rather than in the model\u2019s overall performance. Experimentally, in Section 2.2, we analyze the effect of different ICL shot numbers.
