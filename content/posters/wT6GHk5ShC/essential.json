This paper investigates the effect of SVD-based weight pruning, a model compression technique, on ICL performance.  Previous research has shown that model compression can significantly reduce storage and computational costs without affecting accuracy, but the relationship between model compression and ICL has not been well explored. This work addresses this gap by examining whether and how pruning weights in LLMs affects their ICL capabilities.\nThe researchers discovered that SVD-based weight pruning significantly enhances ICL performance. Surprisingly, pruning weights in deeper layers often leads to more stable performance improvements compared to shallower layers.  To understand this phenomenon, they presented a theoretical analysis using implicit gradient descent and provided mutual information based generalization bounds for ICL.  Based on this analysis, they proposed a derivative-free algorithm that enhances ICL inference for downstream tasks. Experiments show that this simple algorithm improves model performance on various benchmark datasets and open-source LLMs. This demonstrates the potential of using SVD-based weight pruning to improve efficiency and performance in LLMs.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "wT6GHk5ShC/podcast.wav"}
