The interior point method (IPM) is a popular approach for solving NLPs; however, its performance is hampered by the need to solve large systems of linear equations. This paper addresses this computational bottleneck by proposing IPM-LSTM.\n\nIPM-LSTM uses LSTM neural networks to efficiently approximate solutions to these linear systems, significantly reducing the computational burden of the IPM. The approximated solutions are then used to warm-start a standard interior point solver, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of NLP solving.  The results demonstrate that IPM-LSTM outperforms traditional methods, achieving substantial improvements in solution time and iteration count across various NLP types, including quadratic programs and quadratically constrained quadratic programs.", "affiliation": "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "9c3IiAWeiN/podcast.wav"}
