HLB is related to the HRR in being derived via a similar approach, but replacing the Fourier transform F(.) with the Hadamard transform (which simplifies out). The MAP is most similar to our approach in mechanics, but the difference in derived unbinding steps leads to dramatically different performance. The VTB is the most recently developed VSA in modern use.", "description": "This table summarizes the binding and unbinding operations, as well as the vector initialization for five different vector symbolic architectures (VSAs): HRR, VTB, MAP-C, MAP-B, and the novel HLB method proposed in the paper.  It highlights the key differences in their mathematical formulations and how these differences affect their computational efficiency and performance.  The table shows that the HLB method is related to the HRR, but uses the Hadamard transform instead of the Fourier transform, leading to simplification.  While MAP has a similar structure, the difference in the unbinding operation greatly impacts the performance. The VTB is presented as a recently developed state-of-the-art method for comparison.", "section": "Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "p3hNrpeWMe/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Accuracy comparison of the proposed HLB with HRR, VTB, MAP-C, and MAP-B in CSPS.
