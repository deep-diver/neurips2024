However, existing retargeting methods often struggle to balance the preservation of key semantics and image quality, resulting in either deformation or loss of important objects, or the introduction of local artifacts such as discontinuous pixels and inconsistent regenerated content. To address these issues, we propose a content-aware retargeting method called PruneRepaint. It incorporates semantic importance for each pixel to guide the identification of regions that need to be pruned or preserved in order to maintain key semantics. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive repainting module that selects image regions for repainting based on the distribution of pruned pixels and the proportion between foreground size and target aspect ratio, thus achieving local smoothness after pruning. By focusing on the content and structure of the foreground, our PruneRepaint approach adaptively avoids key content loss and deformation, while effectively mitigating artifacts with local repainting. We conduct experiments on the public RetargetMe benchmark and demonstrate through objective experimental results and subjective user studies that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of preserving semantics and aesthetics, as well as better generalization across diverse aspect ratios.

On the contrary, crop-based methods [38, 29] introduce no artifacts but often results in the loss of key semantics (see Figure 1 (c)). To relieve these problems, following methods typically use pixel-shifting operators. Noticeable works include seam-carving [1, 28], which calculates energy using manual operators [6, 2] to identify seams for deletion. Some other works [5, 39, 14] further integrate these traditional operators to enhance the generalization to different scenarios.

Moreover, these methods only focus on foreground regions, typically leading to discontinuous backgrounds and decreased aesthetic appeal. Towards better aesthetics and region consistency, other works [3, 31, 22, 8] achieve image retargeting from a generative perspective with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [10]. These methods often implicitly learn the semantic distribution of images to regenerate retargeted images.

This approach ensures that important objects are preserved in the image even if they exceed the expected size, resulting in a flexible method that can handle images with any aspect ratio.

Croppingbased methods [38, 29] chooses the best window of target size from the original image, which preserves the structure but leads to the loss of crucial information outside the window.
