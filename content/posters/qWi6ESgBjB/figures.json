It shows how the original image and mask image are used as input to an IP-Adapter and ControlNet respectively. The IP-Adapter processes the original image ('guide') to incorporate its features into the diffusion process. The ControlNet, meanwhile, receives the mask image which guides the inpainting process by selectively updating the pixels according to the mask.  The intermediate output from the IP-Adapter is then processed by the main U-Net-like structure which produces the final repainted image (Yt-1). This image-guided repainting module works in conjunction with the Adaptive Repainting Region Determination module to address abrupt pixels resulting from seam carving, restoring local smoothness and improving the overall quality of the retargeted image.", "section": "3.3.2 Image-guided Repainting"}, {"figure_path": "qWi6ESgBjB/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Visual comparison to other retargeting methods on ratio 16:9.", "description": "This figure compares the visual results of different image retargeting methods on a 16:9 aspect ratio.
