In the case of Adversarial Random Forests, a tree is sampled uniformly at random, then a leaf is sampled in the tree and finally an observation is sampled according to the distribution \"attached\" to the leaf. Hence, only one tree is used to generate an observation. In our case, we leverage the combinatorial power of the trees in the forest: all trees are used to generate one observation, as each is contributing to one leaf.", "description": "This figure compares two methods for generating data: Adversarial Random Forests (ARFs) and Generative Forests (GFs). ARFs randomly select a tree, then a leaf within that tree, and finally sample an observation from the leaf's distribution.  In contrast, GFs utilize all trees simultaneously, combining the information from all leaves to generate a single observation. This highlights the key difference: ARFs use only one tree per observation, while GFs leverage the collective power of the entire forest.", "section": "Generative forests: models and data generation"}]
