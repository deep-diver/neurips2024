Existing models struggle with efficiency and theoretical guarantees.  Neural nets dominate unstructured data but underperform on tabular data in many cases. \nThis research introduces Generative Forests (GFs), a novel class of forest-based models, along with a simple, theoretically-sound training algorithm (GF.BOOST).  GF.BOOST minimizes losses efficiently and the model structure facilitates fast density estimations. Experiments demonstrate that GFs produce substantially better results than state-of-the-art methods in data generation, imputation, and density estimation. **The algorithm's simplicity and theoretical guarantees are key strengths**. **Significant improvements are demonstrated across various tasks**.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Generative Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cRlQHncjwT/podcast.wav"}
