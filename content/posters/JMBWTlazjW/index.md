### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Modern Language Models (LLMs) often undergo a final training stage using preference feedback to enhance their capabilities. However, the methods used vary widely, making it difficult to isolate the effects of data, algorithms, reward models, and training prompts. This lack of understanding hinders the development of more effective LLM training strategies.

This paper systematically studies these four core aspects of preference-based learning, comparing the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The results show that data quality matters most, followed by the algorithm choice (PPO outperforming DPO), reward model quality, and finally, the choice of training prompts.  While scaling reward models showed gains in mathematical evaluation, other categories saw only marginal improvement. The study also provides a recipe for effective preference-based learning.

> This figure shows the impact of different factors on the performance of a language model trained using preference feedback.  The left panel shows accuracy on the GSM (Grade School Math) benchmark, focusing on mathematical reasoning. The right panel displays the overall performance across 11 different benchmarks. Each bar represents a model trained with a specific combination of factors, such as the quality of preference data, learning algorithm (DPO or PPO), and reward model. The figure highlights the importance of each of these factors in achieving good performance. Notably, PPO generally outperforms DPO, and high-quality preference data leads to the most significant improvement.

> This table presents the results of training a 13B parameter T√úLU language model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on fourteen different preference datasets.  The table shows the model's performance across several evaluation categories (Factuality, Reasoning, Coding, Truthfulness, Safety, and Instruction Following).  The performance is compared against a baseline model trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT).  The color-coding highlights improvements (blue) and degradations (orange) compared to the baseline. The overall findings indicate that synthetic datasets tend to yield the best results, and DPO training primarily improves truthfulness and instruction-following capabilities.





### In-depth insights


#### Pref-Based Learning
Preference-based learning (Pref-based learning) offers a powerful paradigm for enhancing language models by leveraging human preferences over generated outputs.  **This method sidesteps the complexities of precisely defining reward functions**, a significant challenge in traditional reinforcement learning. Instead, it directly optimizes the model based on human judgments comparing different outputs.  This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with nuanced aspects of language like helpfulness, harmlessness, or overall quality, which are difficult to capture with explicit rules.  **The choice of data, algorithm, and reward models significantly impacts performance.**  High-quality preference data is crucial, with synthetic data often demonstrating superior results compared to manually annotated sets. **Effective algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are key to successfully integrating these preferences into model training.**  While simpler methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) exist, PPO often outperforms DPO in diverse downstream tasks, though at a higher computational cost.  Further research into developing more efficient and scalable pref-based learning methods remains important, especially concerning large-scale deployment.

#### PPO vs. DPO
The comparison of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) for learning from preference feedback reveals crucial differences in their approaches and performance.  **PPO, an online method**, trains a reward model to score generated responses, iteratively refining a policy model based on these scores.  **DPO, conversely, is an offline method**, directly training the policy model on preference data without an intermediary reward model. While **DPO offers computational efficiency**,  **PPO demonstrates superior downstream performance** across various evaluation metrics, particularly in complex tasks requiring reasoning and code generation.  The choice between PPO and DPO involves a trade-off between computational cost and performance gains, with PPO's enhanced capabilities justifying its higher computational demand in many scenarios.

#### Reward Model Impact
The study's findings on reward model impact reveal a complex relationship between reward model size and performance.  **Larger reward models (70B parameters) yielded significant improvements on specific tasks, most notably GSM (mathematics reasoning), exceeding gains from smaller models.** However, this improvement didn't generalize broadly across all benchmarks.  Surprisingly, other categories showed only marginal gains despite significant gains in mathematical evaluations.  This suggests that while scaling up reward model size can be beneficial for specialized tasks, it may not necessarily translate to substantial improvements in overall model performance.  **The quality and diversity of the reward model training data also play a crucial role**, highlighting the need for high-quality preference data for optimal results. The research emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation across diverse benchmarks rather than relying solely on a limited set of metrics to accurately gauge overall performance improvements. **This highlights a critical challenge in effectively leveraging learning from preferences ‚Äî achieving improvements across a wide range of abilities remains difficult even with significantly improved reward models.**

#### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in effectively utilizing large language models (LLMs).  **Careful crafting of prompts significantly impacts the quality and relevance of LLM outputs.**  The paper highlights that prompt engineering is not a standalone process, but rather deeply intertwined with other aspects of LLM training and fine-tuning, such as data selection and reward model design. **High-quality prompts, particularly those tailored to specific downstream tasks, can substantially improve model performance.**  However, the paper also suggests that the effectiveness of prompt engineering is dependent on the strength of other components within the training pipeline. While targeted prompts can yield significant gains in specific areas, applying more general prompts and leveraging well-trained reward models can provide more robust performance across diverse tasks. Therefore, a well-rounded approach, **combining effective prompt engineering with other best practices,** is essential for maximizing the capabilities of LLMs. 

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize expanding the scope of learning from preference feedback beyond the current limitations.  **Addressing the computational cost of PPO and the scalability challenges of large-scale reward models** is crucial. Investigating the impact of diverse, high-quality preference data from various sources, including synthetic generation and human annotation, is needed.  **Exploring more efficient algorithms** than PPO, that can match or surpass its performance while maintaining scalability, is another key area.  Furthermore, future efforts should focus on understanding how to better incorporate domain-specific knowledge and contextual information into reward models to improve downstream performance. **A deeper investigation into handling potential biases** embedded in existing datasets is also necessary to create fairer and more robust language models. Finally, expanding the evaluation benchmarks beyond currently used metrics to incorporate a broader range of capabilities would provide a more thorough understanding of the impacts and limitations of these approaches.

> This figure illustrates the core components of two prominent preference-based learning algorithms: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  DPO directly trains a policy model using preference data, represented by prompts, responses, and rankings. In contrast, PPO uses a two-stage approach. First, it trains a reward model on the preference data. Then, this reward model scores the responses generated by the policy model during training. These scores guide the policy model's training, resulting in improved response quality based on the learned preferences.
