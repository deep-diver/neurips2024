TBS, shown on the top half, addresses the temporal aspect of diffusion models by using learnable activation binarizers and cross-timestep connections to handle the highly timestep-correlated activation features.  SPD, depicted in the bottom half, focuses on the spatial aspect by using patch-wise distillation to overcome challenges in matching binary features during the training process.
