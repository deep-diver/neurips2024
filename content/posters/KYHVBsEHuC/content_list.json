DiffuPac leverages a BERT model with 12 transformer blocks, each featuring 12 attention heads and an embedding dimension of 768, to capture nuanced relationships in network traffic. This setup supports the maximum sequence length of 512. The diffusion model incorporates time step embedding to provide temporal context, enhancing the model\u2019s understanding of the reverse process. To manage the computational demands, particularly during the sampling phase, a projection layer reduces the embedding dimension to 128. Additionally, DiffuPac utilizes the FAISS library (Douze et al. [2024]), renowned for its capability to handle large-scale similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Experimental Details. Our experimental framework integrates advanced feature extraction tools and a diverse set of machine learning classifiers, building on methodologies established in the Traffic Manipulator research. We employ 2 feature extractors: AfterImage (Mirsky et al. [2018]), which provides detailed packet statistics, and CICFlowMeter (Draper-Gil et al. [2016]), which assesses connection-level metrics. Recognizing the documented shortcomings of the original CICFlowMeter, our research employs a revised version that integrates enhancements and corrections proposed in recent studies (Engelen et al. [2021], Liu et al. [2022]). These modifications are crucial in ensuring more accurate and reliable feature extraction for our analysis. AfterImage and CICFlowMeter offer a comprehensive view of network traffic, capturing both packet-level and flow-level data essential for nuanced analysis. These feature extractors are integral to NIDS detection as they preprocess network data into structured features that are then analyzed by ML classifiers. This preprocessing step is crucial for transforming raw network traffic into a format that classifiers can effectively interpret, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the anomaly detection. We utilize a variety of machine learning classifiers for anomaly detection, including KitNET (Mirsky et al. [2018]), an ensemble of autoencoders; Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for deep learning; Logistics Regression $(L R)$ , Decision Tree $(D T)$ , and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for traditional approaches; and Isolation Forest $(I F)$ for outlier detection. Our experiments cover 6 types of attacks\u2014Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), Botnet, Brute Force, DDoS, Port Scan, and Infiltration\u2014utilizing data from Kitsune and the CICIDS-2017 dataset.

The nature of Brute Force attacks involves numerous failed login attempts, leading to highly irregular sequence numbers (Javed and Paxson [2013]).

The sheer volume and repetitive nature of DDoS traffic (Haseeb-ur rehman et al. [2023]) make it difficult to disguise effectively. Despite efforts of intelligent mutation process, the high volume and distinctive traffic patterns will cause substantial deviations in the eCDFs as well.

Unlike previous research, which often assumes attacker access to NIDS, DiffuPac operates under constraints of limited attacker knowledge, reflecting more realistic scenarios. Here, we present the in-depths insights obtained from this study: (a) DiffuPac uniquely combines normal and malicious packet sequences using contextual alignments, ensuring seamless integration into genuine traffic while employing these normal packet sequences to guide the denoising process. Through the performance evaluations with various NIDS, our model achieved an average improvement of approximately $6.69$ percentage points in evasion rate compared to the two baselines across all attack types. (b) Evasion rates varied notably across attack types, with DDoS and Brute Force attacks showing higher probabilistic differences due to their complex, repetitive nature. This highlights potential areas for further refinement in DiffuPac\u2019s approach to handling voluminous attacks. (c) Simpler ML models like DT and IF displayed surprising resilience due to their less complex decision boundaries, limiting the effectiveness of DiffuPac\u2019s modifications. In contrast, DNNs, with their intricate decision boundaries, were more vulnerable, underscoring the complexities inherent in designing robust adversarial tactics.

Moreover, adversarial defenses are a key focus of our ongoing research, particularly in relation to DiffuPac\u2019s capabilities. One promising direction is the development of adversarial purification using diffusion models, a technique successfully applied in image processing. This approach treats adversarial perturbations as noise, utilizing the diffusion model\u2019s reverse process to restore network packets to their original state before analysis by NIDS. We believe this method has significant potential for enhancing network security and aim to further develop and test it as a novel defense strategy.
