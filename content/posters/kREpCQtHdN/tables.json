It compares three models: a basic model using only quantized encoding and two augmented models with sequential encoders and a noise estimator, respectively. For each model, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and bias between the true latent factors and their estimated counterparts are reported. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of sequential encoders and noise estimators significantly improves the performance of the latent estimation framework, resulting in higher PCC values and lower bias.", "section": "Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "kREpCQtHdN/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Contribution of each module.", "description": "This table shows the contribution of each module in the latent estimation framework.
