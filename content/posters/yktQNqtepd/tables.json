For each type of tracklet input, the table shows the baseline performance (i.e., the performance without using the proposed method) and the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method significantly improves upon the baseline performance in all cases.  The \"Ours-E\" column shows the performance of the proposed method when the occupancy is predicted for the entire ground-truth bounding box, even if it extends outside of the predicted region of interest (RoI).", "section": "5.3 Shape Completion Results"}, {"figure_path": "yktQNqtepd/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Detection with range breakdown.
