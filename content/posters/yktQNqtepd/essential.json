This limitation affects the accuracy and robustness of perception systems in autonomous driving, hindering safe and efficient navigation.  High-resolution occupancy maps offer a solution, but are computationally expensive for large scenes. \nThe paper proposes a novel approach that combines the advantages of both bounding boxes and occupancy maps using **object-centric occupancy**. This method constructs high-resolution occupancy maps for individual detected objects, enabling more accurate shape representation.  It leverages a new network with an implicit shape decoder that utilizes temporal information from long sequences to complete object shapes under noisy conditions, enhancing the robustness of the system.  Experiments show a significant improvement in detection accuracy, especially for incomplete or distant objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "yktQNqtepd/podcast.wav"}
