Since a 3D bbox is essentially a cuboid that encapsulates the object, it fails to capture the precise details of the object\u2019s shape, particularly for objects with irregular geometries. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the crane is perfectly enclosed by a 3D bounding box. However, its boom, which is a long protrusion relative to the cab, results in a significant amount of unoccupied space within the 3D bounding box. Nevertheless, algorithms that employ 3D bounding boxes as a perception result inherently assume that the space within the bbox is fully occupied, thereby deeming the space enclosed by the 3D bounding box as impassable. Consequently, when addressing complex and irregularly shaped objects, bounding boxes are inadequate in providing fine-grained perceptual outcomes, which can consequently impact the precision of subsequent tasks, such as planning and control.

Compared to 3D bboxes, this representation more effectively captures irregular shapes, thereby enhancing accurate planning and control. Real-time scene-level occupancy generation from sensor inputs is non-trivial, presenting challenges not only for vision-centric inputs due to the absence of depth sensing, but also for LiDAR sensors because of the sparsity of each LiDAR scan (see Fig. 2 (b)). Thus, existing approaches [33, 34] leverage neural networks to predict occupancy in a data-driven manner. Due to computational constraints, these methods typically produce low-resolution occupancy grids for large scene perception (e.g., $200\\times200\\times16$ with a voxel size of $(0.4m)^{3}$ in [27]) or requires intensive training for implicit representation [? ? ], which remains insufficient and inefficiency for practical use.

In real-time applications, 3D detection is prone to drift, and tracking algorithms may lose or mismatch objects, resulting in inaccurate tracklets.

For occupied voxels, the models additionally predict the corresponding semantic class. Another similar task is 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) [24]. Unlike SOP, which only needs to predict the occupancy for visible regions, SSC additionally requires the model to determine the occupancy status at unseen regions. It is worth noting that although SOP and SSC are predominantly associated with vision-centric approaches, they are also applicable to sparse LiDAR or multi-modal inputs [33, 34]. Existing SOP and SSC methods primarily focus on scene-level occupancy, while our work concentrates on object-centric occupancy for better shape representation.

To remedy this issue, [9] employs a residual point probing strategy to remove redundant points in the multi-frame inputs.

Leveraging LiDAR scans and detection annotations from a base 3D dataset, our pipeline probes dense occupancy grids by aggregating multi-frame LiDAR point clouds and then executes occlusion reasoning to discriminate between free and unobserved voxels. Compared to ego-centric approaches [27, 31], our methodology primarily differs by focusing on annotated objects instead of the entire scene. For each designated object, we gather points within its annotated bounding boxes over time, transform these points from sensor coordinates to the bounding box coordinates and aggregate them into a dense point cloud. Unlike scene-level occupancy, we do not transform the densified object point cloud back to each ego-vehicle coordinate for occupancy construction. Instead, we directly voxelize it under the local object coordinate system, maintaining object-centric precision. While densified object point clouds encode better shape information than a single LiDAR scan, it\u2019s important to note that unoccupied voxels (grey voxels in Fig. 6) does not necessarily indicate free space; they may be unobserved by the LiDAR due to occlusion. Hence, an occlusion reasoning process is required to distinguish between voxels that are truly free and those that are unobserved. Basically, an unoccupied voxel is considered free if it is traversed trough by a LiDAR ray, and unobserved otherwise. Instead of the time-consuming ray-casting operation used in [27], we adopt a more efficient approach by leveraging range information from raw range images. Specifically, for each unoccupied voxel, we first convert its center to the range image format using sensor intrinsics and extrinsics at a specific timestamp $t$ , yielding a 2D-pixel index $(u_{t},v_{t})$ and a range value $r_{t}$ .
