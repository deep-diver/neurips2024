Quantile regression-based methods are common but struggle to effectively handle these scenarios.  The use of pre-specified statistics like quantiles also limits their accuracy. \nThis paper introduces SinkhornDRL, which leverages Sinkhorn divergence\u2014a regularized Wasserstein loss\u2014to overcome these limitations.  Sinkhorn divergence approximates Wasserstein distance while offering computational efficiency and robustness to noise.  The paper demonstrates SinkhornDRL's superior performance and stability on the Atari games suite, particularly in multi-dimensional reward settings.  Theoretically, the authors prove the contraction properties of SinkhornDRL, aligning it with both Wasserstein distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).", "affiliation": "University of Alberta", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "CiEynTpF28/podcast.wav"}
