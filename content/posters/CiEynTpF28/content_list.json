Despite the gradual introduction of numerous algorithms, quantile regression-based algorithms [14, 13, 56, 41, 33, 42, 43] dominate attention and research in the realm of distributional RL. These algorithms utilize quantile regression to approximate the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance to compare two return distributions. Nevertheless, two major limitations hinder their performance improvement and wider practical deployment. 1) Inaccuracy in Capturing Return Distribution Characteristics. The way of directly generating quantiles of return distributions via neural networks often suffers from the non-crossing issue [58], where the learned quantile curves fail to guarantee a non-decreasing property. This leads to abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability. The inaccurate distribution estimate is fundamentally attributed to the use of pre-specified statistics [41], while unrestricted statistics based on deterministic samples can be potentially more effective in complex environments [37]. 2) Difficulties in Extension to Multi-dimensional Rewards. Many RL tasks involve multiple sources of rewards [32, 15], hybrid reward architecture [50, 30], or sub-reward structures after reward decomposition [31, 57], which require learning multi-dimensional return distributions to reduce the intrinsic uncertainty of the environments. However, it remains elusive how to use quantile regressions to approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance, while circumventing the computational intractability issue in the related multi-dimensional output space.

Sinkhorn divergence [45] has emerged as a theoretically principled and computationally efficient alternative for approximating Wasserstein distance. It has gained increasing attention in the field of optimal transport [4, 24, 21, 39] and has been successfully applied in various areas of machine learning [38, 25, 54, 20, 8]. By introducing entropic regularization, Sinkhorn divergence can efficiently approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance using computationally efficient matrix scaling algorithms [45, 39]. This makes it feasible to apply optimal transport distances to RL tasks with multi-dimensional rewards (see experiments in Section 5.3). Moreover, Sinkhorn divergence enables the leverage of samples to approximate return distributions instead of relying on pre-specified statistics, e.g., quantiles, thereby increasing the accuracy in capturing the full data complexity behind return distributions and naturally avoiding the non-crossing issues in distributional RL. Beyond addressing the two main limitations mentioned above, the well-controlled regularization introduced in Sinkrhorn divergence helps to find a \u201csmoother\u201d transport plan relative to Wasserstein distance, making it less sensitive to noises or small perturbations when comparing two return distributions (see Appendix A for the visualization). The term \"smoother\" refers to the effect of regularization in Sinkhorn divergence to encourage a more uniformly distributed transport plan. This regularization also aligns with the maximum-entropy principle [28, 16], which aims to maximize entropy while keeping the transportation cost constrained. Furthermore, the resulting strongly convex loss function [3] and the induced smoothness by regularization facilitate faster and more stable convergence in the deep RL setting (see more details in Sections 4 and 5).
