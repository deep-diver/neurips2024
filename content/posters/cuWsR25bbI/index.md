### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning models exhibit emergence‚Äîa sudden ability to solve new problems as resources increase‚Äîand predictable scaling laws.  Understanding the relationship between these two phenomena is crucial. Existing models either focus on emergence or scaling laws, lacking a unified framework. 

This paper introduces a novel, analytically tractable multilinear model to address this gap. By representing skills as orthogonal basis functions and using a multilinear model with a layered structure mimicking neural networks, they derive analytical expressions for skill emergence and scaling laws with respect to training time, data size, model size and computational resources.  This model accurately predicts the stage-like emergence of multiple skills observed in experiments, highlighting the role of layered structure and power-law skill distribution in this phenomenon.

> This figure shows the emergence of five skills in a two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on a multitask sparse parity problem.  The x-axis of each subplot represents a different training parameter: time (T), dataset size (D), and number of parameters (N). The y-axis represents the skill strength (Rk/S), which is a normalized measure of how well a particular skill has been learned. Dashed lines show the empirically observed skill emergence in the MLP; solid lines show the predictions of an analytically solvable multilinear model. The model, calibrated using only the emergence of the first skill, accurately predicts the emergence of the remaining skills.

> This table shows the dataset used for the multitask sparse parity problem.  It displays the control bits (one-hot encoding of the task), skill bits (binary string with m=3 relevant bits), the target value (y), a vector representation (M) of the relevant bits used to compute the parity, and the values of the skill basis functions (gk) for each example.  The frequencies of the different parity tasks follow an inverse power law distribution, a key element of the multitask problem. The skill basis functions are orthogonal and form a basis set to represent skills.





### In-depth insights


#### Skill Emergence
The concept of skill emergence, central to the paper, explores how deep learning models seemingly acquire new abilities (skills) abruptly as training progresses.  The authors **frame skills as orthogonal basis functions** within a multi-linear model, allowing for analytical solutions. This approach reveals **analytic expressions for skill emergence**, shedding light on the relationship between training time, data size, model size, and computational resources.  **Power-law scaling laws** are derived, aligning with empirical observations in neural network scaling.  The model predicts the **sigmoidal emergence of skills**‚Äîcapturing a gradual increase leading to a sudden, near-complete skill acquisition. **Simulations on multitask sparse parity datasets confirm these predictions**, providing strong evidence for the framework's accuracy.  Importantly, the analysis **decouples skill acquisition dynamics**, simplifying the complex interactions within deep neural networks.

#### Multilinear Model
The core of the research paper revolves around a novel multilinear model designed to demystify emergence and scaling laws in deep learning.  This model cleverly sidesteps the complexities of neural networks by representing skills as orthogonal basis functions.  **The multilinear structure of the model, a product of its parameters, directly mirrors the layered architecture of neural networks**, providing a simplified, yet insightful, lens for studying skill acquisition. **The model's analytical tractability is a significant advantage**, enabling the derivation of precise scaling laws for factors like training time, data size, and model parameters.  This allows for quantifiable predictions about when and how new skills emerge, **offering a powerful framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive emergence in deep learning**. The model's predictive power is further demonstrated through its capacity to accurately capture experimental results observed in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even transformers, **highlighting the general applicability of its fundamental principles** to various network architectures.

#### Scaling Laws
The study of scaling laws in deep learning is crucial for understanding how model performance changes with increased resources.  This paper delves into these scaling laws, examining the relationship between loss and training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute.  The authors present **a novel multilinear model** that captures the sigmoidal skill emergence observed in neural networks. The model's simplicity is a major advantage, allowing for **analytical derivations of scaling laws**, including prefactor constants.  These derivations reveal power-law relationships with exponents that match empirical observations from prior work. The **orthogonal basis of skill functions** used by this model greatly simplifies the analysis, leading to a deeper understanding of how different factors contribute to model performance and skill acquisition.  The model's predictions align well with experimental results obtained from neural networks, especially in capturing the ordered emergence of multiple new skills. This makes the model an excellent tool for understanding and predicting emergence phenomena in deep learning.

#### NN Emergence
The paper investigates the phenomenon of NN emergence, where neural networks seemingly acquire new abilities abruptly as training progresses.  The authors propose a multilinear model, **demonstrating analytically how multiple skills emerge in a stage-like manner** as training time, data size, or model size increase.  This model utilizes orthogonal functions representing individual skills, offering an analytically tractable framework for studying emergence and scaling laws. Notably, the multilinear model accurately predicts the ordered emergence of skills in both multilayer perceptrons and transformer architectures. **This prediction capability showcases the model's explanatory power**, suggesting that the interaction between layers, coupled with a power-law distribution of skill frequencies in the data, underlies the observed stage-like emergence.  While the multilinear model simplifies the complexity of actual neural network dynamics, it provides a valuable theoretical lens, highlighting the potential of **analytically tractable models to capture key emergent phenomena** in deep learning.

#### Model Limits
The limitations of the proposed model stem primarily from its simplified assumptions about neural network dynamics.  **The decoupled nature of skill acquisition**, while analytically convenient, fails to capture the complex interactions and dependencies observed in real-world neural networks.  The model's reliance on orthogonal skill functions, although simplifying the analysis, **restricts its applicability to datasets with clearly separable skills**; in practice, skills frequently overlap and interact.  Furthermore, the model's simplified assumptions of power-law distributions of skill frequencies and dataset size are idealizations which may not accurately reflect empirical data.  **The stage-like training assumption**, while illuminating, might not always hold in real-world scenarios, where the emergence of multiple skills can be more gradual and less clearly defined. While the multilinear model offers valuable insights into the scaling laws and skill emergence, the model's limitations highlight the need for more sophisticated theoretical frameworks to fully capture the rich, complex dynamics of neural network learning.  **Future research should focus on developing models that address the non-linear interactions between skills and the impact of non-idealized data characteristics**.
