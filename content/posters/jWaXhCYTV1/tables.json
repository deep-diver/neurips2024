It shows precision, recall, F1 score, and computation time for various graph types (ER2, ER4, SF2, SF4), dimensions (d), and observed dimensions (p). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method across different settings and sample sizes.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "jWaXhCYTV1/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of Precision, Recall, and F1 scores for different graph types, d values, and methods between our method and DCI.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the proposed method and the DCI method in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score for different graph types (ER2, ER4, SF2, SF4), numbers of latent variables (d), and sample sizes.  The results are useful for understanding the relative performance of the two approaches under different conditions.", "section": "5.1 Synthetic Data"}]
