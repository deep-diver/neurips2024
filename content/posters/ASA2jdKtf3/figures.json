Decisions and utilities are coloured according to association with particular agents. Solid edges represent causal dependence and dotted edges are information links. Conceptual context and domains and CPDs for the variables are given above the diagrams.", "description": "This figure shows two Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs).  A MAID is a graphical model representing a game-theoretic situation with multiple agents.  Each diagram depicts the interaction between a human (H) and an AI (A) agent.  In Figure 1a, the human evaluates the AI's honesty, observing the AI's capabilities (C) before deciding whether or not to deploy (DH) the AI. In Figure 1b, the human evaluates the AI's dangerous capabilities, observing only the outcome of the evaluation before making a deployment decision.  The diagrams show the causal relationships between the variables (e.g., capabilities influence the evaluation outcome, which influences the human's decision),  and the information available to each agent (dotted lines).", "section": "2 Background"}, {"figure_path": "ASA2jdKtf3/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: In (a) and (b), graphical representations of EFGs include environment variables (V\u00ba), agent decisions (VA and VH), utilities (tuples on the top and bottom), and information sets (dotted lines). The EFGs in Figure 2a and Figure 2b are equivalent to the MAIDs in Figure 1a and Figure 1b, respectively. V\u00ba represents the initial move, made by nature, which determines A's capability C. VA, VA and VH, VH, VH, & VH represent moves made by A and H, respectively. I\u00b9 and I\u00b2 represent H's non-singleton information sets.", "description": "This figure shows two extensive form games (EFGs) which graphically represent the same scenario as the MAIDs in Figure 1.  The EFGs model the interaction between a human (H) evaluating an AI (A) for honesty (a) or dangerous capabilities (b).  The diagrams illustrate the AI's capabilities (C), the human's decision to deploy (DH) or not deploy (\u00acDH) the AI, and the resulting utilities for both the AI (UA) and the human (UH). The dotted lines represent information sets, indicating the uncertainty an agent has about the game state when making a decision. This figure helps demonstrate the equivalence between MAIDs and EFGs.", "section": "2 Background"}]
