The simulations varied the initial token distribution (Gaussian with different standard deviations,  a sparse distribution from Example 4.1 with different scales, and a fixed all-ones vector). The step size was adjusted to optimize the training process for each setting.", "section": "B Experimental details and additional results"}]
