However, current methods struggle with 'prediction bias' (misclassifying new data as old) and 'hardness bias' (forgetting previously learned difficult classes).  These biases hinder the incremental learning process, limiting the real-world applicability of such AI systems. \nThe paper introduces 'Happy', a new framework that directly addresses these biases. Happy uses 'hardness-aware prototype sampling' to selectively focus on difficult classes, reducing forgetting. It also employs 'clustering-guided initialization' and 'soft entropy regularization' for better new class discovery by reducing overconfidence in already-known classes. Through extensive experiments, Happy demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods across multiple datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in handling the challenges of continual GCD.", "affiliation": "Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "hdUCZiMkFO/podcast.wav"}
