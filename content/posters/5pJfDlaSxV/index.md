### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Conformal Prediction (CP) offers statistically valid prediction sets but struggles when test data is altered adversarially. Existing methods using randomized smoothing have limitations, only supporting l2-bounded perturbations and classification tasks.  They also produce overly conservative predictions.

This research introduces Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction (VRCP), a novel framework addressing these limitations. VRCP leverages neural network verification to create robust prediction sets, handling various norms and both classification and regression tasks.  Its evaluations show VRCP achieves higher nominal coverage and more precise prediction sets than the current state-of-the-art methods.

> üîº The figure shows the distribution of prediction set sizes for different conformal prediction methods on the CIFAR10 dataset under adversarial attacks.  Vanilla CP violates the coverage guarantee, while VRCP-I and VRCP-C maintain it and have similar set size distributions to vanilla CP.  The state-of-the-art methods (RSCP+ and RSCP+ with post-training transformation (PTT)) fail to achieve the same level of performance, producing much larger prediction sets.

(2), as well as for our proposed robust algorithms (VRCP‚ÄìI and VRCP‚ÄìC) along with the SotA (RSCP+ and RSCP+ (PTT), see Section 3) on the CIFAR10 dataset. As we observe, VRCP-I and VRCP-C closely resemble the spread of vanilla CP prediction set sizes, whilst the SotA falls short of achieving this. Here we use an adversarial perturbation of radius ‚Ç¨ = 0.02, error rate a = 0.1, number of splits nsplits = 50 and smoothing parameter (used in RSCP+ and RSCP+ (PTT)) œÉ = 2‚Ç¨.

### In-depth insights


#### Robust Conformal Prediction
Robust Conformal Prediction (RCP) enhances the traditional Conformal Prediction (CP) framework by addressing its vulnerability to adversarial attacks and distributional shifts.  **Standard CP guarantees coverage of the true output with a specified probability, assuming exchangeability between training and test data.** However, this assumption often fails under real-world conditions with noisy or manipulated inputs. RCP methods modify the CP algorithm to maintain valid coverage even when facing such challenges. This often involves techniques that either inflate prediction sets to account for uncertainty introduced by perturbations, or employ robust statistical methods.  **Key improvements over standard CP include better coverage guarantees in adversarial settings and more efficient prediction regions.**  However, the increased robustness often comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, especially when using advanced verification techniques for neural network predictions.  **A crucial aspect of RCP is the choice of norm used to define the size of adversarial perturbations.** Different norms lead to varied computational challenges and robustness guarantees.

#### NN Verification Methods
Neural network verification (NNV) methods are crucial for ensuring the robustness and reliability of deep learning models, especially in safety-critical applications.  **Complete methods** guarantee the verification of properties across all possible inputs within a given perturbation bound, but are computationally expensive.  **Incomplete methods**, conversely, provide sound but not necessarily complete verification, trading off precision for speed.  **Different approaches** exist such as those leveraging interval bound propagation, abstract interpretation, or combinations of these techniques.  The choice of method often involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. **Future research** should focus on developing more efficient and scalable complete methods and exploring the synergies between different approaches to achieve both strong guarantees and fast execution times.  This is particularly important in the context of applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis where reliability is paramount.

#### Adversarial Robustness
Adversarial robustness is a crucial concept in machine learning, particularly concerning the vulnerability of models to adversarial attacks.  **These attacks involve subtle, often imperceptible, modifications to input data that can cause a model to misclassify or produce erroneous outputs.**  The paper explores methods to enhance adversarial robustness in the context of conformal prediction (CP), a technique for providing valid prediction sets.  The core challenge lies in ensuring that the CP guarantees remain valid even when the data is subjected to adversarial perturbations.  The proposed Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction (VRCP) framework uses neural network verification to create robust prediction sets that provide coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks, **achieving above-nominal coverage and more informative prediction regions than existing methods**.  A key aspect of this approach is its ability to support different norms, addressing a significant limitation of previous techniques that primarily focus on l2-norm bounded perturbations. The work signifies a **significant step forward in creating dependable and trustworthy machine learning models** in the face of malicious or noisy inputs.

#### Beyond L2 Norm
The section 'Beyond L2 Norm' would delve into the paper's extension of adversarial robustness beyond the commonly used L2 norm.  This is crucial because **real-world attacks aren't confined to L2-bounded perturbations**. The discussion would likely showcase the framework's ability to handle L1 and L‚àû norm-bounded attacks, highlighting its enhanced applicability and practical relevance.  **The paper would likely present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method against these different attack types**,  comparing its performance with existing approaches.  A key aspect would be showing that the method maintains statistically valid prediction sets even under these broader attack scenarios, thereby **emphasizing its superior robustness and generality** compared to methods limited to the L2 norm.

#### Empirical Validations
An empirical validation section in a research paper would typically present results from experiments designed to test the paper's claims.  It would likely involve a description of the experimental setup, datasets used, metrics employed, and a detailed analysis of the findings.  **A strong validation section would not only demonstrate that the proposed method works as expected but also compare it against existing baselines, highlighting improvements and addressing potential limitations.**  The presentation of results should be clear, concise, and visually appealing.  Appropriate statistical measures should be included to convey the significance of the findings, such as confidence intervals or p-values.  **A thorough discussion of the results would be essential, interpreting the implications of the experiments and addressing potential biases.** It is crucial to ensure that the validation strategy is rigorous and comprehensive, addressing potential sources of error and providing a nuanced interpretation of the results.  **The ultimate aim of the section is to build confidence in the robustness and generalizability of the claims made in the paper.**
