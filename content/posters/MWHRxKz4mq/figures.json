The input is a complete trajectory of the system's state (represented as a sequence of maps of the globe). This trajectory is passed to an encoder that extracts a representation of the time-invariant parameters. A mechanistic neural network (MNN) solver is then used to decode the parameters back into a representation of the trajectory. The figure also highlights how interventions can be performed to understand the causal effect of specific parameters on the system. By manipulating the estimated parameter (\u03b8) and feeding it back into the MNN, the model generates a modified trajectory. This allows the analysis of the causal impact of changing specific parameters, such as reconstructing \"colder seas\" by adjusting a related parameter.", "section": "4 CRL-construct of Identifiable Neural Emulators for Dynamical Systems"}, {"figure_path": "MWHRxKz4mq/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Our mechanistic identifier learns the underlying time-invariant parameters \u03b8, providing a versatile neural emulator for downstream causal analysis.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the proposed mechanistic identifier model.
