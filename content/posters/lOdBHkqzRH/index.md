### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications of contextual linear optimization (CLO) face the challenge of bandit feedback, where only the cost of the chosen decision is observed, not the costs of other potential choices. This limitation significantly hinders the application of existing CLO algorithms, which assume full cost observation for all potential decisions.  This makes the accurate prediction of costs and optimization of policies challenging and creates a need for new methods and theories. 

This research addresses this challenge by proposing induced empirical risk minimization (IERM), a novel offline learning framework for CLO with bandit feedback. The core contribution of the paper is a fast-rate regret bound for IERM, demonstrating that even with partially observed data and potentially misspecified models, the algorithms can still achieve near-optimal performance.  Furthermore, computationally tractable surrogate losses are introduced to simplify the implementation of IERM, thereby making it more suitable for real-world deployment. The effectiveness of the IERM framework is numerically validated through a simulation study, demonstrating its practical utility in improving decision-making in settings with limited data availability.

> This figure shows a 5x5 grid representing a stochastic shortest path problem. Each circle node represents a location, with 's' as the starting point and 't' as the destination. Each edge connecting two nodes has an associated random cost Yj, where 'j' is the index for the edge. The decision variable zj is binary (0 or 1), representing whether or not to traverse the edge 'j'. The goal is to find the shortest path from 's' to 't', considering the uncertain costs on each edge.

> This table presents the average relative regret ratio for various methods across 50 replications of an experiment.  The results are shown for different training dataset sizes (400, 1000, and 1600 data points) when the model used to induce the policy and the nuisance model are correctly specified and the logging policy is random.  The relative regret is a measure of how suboptimal a given policy is in comparison to the best possible policy.





### In-depth insights


#### Contextual Bandit CLO
Contextual Bandit CLO integrates contextual information and bandit feedback mechanisms within the framework of contextual linear optimization (CLO).  **The core idea is to leverage contextual features to improve the efficiency of decision-making in scenarios where the cost of actions is uncertain and only partially observable.** This differs from standard CLO, which typically assumes full observability of cost vectors.  Bandit feedback, where only the realized cost of the chosen action is observed, introduces significant challenges.  **The key contribution of this approach lies in the development of algorithms that effectively learn optimal policies despite the limited information.**  This requires addressing the trade-off between exploration (gathering more information) and exploitation (optimizing performance based on current knowledge).  **Algorithms would likely involve techniques such as inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation, or other methods designed to handle missing data and uncertainty.**  The combination of contextual information and bandit feedback allows for more adaptive and efficient decision-making, making this a valuable area of research with applications in various fields, such as online advertising, recommender systems and operations research.

#### IERM Regret Bounds
Analyzing IERM regret bounds requires a nuanced understanding of the algorithm's core mechanics.  **The regret, a measure of sub-optimality, is intrinsically linked to the complexity of the function class used in the induced empirical risk minimization (IERM) approach**.  A richer function class allows for a better approximation of the optimal policy, but introduces higher complexity, potentially leading to increased regret.  The analysis often involves **bounding the regret using Rademacher complexity**, which quantifies the richness of the function class.  **Crucially, the analysis needs to address model misspecification**, where the true optimal policy may not be contained within the function class. The regret bounds depend on the misspecification error, the complexity of the function class, and the quality of nuisance function estimates.  **Fast rates of convergence are often desired, and these depend on margin conditions which determine how easily the optimal policy is distinguished from suboptimal policies**.  The presence of bandit feedback, as opposed to full feedback, increases the analytical challenge, requiring more sophisticated techniques to handle partial observability of costs.

#### Bandit Feedback IERM
Bandit feedback presents a unique challenge to contextual linear optimization (CLO) by limiting observability to only the realized cost of a chosen action, unlike full-feedback settings.  **Induced Empirical Risk Minimization (IERM)**, adapted to this bandit feedback scenario, becomes crucial.  Instead of directly observing the full cost vector, IERM in this context learns a predictive model to estimate the expected cost of various actions given contextual features and then optimizes downstream performance based on these estimates.  This indirect approach necessitates robust estimation techniques and careful consideration of model misspecification, which the authors address by proving a fast-rate regret bound, even under misspecified models and flexible optimization estimates.  **The development of tractable surrogate losses** is also crucial for practical implementation. The effectiveness of IERM with bandit feedback is demonstrated through empirical results on a stochastic shortest path problem. This approach provides a powerful framework for tackling CLO problems where observing the full cost vector is infeasible.

#### Surrogate Loss
The concept of a "Surrogate Loss" in the context of contextual linear optimization (CLO) with bandit feedback is crucial for efficient learning.  **Directly optimizing the IERM objective in CLO with bandit feedback is computationally intractable due to its non-convexity.**  Therefore, the authors explore surrogate loss functions, specifically highlighting the SPO+ loss as a computationally tractable alternative.  **SPO+ offers several advantages, including convexity with respect to the model parameters**, enabling efficient optimization via techniques like gradient descent.  The effectiveness of SPO+ is experimentally validated and it's shown that its use directly addresses the computational challenges inherent in the IERM formulation. The paper's contribution is not simply in proposing SPO+, but in demonstrating its practical applicability within the specific context of CLO and bandit feedback.  **Furthermore, the authors adapt SPO+ for use with different methods for estimating the expected cost (DM, ISW, DR), further highlighting its flexibility and robustness.** The analysis of using these surrogate losses, in tandem with the theoretical regret bounds, suggests a pragmatic approach for tackling a previously difficult problem, paving the way for more efficient and scalable algorithms in contextual decision-making.

#### Empirical Analysis
An empirical analysis section in a research paper would typically present the results of experiments or observational studies designed to test the paper's hypotheses or claims.  A strong empirical analysis would begin by clearly describing the data used, including its source, size, and relevant characteristics. **Methodology** would be detailed, specifying the experimental design, data collection methods, and any pre-processing steps.  Results would be presented clearly and concisely, often using tables, figures, and statistical measures to summarize key findings.  **Statistical significance** of any observed effects should be reported, along with measures of effect size.  The analysis should directly address the research questions, and any limitations of the data or methods should be acknowledged.  Finally, a thoughtful discussion interpreting the results in light of existing literature and the implications of the findings would be crucial for a robust empirical analysis. **Visualizations** are key, allowing readers to quickly grasp major trends and outliers.
