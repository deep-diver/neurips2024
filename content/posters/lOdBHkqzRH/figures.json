Each circle node represents a location, with 's' as the starting point and 't' as the destination. Each edge connecting two nodes has an associated random cost Yj, where 'j' is the index for the edge. The decision variable zj is binary (0 or 1), representing whether or not to traverse the edge 'j'. The goal is to find the shortest path from 's' to 't', considering the uncertain costs on each edge.", "section": "5 Numerical Experiments"}]
