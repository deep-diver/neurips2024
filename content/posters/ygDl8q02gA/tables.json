[{"figure_path": "ygDl8q02gA/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The query complexity of the different variants of the l-PL problem, for both the k-known and the k-unknown setting. We obtain matching upper and lower bounds for all the variants with the exception of the weighted l-PL problem in k-unknown setting, for which the upper bound does not match the lower bound (given for the k-unknown case) exactly. The results are given in terms of the complexity RSk(n,k) and RSu(n,k) (defined in Equations 1 and 2) of solving the problem without errors.", "description": "This table summarizes the query complexity results for various partition learning problems with faulty oracles. It shows the complexity for different scenarios: whether the number of clusters (k) is known or unknown, and whether the oracle can have false positives, false negatives, or both.  The complexities are expressed in terms of RSk(n,k) and RSu(n,k), representing the complexities in the error-free setting for known and unknown k respectively.", "section": "A hierarchy of problems"}]
