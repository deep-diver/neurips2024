Existing compression techniques often struggle to balance compression ratios with maintaining model performance, especially in low-bit quantization regimes. This necessitates the development of new methods to effectively compress LLMs without significant performance degradation. \nThis paper introduces CALDERA, a novel post-training LLM compression algorithm that addresses this challenge. CALDERA uses a low-rank, low-precision decomposition to approximate the weight matrices of LLMs.  The method is theoretically analyzed, providing error bounds, and empirically evaluated on several LLMs, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques, particularly in the low-bit quantization regime (less than 2.5 bits per parameter).  The algorithm also demonstrates adaptability to existing low-rank adaptation techniques, further boosting performance.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "lkx3OpcqSZ/podcast.wav"}
