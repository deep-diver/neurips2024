Quantization, reducing the precision of model parameters, offers a potential solution but faces challenges, especially with activations containing outliers. This leads to accuracy loss when using simple quantization techniques. \nQuaRot, a novel quantization scheme based on rotations, overcomes these limitations by rotating the LLM's hidden states to eliminate outliers before quantization. This computationally invariant rotation simplifies the process, enabling lossless 4-bit quantization of all model components\u2014weights, activations, and KV cache.  The results show significant performance improvements, including a 3.33x speedup in prefill and a 3.89x memory saving during decoding on a 70B parameter LLM.  Additionally, 6-bit and 8-bit models demonstrate lossless quantization using standard rounding.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "dfqsW38v1X/podcast.wav"}
