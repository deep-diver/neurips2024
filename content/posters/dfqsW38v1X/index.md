### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational resources, hindering their practical deployment.  Quantization, reducing the precision of model parameters, offers a potential solution but faces challenges, especially with activations containing outliers. This leads to accuracy loss when using simple quantization techniques. 

QuaRot, a novel quantization scheme based on rotations, overcomes these limitations by rotating the LLM's hidden states to eliminate outliers before quantization. This computationally invariant rotation simplifies the process, enabling lossless 4-bit quantization of all model components‚Äîweights, activations, and KV cache.  The results show significant performance improvements, including a 3.33x speedup in prefill and a 3.89x memory saving during decoding on a 70B parameter LLM.  Additionally, 6-bit and 8-bit models demonstrate lossless quantization using standard rounding.

### In-depth insights


#### QuaRot's Rotation
QuaRot's core innovation lies in its use of rotations, specifically randomized Hadamard transformations, to address the challenge of outlier values in LLMs during quantization.  These rotations, applied to weights and activations, **transform the data distribution** to minimize the impact of extreme values, making subsequent quantization more effective. This clever approach avoids the need for outlier-specific handling or calibration datasets, which are common in other quantization methods.  The computational invariance property ensures that these rotations don't alter the model's output, preserving accuracy while improving quantizability.  **Fusion of the transformations into weight matrices** further optimizes computation by reducing the number of explicit rotation operations.  This technique enables a truly end-to-end, 4-bit quantization of LLMs, encompassing all weights, activations, and KV caches, a notable achievement with significant implications for efficiency and deployment of LLMs.

#### 4-bit Quantization
The research paper explores 4-bit quantization techniques for large language models (LLMs), a significant advancement in model compression.  **QuaRot**, the proposed method, achieves this by employing randomized Hadamard transformations to eliminate outlier features in activations and weights before quantization. This innovative approach allows for end-to-end 4-bit quantization without sacrificing performance, as demonstrated by results on the LLAMA2 model. **The computational invariance property** employed ensures that despite the transformations, model output remains unaffected.  Compared to other methods, QuaRot achieves superior performance, surpassing competitors in perplexity scores and maintaining near-lossless accuracy.  **Key advantages** include minimal accuracy loss with significant memory and compute efficiency gains for inference, making it highly practical for deploying large LLMs in resource-constrained environments.  Further analysis reveals that lossless 6-bit and 8-bit quantization can also be attained using simpler round-to-nearest methods. The research highlights the efficacy of QuaRot for both prefill and decoding phases of inference, improving upon existing approaches significantly.

#### Hadamard Transform
The application of Hadamard transforms within the context of this research paper centers around their inherent properties as orthogonal matrices for **enhancing the quantization process of Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  By applying Hadamard transformations to weight matrices, the authors aim to reduce incoherence.  This technique is critical because **high incoherence makes weight quantization challenging**, especially when targeting low-bit representations like 4-bits.  The methodology uses randomized Hadamard matrices, offering efficiency advantages and avoiding the need for precise, deterministic Hadamard matrices.  Crucially, the computational invariance theorem enables the integration of these transformations without altering the model's output, making this an efficient approach to **outlier elimination in activations**.  The extension of Hadamard transforms to the attention module further highlights its potential for improving the quantization of keys and values within the KV cache, ultimately impacting memory efficiency and inference speed.  This strategic use of Hadamard transforms forms a core element of the proposed quantization method, effectively addressing the limitations of conventional approaches to quantizing LLMs.

#### LLM Efficiency
Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally expensive, demanding significant resources for both training and inference.  **LLM efficiency focuses on reducing this computational burden** through various techniques.  Quantization, a core method discussed, reduces the precision of model weights and activations, leading to smaller model sizes and faster processing. However, **naive quantization can result in substantial accuracy loss**.  The paper explores innovative approaches like rotating the model's inputs to mitigate this issue, enabling effective quantization without significant performance degradation. **This is crucial for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices and reducing their environmental impact.**  Further efficiency gains are sought through optimized matrix multiplications and efficient cache management, which are critical aspects of inference speed.  **Future research should explore the trade-offs between different efficiency techniques** and their impact on the overall LLM performance and applicability.

#### Future of QuaRot
The future of QuaRot hinges on addressing its current limitations and exploring new applications.  **Extending QuaRot's applicability beyond LLMs to other deep learning models** is a key area for development, potentially impacting various domains including computer vision and speech recognition.  **Improving the quantization process for various hardware architectures**, such as mobile GPUs, is crucial for broader adoption.  **Research into more efficient and accurate quantization techniques** is also needed to minimize performance loss.  Further exploration of the interplay between rotation and quantization, particularly the exploration of alternative orthogonal transformations beyond Hadamard, promises to unlock new performance gains. **Developing a better understanding of how QuaRot impacts different model architectures** will allow for its optimization and improved effectiveness. Combining QuaRot with other compression methods, such as pruning, might yield additional performance benefits. Finally, **research should focus on addressing the challenges posed by long sequences and larger batch sizes** inherent to many LLMs to improve scalability.

It shows how the weights and activations are processed to enable 4-bit quantization.  The key elements are the absorption of RMSNorm scaling into the weight matrices, the rotation of the hidden state using Hadamard transformation (Q), the cancellation of this rotation through Q<sup>T</sup>, 4-bit quantization of weights and activations, and a final on-the-fly Hadamard transform before the output is produced. This computational invariance allows for efficient low-bit inference.

The hidden state X has been rotated by Q, which is canceled out by the absorption of QT into the first two weight matrices. All weights are stored in INT4, and all activations immediately before the weights are also quantized to INT4. The result of the matmul between the INT4 weights and activations on a TensorCore is INT32, which we immediately cast (and scale) to FP16 which is the default precision of the model. Whilst the signal is still in FP16, we perform a single on-the-fly Hadamard transform before quantizing and computing a (modified) down-proj, which results in a rotated output YQ.

> Table 1: WikiText-2 perplexity results on 4-bit quantization of LLAMA-2 models with 2048 sequence length. We extract the results for SmoothQuant and OmniQuant results of [Shao et al., 2023]. 128G shows the group-wise quantization with group size 128. Here, we quantize all weights, activations, and caches in 4-bits in QuaRot.
