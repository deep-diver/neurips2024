Panel (a) displays the original rehearsal graph, depicting the influence relationships between variables X, Z1, Z2, Z3, and Y1, Y2.

Specifically, the incoming arrows into the altered Z variable(s) are removed, indicating that the influence from other variables is disrupted by the intervention.  This showcases how the alteration graphs illustrate the changes in influence relationships after a decision or intervention has been made.", "section": "Preliminaries"}, {"figure_path": "yhd2kHHNtB/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: An example of estimated P with \u03c4 = 0.9", "description": "This figure shows an example of how to estimate the probability region P with an expected probability of \u03c4=0.9.
