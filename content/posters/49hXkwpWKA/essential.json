{"importance": "This paper is important because it presents a novel approach to improve both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and detection simultaneously.  It tackles the common challenge of distribution shifts in real-world machine learning applications, significantly improving model robustness using a human-assisted framework that strategically leverages limited human annotations for maximal impact. The findings offer valuable insights into efficient human-in-the-loop learning and pave the way for more reliable and robust AI systems in various fields. This approach effectively utilizes human feedback to address a critical limitation of current state-of-the-art methods, leading to enhanced model performance and significantly reducing OOD errors.

This is especially challenging when dealing with real-world data containing both covariate and semantic shifts, for which distinguishing between these types of OOD data is difficult.  Existing methods often fail to effectively address both challenges simultaneously. \nThis paper introduces AHA (Adaptive Human-Assisted OOD learning), a novel framework that uses human assistance to strategically improve both OOD generalization and detection. AHA focuses on labeling data in a specifically chosen \"maximum disambiguation region,\" where the model's uncertainty about the type of OOD data is highest.  By doing so, it leverages human effort efficiently to maximize improvements in both tasks. The results show that AHA, with a limited labeling budget, significantly outperforms existing methods in both OOD generalization and OOD detection, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for improving real-world AI systems.
