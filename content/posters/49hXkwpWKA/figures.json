(a) shows labeling the top-k most OOD examples, (b) shows labeling examples near the 95% true positive rate (TPR) threshold, and (c) - the proposed approach - shows labeling examples within the \"maximum disambiguation region\", where the densities of covariate and semantic OOD data are approximately equal. This region is designed to maximize the utility of limited human labeling effort by disambiguating the two types of OOD data.
