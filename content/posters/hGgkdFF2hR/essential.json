Existing low-rank methods aim to address this issue by factoring the transport plan, but they often lack flexibility and interpretability.  The computational complexity of these methods also poses a challenge.\nThis paper introduces Factor Relaxation with Latent Coupling (FRLC), a novel algorithm that leverages a latent coupling factorization to compute low-rank transport plans. **FRLC's key advantages include decoupling the optimization into three smaller OT problems, enhanced flexibility to handle various OT objectives and marginal constraints, and improved interpretability through the latent coupling.**  The researchers demonstrate FRLC's superior performance on diverse applications, highlighting its efficiency and ability to reveal meaningful insights from complex datasets.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "hGgkdFF2hR/podcast.wav"}
