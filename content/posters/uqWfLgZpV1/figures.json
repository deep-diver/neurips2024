Time (s) is the per-round time complexity on client.", "description": "The table compares the proposed algorithm, FOMD-OMS, with two existing federated online multi-kernel learning algorithms, eM-KOFL and POF-MKL.  It shows that FOMD-OMS achieves a better regret bound (a measure of performance) with lower time and communication complexity than the other methods. The time complexity is the computational cost per round on each client,  while download (bits) shows the amount of data transmitted from server to clients.", "section": "4.2 Comparison with Previous Work"}]
