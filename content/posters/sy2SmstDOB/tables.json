Metrics include FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), CLIP score (measuring text-image alignment), and aesthetic score.  The results show UniFL's superior performance across various metrics and different inference steps (20 steps and 4 steps).", "section": "5.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "sy2SmstDOB/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison between our method and other methods on SD1.5 and SDXL architecture.
