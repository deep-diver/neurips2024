It consists of three main components:\n\n1.  **Retinex Estimator:** This component takes the input image (I) and estimates the reflectance (R) and illumination (L) maps using Retinex theory.  The output of the Retinex Estimator is then used to refine the reflectance and illumination maps further.\n2.  **Exposure Correction Mamba Module (ECMM):** This module consists of two branches, one for processing the reflectance map (R') and another for processing the illumination map (L'). Each branch uses a Retinex Mamba Block (RMB) to refine the respective maps.  The RMB incorporates a Retinex-SS2D layer, an innovative scanning strategy that enhances both efficiency and effectiveness.\n3.  **Final Output:** The final output (Iout) of the system is obtained by combining the refined reflectance and illumination maps. The result demonstrates an enhanced image with improved contrast, color, and structural details.\n\nThe figure also includes detailed diagrams of the ECMM and RMB components, showing the specific layers and operations involved in each.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "mZsvm58FPG/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The details of our proposed Retinex-SS2D layer.
