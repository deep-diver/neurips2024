Existing methods often struggle with the computational complexity and high sample complexity associated with large state spaces.  Many algorithms' sample efficiency depends on the size of the state space, making them impractical for real-world applications.  This significantly limits their applicability. \nThis research introduces Spectral Dynamic Embedding Policy Optimization (SDEPO), a novel natural policy gradient algorithm. SDEPO uses spectral dynamic embedding to effectively approximate the value function for ZSMGs in continuous state spaces. The researchers provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating near-optimal sample complexity independent of the state space size.  They also present a practical variant, SDEPO-NN, that handles continuous action spaces effectively and shows strong empirical performance. **This is a significant contribution as it improves the scalability and efficiency of solving ZSMGs in real-world scenarios.**", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wvQHQgnpGN/podcast.wav"}
