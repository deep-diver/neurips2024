The study compares the accuracy achieved using different training methods (Vanilla Training, Shortcut Back-propagation, and Evolutionary Training) on two different network architectures (ResNet18 and ResNet34) with varying numbers of timesteps (2 and 4). The results show that the shortcut back-propagation method consistently improves accuracy compared to vanilla training, and that the evolutionary training framework further enhances performance.", "section": "5.1 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "xjyU6zmZD7/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison with SoTA methods on CIFAR-10(100).", "description": "This table compares the performance of the proposed 'Shortcut Back-propagation' and 'Evolutionary Training' methods with other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
