Existing methods often rely on multiple task-specific encoder-decoder pairs, leading to high overhead of parameter and bitrate usage, or face challenges in multi-objective optimization under a unified representation, failing to achieve both performance and efficiency. To this end, we propose Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) integrated into existing coding models for joint human-machine vision, unifying the feature representation with an allin-one architecture. MPA employs a predictor to allocate latent features among task-specific paths based on feature importance varied across tasks, maximizing the utility of shared features while preserving task-specific features for subsequent refinement. Leveraging feature correlations, we develop a two-stage optimization strategy to alleviate multi-task performance degradation. Upon the reuse of shared features, as low as $1.89\\%$ parameters are further augmented and fine-tuned for a specific task, which completely avoids extensive optimization of the entire model. Experimental results show that MPA achieves performance comparable to stateof-the-art methods in both task-specific and multi-objective optimization across human viewing and machine analysis tasks. Moreover, our all-in-one design supports seamless transitions between human- and machine-oriented reconstruction, enabling task-controllable interpretation without altering the unified model.

The intuitive and simple solution to achieve optimal performance for various tasks involves defining distinct encoder-decoder pairs tailored to specific instances with multiple bitstreams (separate [49, 69, 11, 42, 7, 75] or scalable [51, 80, 30, 74, 12, 26]), which however incurs significant parameter overhead and inefficient bitrate consumption. As a result, alternative efforts [8, 19, 22, 45] attempt to enhance the compression performance across multiple tasks by deriving a unified and compact representation of input images. Typically, they rely on a generalized encoder for feature extraction and deploy diverse decoding models to support corresponding vision tasks. However, they still suffer from the parametric inefficiency of multiple dedicated decoders. Recent work has made some progress in designing a unified compression model for multi-task, where the encoder generates a unified representation, and the decoder focuses on task-oriented reconstruction. Popular techniques include conditional generation [2, 32] and residual prediction [33, 24, 41], enabling user-controllable modulation of decoded results through task-driven guidance. While achieving performance comparable to decoder-specific approaches, they solely focus on human-centric requirements, such as perception-oriented and fidelity-oriented aspects. More critically, the challenge of multi-objective optimization [62, 20], particularly in the context of multitask learning [66, 63], persists in the unified paradigm for joint human-machine vision, offering the performance largely inferior to that optimized for each task independently [42, 7, 8]. The crux of the problem lies in the indiscriminate treatment of the unified representation across diverse tasks, which necessitates searching for an accurate Pareto front for transition between tasks. This requires the use of massive and complicated techniques to fti it [47, 58, 57, 75] and multi-objective optimization with variable weights [2, 32, 24, 41]. Its failure can lead to significant performance degradation. And as the number of tasks increases, the difficulty of optimal search grows dramatically [15, 31, 23]. So far, few approaches consider the correlation of features across tasks to ensure efficient multi-task collaboration while also optimizing for the specificity of distinct tasks.

In contrast, the segmentation task challenges the model\u2019s ability to understand pixel-level semantics and represents a low-level vision task. Thus, we test the reconstructed images on classification and semantic segmentation tasks to comprehensively evaluate the performance of MPA for machine vision. We compare MPA to SOTA baselines with task-specific optimization, SFT [69] and TransTIC [11], along with VTM17.1 [1].

For human vision, the FID of MPA is lower than that of the best-performing model, CRDR, at a low bitrate. Since perceptual performance is more reflective of the human visual system at a low bitrate, this part of the gain is significantly beneficial. Considering the distortion, even with only partial parameters optimized for MSE, MPA still has a wide adjustable range comparable to other fully fine-tuned models, especially at a low bitrate. Note that we achieve such performance with a smaller decoder (9.295M for MPA vs. 13.38M for CRDR), fewer training steps (3.5M steps for MPA vs. 5M steps for CRDR), and partial fine-tuning $.27\\%$ for MPA and $100\\%$ for CRDR).

", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Discussion. We choose the perceptually optimized path to serve as the main path due to its ability to preserve high-level semantic features that are useful across various tasks. This generalization is achieved by using pre-trained classification models for measurement (VGG [68] for training and AlexNet [40] for testing). This method aligns well with both human and machine perceptions in the latent space [81]. The pre-trained VGG implicitly incorporates label information, making the distribution of the reconstructed image semantically closer to the original one, thus reducing perceptual distance and enhancing accuracy. Additionally, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{cls}}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{seg}}$ use task-specific pre-trained models to compute cross-entropy loss (image-wise for classification and pixel-wise for segmentation), directly targeting task-specific accuracy. These constraints, along with semantic information from the first training stage, allow $\\phi_{\\mathrm{cls}}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{seg}}$ to achieve higher accuracy than $\\phi_{\\mathrm{perc}}$ with lower computational complexity. Moreover, perceptually optimized features can be easily adapted for MSE optimization, achieving higher PSNR. Perceptual loss preserves high-level semantic features, which supports the minimization of pixel-wise distortion when fine-tuned with MSE loss especially at a low bitrate [18]. Thus, perceptual optimization not only unify human and machine vision tasks but also enhance performance in traditional metrics like PSNR, making it a suitable method for the generalized model.

MSE optimization prioritizes image textures, with fine-grained textures scoring higher, while analysis tasks focus on semantic regions. Score prediction differences at each stage highlight distinctions between MSE and machine vision perception. MSE-optimized features show significant score differences at lower-level stages (1st and 2nd), enhancing PSNR by improving textures. Conversely, machine vision-optimized features show significant score differences at all stages, indicating that both high- and low-level semantic features are crucial for analysis tasks. Consequently, images optimized for MSE without semantic supervision are visually smoother at low bitrate but may lose important semantic features, reducing accuracy. Paths optimized under LPIPS supervision retain more semantic information, ensuring the reconstructed image is semantically closer to the original one. By introducing task loss in Eq.

Top-1 accuracy and mIoU are computed at the lowest bitrate, i.e., 0.1521bpp on ImageNet-1K and 0.0948bpp on ADE20K. For the effects of complexity, Table 1 reveals that human vision-oriented tasks are more sensitive to the complexity of the paths, which suggests the use of inverted bottleneck MLPs, while machine vision-oriented paths can use bottleneck MLPs because the complexity has relatively less impact on the accuracy. As for the choice of paths, we conduct cross-validations as shown in Table 2, which demonstrates that the paths do learn the task-specific features to make their corresponding tasks perform optimally. To evaluate the effect of MPA in the encoder, we conduct ablations on each MPA component. We replace the predicted mask with a random mask and disable $\\phi_{\\mathrm{hq}}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{lq}}$ during encoding.

By leveraging the different importance of features for different tasks and feature correlations across tasks, MPA can empower existing learned image compression models with the ability to reconstruct images with various orientations based on the needs of users or machines (such as fidelity and accuracy), significantly enhancing their versatility. This research not only proposes and sets a new baseline for multi-task coding but also offers a new avenue for the exploration of joint human-machine vision. By exploiting generalized features and few-step fine-tuning for a tiny proportion of parameters, MPA enables joint human-machine vision for multiple tasks in an all-in-one manner, without massive handcrafted techniques. This advancement represents a significant step toward creating a versatile coding framework that can adapt to a wide range of applications and requirements. This can have a positive societal impact by saving a massive amount of storage space, as only a unified model and a unified representation need to be stored rather than multiple coding models and representations. By reducing storage requirements, it can lower the cost of data storage and transmission, making it more accessible for a wide range of applications. Additionally, this reduction in storage can lead to more efficient use of resources and energy, contributing to environmental sustainability. Lower storage costs and improved resource efficiency can also facilitate broader adoption of advanced coding technologies in various industries, enhancing scalability and operational efficiency. Although there are limitations in scenarios requiring extremely high fidelity or accuracy, which may lead to potential negative societal impacts such as misjudgments on reconstructed images, these issues can be addressed by future work aimed at performance improvements or the development of solutions tailored to specific scenarios.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
