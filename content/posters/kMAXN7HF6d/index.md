### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Online class matching, a crucial problem in various applications, involves matching online items to agents in different classes fairly and efficiently. Prior work has struggled to find non-wasteful algorithms that achieve reasonable approximations for various fairness criteria. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the first randomized algorithm that simultaneously ensures a 1/2-approximation for class envy-freeness, class proportionality, and utilitarian social welfare. It does so while also maintaining non-wastefulness. This is a significant advance in the field of fair online matching. The research further provides tight upper bounds on the achievable fairness guarantees, helping to understand the limits of fairness in this context. This is important because it reveals the difficulty in simultaneously achieving both fairness and efficiency. The paper also introduces the concept of "price of fairness," demonstrating the trade-off between these two important goals in online matching.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers working on **online matching and fair division** problems.

> üîº The figure shows two examples of matchings between two classes of agents (red and blue) and items (white). The left-hand side shows a class envy-free (CEF) matching, where no class of agents would prefer the items assigned to another class.  The right-hand side depicts a non-wasteful (NW) matching, demonstrating a scenario where items are not allocated to agents who like them, even though it is possible to improve the matching size. The figure illustrates the trade-off between fairness and efficiency in matching problems.

### In-depth insights


#### Online Fairness
Online fairness, in the context of resource allocation, presents unique challenges.  **Unlike traditional fairness problems**, where all resources and agents are known upfront, online settings involve dynamic arrivals of resources and immediate irrevocable decisions. This necessitates algorithms that balance fairness and efficiency in real-time. **Key challenges** include ensuring equitable distribution across different classes of agents, handling uncertainty about future arrivals, and defining appropriate fairness metrics for online scenarios.  **Algorithmic approaches** must contend with the trade-off between optimal resource allocation (maximizing total welfare) and achieving fairness.  Research in this field explores randomized algorithms and approximation guarantees, aiming for algorithms that maintain fairness while staying computationally efficient.  **The price of fairness**, the trade-off between optimal and fair allocations, is a crucial consideration.  This involves evaluating how much loss in total utility is acceptable to achieve a certain level of fairness. The study of online fairness requires careful analysis of various fairness metrics,  handling different types of resources (divisible or indivisible), and addressing the complexities of real-world applications.

#### Class Envy-Freeness
Class envy-freeness (CEF) is a fairness concept crucial in resource allocation, especially when dealing with multiple groups or classes of agents.  **It ensures that no class feels unfairly treated by comparing its allocation to the best possible allocation any other class could have received**.  The challenge lies in defining and measuring this 'best possible' allocation, particularly when resources are indivisible.  Different notions of CEF exist, such as a-CEF which offers an approximation guarantee, and CEF1, which permits minor envy.  **Achieving CEF, especially in online settings where resources arrive sequentially and decisions are irreversible, is computationally complex and may not always be feasible**.  The paper explores the tradeoffs between CEF and other desirable properties like efficiency (utilitarian social welfare) and non-wastefulness, highlighting the inherent tension between fairness and optimality.

#### Algorithmic Guarantees
The core of the research lies in establishing **algorithmic guarantees** for online class fair matching.  The authors aim to design algorithms that provide **approximations** to various fairness objectives (class envy-freeness, class proportionality) while simultaneously ensuring efficiency (non-wastefulness).  A key challenge addressed is the inherent trade-off between fairness and efficiency, particularly when dealing with indivisible items. The analysis involves demonstrating both achievable approximation ratios through novel randomized algorithms and proving **upper bounds** on what is possible to achieve with any algorithm (both randomized and deterministic). The results highlight the limitations of deterministic approaches and emphasize the role of randomization in achieving reasonable fairness guarantees in online settings. The study provides a framework for evaluating trade-offs between optimal and fair matching through a newly defined concept of the 'price of fairness', further enriching our understanding of these complex algorithmic challenges.

#### Price of Fairness
The concept of "Price of Fairness" in the context of online class matching explores the trade-off between achieving optimal resource allocation (maximizing utilitarian social welfare or USW) and ensuring fairness among different classes of agents.  **The inherent tension arises because maximizing USW might lead to inequitable distributions across classes**, even if it results in a higher overall number of successful matchings.  The analysis delves into the quantification of this trade-off, often by showing how increasing the level of fairness (e.g., measured by the degree of approximation to class envy-freeness or CEF) directly impacts the achievable USW.  **A key finding in this research area would likely reveal an inverse proportionality relationship**:  higher levels of fairness in the final matching come at a cost of lower overall efficiency, and vice versa.  This necessitates careful consideration of fairness constraints when designing algorithms for online resource allocation.  **The "Price of Fairness" highlights the need for a nuanced approach that considers both efficiency and fairness objectives**, potentially through the development of novel algorithms that achieve a suitable balance between these competing goals. This is often explored via theoretical frameworks, but also through practical examples in areas like online marketplaces or resource allocation.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending the online class fair matching problem to incorporate more realistic settings such as **dynamically changing class structures** or **agent preferences that evolve over time**.  Investigating the impact of **imperfect information** about agent preferences or class characteristics is crucial.  The development of more sophisticated algorithms, potentially leveraging **machine learning techniques**, to approximate fairness guarantees more closely is another key area.  Finally, a deeper examination into the **trade-offs between various fairness criteria** in dynamic resource allocation settings is needed to guide practical algorithm design, possibly through improved theoretical bounds.  Ultimately, the goal is **robust and efficient algorithms applicable to real-world scenarios**, offering both fairness and efficiency.

> üîº The figure shows a bipartite graph representing a hardness instance for Theorem A.4, which demonstrates that a non-wasteful CEF matching does not guarantee maximization of class Nash social welfare (CNSW).  The graph includes two classes of agents (red and blue nodes), and items (white nodes). The connections show which agents like which items. The structure of the graph and the connection is designed to show that even if a matching is class envy-free (CEF) and non-wasteful, it does not necessarily maximize the CNSW objective function.
