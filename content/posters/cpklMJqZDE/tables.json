[{"figure_path": "cpklMJqZDE/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: LDNet for Compressed Sensing. On the left, we plot the NMSE (in dB) obtained by LDNet and Bayes AMP baselines on the Bernoulli-Gaussian prior. On the right, we plot NMSE (not in dB) achieved on the Z2 prior. LDNet (along with the guided denoisers) achieves virtually identical performance to the conjectured computationally optimal Bayes AMP.", "description": "This figure compares the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) achieved by the proposed LDNet model and two baseline models (Bayes AMP and guided denoisers) for two different signal priors in compressed sensing experiments.  The left panel shows the NMSE (in decibels) for a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior, and the right panel shows NMSE (not in dB) for a Z2 prior.  The results demonstrate that the LDNet achieves performance nearly identical to Bayes AMP, which is conjectured to be optimal.  The plot includes the NMSE as a function of the number of layers used in each method.", "section": "4.1 Compressed sensing"}]
