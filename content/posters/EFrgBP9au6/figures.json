", "description": "This figure displays the results of experiments conducted on three different datasets (X, Y, and Z) using linear regression and a random feature model.  The first row shows quantile-quantile (QQ) plots comparing the empirical distribution of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iterates against a fitted Student's t-distribution and an alpha-stable distribution. The second row presents similar QQ plots, but focuses on the alpha-stable distribution. The third row compares the complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) of the empirical data to the ccdfs of Student's t-distributions parameterized by upper and lower bounds (\u03b7* and \u03b7*) of the asymptotic tail index. These comparisons visually assess the goodness-of-fit of the Student's t-distribution and the alpha-stable distribution as models for the heavy-tailed distribution of SGD iterates.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
