Existing data pruning methods, designed for training from scratch, are often ineffective when used with pre-trained models in the transfer learning paradigm. This incompatibility is largely due to the distribution shift between pre-training and downstream data, common in molecular tasks. This makes efficient training on molecular data challenging, and existing data pruning methods unsuitable for this transfer learning context.\nTo address this, the paper introduces MolPeg, a novel molecular data pruning framework for enhanced generalization.  MolPeg employs a source-free approach, working with pre-trained models, and introduces a unique scoring function based on loss discrepancies between two models (an online model and a reference model with different update paces) to evaluate sample informativeness.  MolPeg consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves superior generalization, surpassing full-dataset performance by pruning up to 60-70% of the data in some datasets. This showcases the potential of MolPeg to improve both training efficiency and model generalization, particularly when pre-trained models are used.", "affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GJ0qIevGjD/podcast.wav"}
