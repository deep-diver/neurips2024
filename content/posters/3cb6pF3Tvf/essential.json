Existing algorithms like SUM struggle to handle prediction errors effectively.  Previous attempts such as SUMw and FSUM had limitations in consistency and robustness. \n\nThis paper introduces PFSUM, a novel learning-augmented algorithm designed to overcome these limitations. PFSUM cleverly integrates both past performance and predicted future costs to make more informed online decisions. The researchers rigorously prove PFSUM's competitive ratio, showing it's both consistent (performs well with perfect predictions) and robust (handles prediction errors gracefully). Extensive experiments demonstrate that PFSUM significantly outperforms existing algorithms, making it a valuable contribution to the field.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "3cb6pF3Tvf/podcast.wav"}
