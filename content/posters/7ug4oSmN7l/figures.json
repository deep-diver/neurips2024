The first part transforms the input graph G by treating the arcs on G as nodes of a new directed graph G, only executing once. The second part leverages the GAT and AM to update arc embeddings and select arcs, executing at each time step.", "description": "This figure illustrates the DaAM (Direction-Aware Attention Model) pipeline, which comprises two main stages. The first stage involves a one-time graph transformation where the input graph G's arcs are converted into nodes of a new directed graph G.  The second stage, executed at each decision step, uses a Graph Attention Network (GAT) and an Attention Model (AM) to update the arc embeddings and select the next arc based on these embeddings.  The process involves using an encoder and decoder in the AM to generate probabilities for arc selection.", "section": "4.1 Direction-aware Attention Model"}, {"figure_path": "7ug4oSmN7l/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Convergence trends of different methods in reinforcement learning training.", "description": "This figure shows the convergence trends of different methods during reinforcement learning training across four different tasks (Task30, Task40, Task50, and Task60).  Each plot displays the solution cost over training epochs for three approaches: MDS+GAT (combining Multi-Dimensional Scaling and Graph Attention Networks), MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling only), and GAT (Graph Attention Networks only).  The plots illustrate how the solution cost decreases over epochs for each method and task, allowing for a comparison of their convergence speed and performance. The relatively stable convergence of the MDS+GAT method suggests its superiority in this aspect.", "section": "4.2 Supervised Reinforcement Learning for CARP"}, {"figure_path": "7ug4oSmN7l/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Qualitative comparison in four real street scenes.

Each subfigure represents one road network, displaying the paths generated by the three algorithms overlaid on a satellite image of the area. The paths are color-coded to distinguish them, with gray representing roads not needing service and red dots showing depot locations.  The cost of each path is displayed below each subfigure, allowing for a comparison of the algorithms' performance across different scenarios.", "section": "5.2 Evaluation Results"}]
