Details are described in PAIRED [3].", "description": "This table summarizes the teacher policies used in three different Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) approaches: Domain Randomization (DR), PAIRED, and the proposed SHED method.  It shows the teacher's policy (\u039b(\u03c0)) and decision rule for each approach.  The notation U(\u0398) represents a uniform distribution over the environment parameter space;  \u010e represents a baseline distribution; \u03b8\u03c0 represents the environment parameter that maximizes the regret of the student policy (\u03c0); and \u03c5\u03c0 is the student's performance above the baseline distribution.", "section": "3.3 Rewards and Choice of evaluate environments"}]
