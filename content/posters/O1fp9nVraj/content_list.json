In this paper we study debate, where two AI\u2019s compete to convince a judge; consultancy, where a single AI tries to convince a judge that asks questions; and compare to a baseline of direct question-answering, where the judge just answers outright without the AI. We use large language models (LLMs) as both AI agents and as stand-ins for human judges, taking the judge models to be weaker than agent models. We benchmark on a diverse range of asymmetries between judges and agents, extending previous work on a single extractive QA task with information asymmetry, to also include mathematics, coding, logic and multimodal reasoning asymmetries. We find that debate outperforms consultancy across all tasks when the consultant is randomly assigned to argue for the correct/incorrect answer. Comparing debate to direct question answering, the results depend on the type of task: in extractive QA tasks with information asymmetry debate outperforms direct question answering, but in other tasks without information asymmetry the results are mixed. Previous work assigned debaters/consultants an answer to argue for. When we allow them to instead choose which answer to argue for, we find judges are less frequently convinced by the wrong answer in debate than in consultancy. Further, we find that stronger debater models increase judge accuracy, though more modestly than in previous studies.

From a theoretical perspective, work connecting debate protocols to interactive proofs in computational complexity theory has shown that debate can allow for tasks of significant complexity to be accurately and efficiently supervised by much more limited judges (Irving et al., 2018; Brown-Cohen et al., 2023).

Attempts to answer this question are still in early stages (Michael et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2024). Thus far, debate between LLMs has been primarily studied on a reading comprehension task, where the judge is artificially limited by only being allowed to see short verified quotes from the text provided by the LLM debaters. While providing initial promising evidence on the power of debate, the use of this type of information asymmetry limits the ability to fully evaluate the qualitative advantages of debate predicted by theory. The long-run difference between superhuman AIs and humans is likely to extend to differences along many capabilities, including mathematical and logical reasoning, creativity, and factual knowledge.

The tasks are constructed from binary-choice versions of multiple-choice question answering datasets, and include extractive QA, closed QA and multimodal reasoning tasks. In order to control the gap between the more capable models and weaker judges, in our main evaluation experiments we vary the strength of the judge to be equal or weaker than the models it is judging.

For consultancy, for each question, we follow Michael et al. [30]; Khan et al. [25] by assigning the consultant to argue separately for both the correct and incorrect answer. This is designed to simulate a worst-case variant of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in which human feedback can\u2019t distinguish correct/incorrect answers. Thus, the comparison between the accuracy of a less capable judge in consultancy and debate enables us to empirically test the question of whether debate between capable AI agents can enable more accurate judgment. We also compare to direct QA baselines (QA with/without article), see caption of Figure 1. For judge models we use Gemma7B (V1) [19], GPT-3.5 [5], Gemini Pro 1.0 [18], and Gemini Pro 1.5 [38].

To study this question we also consider open consultancy [40], in which the consultant chooses their answer, rather than being assigned one; and introduce open debate where we track the performance of a debater (the protagonist) which is assigned the answer which the same debater model would choose under the direct QA baseline.

We find that debate consistently outperforms consultancy across all tasks, previously only shown on a single extractive QA task in Khan et al. [25].   \n2. Comparing debate to direct question answering baselines, the results depend on the type of task. In extractive QA tasks with information asymmetry, debate outperforms QA without article as in the single task of Khan et al. [25], but not QA with article. For other tasks, when the judge is weaker than the debaters (but not too weak), we find either small or no advantage to debate over QA without article.   \n3. Changes to the setup (number of turns, best-of-N sampling, few-shot, chain-of-thought) seem to have little effect on results.   \n4. In open consultancy, the judge is equally convinced by the consultant, whether or not the consultant has chosen to argue for the correct answer. Thus, using weak judges to provide a training signal via consultancy runs the risk of amplifying the consultant\u2019s incorrect behavior. See Figure 3.   \n5. In open debate, in contrast, the judge follows the debater\u2019s choice less frequently than in open consultancy. When the debater chooses correctly, the judge does a bit worse than in open consultancy. But when the debater chooses incorrectly, the judge does a lot better at discerning this. Thus, the training signal provided by the weak judge in open debate is less likely to amplify incorrect answers than in open consultancy.   \n6. Comparing across debater models/settings, we calculate Elo scores and show that stronger debaters lead to higher judge accuracy (including for a weaker judge) across a range of tasks, see Figure 4.

That debate beats consultancy is encouraging, though it\u2019s likely that consultancy is a weak baseline to beat because of the 50/50 chance of the consultant arguing for the incorrect answer.

We form our tasks by processing existing datasets with LLM prompt templates appropriate for each scalable oversight protocol. In general, where an underlying dataset is multiple choice, we form a binary choice version by selecting the correct answer and a random answer. We group tasks into three categories: Extractive QA (QuALITY [32], BoolQ [11] and GPQA-extractive [39]), in which a binary-choice question, along with an article, are supplied to consultants/debaters but not to the judge, introducing an information asymmetry. Debaters extract passages from the article to use in their arguments \u2013 modeling a specific kind of weak-strong gap. The debaters and judges have access to a tool which verifies whether the passage is indeed contained in the article (see Appendix G). Closed QA (MMLU [20], GSM8KQA [12], PrOntoQA [41], TruthfulQA [29] and GPQA [39]) contain questions and answers, but there is no article to use as a source, in contrast to extractive QA, and hence there is no information asymmetry. The weak-strong gaps being motivated here are more intrinsic to the models \u2013 their capability and skill/reasoning gaps. Multimodal (MMMU [48]) tasks are image+text-to-text, others are text-to-text. Judge and debaters/consultants can view the image as well as the question, without information asymmetry.

Further, we look at the mean of the selected answer position for each model (1 or 2), (1.5 represents no positional bias as our datasets are balanced). Judges often display positional bias, to a greater degree in debate than in other protocols. Using both orders slightly reduces the variance of positional bias estimates, see Figure A.8.

The ablation on BoN revealing no improvement is a mildly negative sign for debate as a training protocol, as BoN is motivated as a proxy for training. The ablation showing no improvement with number of turns is also a mildly negative sign, though perhaps will differ under training for debate, if models learn to use further rounds to better argue against the claim of their opponent in the prior round.

This may be due to the judge\u2019s greater dependence on debater statements in the extractive tasks, where judges rely on debaters for information they cannot access themselves. Additional results can be found in Appendix E, showing that stronger models tend to score higher Elo; that it\u2019s often advantageous to argue for the truth; however, this advantage doesn\u2019t increase with increasing Elo, contra Khan et al.

We found that, on previously unstudied closed QA tasks, weak judges achieve higher accuracy in the debate protocol, than consultancy, and around the same as direct question answering. Further, through implementing new scalable oversight protocols, open debate and open consultancy, we were able to further see the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches: weak judges do slightly better in consultancy compared to debate when the consultant/debater chooses correctly \u2013 however, weak judges do much worse in consultancy compared to debate when the consultant chooses incorrectly. We find that, across tasks, stronger debaters (as measured by their Elo scores) lead to higher judge accuracy, but the effect was relatively weak compared to Radhakrishnan [37], Khan et al. [25] which studied the QuALITY task only.

While results on win rates, and advantages arising from selecting correct vs. incorrect answers provide some evidence of their abilities to play these games, they don\u2019t give us much evidence about their effectiveness as scalable oversight training protocols. Further, the models we used as consultants/debaters were all fine-tuned with RLHF for, among other qualities, honesty, which is what debate is aiming to incentivise, and for example may hamper the dishonest consultant/debater (see discussion in Appendix C.3 of Khan et al. [25]). It would be interesting to perform our study in the helpful-only setting.

We could also investigate other scalable oversight protocols, e.g. debate with cross-examination [3] or iterated amplification [10].

Across the ProntoQA reasoning task, 11 of the 12 failures stem directly from logical errors made by the judge, with the 12th attributable to poor debating by the honest debater.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
