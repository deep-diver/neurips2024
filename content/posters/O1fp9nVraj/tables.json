The tasks are categorized into three types: extractive, multimodal, and closed.  Extractive QA tasks introduce an information asymmetry where the judge (weaker LLM) does not have access to the same information as the debaters/consultants (stronger LLMs).  The table highlights key features for each task, helping to understand the varying levels of difficulty and the type of reasoning required.", "section": "Tasks"}, {"figure_path": "O1fp9nVraj/tables/tables_40_1.jpg", "caption": "Table F.1: Summary of key characteristics differentiating our tasks: extractive (top row), multimodal (MMMU) and closed (others).

It categorizes them into three types: Extractive QA, Closed QA, and Multimodal.  For each task type, it highlights key features that differentiate the tasks from one another and influence the difficulty and nature of the task. It also notes which tasks include information asymmetry (where the judge has less information than the debaters/consultant).
