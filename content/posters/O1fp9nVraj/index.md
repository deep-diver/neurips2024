### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current AI alignment relies heavily on human feedback, but this is unsustainable as AI surpasses human capabilities. This paper investigates scalable oversight protocols, aiming to leverage AI's abilities to enhance human supervision of superhuman AI. The study focuses on three protocols: debate, where two AIs argue for opposing answers; consultancy, where a single AI interacts with the judge; and direct question-answering. The researchers employ large language models (LLMs), with weaker models acting as judges and stronger ones as agents.  The main challenge is to design methods which bridge the capability gap between humans and future superhuman AI. 

The study benchmarks these protocols across diverse tasks with varying asymmetries between judges and agents.  Results show debate outperforms consultancy across all tasks.  However, its advantage over direct question answering varies depending on the task type. Interestingly, when agents choose which answer to argue for, judges are less often convinced by the incorrect answer in debate compared to consultancy. Moreover, utilizing stronger AI debaters increases judge accuracy, though the improvement is more modest than initially expected.

> üîº This figure illustrates the different types of tasks and protocols used in the study.  The tasks are categorized into three types: Extractive QA (extracting information from a text), Closed QA (no additional context), and Multimodal (combining text and images). The protocols represent different methods for obtaining human-level oversight of AI agents: Direct QA (judge answers directly without AI assistance), Consultancy (single AI agent tries to persuade a judge), Debate (two AI agents compete to persuade a judge), Open Consultancy (AI agent chooses an answer and tries to persuade a judge), and Open Debate (AI agents choose answers and compete to persuade a judge).  The QA with article protocol was only used in the Extractive QA tasks.

### In-depth insights


#### Weak Judge Debate
The concept of 'Weak Judge Debate' in the context of large language model (LLM) evaluation presents a compelling approach to scalable oversight.  It leverages the inherent strengths of debate to help **less capable judges** make accurate assessments of potentially superhuman AI agents. The core idea is that the structured debate format, where two strong LLMs argue for opposing answers, allows even a weak judge to discern the correct answer by observing the quality of reasoning and evidence presented. This paradigm shifts the focus from directly judging AI capabilities to evaluating the persuasive power of the AI arguments, which might prove a more manageable and scalable method for human oversight.  A key advantage is the robustness to inherent bias in both AI agents and judges; debate offers a process for **amplifying the strength of correct arguments** while mitigating the impact of bias by allowing comparison of arguments.  However, experimental results show that debate's effectiveness is task dependent. While it consistently outperforms simpler methods like consultancy, its efficacy can vary based on factors like task complexity, type of argumentative asymmetry and the judge's baseline capabilities, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand and optimize its potential for scalable oversight in various contexts.

#### Scalable Oversight
Scalable oversight, crucial for safely managing superhuman AI, seeks methods enabling humans to accurately supervise advanced AI systems.  The core challenge lies in developing protocols that leverage AI capabilities to enhance human oversight, addressing the limitations of direct human feedback. **Debate and consultancy protocols** are explored as potential solutions, both utilizing weaker AI models as human surrogates to evaluate stronger AI agents' performance.  **Debate**, where two strong AI models argue for opposing answers, shows promise for improving accuracy over **consultancy**, where a single model attempts to convince the judge.  However, **results are highly task-dependent**, with debate offering more advantages on tasks involving information asymmetry. Open-role variations, allowing AI agents to choose their argument, add further complexity, with open debate demonstrating resilience to biases. This highlights the importance of testing scalable oversight under various conditions and capability gaps to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.  **Future research must rigorously test debate and other protocols** as training methods, measuring their impact on long-term AI alignment.

#### Debate vs. Consult
This research explores the effectiveness of two AI oversight protocols: debate and consultation, in evaluating strong AI models using weaker judge models.  **Debate**, involving two strong AIs arguing opposing viewpoints before a weaker judge, consistently outperforms **consultation**, where a single AI attempts persuasion.  This is true across diverse tasks ranging from extractive QA to mathematical reasoning, highlighting debate's robustness. However, debate's advantage over direct question answering, where a judge answers without AI input, varied depending on the task and the judge's capabilities, suggesting that a weaker judge may require a strong information asymmetry or a significantly less difficult question to benefit.  The open-role variants, where agents select which argument to advance, further emphasize debate's reliability, especially by reducing the impact of errors.  **Stronger debater models consistently improve judge accuracy in debate**, although the effect is more modest than expected, underscoring the need for advanced judge-training methodologies.

#### Open Debate
In the realm of AI alignment research, **open debate** presents a compelling approach to scalable oversight.  Unlike traditional debate protocols where debaters are assigned arguments, open debate empowers AI agents to autonomously select the stance they wish to defend. This crucial element introduces a more realistic scenario, mimicking real-world situations where AI might strategically choose its arguments.  The inherent uncertainty in argument selection provides valuable insights into AI decision-making processes and allows for a more robust assessment of AI capabilities. **By observing how a weaker judge model reacts to the AI's self-selected stance, researchers can gauge the persuasiveness and overall quality of AI reasoning.** This contrasts with closed-debate where the judge's accuracy is potentially skewed by the predefined arguments.  Moreover, **open debate's emphasis on self-selection promotes a richer evaluation of AI's potential for manipulation or strategic behavior**.  This method provides a critical step towards building trustworthy and reliable AI systems.  The study's findings suggest that open debate, while having challenges, offers a more realistic and nuanced evaluation of AI's alignment compared to traditional assigned-role protocols.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize **rigorous empirical validation** of debate's effectiveness as a training protocol, moving beyond inference-only evaluations.  This necessitates a transition to **real-world training scenarios** where judge accuracy is assessed during model training, rather than solely in a post-hoc inference setting.  Investigating **alternative judge models**, including human judges, is crucial for assessing generalization and robustness.  Moreover, exploring **different task domains** will expand the understanding of debate's applicability beyond existing benchmarks.  Further work should also focus on refining existing protocols via hyperparameter tuning and exploration of **innovative debate structures** to improve judge accuracy and efficiency.  A key area for improvement is mitigating **positional bias**, ensuring that debate outcomes are less influenced by presentation order.  Finally, studying how debate scales with **increasing capability gaps** between judges and agents remains a vital open question.

The bottom panel breaks down judge accuracy further, showing performance when the protagonist/consultant chose correctly vs. incorrectly. Different colors represent different protocols and judge models, and the results are separated by task type (extractive, closed, multimodal).

> Figure 3: Open debate and open consultancy, where a protagonist debater/consultant chooses which answer to argue for. Top: Judge accuracy (y-axis) and win rate of protagonist/consultant (x-axis). Blue colours for consultancy, red colours for debate, with the shade corresponding to judge model. Bottom: Judge accuracy according to whether the protagonist/consultant chose the correct (dark) or incorrect (light) answer. Split by judge model (x-axis) and protocol: consultancy and debate. Facet is task type. 95% CIs. Correct answer rate: 88% (extractive), 84% (closed), 71% (multimodal).

> üîº This figure displays the mean judge accuracy across nine different question answering tasks, broken down by four different scalable oversight protocols: QA without article, Consultancy, Debate, and QA with article.  The x-axis represents the different judge models used (Gemma7B, GPT-3.5, Pro 1.0, Pro 1.5). The y-axis shows the mean judge accuracy, with error bars representing the 95% confidence intervals.  The figure allows for a comparison of the effectiveness of each protocol across various tasks and judge model capabilities.

> üîº This figure presents an analysis of debater performance in terms of Elo ratings. The top part displays the Elo ratings for each debater model, categorized by whether they were assigned to argue for the correct or incorrect answer. The bottom part shows the difference between the Elo ratings for debaters arguing for the correct and incorrect answers, plotted against the aggregate Elo rating of all debaters. The results indicate that the advantage of arguing for the correct answer is more significant for extractive tasks compared to closed tasks.

Bottom: Correct answer advantage (correct debater's Elo - incorrect debater's Elo) vs. aggregate debater Elo. 95% CIs. Answer advantage is more sensitive to debater elo on extractive tasks than closed tasks.

> üîº This figure shows the results of Elo calculation for debaters with different models.  The top part shows the Elo rating of debaters categorized by model and whether they were assigned to argue for the correct or incorrect answer.  The bottom part shows the relationship between the difference in Elo ratings (correct - incorrect) and the aggregate Elo rating of the debaters. The figure demonstrates that the advantage of arguing for the correct answer is more influenced by the debaters' Elo ratings in extractive tasks compared to closed tasks.

> üîº This figure presents the results of an Elo rating calculation for different LLM debaters, categorized by model and whether they argued for the correct or incorrect answer.  The top section displays the Elo ratings themselves, showing the relative strengths of each debater in persuading the judge. The bottom section analyzes the difference in Elo scores between debaters arguing for correct versus incorrect answers, revealing that this difference is more pronounced for tasks with information asymmetry (extractive QA) than for tasks without (closed QA). 95% confidence intervals are included to provide statistical significance.

> üîº This figure displays the results of the main experiments comparing different scalable oversight protocols: QA without article, Consultancy, Debate, and QA with article.  The results are broken down by task type (Extractive, Closed, Multimodal) and judge model strength (Gemma7B, GPT-3.5, Pro 1.0, Pro 1.5).  The y-axis shows the mean judge accuracy, with higher values indicating better performance. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The figure shows that debate generally outperforms consultancy and, depending on the task type, sometimes outperforms direct question answering (QA without article).  The QA with article protocol serves as a strong baseline, demonstrating the benefit of providing the judge with all relevant information.

> Figure 2: Assigned-role results: mean judge accuracy (y-axis) split by task type (facet), judge model (x-axis), protocol (colour). Higher is better. 95% CI calculated aggregated over tasks of same type (Appendix D for details). The QA with article protocol (purple) can only be applied for extractive tasks. Only Pro 1.5 is multimodal.
