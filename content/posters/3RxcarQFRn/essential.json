However, inaccurate surrogate models often lead to poor optimization results.  This is particularly problematic in areas such as drug design or materials science where each function evaluation is very expensive. Existing methods for offline MBO struggle with inaccurate surrogate models, leading to suboptimal designs. \nThis paper introduces a novel framework, Generative Adversarial Model-based Optimization using adaptive source critic regularization (aSCR), to address these issues.  **aSCR dynamically adjusts the strength of a constraint that keeps the optimization within the reliable region of the design space**.  The method is shown to outperform existing approaches on a variety of offline generative design tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and broad applicability.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "3RxcarQFRn/podcast.wav"}
