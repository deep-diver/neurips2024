It shows a series of HWP layers applied to the qubits (q0-q3), followed by a parity check block.  The parity check block consists of a series of CNOT gates which measure the parity of the qubits and store it in an ancilla qubit (a0). This block is repeated 'T' times to continuously monitor and mitigate errors.  The resulting parity information helps in correcting errors and enforcing constraints. The figure is relevant to the use of parity checks as an error mitigation method for the HWP ansatz in quantum circuits.", "section": "Parity Check as Error Mitigation for HWP"}, {"figure_path": "aIuByRyHhV/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) The QAP instance with four facilities {A, B, C, D} mapped to four locations {0, 1, 2, 3}.
