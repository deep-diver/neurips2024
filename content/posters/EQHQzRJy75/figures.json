It shows a two-stage process: 1) Gradient-Based Submodular Subset Selection (GBSSS) which selects representative point clouds from the unlabeled data pool using a submodular function based on gradients from hypothetical labels generated by Monte Carlo dropout. This stage aims to maximize the coverage of the unlabeled data while considering object diversity and difficulty levels.  2) Submodular Diversity Maximization for Class Balancing (SDMCB) that selects a subset of the point clouds from stage one to balance the class distribution of the labeled data, making the model robust to class imbalance.  The figure also depicts the overall workflow, including initial training, active learning iterations (query rounds), and model retraining with newly labeled data.", "section": "4 Algorithms"}, {"figure_path": "EQHQzRJy75/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The proposed STONE method more effectively maintains the balance of label distribution in active 3D object detection. The plots show the cumulative label distribution entropy values on KITTI [15] validation set split with PV-RCNN [49].", "description": "This figure compares the cumulative label distribution entropy across different active learning query rounds for three methods: STONE, CRB, and KECOR. It demonstrates that STONE effectively maintains a balanced label distribution, unlike CRB and KECOR, which show an increasing entropy (imbalance) as the number of query rounds increases.  This highlights STONE's ability to address data imbalance, a key challenge in active 3D object detection.", "section": "4.2.2 Submodular Diversity Maximization for Class Balancing (SDMCB)"}, {"figure_path": "EQHQzRJy75/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: 3D mAP (%) of AL baselines on the KITTI validation set with PV-RCNN.", "description": "This figure shows the performance comparison of various active learning (AL) baselines and the proposed STONE method on the KITTI validation dataset using the PV-RCNN backbone.
