We employ these functions in our GBMSS study to assess their effectiveness. In terms of performance measured by 3D AP, we observe results similar to those of STONE. However, it comes with an extremely high labeling cost with a $50.98\\%$ rise in bounding box annotations. With the max coverage submodular function, we see slight performance drops of $1.57\\%$ , $0.06\\%$ , and $0.65\\%$ for the EASY, MODERATE and HARD difficulty levels respectively.

To ensure a fair comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods CRB [35] and KECOR [34], we leveraged $1\\%$ of the labeled bounding boxes. Referring to Tables 8 and 9, as more labeled bounding boxes are added to the training, the results get better. It is worth noting that the KECOR method marginally surpasses STONE when using $2\\%$ and $3\\%$ of the bounding box. This is because the STONE method, when utilizing the PV-RCNN backbone, tends to select scenes with more objects. As a result, STONE reaches the bounding box limit very early in the active learning stage. The slightly better results achieved by KECOR are due to it querying more scenes and being trained over more epochs. In active 3D object detection, the goal is to label as few bounding boxes as possible to achieve good performance. Therefore, it is critical to maintain high performance with a smaller number of labeled bounding boxes, as demonstrated by STONE.
