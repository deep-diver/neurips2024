E-NFE is measured by Tweedie T-leaping method with log-linear noise schedule.", "description": "The figure shows the expected number of function evaluations (E-NFEs) for different sampling methods and numbers of sampling steps.  The x-axis represents the number of sampling steps, while the y-axis shows the E-NFEs.  Three lines are plotted, showing the theoretical and experimental E-NFEs for the caching strategy, as well as the E-NFEs for the uncached strategy. The figure demonstrates that the caching strategy significantly reduces the E-NFEs, especially as the number of sampling steps increases. The experimental results closely match the theoretical predictions.", "section": "3.2 Efficient samplers to reduce NFE by caching Co (xt)"}, {"figure_path": "7yqjVgWWxx/figures/figures_4_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Sample quality measured by perplexity (\u2193). We compare SEDD with Euler and Tweedie T-leaping (abbr. T-\u03c4) samplers, and RADD with Euler sampler. We show E-NFE for RADD with caching and NFE otherwise.", "description": "This figure compares the sample quality (measured by perplexity) and the number of function evaluations (NFEs) of different diffusion models.  The perplexity decreases as the NFE increases across all models, indicating that higher computational cost generally results in better sample quality.  The figure shows that RADD with caching consistently achieves lower perplexity than SEDD (with Euler and Tweedie T-leaping samplers), and that RADD with caching requires fewer NFEs than RADD without caching.", "section": "3.2 Efficient samplers to reduce NFE by caching Co(xt)"}]
