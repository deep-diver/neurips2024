In complex driving scenarios, vehicles need to perceive lanes & traffic elements and reason their topological relationships (i.e., lane connectivity and correspondence with traffic elements), which provides comprehensive information for downstream path planning and motion control. Under the trend of end-to-end autonomous driving, abovementioned perception and reasoning are integrated into a single task, referred to as topology reasoning [1] in autonomous driving scenes. This challenge has attracted widespread attention within the ego planning [2, 3, 4]and high-definition map learning [5, 6, 7, 8] communities. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "The topology reasoning task has garnered significant attention recently, since it is closer to the real needs. Some works have explored lane centerline representation [1, 9, 10, 11] and lane segment representation [12], while others have introduced SDMap (Standard-Definition Map) [13] to provide additional clues for learning. However, existing works primarily focus on enhancements in the perception part, with scarce modifications made to the reasoning part. Irrespective of the approach details, existing studies typical employ vanilla MLP to learn lane topology directly from lane query. This paradigm has its shortcoming: since each lane is encoded independently through distinct query, it is challenging to ensure strictly overlap at the endpoints of two connected lanes, as shown in Figure 1(b). In contrast, it is evident that the endpoints of two connected lanes in the ground truth actually overlap perfectly, as shown in Figure 1(a). Lanes with slightly shifted endpoints may be erroneously classified by MLP as disconnected. This leads to MLP easily predicting fewer lane topology, as shown in Figure 1(c). ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To tackle the aforementioned issues, we introduce TopoLogic, an interpretable method for lane topology reasoning that is based on lane geometric distances and the similarity of lane query in semantic space. The geometric distance-based approach aims to mitigates the impact of endpoint shift, thereby more robustly learning lane topology. This approach first calculates the geometric distance between lanes and then uses a learnable mapping function to map the distance to connectivity probability. Notably, for two given lanes, their geometric distance is defined as the distance between the ending point of one lane and the starting point of subsequent lane. This distance itself can serve as a strong criterion: when this distance is within a certain range, the predicted endpoints should be considered overlapping, and the lanes connected; otherwise, they are not. In this way, the lane topology reasoning becomes more tolerant of endpoint shifts, thus becoming more accurate. It\u2019s worth noting that even when the geometric distance method is merely applied as post-processing without re-training, the performance of SOTA model in lane topology reasoning is significantly improved, as shown in Figure 1(d). Moreover, reasoning lane topology completely based on geometric distances can lead to inaccuracies when lane detection is imprecise as is shown in Figure 4, since the calculation of lane geometric distance heavily relies on the accuracy of lane detection. To make up for the deficiency of geometric distances approach, we design a extra topology approach based on the similarity of lane queries as a complement. This approach projects lane queries into a high-dimensional semantic space, and involves explicitly computing the dot product between lane query to determine similarity, and then mapping this similarity onto lane topology using sigmoid [14]. The approach for calculating lane query similarity complements the approach used for computing lane geometric distance topology and similarly boasts high interpretability. The final lane topology is obtained by fusing the topology matrix derived from both approachs. By the way, the lane topology is also used in GNN to enhance lane learning through the aggregation of features from adjacent lanes.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
