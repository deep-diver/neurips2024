The overarching structure of TopoLogic comprises two main components: an image encoder for feature extraction and transformation, and a lane decoder responsible for end-to-end topology reasoning. This decoder utilizes the proposed lane geometric distance topology and lane similarity topology, and fuse them into the final lane topology, which is facilitated through GNN to augment lane learning in the next decoder layer.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the TopoLogic model. It shows two main components: an image encoder that processes multi-view images to extract and transform features into a bird's eye view (BEV) representation, and a lane decoder that performs end-to-end lane topology reasoning.  The lane decoder incorporates two parallel branches: one for calculating lane geometric distance topology and another for calculating lane similarity topology.  These two topologies are then fused together using a learnable weighting scheme, and the result is fed into a graph convolutional network (GNN) to further enhance lane feature learning and refine the final lane topology output. The figure also illustrates the calculation of geometric distances between lane lines and the use of sigmoid function for mapping lane query similarity scores to topology.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "MXzr10iX2d/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of various mapping functions. fgau represent Gaussian function, fsig represent sigmoid function, and ftan represent tanh function.

The x-axis represents the geometric distance between lane endpoints, and the y-axis represents the resulting topology score (probability of connectivity). The four functions are: Gaussian (fgau), sigmoid (fsig), tanh (ftan), and the authors' proposed function (fours). The plot shows that the authors' function, fours, has a wider tolerance for endpoint shift, meaning it is less sensitive to small variations in endpoint position.", "section": "3.3 Lane Geometric Distance Topology"}, {"figure_path": "MXzr10iX2d/figures/figures_4_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Qualitative result about lane topology reasoning result of TopoNet and our TopoLogic.
