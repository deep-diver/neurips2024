### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current audio-visual (AV) representation learning often overlooks the importance of data alignment. Misaligned audio (noise, synchronization issues) limits the quality of joint representations. This paper addresses this issue by proposing AVAgent, a novel data-centric approach to improve AV joint representations.

AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to analyze audio and video, plan audio edits, and use a VLM to evaluate the results. This agentic workflow iteratively refines the alignment.  Experiments show that AVAgent significantly improves performance on several downstream tasks (classification, localization, separation) compared to existing methods, demonstrating the impact of a data-centric approach.

> The figure illustrates the AVAgent workflow, a three-step cyclic process for improving audio-visual joint representations.  The workflow starts with a 'tool use' phase where a multimodal LLM processes both audio and video inputs separately to create textual descriptions.  Next, in the 'planning' phase, the AVAgent (an LLM-based assistant) analyzes these descriptions, determines if alignment is needed, and plans audio editing actions. Finally, in the 'reflection' phase, a vision-language model (VLM) evaluates the results, providing feedback to the AVAgent. This cyclic process of tool use, planning, and reflection continues until the audio and video are well-aligned.

### In-depth insights


#### Agentic AV Alignment
Agentic AV alignment presents a novel approach to enhancing audio-visual (AV) data quality by actively aligning audio signals with visual content using a large language model (LLM)-driven agent. This **data-centric** approach directly addresses common issues like background noise and temporal misalignment.  The agent's workflow involves iterative refinement cycles: First, it uses a multimodal LLM to independently analyze audio and visual data, generating descriptions.  Next, the LLM plans audio edits based on this analysis, performing tasks such as noise reduction or synchronization adjustments. Finally, a vision-language model (VLM) evaluates the results, providing feedback for iterative improvement. This **agentic workflow**, with its built-in feedback loop, enables adaptive alignment tailored to each AV pair. Unlike traditional approaches that assume pre-aligned data, this method actively improves data quality before representation learning, leading to **significant improvements** in various downstream tasks.  This framework demonstrates the potential of LLMs for intelligent data pre-processing, showcasing a powerful paradigm shift in AV representation learning.

#### LLM-Driven AudioFix
An LLM-driven AudioFix system presents a novel approach to audio enhancement.  It leverages the power of large language models to intelligently analyze audio, identify issues like noise, clipping, or inconsistencies, and apply targeted fixes.  **The key advantage is the context-aware nature of the corrections.** Unlike traditional methods relying solely on algorithms, the LLM understands the semantic content of the audio, leading to more natural and effective repairs. For instance, the system could intelligently reduce background noise during speech while preserving the desired sounds, or automatically adjust volume levels to maintain consistency.  This adaptive approach significantly improves audio quality and could be particularly useful for applications where perfect audio recording is not feasible.  **However, the system's efficacy hinges on the quality of the input audio and the LLM's training data.**  The system's robustness to unexpected audio issues also needs to be thoroughly evaluated.  **Ethical considerations surrounding potential misuse are also paramount,** requiring careful consideration of safeguards.

#### Data-Centric AV
A data-centric approach to audio-visual (AV) processing prioritizes enhancing the quality and alignment of AV data before feeding it into models.  This contrasts with model-centric methods, which focus primarily on algorithmic improvements. **Data-centric AV** recognizes that noisy or misaligned audio and video significantly hinder model performance.  Therefore, it emphasizes preprocessing techniques like intelligent noise reduction, synchronization, and data augmentation.  By improving data quality through careful alignment and cleaning, **a data-centric method aims to increase the robustness and generalizability of AV models**. This approach often involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to analyze and correct discrepancies between audio and video streams.  The use of LLMs for planning data modifications and VLMs for evaluating results is a key characteristic of this approach, resulting in a data-centric workflow that iteratively improves data quality and alignment.  **This iterative cycle distinguishes data-centric AV from conventional approaches, producing cleaner, more aligned data**, thereby boosting the performance of subsequent learning methods on downstream AV tasks.

#### AV Representation
Audio-visual (AV) representation learning seeks to **fuse audio and visual data** for improved performance in tasks like captioning and sound source separation.  **Early methods** focused on concatenating or merging features from separate audio and visual processing streams.  However, this approach often struggles with **misalignment issues** such as background noise, asynchronicity, or inconsistent contextual information between modalities.  **Recent advances** emphasize the importance of data pre-processing and alignment techniques to address these issues before joint representation learning.  **More sophisticated methods** explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to intelligently analyze and adjust audio data to better match visual context, showing promising improvements in downstream tasks.  **Future research** should focus on developing more robust and efficient alignment strategies, particularly those handling complex real-world scenarios with substantial noise or distortion, leading to more accurate and reliable AV representations.

#### Future of AV
The future of audio-visual (AV) technology is bright, promising significant advancements across diverse fields.  **Improved data quality and alignment** will be crucial, leveraging AI-driven techniques like those demonstrated in the paper to create more robust and accurate AV representations. **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) will play an increasingly vital role in processing and understanding AV data, enabling more sophisticated applications like automatic captioning, content retrieval, and human-computer interaction.  **Agentic workflows**, as explored in this research, offer a powerful means for automating data refinement, adapting to diverse audio and visual inputs, and enhancing synchronization.  However, challenges remain, including the need to address computational resource requirements and ensure ethical considerations are at the forefront of development, especially regarding issues of privacy and potential misuse.  Ultimately, the future will see more seamless integration of AV modalities, leading to enhanced applications in media, entertainment, accessibility, education, and surveillance.
