These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AVAgent on source separation, we compare the following methods: 1) NMF [70]: a traditional signal processing approach based on non-negative matrix factorization to generate the spectrogram of each sound source; 2) RPCA [71]: a parameter-free baseline based on robust principal component analysis; 3) Sound-ofPixels [4]: a deep learning approach that recovers separated audio conditioned on pixel-level visual features; 4) MP-Net [72]: an improved audio-visual method based on recursive separation from the mixture; 5) CCoL [73] (CVPR 2021): a cyclic co-learning framework based on sounding object visual grounding to separate individual sound sources. 6) OneAVM [17] (ICML 2023): a unified audio-visual framework for localization, separation, and recognition. We report the comparison results on three main benchmarks in Table 4. As can be seen, the proposed AVAgent achieves the best performs the bestance in terms of all metrics on VGGSound-Instruments and VGGSound-Music. For example, on the challenging VGGSound-Music, we outperform OneAVM [17], the current state-of-the-art model with a unified audio-visual learning framework, by 2.75 SDR and 2.67 SAR. Meanwhile, we achieve the best results of SDR and competitive results of SAR on the MUSIC dataset. These improvements show the superiority of our method in sound source separation.

For the naive baseline, random actions such as arbitrary pitch adjustments, random noise addition, or unsystematic volume changes are applied to the audio-visual data.

Our method diverges from traditional method-centric approaches, which primarily focus on algorithmic enhancements, and instead emphasizes the critical role of data quality in audio-visual learning processes. Our methodology leverages both Multimodal LLMs and advanced LLM techniques, including LoRA tuning, to analyze and adaptively modify the audio stream in alignment with the corresponding video content. Through a series of well-structured experiments across various audio-visual tasks such as classification, source localization, retrieval, question-answering, segmentation, and source separation, our approach has demonstrated significant improvements over existing methods. The success of our method confirms the importance of focusing on data quality and intelligent data manipulation in audio-visual representation learning.

The results are reported in Table 6. LoRA tuning enhances our LLM\u2019s memory and context retention capabilities, enabling it to make more informed decisions regarding AV synchronization. We implement LoRA tuning on the LLM to fine-tune it specifically for tasks that require a deep understanding of the audio-visual context. This involves adjusting the LLM\u2019s parameters to remember better and integrate lengthy audio-visual sequences. The application of LoRA tuning leads to noticeable improvements in tasks such as audio-visual source localization and segmentation, where the precision of temporal and spatial alignments is crucial. Metrics such as mIoU and F1 score show substantial enhancements. These improvements can be attributed to the LLM\u2019s enhanced ability to maintain context over extended interactions, proving essential in complex scenarios where long-term dependencies are critical. These analyses highlight the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-driven approach in achieving high-quality AV synchronization. By leveraging sophisticated LLM tuning methods and moving away from naive, random modifications, our method sets a new standard in AV data processing, paving the way for more accurate and effective multimedia applications.
