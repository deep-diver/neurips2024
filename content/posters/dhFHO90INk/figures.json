Top - in implicit guidance, first we match the training dataset, by pairing each sample with the closest one w.r.t. its shape, which has a better property (size). Then, we train a encoder-decoder framework which due to the construction of the dataset learns a lower dimensional manifold where the embeddings are ordered by the property value. Bottom - in explicit guidance, we train two separate models: a generator and a discriminator that guides the optimization in latent space.", "description": "This figure illustrates the difference between implicit and explicit guidance in design optimization.  Implicit guidance (top) uses a matching technique to create a dataset where samples are paired with similar ones having a better property value. This matched dataset is then used to train an encoder-decoder model which implicitly learns the direction of improvement. In contrast, explicit guidance (bottom) trains separate generator and discriminator models to explicitly guide the optimization process in the latent space.
