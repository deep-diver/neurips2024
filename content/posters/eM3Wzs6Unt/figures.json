(a) Optimal Option Trajectory illustrates the optimal trajectory as a PGM, showing the dependencies between states (St), actions (at), options (ot), and optimality variables (\u03b5t). (b) Variational Distribution (HiT-MDP) shows the variational distribution used to approximate the optimal trajectory, simplifying the model by introducing latent variables and using a Hidden Temporal Markovian Decision Process (HiT-MDP).", "section": "3.1 PGM Formulations of The Option Framework"}, {"figure_path": "eM3Wzs6Unt/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Experiments on Mujoco Environments. Curves are averaged over 10 independent runs with different random seeds and smoothed by a sliding window of size 20. Shaded regions indicate standard deviations.", "description": "This figure shows the experimental results of VMOC and other algorithms across 10 different MuJoCo environments.  The y-axis represents the episodic return, a measure of performance, and the x-axis represents the number of steps taken. Each line represents a different algorithm. The shaded areas around each line indicate the standard deviation, showing the variability in performance across multiple runs. The results demonstrate VMOC's superior performance in most environments.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
