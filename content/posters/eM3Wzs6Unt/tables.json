Curves are averaged over 10 independent runs with different random seeds and smoothed by a sliding window of size 20. Shaded regions indicate standard deviations.", "description": "This figure presents the experimental results of the VMOC algorithm and six baselines on ten MuJoCo environments.  The graphs show episodic returns over training steps, highlighting VMOC's superior performance in terms of return, convergence speed, and stability across runs and environments, especially in those with high dimensional state and action spaces.", "section": "Experiments"}]
