The option framework in HRL has advanced automatic discovery of temporally-extended actions. However, existing methods struggle with ineffective exploration and unstable updates when learning option and action policies simultaneously.  These limitations hinder the broader adoption of HRL, particularly in complex domains.\n\nThe paper introduces Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm designed to address these limitations. **VMOC leverages variational inference to stabilize updates and maximum entropy to encourage exploration.** By using low-cost option embeddings, VMOC enhances scalability and expressiveness, achieving superior performance in various environments. The algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in learning coherent and diverse options suitable for complex tasks, offering a significant advancement in HRL.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "eM3Wzs6Unt/podcast.wav"}
