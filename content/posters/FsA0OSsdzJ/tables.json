The results are given as the average mean squared root error (MSE) across five different random seeds. The models are evaluated on two different datasets: a fully synthetic dataset and a semi-synthetic Spotify dataset.  The table shows the MSE for each model at various time steps (T+1 to T+5), allowing for a comparison of model performance over time.  The results are crucial for demonstrating the superiority of the proposed CSI-VAE models.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "FsA0OSsdzJ/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Main experimental results, averaged mean squared root error over five different seeds.", "description": "This table presents the main experimental results of the paper, showing the averaged mean squared root error (RMSE) for different models across five different random seeds.  The results are broken down by prediction time horizon (T+1 to T+5) and dataset (Full Synthetic and Semi-Synthetic Spotify).  The models compared include the proposed CSI-VAE method in three variations (CSI-VAE-1, CSI-VAE-2, and CSI-VAE-3), as well as several standard baselines (GRU-0, GRU-1, GRU-2, LSTM, and Transformer).  This table allows for a comparison of the performance of the proposed CSI-VAE method against standard baselines across different prediction horizons and datasets.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
