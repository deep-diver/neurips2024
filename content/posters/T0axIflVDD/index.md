### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Non-stationary time series forecasting remains challenging due to evolving trends and seasonal patterns, limiting the effectiveness of traditional methods.  Existing instance normalization techniques, while improving accuracy, struggle with complex seasonal patterns. 

The proposed Frequency Adaptive Normalization (FAN) method innovatively addresses this limitation by employing Fourier transforms to identify instance-wise predominant frequencies, effectively handling both dynamic trends and seasonality.  FAN then uses these identified frequencies to normalize the data,  modeling the discrepancy between input and output frequencies via a simple MLP. Experiments across eight benchmark datasets show substantial improvements (7.76%~37.90% average improvements in MSE), highlighting FAN's potential for broader applicability and improved forecasting accuracy.

> This figure shows a sinusoidal signal with a linearly varying frequency.  The three segments of the signal highlight the concept of non-stationarity, because they have consistent mean and variance but different Fourier frequencies.  The Fourier spectrum plots for each segment visually demonstrate the changing principal frequencies, illustrating the limitations of methods that rely solely on statistical measures (mean and variance) to capture non-stationarity.

> This table presents the characteristics of eight benchmark datasets used in the paper for multivariate time series forecasting.  For each dataset, it shows the trend variation (differences in means across different sections), seasonality variation (average variance over the Fourier spectrum), and the chosen hyperparameter K (number of dominant frequency components considered).  These values are relevant because they illustrate the varying degrees of non-stationarity present in each dataset and how the model parameters were adjusted to suit.





### In-depth insights


#### FAN: Core Idea
The core idea behind FAN (Frequency Adaptive Normalization) is to **improve time series forecasting accuracy by addressing non-stationarity**.  Unlike methods relying solely on basic statistical measures like mean and variance, FAN leverages the **Fourier transform** to identify instance-wise predominant frequencies.  This allows the model to separate stationary components from non-stationary (trend and seasonal) components, making the forecasting task easier. **Crucially, FAN models the discrepancy in frequency components between input and output**, unlike reversible instance normalization methods that assume consistent trends, enhancing its ability to handle dynamic patterns. By using a simple MLP to predict the changes in the prominent frequencies between input and output, FAN achieves a model-agnostic solution applicable to various forecasting backbones.  **This frequency-based approach allows FAN to distinguish patterns missed by simpler methods**, significantly improving forecast accuracy on various benchmark datasets.

#### Frequency Analysis
A thorough frequency analysis in a time series context would involve several key aspects.  Firstly, **identifying the dominant frequencies** present in the data is crucial, often using techniques like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This reveals the periodic patterns inherent in the data, such as seasonal or cyclical trends. Secondly, analyzing the **amplitude and phase of these frequencies** provides insights into the strength and timing of those patterns.  Changes in amplitude might signify variations in the intensity of seasonal effects over time, while shifts in phase could indicate changes in the timing of those patterns.  Thirdly, examining the **evolution of frequencies over time** is important for non-stationary time series, revealing how periodic patterns change over time. This often necessitates a time-frequency analysis, providing a visual representation of the frequency content at different time points. Finally, **relating frequencies to external factors** can uncover valuable connections between the periodic patterns in the data and external influences, contributing to a richer understanding of the underlying phenomena and providing a more robust forecasting framework.

#### Model Comparisons
A dedicated 'Model Comparisons' section in a research paper would provide a crucial analysis of various models' performance.  It should go beyond simply reporting metrics; a thoughtful comparison would delve into the **strengths and weaknesses** of each model, considering factors like **computational cost, data requirements, and the models' inherent biases**.  The analysis might involve visualizations, showing how different models handle various aspects of the data, such as trends, seasonality, or outliers. **Statistical significance tests** would be essential to ascertain whether observed differences are truly meaningful or just random variation.  Furthermore, the comparison should contextualize the models within the existing literature, highlighting how the proposed model stands out or compares against established baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.  Finally, **limitations of each model** should be acknowledged, making the discussion comprehensive and transparent.

#### Ablation Studies
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of a time series forecasting model, this might involve removing normalization techniques,  the frequency residual learning module, or the non-stationary pattern prediction module. **By progressively removing these components and observing the impact on performance metrics (like MSE or MAE), researchers can quantify the value of each component.**  This helps determine which parts are most crucial for the model's effectiveness and potentially identify areas for improvement or simplification.  For instance, removing the non-stationary pattern prediction module might reveal whether the model heavily relies on this component for accurate long-term predictions or whether the backbone model itself can adequately capture the non-stationarity. Similarly, removing the normalization step could highlight its role in preparing the input data for the model and in improving model stability. **A well-designed ablation study should reveal the relative importance of different parts of the model, giving insights into its strengths and weaknesses.** The results should also inform future model designs, allowing for the potential streamlining and optimization of the model.

#### Future of FAN
The future of Frequency Adaptive Normalization (FAN) looks promising, building on its demonstrated success in handling non-stationary time series forecasting.  **Further research could explore more sophisticated methods for selecting the principal frequency components**, moving beyond simple top-K selection to incorporate more nuanced criteria based on frequency distribution characteristics or even machine learning techniques.  **Improving the prediction module to better capture the dynamics of evolving non-stationary patterns** could also greatly enhance the model's accuracy. This could involve incorporating more advanced neural network architectures or exploring alternative techniques such as recurrent neural networks or transformers.  **Addressing limitations such as handling signals with complex, non-periodic non-stationarities and reducing the reliance on the Fourier transform** is also crucial to expanding FAN's applicability.  The development of efficient GPU-accelerated algorithms is essential for the scalability and practical use of FAN on larger datasets. Finally, **investigating potential applications in diverse domains beyond the benchmarks tested** ‚Äì such as finance, healthcare, or environmental science ‚Äì would showcase the general applicability of FAN and inspire further development and refinement.

> This figure illustrates the architecture of the Frequency Adaptive Normalization (FAN) method.  The process begins with a normalization step, where the input time series (Xt) undergoes a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).  The top K dominant frequency components are then identified, filtered out (using the 'Filter' operation), and reconstructed using an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT). This results in two components: X<sup>non</sup> (non-stationary components) and X<sup>res</sup> (stationary components). X<sup>res</sup>  is fed into a forecasting backbone model (g<sub>Œ∏</sub>) to predict the stationary part of the output (≈∂<sup>res</sup>). Meanwhile, a separate prediction module (q<sub>œÜ</sub>) using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) forecasts the non-stationary components (≈∂<sup>non</sup>) using the removed non-stationary components (X<sup>non</sup>) from the input, and the current input (X<sub>t</sub>). The overall output (≈∂<sub>t</sub>) is the sum of ≈∂<sup>res</sup> and ≈∂<sup>non</sup>.  A combined loss function incorporates both the prediction error (L<sub>forecast</sub>) and the accuracy of non-stationary pattern prediction (L<sub>œÜ</sub><sup>nonstat</sup>) to ensure accurate forecasting.

> This figure illustrates the architecture of the Frequency Adaptive Normalization (FAN) method. FAN is composed of three main stages: normalization, frequency residual learning, and denormalization. The normalization stage removes the impact of non-stationary signals (trend and seasonal patterns) from the input time series using a frequency domain decomposition.  The frequency residual learning stage focuses on the stationary aspects of the input time series, enabling the forecasting backbone to learn more effectively from the stationary information. The denormalization stage uses a simple MLP to predict and add back the non-stationary information from the input, addressing potential shifts in frequency components between inputs and outputs. The whole structure also incorporates a prior loss function which guides the model to accurately predict the non-stationary components, improving overall forecasting accuracy.

Normalization involves using a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to decompose the input time series into its frequency components.  Key frequency components are then filtered out, leaving a residual signal representing the stationary aspects of the data.  This residual is fed into the forecasting backbone. The denormalization process uses a prediction module (MLP) to estimate and reconstruct the non-stationary components that were previously removed, and combines this with the prediction from the forecasting backbone to produce the final forecast. A loss function is applied to the entire process, including the prediction of the non-stationary components.
