The results, obtained from real-world experiments, demonstrate the impact of the embodied alignment on the model's ability to handle various combinations of instruction and observation modalities.  It showcases the performance across different pairings of instruction (text, audio, image, video) and observation modalities (image, video, point cloud).  The significant drop in performance when the embodied alignment module is removed highlights its importance in the overall framework.", "section": "4.1 Real-World Evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "8lcW9ltJx9/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison with state-of-the-art robotic models in real-world experiments.", "description": "This table compares the performance of Any2Policy with three state-of-the-art robotic models (VIMA, R3M, and T5) on real-world experiments using different instruction and observation modalities.
