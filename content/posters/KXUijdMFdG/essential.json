Current GNNs either lack the expressive power to detect complex patterns or are computationally expensive when dealing with large graphs.  This necessitates developing GNNs that can effectively detect these patterns while maintaining computational efficiency.\nThis paper introduces Deep Homomorphism Networks (DHNs), a new type of GNN layer that significantly improves GNNs' ability to detect these patterns.  The key innovation is a new layer that uses graph homomorphisms to efficiently enumerate and process local subgraph patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was theoretically analyzed and empirically validated.  The DHNs are shown to be more efficient than other existing GNN models that provide comparable expressive power. This offers a potentially valuable tool for various applications involving large graphs.", "affiliation": "Roku, Inc.", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "KXUijdMFdG/podcast.wav"}
