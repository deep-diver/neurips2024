The table highlights that the MC attack achieves surprisingly high accuracy (69.31%), close to the clean accuracy of the edge device (77.20%), demonstrating the vulnerability of collaborative inference to prediction leakage.  In contrast, training a model from scratch on the server produces significantly lower accuracy (15.34%).", "section": "A.2 Prediction Leakage from the Feature"}]
