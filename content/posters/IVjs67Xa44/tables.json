Each algorithm's performance is evaluated based on two key metrics: the probability of producing an unstable matching and the number of samples required to find a stable matching. The table shows that the AE arm-DA algorithm offers improved performance in terms of sample complexity compared to the other two, especially when considering the probability of generating unstable matchings.", "section": "4 Uniform Sampling DA Algorithms"}, {"figure_path": "IVjs67Xa44/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of bounds on probability of unstable matchings and the sample complexity to find a stable matching. \u03b3 = exp(\u2212\u0394\u00b2/8).", "description": "This table compares three different algorithms for finding stable matchings in two-sided markets: uniform agent-DA, uniform arm-DA, and AE arm-DA.  For each algorithm, it provides the order of magnitude of the probability of finding an unstable matching and the sample complexity (number of samples needed) to find a stable matching. The bounds are expressed in terms of ES(m), which represents the size of the envy-set in the stable matching m, and also depends on the minimum preference gap \u0394.
