Existing approaches, primarily based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), are computationally expensive due to their ray-tracing process.  The high computational cost hinders their use in applications demanding real-time performance, such as AR/VR, gaming, and filmmaking.  This necessitates the development of more efficient HDR NVS methods capable of generating high-quality HDR images rapidly.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, the researchers introduce HDR-GS (High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for HDR NVS. HDR-GS leverages the speed advantages of Gaussian splatting while employing a novel Dual Dynamic Range (DDR) Gaussian point cloud model. This model uses spherical harmonics to represent HDR colors and an MLP-based tone-mapper for LDR color rendering. The HDR and LDR outputs are fed into Parallel Differentiable Rasterization (PDR) processes to construct HDR and LDR images. Experiments demonstrate that HDR-GS surpasses existing techniques with a 1000x speed improvement in inference while maintaining comparable, or even better, image quality. This makes HDR-GS a significant advancement in the field of HDR NVS.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "HkMCCFrYkT/podcast.wav"}
