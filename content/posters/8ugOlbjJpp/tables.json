The algorithm iteratively refines an initial point by solving a sequence of regularized saddle point problems using a subroutine (Aemp) on disjoint partitions of the dataset.  Each iteration involves updating the regularization parameter and using the output of the previous iteration as the starting point for the next. The algorithm's output is an approximate solution to the original SSP.", "section": "3 A New Analysis for Recursive Regularization"}]
