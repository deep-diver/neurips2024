Existing methods often train a regression model and then fine-tune it at test time, but this approach may not be optimal.  A key challenge lies in the difference between training and test-time objectives, hindering effective learning. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning approach to address these challenges.  The proposed method incorporates test-time optimization into the training process, effectively creating a model more adaptable to test-time optimization.  It introduces a dual-network architecture that unifies the training and test-time objectives, improving learning efficiency and robustness. \nThe researchers' approach leverages meta-learning to perform test-time optimization on each training sample before the actual training optimization. This results in meta-parameters which are ideal for test-time optimization.  To address the discrepancy between training and test objectives, a dual-network architecture is introduced. This dual network uses an auxiliary network to provide pseudo ground-truth data during test-time optimization, thereby aligning training and test-time objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and generalization, showcasing the benefits of the proposed meta-learning strategy and the dual-network architecture.  The improved performance is validated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets.", "affiliation": "South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "ugqx9tgyum/podcast.wav"}
