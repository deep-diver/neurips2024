Existing research on adversarial attacks primarily focuses on single-modality systems, neglecting the unique challenges of VIReID, such as modality differences and the need for robust ranking mechanisms.  This creates a significant gap in understanding and improving the security of these systems.  The lack of focus on the alignment of adversarial features across different modalities (visible and infrared) also poses a major obstacle. \nThis paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel feature-level adversarial attack method for VIReID. This method uses universal adversarial perturbations and a frequency-spatial attention module to generate adversarial features that are consistent across modalities.  The study also incorporates an auxiliary quadruple adversarial loss to enhance the distinctions between visible and infrared features, further disrupting the system's ranking. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB benchmarks showcase the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating the vulnerability of existing VIReID systems and highlighting the need for improved security measures.", "affiliation": "Xidian University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "RaNct2xkyI/podcast.wav"}
