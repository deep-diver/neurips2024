In practice, the adversarial attacks based on VIReID aim to disrupt output ranking and quantify the security risks of models. Although numerous studies have been emerged on adversarial attacks and defenses in fields such as face recognition, person re-identification, and pedestrian detection, there is currently a lack of research on the security of VIReID systems. To this end, we propose to explore the vulnerabilities of VIReID systems and prevent potential serious losses due to insecurity. Compared to research on single-modality ReID, adversarial feature alignment and modality differences need to be particularly emphasized. Thus, we advocate for feature-level adversarial attacks to disrupt the output rankings of VIReID systems. To obtain adversarial features, we introduce Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to simulate common disturbances in real-world environments. Additionally, we employ a Frequency-Spatial Attention Module (FSAM), integrating frequency information extraction and spatial focusing mechanisms, and further emphasize important regional features from different domains on the shared features. This ensures that adversarial features maintain consistency within the feature space. Finally, we employ an Auxiliary Quadruple Adversarial Loss to amplify the differences between modalities, thereby improving the distinction and recognition of features between visible and infrared images, which cause the system to output incorrect rankings. Extensive experiments on two VIReID benchmarks (i.e., SYSU-MM01, RegDB) and different systems validate the effectiveness of our method.

The credibility and stability of VIReID are crucial in such special application scenarios. However, there is currently insufficient theoretical research on the security of VIReID.

Adversarial attacks based on ReID focus on crafting adversarial samples suitable for visible images and disrupting internal rankings. In contrast, VIReID requires more consideration regarding the generalizability of attack methods under different imaging mechanisms and how to align adversarial features between infrared and visible images. Moreover, dealing with two modalities necessitates comparing distances between modalities and within modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a feature-level adversarial attacks and ranking disruption for VIReID. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "First, we adopt the method of universal adversarial perturbation (UAP)[11] to generate adversarial samples, which seeks a set of universal perturbations independent of the image and can generalize well in deep neural networks. At the same time, it significantly lowers the threshold for implementing adversarial attacks and adapts to different systems. Secondly, to make visible and infrared images more consistent in the feature space, we propose a frequency-spatial attention module, achieving adversarial feature alignment by unifying frequency and spatial features. Visible and infrared images are generated under different imaging conditions; the former provides rich texture information, while the latter contains significant pixel amplitude information. This module uses fast Fourier transform to decompose features into amplitude and phase, corresponding to the texture details and spatial position information of images, respectively. Since these features are closely related to the spatial domain, a spatial attention module is chosen for these two components to further emphasize or suppress different regions in the feature map. Additionally, a weighted spatial attention module is applied to the shared features to maintain consistency in the feature space. This method not only focuses on the frequency domain features of visible and infrared images from different imaging conditions but also emphasizes their spatial features for significant pedestrian poses, thereby achieving adversarial feature alignment. To disrupt the ranking of identification results, we propose an auxiliary quadruple adversarial loss function. The visible and infrared pedestrian features extracted by the first-stage model are used as auxiliary features in the calculation process of the features loss function extracted in the second stage. By pulling the distance between the same modality and the same person closer and pushing the distance between different modalities and the same person farther, while also ensuring that the intra-class distance is smaller than the inter-class distance, the differences between modalities are expanded and the ranking under different modalities is disrupted. By utilizing generated features containing multiple types of information, the network\u2019s ability to explore features at different levels is enhanced.

VIReID [12\u201315]refers to the technique of identifying and matching pedestrians from one modality to another using visible or infrared images. Moreover, VIReID finds wide application in the field of security, enhancing the intelligence level of security systems. The significant differences between different modalities make VIReID challenging. To alleviate the modality discrepancy at the feature level, some methods adopt single-stream, dual-stream, or multi-stream networks[16\u201319], extracting shared features from different modalities by designing various attention mechanisms and loss functions[20\u201323]. Ye et al.[16] proposed the concept of metric learning, jointly optimizing modality-specific and modality-shared matrices. Subsequently, Zhu et al.[18] proposed a hetero-center loss, which for the first time shortens the distance between feature centers of the same identity, bridging the gap between features of the same pedestrian across different modalities. In addition, Ling et al.[24] devised a multi-constraint similarity learning approach to comprehensively explore the relationships between cross-modal information. Meanwhile, as the posture and shape of pedestrians provide important information in the recognition process, these methods mainly focus on spatially enhancing feature representation. However, there are also differences in frequency information between visible and infrared images.

Many studies have revealed the vulnerability of deep models to carefully crafted small perturbation, resulting in significant errors with high confidence in predictions. Adversarial attacks aim to explore adversarial noise that causes deep learning models to behave abnormally. FGSM[30] belongs to the single-step attack algorithm, which optimizes the loss by quickly determining the direction of perturbation for input samples and calculates the adversarial perturbation through backpropagation. The concept of iterative thinking was subsequently incorporated into FGSM, thereby leading to the development of Projected Gradient Descent [31] (PGD). Subsequently, adversarial attacks on ReID were also studied, with the core idea of generating well-crafted adversarial examples or disturbing ranking results. LTA[32] used local grayscale iteration to generate adversarial examples, mainly focusing on disturbing the color of the original image.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
