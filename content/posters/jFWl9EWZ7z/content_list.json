Specifically, they leverage both 3D features from the point cloud, and 2D features extracted from renderings of the detected objects at fixed camera poses. These object features along with the text embedding are passed into a Transformer to make the final prediction.

Excessive proposals may increase complexity and lead to redundant computations while sparse proposals may miss critical information in the scene.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
