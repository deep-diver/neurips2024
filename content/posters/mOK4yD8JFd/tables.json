The comparisons involve our framework, the state-of-the-art polarized image low-light enhancement method PLIE [32] and its improved version PLIE+, the only existing polarized image deblurring method PolDeblur [33] and its improved version PolDeblur+, and four learning-based image enhancement methods designed for conventional images that also fuse noisy and blurry pairs (LSD2 [17], LSFNet [2], SelfIR [27], and D2HNet [28]).", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed framework's performance against several state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data.  The metrics used are PSNR and SSIM for the Degree of Polarization (DoP), Angle of Polarization (AoP), and total intensity (S0).  The comparison includes methods specifically designed for polarized images (PLIE, PolDeblur) and their enhanced versions, as well as general-purpose image enhancement methods that handle noisy and blurry image pairs (LSD2, LSFNet, SelfIR, D2HNet).", "section": "5.1 Evaluation on synthetic data"}, {"figure_path": "mOK4yD8JFd/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative evaluation results of ablation study.", "description": "This table presents the quantitative results of an ablation study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.  It compares the complete framework's performance (in terms of PSNR and SSIM for DoP, AoP, and total intensity) against variations where specific modules or phases are removed or replaced.  The variations include removing the color and structure cue fusion (CSCF), coherence-aware aggregation (CAG), coherence injection (CI) modules, and the Cartesian coordinate representation.  It also shows the impact of removing the artifact suppression phase. The results demonstrate the importance of each component in achieving the overall performance of the proposed framework.", "section": "5.3 Ablation study"}]
