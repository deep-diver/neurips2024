In practice, the DoP and AoP cannot be captured directly, but are usually calculated from polarized snapshots1in an indirect manner. However, since a polarizer would block part of the light, selecting an appropriate exposure time could be challenging, making the captured polarized snapshots often degrade [15, 33]. As shown in Fig. 1 (left), setting a short exposure time would result in a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making the DoP and AoP severely degenerated; while if setting a relatively long exposure time to increase the SNR, motion blur is more likely to occur, making the DoP and AoP over-smoothed, as shown in Fig. 1 (middle). To deal with the above issues, several methods have been proposed to handle the low-light noise [10, 25, 15, 32] or motion blur [33] in the polarized images. Since these methods can work in a polarization-aware manner (i.e., they explicitly take the preservation of polarization properties into consideration), they usually demonstrate higher performance compared with the corresponding methods designed for conventional images [3, 29, 14, 23].

First, we show the effectiveness of the first phase by substituting it with a learning-based image enhancement methods designed for conventional images (LSD2 [17] as Phase1). The reason why we choose LSD2 [17] is that it outperforms other similar methods (LSFNet [2], SelfIR [27], and D2HNet [28]) in restoring $\\mathbf{S}_{0}$ (see Tab. 1). We can see that the performance becomes inferior since our first phase can make full use of the color and structure cues encoded in the Stokes parameters while LSD2 [17] cannot. Then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed CSCF modules in the first phase (W/o CSCF) by substituting them with vanilla convolution layers. We can see that the performance degenerates since the CSCF modules are more suitable for addressing the issues of erroneous global tone and less salient local structure in the feature space. Similarly, we also show the effectiveness of the proposed CAG module and CI modules in the second phase (W/o CAG and W/o CI). We can see that the CAG module can facilitate the establishment of the physical correlation between the polarized images, and the CI modules can offer better optimization to the values of the DoP and AoP. Besides, we demonstrate the advantage of reconstructing the DoP and AoP in a Cartesian coordinate representation (W/o Cartesian) by directly reconstructing their values. We can see that the performance degraded severely due to the non-linearity. Finally, we verify the necessity of the third phase used for refinement (W/o refinement) by removing it.

The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
