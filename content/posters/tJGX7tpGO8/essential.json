Existing methods try to alleviate forgetting but lack a clear understanding of what's crucial to preserve.  This paper argues that existing methods suffer from substantial semantic and structural shifts, hindering performance.\nThe proposed solution, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP), directly addresses these issues. **GSIP preserves low-frequency information** (aligning old and new node representations) and **high-frequency information** (mimicking old node similarity patterns) to calibrate these shifts. Experiments show GSIP significantly reduces forgetting (up to 10% improvement) compared to existing approaches across several large datasets.  **It's also seamlessly compatible with existing replay methods**.", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "tJGX7tpGO8/podcast.wav"}
