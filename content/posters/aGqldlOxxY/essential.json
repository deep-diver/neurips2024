The need for an efficient, unbiased, and scalable alternative is clear.  Many researchers have tried to address this by utilizing self-supervised learning techniques in unsupervised image segmentation, but existing methods have limitations in capturing the fine-grained and multi-granular details of images. \n\nThis paper introduces UnSAM, an unsupervised image segmentation method that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. This approach first partitions an image into segments, then iteratively merges them to create a hierarchical structure. These unsupervised multi-granular masks are used to train the model.  UnSAM significantly surpasses previous unsupervised methods and produces results comparable to supervised SAM.  Furthermore, integrating UnSAM's pseudo masks with existing supervised models improves their accuracy, highlighting the benefits of a synergistic training approach.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "aGqldlOxxY/podcast.wav"}
