With the increasing popularity of quad-Bayer pattern in mainstream smartphone cameras for capturing high-resolution videos, mobile photography has become more accessible to a wider audience. However, existing color video SCI reconstruction algorithms are designed based on the traditional Bayer pattern. When applied to videos captured by quad-Bayer cameras, these algorithms often result in color distortion and ineffective demosaicing, rendering them impractical for primary equipment. To address this challenge, we propose the MambaSCI method, which leverages the Mamba and UNet architectures for efficient reconstruction of quad-Bayer patterned color video SCI. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first algorithm for quad-Bayer patterned SCI reconstruction, and also the initial application of the Mamba model to this task. Specifically, we customize Residual-Mamba-Blocks, which residually connect the Spatial-Temporal Mamba (STMamba), Edge-Detail-Reconstruction (EDR) module, and Channel Attention (CA) module. Respectively, STMamba is used to model long-range spatial-temporal dependencies with linear complexity, EDR is for better edge-detail reconstruction, and CA is used to compensate for the missing channel information interaction in Mamba model.

Unlike the traditional RGGB Bayer CFA pattern, the quad-Bayer pattern expands each pixel into four sub-pixels and arranges them periodically [4, 5], as depicted in Fig. 1(a). This arrangement allows for larger pixels by combining neighboring pixels of the same color, resulting in more light intake compared to the Bayer pattern. Consequently, quad-Bayer sensors offer enhanced sensitivity and resolution for imaging tasks [6, 7, 8]. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), quad-Bayer technology effectively mitigates resolution loss and enables the capture of low-noise photos in low-light environments. In summary, quad-Bayer sensors provide HDR capability [9] and improved color accuracy [10] while effectively mitigating resolution loss and capturing low-noise photos in low-light environments.

Subsequently, in the decoding stage, the desired high-speed color video is reconstructed from the acquired measurements and predefined masks.

However, our observation reveals that existing methods struggle to effectively reconstruct videos based on quad-Bayer patterns, often resulting in artifacts, color distortions, and incomplete demosaicing. This ineffectiveness poses a challenge for processing videos captured by smartphone cameras. Thus, in this paper, we aim to break through these challenges and introduce the first quad-Bayer-based color video SCI reconstruction method, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "When incorporating quad-Bayer in color video SCI reconstruction tasks, two challenges arise. One is how to efficiently manage quad-Bayer color video processing with reduced computational complexity. Current color video SCI reconstruction methods encompass model-based [13, 18, 19], iteration-based [14, 15], and End-to-End (E2E) approaches [20, 21]. However, model-based and iterative methods necessitate corresponding demosaicing models [6, 22, 23, 24], which have not been extensively explored for quad-Bayer fields regarding performance and model size trade-offs, leading to suboptimal reconstruction outcomes and inefficiencies. On the other hand, existing E2E methods, primarily transformer-based [17] and hybrid CNN-transformer [16] approaches, typically require significant parameters and computational resources, making it difficult to process long video sequences effectively. The high computational demands of transformers and the absence of a global attention mechanism in CNNs hinder their scalability to modern, lightweight architectures. Leveraging the advancements in State Space Models (SSMs) [25, 26, 27], modern SSMs like Mamba [28] have demonstrated the ability to effectively capture long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity relative to the input size. Furthermore, numerous experiments have illustrated that image-based Mamba [29, 30] achieves promising results and can match the performance of existing transformer [31, 32, 33] and CNN [34, 35, 36] models with smaller parameters. Therefore, we focus on exploring the multi-scale reconstruction capabilities of Mamba-UNet for quad-Bayer processing. This approach aims to create a lightweight design suitable for deployment on mobile devices. By leveraging the Mamba-UNet framework [37, 38, 39, 40], we can reduce parameters and FLOPS while still achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The Residual-Mamba-Block further enhances long-range spatiotemporal dependence by leveraging residual connections and learning scales. STMamba replaces the self-attention module by performing parallel scanning of spatial and temporal dimensions, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and enabling visual reconstruction of videos in a more lightweight manner. The EDR module enhances boundary sharpness perception and restores edge details lost due to compression and motion artifacts. By combining linear transformation with DWConv features, it integrates both local and global information. This approach strengthens the global features extracted by STMamba, fusing them with local details to more effectively capture complex edge structures.
