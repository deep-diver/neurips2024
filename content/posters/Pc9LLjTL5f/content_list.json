To align with our methodology from synthetic data analysis, tie outcomes have been excluded from this analysis to focus specifically on the implications of win-loss dynamics. We select pairs of models (A vs. B) from the initial dataset that feature at least 300 non-tie comparisons. This threshold ensures statistical robustness and allows us to include cases where win rates are closely contested, which can lead to more sensitive ratings. These pairs predominantly involve models from the GPT-4 family [42] and the Claude family [1]. A comprehensive list of model pairs is included in Appendix C under Table 3, and a subset discussed here is shown in Table 2. The recorded win rates primarily exhibit skewed preferences, with the exception of the GPT-4-0314 vs. GPT-4-0613 pairing, indicating comparable performance levels (see Table 2). Given the variable number of evaluations per pair in the original dataset, we standardize this by sampling a fixed number, $N_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ , for each pair to align with the controlled conditions used in synthetic analyses. When sampling to $N_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ , we ensure that the resulting win rates accurately represent the original dataset\u2019s findings, providing a faithful evaluation of recorded model performance. This standardization facilitates a more reliable comparison and assessment of the Elo rating system under real-world conditions. In line with our previous analyses, we continue to explore the influence of variations in $N_{\\mathrm{perms}}=\\{1,100,10000\\}$ and the $K$ -factor (ranging from 1 to 36) on Elo score robustness and reliability.

In cases where the models show a clear difference in performance as indicated by their win rates, such as in the Claude-1 vs. Claude-2.1 experiment, Elo ratings remain notably consistent across different $K$ -factors and $N_{\\mathrm{perms}}$ configurations (see Figure 4a). On the other hand, in cases like the GPT-4-0314 vs. GPT-4-0613 experiment where win rates are closely matched, the Elo rating system exhibits higher volatility at $N_{\\mathrm{perms}}=1$ but gains stability with larger $N_{\\mathrm{perms}}$ settings (100 and 10000), especially at lower $K$ -factors (see Figure 4b). The magnitude of Elo score differences in these experiments illustrates that larger $K$ -factor and $N_{\\mathrm{perms}}$ values can amplify or reduce the perceived performance gap between models, reflecting the critical role of these parameters in evaluation sensitivity.

There is also ongoing research into the efficacy of these systems in diverse and dynamic environments [11, 7]. Prior work has demonstrated some limitations of Elo in maintaining transitivity, especially in non-transitive cyclic games such as rock-paper-scissors and StarCraft II [7, 52].
