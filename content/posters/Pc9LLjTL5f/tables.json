Four different scenarios were set up, each with three models (A, B, C) and varying win probabilities. The table shows the Elo scores for each model under different conditions (N=1, K=1; N=100, K=1; N=1, K=16; N=100, K=16), where N represents the number of permutations of comparisons and K is the K-factor in the Elo algorithm.  The star (*) indicates scenarios where Elo failed to produce a transitive ranking; \u2248 denotes scenarios where the models have similar performances, and \u226b indicates clear differences in model performance.", "section": "5.3 Transitive Properties of Elo Scores"}, {"figure_path": "Pc9LLjTL5f/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Win rates per evaluated model across selected paired comparison experiments.", "description": "This table shows the win rates for different pairs of language models in selected paired comparison experiments.
