They play dominant roles in NLP [5, 37] and multimodal applications [50, 17] ascribed to the large-scale pre-training data [2, 35, 29]. Unfortunately, these data may contain overlooked elements of personal privacy and copyright infringement, posing potential risks of data leakage [32, 36]. Retraining the models from scratch to exclude the risky data is a waste of resource and practically untenable due to the inaccessible pre-training data. To address the issue, prior works [12, 46, 45, 27, 31] have shown that approximate machine unlearning (MU) methods can forget specific pieces of knowledge embedded within LLMs. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Nevertheless, it remains unclear if such strategies of knowledge forgetting are transferable to MLLMs, especially for forgetting the visual recognition of various concepts. The challenge of unlearning visual recognition in MLLMs is formidable. A primary obstacle is limited training data. Recent work [12] utilizes a text of original book (2.1M tokens) combined with synthetic sentences (1M tokens) as the forgetting dataset. To forget the character \u2018Harry Potter\u2019, this work fine-tunes Llama-7b-chat-hf [41] on the entire forgetting dataset for 3 epochs. However, in the real scenario of unlearning the visual recognition of concepts, collecting sufficient images of targeted concepts is challenging. The limited amount of training data poses a significant barrier to unlearning all concept-wise visual knowledge encoded in pre-trained MLLMs. Another challenge is model degradation [52, 19], which pervasively exists in large generative models. Researchers [46] discover that LLMs could stop generating harmful texts by employing Gradient Ascent (GA) on forgetting datasets, thus reducing the need for synthetic data. However, GA often results in meaningless outputs such as only a whitespace or repeated tokens, which eliminate the utility of LLMs. To address this issue, several studies [45, 46] combine GA with minimizing KL-divergence between unlearned and original LLMs to preserve the utility of LLMs. Despite mitigating the meaningless response problem, the method may output self-contradictory answers, as if the concept is not unlearned. This issue may arise from a conflict between objectives of GA and KL-divergence. GA aims to make LLMs cease generating tokens of targeted unlearning concepts, whereas KL-divergence seeks to align the output probability distribution of the unlearning model with that of the original model. The distribution includes the probabilities of generating tokens of targeted unlearning concepts, which are high in the original model.

In accordance with these four targets, we construct the fine-tuning data. Moreover, we introduce an innovative Dual Masked KL-divergence (DMK) Loss to be jointly trained with Cross Entropy Loss.

The experimental results in Table 1 present a comprehensive evaluation of various methods for machine unlearning in MLLMs. The observations are as follows: (i) Efficacy across all methods is at $100\\%$ , which indicates that each method is equally capable of unlearning the seen examples and aligning well with the objectives of machine unlearning. (ii) GA shows an outstanding performance in G-Eval with 1.8 score. However, this high score in generality is a result of GA\u2019s method always outputting whitespace or repeated tokens. SIU also performs a high Generality with $99.0\\%$ EM score, showcasing its effectiveness at extending unlearning to unseen data. (iii) GA performs 9.0 in Specificity score, indicating that there\u2019s a strong impact on the model\u2019s knowledge base. SIU achieves a reasonable balance, with a score of 60.7, illustrating that it maintains a good level of model performance on non-targeted tasks. (iv) Fluency is where the GA method notably fails, with a score of 373.6. In contrast, SIU\u2019s fluency score of 61.2 suggests that it manages to retain coherent language outputs post-unlearning. (v) The PO method seems to have maintained a degree of diversity, as indicated by a moderate score. $\\operatorname{GA+KL}$ shows a limited score of 48.0 in Diversity. GA\u2019s score is essentially at rock bottom (6.3), due to its most responses of whitespace or repeated tokens. SIU performs admirably with a score of 97.0, indicating its maintenance in generating diverse responses post-unlearning. (vi) As the model size increases from 7B to 13B, there is a noticeable decline in the effectiveness of non-SIU methods in Generality. For example, the EM score for GA falls from $36.3\\%$ to $24.7\\%$ , and both PO and $\\operatorname{GA+KL}$ experience severe drops in their generality scores. This sharp decline highlights a critical vulnerability in these methods due to the change in model size. (vii) SIU shows a relatively minor decline in generality (from $99\\%$ to $90\\%$ EM) when scaling up from the 7B to the 13B model. This slight reduction indicates that SIU is more adaptable and stable. (viii) Across all methods, there is an observed improvement in specificity, fluency, and diversity from the 7B to the 13B models. This enhancement suggests a trade-off between the effectiveness of unlearning and the preservation of model utility. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Ablation Study of DMK Loss.

Moreover, the $\\mathcal{C}$ -Dis also goes down if SIU is not equipped with Token-Level Masking or Vocabulary-Level Masking. The results show that The two levels of masking could both improve the generality of unlearning and reduce the probability of generating tokens of $\\mathcal{C}$ .

In contrast, other methods like GA and PO show significant variability with increased fine-tuning steps. For instance, GA\u2019s performance in Specificity and Fluency metrics tends to degrade seriously as the number of steps increases. Compared with the 7B model, the 13B model shows a slower adaptation speed. The 7B model displays a rapid increase in EM scores, reaching near-maximum values by step 10 across most methods. The 13B model shows a slower increase in EM scores over steps. PO method exhibits nearly constant values as steps increase in $\\mathcal{C}$ -Dis, regardless of the model size (both 7B and 13B).

However, his wife Melania is also misidentified by $\\mathcal{M}_{\\widehat{\\theta}}$ . At first, we assume that our unlearning method causes the model to lose the ability to identify some other concepts. Further examination reveals an additional layer to this phenomenon.

This discovery points to a fascinating aspect of machine unlearning: the selective retention of knowledge. The reason of this observation might be that the model\u2019s failure to identify the central male figure as Trump in the original image leads to an inference that the adjacent female could not be Melania. These positive butterfly effects suggest that unlearning is not a blunt tool that erases all traces of a concept but rather can result in a refined restructuring of knowledge within the model.

While the standard KL-divergence loss function is effective in maintaining the overall utility of MLLMs, it can inadvertently introduce logical inconsistencies when applied to unlearning. The essence of the problem with using traditional KL-divergence for unlearning stems from its tendency to pull the probability distribution of tokens related to $\\mathcal{C}$ closer to the distribution of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}$ . This is contradictory to the goal of unlearning, where the aim is to suppress the MLLMs\u2019 ability to recall $\\mathcal{C}$ . For example, considering the training phase, the input is the training image of $\\mathcal{C}$ and the prompt \u2018What\u2019s the name of the central figure in this photograph?\u2019. When MLLMs predict the next token and encounter the phrase \u2018This is\u2019, the token \u2018Donald Trump\u2019 should ideally have a reduced probability in the token distribution. However, since \u2018Donald Trump\u2019 might have a high probability in $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}$ , standard KL divergence would work against the unlearning goal by increasing the likelihood of MLLMs predicting \u2018Donald Trump\u2019 after \u2018This is\u2019. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Table 5 further illustrates the motivation of DMK Loss. We utilize pre-trained LLAVA to generate the next-token probability distribution. The colored data shows relatively high probabilities for the token \u2018Donald\u2019 and \u2018Trump\u2019. For the red colored data token $w_{t}$ after \u2018President\u2019, we could formulate the probability distribution as $P(w_{t})=P_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}}(w_{t}|\\mathcal{T}_{i},T h e$ , picture, features, President). It could be found that the probability of \u2018Donald\u2019 plus that of \u2018Trump\u2019 is near to 1, which indicates the probability of $\\mathcal{C}$ would be extremely high after the token \u2018President\u2019. Directly minimizing the KLdivergence between $\\mathcal{M}_{\\widehat{\\theta}}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}$ on the red colored tokens would cause unlearned model output higher probability of $\\mathcal{C}$ , which is contrary to the objective of machine unlearning. Thus, in TokenLevel Masking we mask the whole distribution to those tokens where the probability of $\\mathcal{C}$ -related tokens is extremely high. For the orange colored tokens (the token of the beginning and the token after \u2018features\u2019), while the max probability is other token, the probability of \u2018Donald\u2019 and \u2018Trump\u2019 is also high. It would also improve the probability of generating $\\mathcal{C}$ if directly employing KL-divergence. To this end, we apply the vocabulary-level masks to the tokens of \u2018Donald\u2019 and \u2018Trump\u2019 in the vocabulary. As to the reason why we do not apply vocabulary-level mask to the red colored tokens, the probability of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}$ generating other tokens is remarkably low on the red colored tokens. If only mask the tokens of \u2018Donald\u2019 and \u2018Trump\u2019 in the vocabulary, the probability of generating other tokens would also be seriously reduced for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\widehat{\\theta}}$ due to KL-divergence loss, which harms the utility of MLLMs. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Table 5: Token probabilities of pre-trained LLAVA given the image of Donald Trump and the prompt \u2018who is in the picture?\u2019.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
