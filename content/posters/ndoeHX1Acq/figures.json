These models are jointly training on the indoor datasets SUN RGB-D (SUN), ScanNet, and outdoor datasets KITTI, nuScenes (nuS). We also evaluate the cross-domain performance on the indoor S3DIS and outdoor Waymo datasets. The center of the circle means that the corresponding metric is less than 10%, and the outermost means 90%. Existing indoor detectors are plotted in red, outdoor detectors are in green, and detectors that aim for different scenes are in orange. Our model has the remarkable capacity to generalize across a wide range of diverse 3D scenes (a larger polygon area) with only one set of parameters and the same architecture.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of OneDet3D against 10 other 3D object detectors across multiple datasets (SUN RGB-D, ScanNet, KITTI, nuScenes, S3DIS, and Waymo).
