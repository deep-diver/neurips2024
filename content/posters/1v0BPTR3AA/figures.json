The three axes represent age, physiological indicators/biochemical markers, and risk scores (the output). The colored area represents the combinations of input features observed in the training data.

This tensor serves as an instance of f* in Assumption 4-(II), with the transform M represented by the DCT operation.", "description": "This figure shows how the singular values decay at different rates across the 5 frequency components (after DCT transformation) of the Akiyo video data. Each line represents the decay of a different frequency component of the tensor, where the tensor represents the embeddings of the ground truth function. This illustrates the varying spectral decay properties mentioned in Assumption 4-(II), which is crucial to the paper's theoretical analysis under combinatorial distribution shift. The different decay rates across different frequency components highlight the importance of using specific hypothesis classes to better capture the varying spectral decay patterns in the proposed ERM-DS algorithm.", "section": "3 An Ft-SVD-based Framework For Multi-output Regression under CDS"}, {"figure_path": "1v0BPTR3AA/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An illustration of the varying rates of spectral decay across different frequency components following Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
