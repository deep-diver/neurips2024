It categorizes algorithms based on whether they assume a known or unknown causal graph and whether they use hard/do interventions or soft interventions.  The regret bounds are expressed using Big-O notation, showing the scaling with respect to key parameters such as the number of interactions (T), the number of arms (K), the maximum in-degree of the graph (d), and the maximum causal path length (L). A checkmark indicates whether the algorithm is scalable. The lower bounds provide theoretical limits on the achievable regret.  The table highlights the contribution of the paper, GA-LCB, which achieves near-optimal regret bounds for the most general setting of an unknown graph and soft interventions.", "section": "1 Motivation & Overview"}]
