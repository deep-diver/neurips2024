This often leads to \"plasticity loss,\" where the model struggles to adapt to new data, hindering performance.  Existing methods, such as hard resets, can be inefficient as they discard useful information.\nThis paper introduces Soft Resets, a novel learning method that addresses plasticity loss by modeling non-stationarity using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with an adaptive drift.  This drift mechanism gently nudges the model's parameters toward their initial state, acting as a soft reset.  **Experiments demonstrate that Soft Resets significantly improves performance in non-stationary settings**, outperforming baselines across various tasks including continual learning and reinforcement learning benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fDiZJ7mmOV/podcast.wav"}
