### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional neural network training assumes stationary data, but many real-world scenarios involve non-stationary data distributions (e.g., continual learning, reinforcement learning). This often leads to "plasticity loss," where the model struggles to adapt to new data, hindering performance.  Existing methods, such as hard resets, can be inefficient as they discard useful information.

This paper introduces Soft Resets, a novel learning method that addresses plasticity loss by modeling non-stationarity using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with an adaptive drift.  This drift mechanism gently nudges the model's parameters toward their initial state, acting as a soft reset.  **Experiments demonstrate that Soft Resets significantly improves performance in non-stationary settings**, outperforming baselines across various tasks including continual learning and reinforcement learning benchmarks.

The left side shows the graphical models for the data generating process under stationary (a) and non-stationary (b) assumptions. The right side illustrates how the Bayesian posterior evolves under different scenarios. In the stationary case (c), the posterior concentrates around the optimal parameters. In the non-stationary case without a dynamical model (d), the posterior adapts slowly to sudden changes in optimal parameters.  However, by incorporating a drift model (e), the posterior is softly reset, allowing for faster adaptation to changes.

### In-depth insights


#### Soft Reset Mechanism
The proposed 'Soft Reset Mechanism' offers a novel approach to address the challenge of plasticity loss in neural networks trained on non-stationary data.  Unlike traditional hard resets that abruptly discard learned parameters, this method introduces a **soft, gradual shift of network parameters towards their initial values**, controlled by a learned drift parameter. This drift, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, dynamically adjusts the extent of the reset based on the perceived non-stationarity in the data. The mechanism effectively balances retaining valuable learned information with enabling adaptation to new data distributions. The **adaptive nature** of the soft reset, learning its parameters online, makes it particularly robust, and unlike methods requiring predefined schedules or heuristics for resets, this method automatically adapts to varying levels of non-stationarity.  A key advantage is the implicit increase in effective learning rate that the soft reset engenders, facilitating quicker adaptation to shifts. Overall, the soft reset represents a significant advancement in continual learning, offering a more elegant and efficient solution to preserving plasticity and improving the robustness of neural networks in the face of non-stationary data.

#### Non-Stationary Learning
Non-stationary learning tackles the challenge of training machine learning models on data whose underlying distribution changes over time. This is in contrast to traditional methods that assume a stationary distribution.  **The core issue is that models trained on a stationary distribution often fail to adapt effectively when the data distribution shifts.**  This paper addresses this by introducing a novel method that leverages an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to model the adaptation to non-stationarity, incorporating soft parameter resets. This approach contrasts sharply with hard resets, which discard valuable learned parameters. The adaptive drift parameter dynamically adjusts the influence of the initialization distribution, striking a balance between maintaining plasticity and adapting to the new data.  The proposed methods are empirically evaluated in both supervised and reinforcement learning scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and the prevention of catastrophic forgetting.  **A key contribution is the online estimation of the drift parameter, allowing the model to dynamically adjust to different levels of non-stationarity.**  While the focus is on neural networks, the underlying principles of soft resets and adaptive drift parameters may find wider applications in various machine learning contexts dealing with evolving data distributions.

#### Drift Model Estimation
Estimating the drift model is crucial for adapting to non-stationary data distributions.  The authors propose using a predictive likelihood approach, selecting the prior distribution that best explains future data.  This involves an approximate online variational inference method with Bayesian neural networks, updating the posterior distribution over NN parameters using the drift model. **The drift is explicitly modeled using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, with an adaptive drift parameter (Œ≥t) that controls the rate of movement toward the initialization distribution**. The estimation process uses a gradient-based approach, optimizing predictive likelihood via gradient descent and the reparameterization trick.  **The adaptive nature of Œ≥t is key, allowing the model to react appropriately to different levels of non-stationarity.**  Online estimation is computationally efficient, crucial for real-time adaptation in non-stationary environments.  The method is further enhanced by exploring shared parameters for improved stability and reducing model complexity.

#### Plasticity Benchmarks
Plasticity benchmarks in the context of non-stationary learning for neural networks are crucial for evaluating a model's ability to adapt to changing data distributions without catastrophic forgetting.  These benchmarks typically involve a sequence of learning tasks, where the model is trained on each task consecutively.  **Performance is then measured on how well the model retains knowledge from previous tasks while learning new ones**.  Key aspects to consider are the type of task transitions (abrupt vs. gradual), the similarity between tasks, and the data efficiency of the approach.  **A good benchmark should reveal whether a model can retain learned knowledge and adapt quickly to new information, or if it suffers from catastrophic forgetting**.  It is vital to choose benchmarks that reflect the intended application scenarios, as the performance on a specific benchmark is not necessarily generalizable across all non-stationary settings. **Analyzing performance across different plasticity benchmarks allows for a more robust assessment of a model's generalization abilities and resilience to non-stationarity.** The metrics chosen for evaluation, such as accuracy, loss, and forgetting rates, need to be carefully selected to highlight the specific aspects of plasticity being measured. This multifaceted approach is vital for the advancement of continual learning and the development of robust, adaptable neural network models.

#### RL Experiments
The RL experiments section would detail the application of the proposed soft parameter reset method within reinforcement learning (RL) environments.  It would likely involve comparing the method against standard RL algorithms (like SAC or PPO) and other approaches that address plasticity loss. **Key aspects** would include the RL environments used (e.g., continuous control tasks in MuJoCo or similar), the performance metrics (such as cumulative reward or average episodic return), and the analysis of results considering factors like the level of off-policy data, task switching frequency, and the impact of hyperparameters.  The experimental design should include sufficient control groups and rigorous statistical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. **Success** would be indicated by a significant improvement in performance compared to baselines, particularly in non-stationary or continual learning scenarios.  The discussion would likely involve explaining the observed behaviors, examining the role of the drift parameter in adapting to non-stationarity and detailing the computational costs and scalability of the method.  **Failure** to meet these criteria would necessitate further investigation into reasons for underperformance, such as limitations in the drift model or inherent challenges in applying soft resets to the chosen RL problem.

Each benchmark involves a sequence of learning tasks where the data distribution changes between tasks. The left panel shows the performance on the permuted MNIST dataset, the center panel shows performance on a data-efficient version of random-label MNIST, and the right panel shows performance on a memorization version of random-label CIFAR-10.  The x-axis shows the task ID, indicating the order in which tasks were presented. The y-axis shows the per-task training accuracy, representing the model's performance on each task.  The figure demonstrates the effectiveness of the Soft Reset methods in maintaining plasticity across multiple tasks, outperforming baseline methods in preventing catastrophic forgetting.

> üîº This figure illustrates the data generating process in both stationary and non-stationary scenarios, highlighting the benefits of the proposed drift model in handling non-stationarity. The left side shows the graphical models for both cases, comparing i.i.d and non-i.i.d assumptions.  The right side provides a visual representation of Bayesian posterior updates under these scenarios and how the drift model improves efficiency and speed in adapting to changes.

> Figure 1: Left: graphical model for data generating process in the (a) stationary case and (b) non-stationary case with drift model p(Œ∏t+1|Œ∏t, Yt). Right: (c) In a stationary online learning regime, the Bayesian posterior (red dashed circles) in the long run will concentrate around Œ∏* (red dot). (d) In a non-stationary regime where the optimal parameters suddenly change from current value Œ∏ to new value Œ∏t+1 (blue dot) online Bayesian estimation can be less data efficient and take time to recover when the change-point occurs. (e) The use of p(Œ∏|Œ∏t, Œ≥t) and the estimation of Œ≥t allows to increase the uncertainty, by soft resetting the posterior to make it closer to the prior (green dashed circle), so that the updated Bayesian posterior pt+1(Œ∏) (blue dashed circle) can faster track Œ∏t+1.

> üîº This figure shows the impact of using a specific initialization (Œ∏0) in the prior distribution (p0(Œ∏)) for the Soft Reset algorithm. Two variants of Soft Reset are compared: one where the prior's mean is set to a specific initialization (Œ∏0), and another where the prior's mean is set to 0. The y-axis shows the average task accuracy across multiple tasks, with error bars representing the standard deviation across 3 random seeds. The results show similar performance for both variants, suggesting that the choice of initialization in the prior may not be as crucial for the Soft Reset algorithm's performance.

> üîº This figure shows a comparison of different SGD approaches for tracking a non-stationary mean in a toy problem.  The true mean switches between -2 and 2 every 50 timesteps. The figure compares standard SGD with two different learning rates (0.05 and 0.15) against SGD methods that include parameter resets at the switch points with different reset learning rates. The results illustrate how parameter resets with appropriate learning rate scheduling can significantly improve adaptation to non-stationarity, allowing for faster convergence to the new mean compared to standard SGD.

> üîº This table compares the computational cost and memory requirements of different methods for non-stationary learning.  The methods include standard SGD, Soft Resets with different parameterizations (per layer and per parameter), Soft Resets with proximal updates (with different iterations), and Bayesian Soft Reset with proximal updates.  The computational cost is given in Big O notation, considering the number of parameters (P), layers (L), SGD backward passes (S), Monte Carlo samples for drift parameter (My), Monte Carlo samples for parameter updates (Me), number of updates for drift parameters (Ky), and number of NN parameter updates (Ke).  The memory requirements are also expressed in Big O notation.
