However, a significant challenge is 'reward hacking,' where models exploit unintended features in the reward model (RM) to maximize rewards, diverging from actual human preferences.  Existing solutions often focus on increasing RM complexity or adding constraints, which may not fully address the underlying issue of reward misgeneralization. \nThis paper introduces InfoRM, a novel information-theoretic reward modeling framework that addresses reward misgeneralization directly. InfoRM uses a variational information bottleneck to filter out irrelevant information from the RM's latent representation, thus focusing on features aligned with human preferences.  Furthermore, it identifies a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the latent space, leading to the development of a new detection metric called the Cluster Separation Index (CSI). Experiments demonstrate InfoRM's effectiveness in mitigating reward hacking and the robustness of CSI across various datasets and RM scales. InfoRM represents a significant advancement in RLHF, offering both improved model performance and a practical tool for online overoptimization detection.", "affiliation": "Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "3XnBVK9sD6/podcast.wav"}
