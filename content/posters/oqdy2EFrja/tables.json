The metrics used for comparison include QAlign scores (img-quality, img-aesthetic, vid-quality, vid-aesthetic), which measure the visual quality and aesthetics of both images and videos, and CLIP score, which assesses the alignment between the generated content and textual prompts. Higher scores indicate better performance.  The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both visual quality and alignment with the text prompts.", "section": "5.1 Comparison with Competitors"}, {"figure_path": "oqdy2EFrja/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantative comparisons of ablation studies on trajectory estimation with multi-modal LLM.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for trajectory estimation using a multi-modal large language model (LLM).  It compares four approaches: Direct Estimation, Estimation using bounding box, Step-by-step estimation, and the authors' proposed method (Ours). The metrics used for comparison include QAlign scores for image and video quality and aesthetics, as well as CLIP scores reflecting the alignment between generated videos and textual prompts. Higher scores indicate better performance.

It shows the impact of different stages of refinement (without SDS, with scale refinement, with trajectory refinement) on several metrics: QAlign-img-quality, QAlign-img-aesthetic, QAlign-vid-quality, QAlign-vid-aesthetic, and CLIP Score. Higher scores indicate better performance. The 'Ours' column shows the results with all refinements applied.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
