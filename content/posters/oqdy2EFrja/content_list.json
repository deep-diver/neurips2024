For each concept, a pre-trained expert model is assigned by LLM to generate its corresponding 3D representation (e.g., 3D Gaussians [25], SMPL parameters [26]) according to the textual description. 2) To provide coarse instruction for composition (i.e., the scale and trajectory of each object in the scene), we further resort to the priors in multi-modal LLM by querying it with the rendered scene image and the textual goals. However, directly instructing multi-modal LLM to return the scale and trajectory of each object leads to unexpected results, as it is challenging for LLM to estimate visual dynamics. Therefore, we follow a step-by-step reasoning philosophy [27] by representing the object with the bounding boxes and dividing the trajectory estimation into sub-tasks, i.e., estimating the starting points, ending points, and trajectories step-by-step. 3) After obtaining the coarse trajectories from the language space, we also propose to refine the scales, rotations, and exact locations with priors from large-scale visual data.

However, although effective, it remains challenging to generate objects with specific attributes or positions. To address this challenge, a series of studies proposed to exploit knowledge from LLM [31, 32] to achieve controllable generation [21, 19, 22, 33\u201335], zero-shot generation [36\u201339], or long video generation [40].

Although we demonstrate promising results in 3D-aware video generation, there still are limitations to be improved in the future.

However, it is still interesting to introduce physically grounded dynamics into 3D representation [66].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
