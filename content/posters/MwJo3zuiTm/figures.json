In cross-silo federated learning (FL) within the business sector, companies are self-interested and often compete. The challenge lies in forming collaborations that prevent free-riding (where some companies benefit without contributing) and conflicts of interest. This paper proposes a solution, FedEgoists, which addresses these challenges by ensuring that a company benefits from FL only if it also benefits the ecosystem and avoiding collaborations with competitors or their allies.  The figure visually depicts this process: companies initially compete (top left), but FedEgoists organizes them into optimized coalitions (right), avoiding free riders and conflicts, while a central FL Manager oversees the process.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "MwJo3zuiTm/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of Algorithm 1.", "description": "This figure illustrates Algorithm 1, which is used for forming conflict-free coalitions without free riders in a federated learning setting.
