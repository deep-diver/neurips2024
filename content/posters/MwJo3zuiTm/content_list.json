This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors.

It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members.

There are two types of FL [21]. In cross-device $F L$ , FL-PTs are end-user devices such as smartphones or IoT devices, and CS is the final owner of the trained model.

The application of FL in the business sector has been studied in diverse domains, including digital banking, ridesharing, recommender systems, and Electric Vehicle charging services [29, 30, 40, 48, 54]. Regional banks have different user groups from their respective regions and are independent [55], while the banks in the same region can compete for users [32]. Recently, a FL platform, MELLODDY, has been developed for drug discovery, including multiple companies from business sectors [36].

In business sectors, individuals are self-interested. This magnifies the free-riding problem where some FL-PTs benefit from the contributions of others without making any contribution to the FL ecosystem [21, 23]. Competition signifies that there is a potential confilct of interest between some two FL-PTs. Thus, two principles can simultaneously be used to meet the individual\u2019s needs: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from the FL ecosystem if and only if it can benefit the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors as well as the allies of its competitors [43]. The first principle is proposed and formulated in this paper for the first time, while the second principle has previously been considered for other scenarios [43].

Since competition and self-interest are considered, all FL-PTs are partitioned into disjoint groups/coalitions, each with the common interest. The competition and benefit relationships among FL-PTs can be described as graphs. We use theoretical tools from graph theory and propose an efficient solution FedEgoists that can well satisfy the two principles above. Meanwhile, FedEgoists can help FL-PTs achieve the best possible ML model performances, i.e., subject to the two principles, the coalitions that FedEgoists finds are optimal in the sense that one coalition cannot increase the utility of any of its members by collaborating with any other coalitions. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution compared to nine baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silo FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of competition in cross-silo FL where a key application area is the business sector. There are two cases. In the first case, all FL-PTs are assumed to offer the same service in the same market area and compete against each other. Several works attempt to reduce the potential side effect after FL-PTs join a fully competitive FL ecosystem. Wu and Yu [51] aim to maintain a negligible change in market share [52, 53] and analyze the achievability of this objective. Tsoy and Konstantinov [46] and Huang et al. [17] study the profitability of FL-PTs, but are taken under different assumptions on the source of extra profit brought by FL. Specifically, Tsoy and Konstantinov [46] assume that: (i) each consumer allocates a fixed budget to multiple services from different markets, and (ii) if a FL-PT owns a better model, the consumer will thus allocate more of its budget to consume its service due to the improved service quality. Huang et al. [17] consider duopoly business competition and assume that, if the model-related service can be improved by FL, customers will have a willingness to pay more and FL-PTs thus have opportunities to increase their proftis. In the second case, not all FL-PTs compete against each other, like one assumption in this paper, where some FL-PTs come from different market areas. Tan et al. [43] study how to avoid the confilcts of interest among FL-PTs for the first time and give a heuristic to realize Principle 2. However, Tan et al. [43] don\u2019t consider the self-interest feature of cross-silo FL in the business sector and cannot guarantee the optimal collaboration among independent coalitions without competition. The collaboration relationships among FL-PTs result in a collaboration graph $\\mathcal{G}_{u}$ . In their heuristic, FL-PTs are considered one by one and $\\mathcal{G}_{u}$ is thus constructed gradually to guarantee that for each FL-PT, there is no path that can be reachable to or from its competitors. In this paper, we apply the concepts of cliques and strongly connected components in graph theory to satisfy the self-interest and competition features and further optimize the proposed algorithm.

A coalition is a cooperative relationship formed among different individuals due to certain interests. Each agent is only concerned with the contributions of other agents within the same coalition [1]. Prior studies mainly focus on alleviating the side effect of data heterogeneity by allocating proper collaborators with data complementarity to each FL-PT. Donahue and Kleinberg [10] provide an analytical understanding of what partition of FL-PTs leads to a core-stable coalition structure for mean estimation and linear regression. Cui et al. [5] propose a heuristic algorithm to compute the core-stable coalition structure for general learning tasks. To some extent, the CS can dictate the collaboration relationships among FL-PTs only if doing so can better address the concerns of FL-PTs such as fairness and performance [7, 14, 60, 61]. Chaudhury et al. [4] treat all FL-PTs as a grand coalition and optimize a common model such that there is no other coalition $\\boldsymbol{S}$ of FL-PTs that could significantly benefit more by training a model only using the data of $\\boldsymbol{S}$ . Sattler et al. [38] propose a novel federated multi-task learning framework where the geometric properties of the FL loss surface is leveraged to group FL-PTs into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. Ding and Wang [8] partition a total of $n$ FL-PTs into $K$ groups, where $K\\ll n$ and the FL-PTs with similar contributors are assigned to the same group. Then, a common model is returned to each group of FL-PTs such that the performance of using $K$ models for $n$ FL-PTs is a good approximation to the the performance of learning $n$ personalized models for $n$ FL-PTs respectively.

Each FL-PT $v_{i}$ is uniquely equipped with its own local dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{i}$ . A benefit graph $\\mathcal{G}_{b}$ is deployed to describe the potential collaboration advantages between any two FL-PTs. Together with the competing relationships represented by $\\mathcal{G}_{c}$ among different FL-PTs, we pave the way for the formation of the contribution graph $\\mathcal{G}_{u}$ . The benefti graph $\\mathcal{G}_{b}$ is a weighted directed graph with an edge set $E_{b}$ (i.e., $\\mathcal{G}_{b}=(\\mathcal{V},E_{b}))$ and is used to evaluate the data complementarity between FL-PTs. It is defined as follows. For any two FL-PTs $v_{j}$ and $v_{i}$ , if $v_{i}$ can benefit from $v_{j}$ \u2019s data, then there is a directed edge from $v_{j}$ to $v_{i}$ (i.e., $(v_{j},v_{i})\\in\\bar{E}_{b})$ and the weight of this edge is $w_{j,i}>0$ where a larger value of $w_{j,i}$ signifies a larger benefti to $v_{i}$ brought by $v_{j}$ . In contrast, if $v_{i}$ cannot benefti from the data of $v_{j}$ , then $(v_{j},v_{i})\\notin E_{b}$ and $w_{j,i}=0$ . The benefti graph can be computed by the hypernetwork technique like [5, 34, 43]. The competing graph $\\mathcal{G}_{c}$ is an undirected graph with an edge set $E_{c}$ , i.e., $\\mathcal{G}_{c}=(\\mathcal{V},E_{c})$ . For any two FL-PTs $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ , if they compete against each other, then there is an undirected edge between $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$ (i.e., $(v_{i},v_{j})\\in E_{c})$ . If they are independent of each other, then $(v_{i},v_{j})\\notin E_{c}$ . The CS is assumed to be trustable. In the real world, the CS may represent an impartial and authoritative third-party (e.g., the industry association) [5]. Then, FL-PTs can report their competitive relationships to the third-party in person and confidentiality agreements can be signed between the third-party and FL-PTs. Each FL-PT $v_{i}$ will report its competitors to CS, as it hopes that CS will correctly utilize this information to prevent its competitors from benefiting from its data. Thus, CS has the knowledge of $\\mathcal{G}_{c}$ . Although $v_{i}$ may benefit from $v_{j}$ \u2019s dat $\\mathsf{a}(w_{j,i}>0)$ ), CS has the authority to determine whether $v_{i}$ can actually utilize $v_{j}$ \u2019s local model update information (i.e., indirectly use $v_{j}$ \u2019s data) in the FL training process or not.

CIFAR-10 images have 10 classes with 6,000 images per class, while CIFAR-100 is more complex and has 100 classes with only 600 images per class. We simulate the data heterogeneity by two typical approaches: (i) pathological distribution [5, 33, 43, 62], where each FL-PT is randomly allocated 2 classes of images for CIFAR-10 and 20 classes of images for CIFAR-100, and (ii) Dirichlet distribution [42, 58, 63], where a distribution vector $q_{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is drawn from the distribution $D i r_{n}(\\beta)$ for each class $c$ and FL-PT $v_{i}$ is allocated a $q_{c,i}$ proportion of data samples of class $c$ ; smaller $\\beta$ value results in higher data heterogeneity, and we set $\\beta=0.5$ .
