The experiment compares the performance of ConsRec, both with and without group annotations, across four metrics (HR@5, HR@10, NDCG@5, NDCG@10) for both group and user recommendation tasks. The results highlight the significant performance drop in group recommendation tasks when group annotations are removed, underscoring the critical issue of reliance on such annotations in existing group recommendation models.", "section": "4.2 Motivation Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "oTZYhOAMhX/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Motivation experiment on two datasets. \"GR\" and \"UR\" denote the group recommendation and the user recommendation, respectively.", "description": "This figure presents the results of a motivation experiment conducted on two datasets, Mafengwo and CAMRa2011, to demonstrate the impact of group annotations on the performance of group and user recommendation models.  The experiment compares the performance of ConsRec, a state-of-the-art group recommendation method, with and without group annotations.  The results show a significant drop in performance (HR@5 and NDCG@5) for group recommendation when group annotations are removed, highlighting the importance of group information in existing approaches.  Conversely, user recommendation performance is less impacted by the removal of group annotations.  This experiment motivates the need for a novel unsupervised group recommendation method that does not rely on expensive group annotations.", "section": "4.2 Motivation Experiment"}]
