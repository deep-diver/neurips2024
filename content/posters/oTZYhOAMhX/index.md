### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current group recommendation methods suffer from two major drawbacks: they rely on pre-defined, fixed user groups unsuitable for dynamic real-world applications, and they require expensive, supervised training with user-group and group-item labels.  These limitations hinder the practical applicability and scalability of group recommendation systems.  This leads to a need for more efficient and adaptable solutions.

The proposed Identify Then Recommend (ITR) framework addresses these issues by introducing an unsupervised approach. ITR first identifies user groups without pre-defined numbers using adaptive density estimation and a heuristic merge-and-split strategy.  Then, it uses self-supervised learning with two pre-text tasks‚Äîpull-and-repulsion and pseudo group recommendation‚Äîto optimize user-group distribution and improve recommendations.  Experimental results demonstrate ITR's effectiveness and superiority over existing methods on user and group recommendation tasks, further validated by its successful deployment in a large-scale industrial recommender system.

> This figure presents the results of a motivation experiment conducted on two datasets, Mafengwo and CAMRa2011, to demonstrate the impact of group annotations on group recommendation and user recommendation performance.  The experiment compares the performance of ConsRec, both with and without group annotations, across four metrics (HR@5, HR@10, NDCG@5, NDCG@10) for both group and user recommendation tasks. The results highlight the significant performance drop in group recommendation tasks when group annotations are removed, underscoring the critical issue of reliance on such annotations in existing group recommendation models.

### In-depth insights


#### Unsupervised GR
Unsupervised group recommendation (GR) tackles a crucial limitation of existing GR methods: **reliance on labeled data**.  Traditional GR approaches require extensive annotation of user-group memberships and group-item interactions, which is costly and time-consuming.  Unsupervised GR aims to address this by learning group structures and making recommendations **without explicit supervision**. This often involves employing clustering techniques to group users based on their preferences or behavior, followed by recommendation generation tailored to these automatically discovered groups.  The challenge lies in effectively capturing underlying user similarities and preferences in an unsupervised manner to create meaningful and accurate groups, ensuring the recommendations are relevant and well-suited to each group's collective interests.  Successful unsupervised GR methods must strike a balance between the accuracy of group discovery and the quality of subsequent recommendations, ideally offering performance comparable to their supervised counterparts.

#### ITR Framework
The ITR framework, as described, is an unsupervised group recommendation system addressing limitations of existing supervised methods.  **Its core innovation lies in its two-stage process:** first, it identifies user groups adaptively without predefined group numbers, leveraging density estimation and a merge-and-split algorithm; second, it performs self-supervised group recommendation using pull-and-repulsion and pseudo-group recommendation pretext tasks. This unsupervised nature is crucial for real-world applications where obtaining user-group labels is expensive and dynamic group distributions are common. The adaptive group discovery and self-supervised learning phases allow ITR to handle dynamic user behavior and avoid the limitations of fixed group sizes. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through improved NDCG@5 scores in experiments on various benchmark datasets and industrial applications.  **However, the heuristic nature of the merge-and-split strategy and the design of the pretext tasks warrant further investigation for robustness and generalizability.**  Further analysis of the computational complexity and scalability in larger datasets is also needed for a complete evaluation of the framework‚Äôs practical applicability.

#### Adaptive Density
The concept of "Adaptive Density" in the context of unsupervised group recommendation is intriguing.  It suggests a **dynamic approach to identifying group centers**, moving away from pre-defined or fixed group structures.  The method likely estimates density based on the proximity of data points (users), with **higher densities indicating potential group centers**. This adaptive approach is crucial because real-world user group distributions are unlikely to be static and require a flexible algorithm to react to this dynamic environment.  A heuristic merge-and-split strategy, likely guided by density estimations, would refine initial group assignments. This involves combining nearby dense regions and splitting less-dense areas, leading to more accurate and representative user clusters. The **self-adjusting nature** of the density estimation and the iterative merge/split algorithm is key to handling the dynamic nature of group formation and evolution.

#### Pre-text Tasks
Pre-text tasks are crucial in self-supervised learning, and their design significantly impacts model performance.  In the context of unsupervised group recommendation, pre-text tasks serve to guide the model towards learning meaningful representations of users and groups without explicit labels.  **A common approach involves designing tasks that encourage users within the same group to have similar representations (pull), while simultaneously separating users from different groups (repulsion).** This pull-and-repulsion strategy helps the model learn the underlying group structure.  **Another effective pre-text task could involve generating pseudo-labels for group-item interactions.** This involves predicting interactions based on the learned representations, thus providing a form of self-supervision. The success of these tasks hinges on their ability to capture relevant information while avoiding trivial solutions or overfitting.  **Careful design and evaluation are vital to ensure the pre-text tasks effectively guide the learning process, ultimately improving the quality of group recommendations.**  The choice of pre-text tasks should be driven by the specific characteristics of the data and the desired outcome. In this context, the balance between complexity, effectiveness, and computational cost is a critical consideration.

#### Future of ITR
The future of ITR (Identify Then Recommend) hinges on addressing its current limitations and exploring new avenues for improvement.  **Extending ITR to handle dynamic group structures** is crucial, potentially through online clustering algorithms that adapt in real-time to evolving user interactions.  **Incorporating diverse data sources** beyond user-item interactions, such as social networks, contextual information, and user demographics, could greatly enhance group identification and recommendation accuracy.  **Developing more sophisticated self-supervised learning techniques** is another key area; exploring advanced contrastive learning methods or incorporating reinforcement learning could boost performance. Finally, rigorous **evaluation on larger, more diverse datasets and industrial applications** will be vital to establish ITR's scalability and real-world impact. Addressing these aspects would solidify ITR's position as a robust and versatile framework for unsupervised group recommendation.
