Existing methods often use neural radiance fields (NeRFs) or meshes, but these can be computationally expensive or lack detail.  **3D Gaussian splatting offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches struggle to accurately infer signed distance functions (SDFs) due to the discrete and sparse nature of the Gaussians.**  They also suffer from off-surface drift, leading to incomplete or inaccurate surface representations.\nThis paper introduces a novel method that combines 3D Gaussian splatting with neural SDFs.  **The key is a differentiable \"pulling\" operation that dynamically aligns the 3D Gaussians to the zero-level set of the neural SDF.** This ensures better alignment with the actual surface and makes the inference process more robust.  The method uses both RGB and geometry constraints during optimization, improving the accuracy, smoothness, and completeness of the reconstructed surfaces.  **Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "r6tnDXIkNS/podcast.wav"}
