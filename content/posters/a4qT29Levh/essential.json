However, existing methods struggle with realistic and controllable closed-loop simulations which are costly to produce.  They often treat initialization and rollout as separate problems, leading to inconsistencies.  This limits the scope and effectiveness of research.\nSceneDiffuser tackles these issues with a unified scene-level diffusion model. It introduces *amortized diffusion*, efficiently performing rollout and handling closed-loop errors while jointly learning agent behavior and scene properties. *Generalized hard constraints* enhance controllability.  The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a challenging benchmark, demonstrating the value of this innovative approach.", "affiliation": "Waymo LLC", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "a4qT29Levh/podcast.wav"}
