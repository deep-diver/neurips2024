Previously known formulations studied couplings between the entire joint distribution induced by the chains, and derived solutions via a reduction to dynamic programming (DP) in an appropriately defined Markov decision process. This formulation has, however, not led to particularly efficient algorithms so far, since computing the associated DP operators requires fully solving a static optimal transport problem, and these operators need to be applied numerous times during the overall optimization process. In this work, we develop an alternative perspective by considering couplings between a \u201cflattened\u201d version of the joint distributions that we call discounted occupancy couplings, and show that calculating optimal transport distances in the full space of joint distributions can be equivalently formulated as solving a linear program (LP) in this reduced space. This LP formulation allows us to port several algorithmic ideas from other areas of optimal transport theory. In particular, our formulation makes it possible to introduce an appropriate notion of entropy regularization into the optimization problem, which in turn enables us to directly calculate optimal transport distances via a Sinkhorn-like method we call Sinkhorn Value Iteration (SVI). We show both theoretically and empirically that this method converges quickly to an optimal coupling, essentially at the same computational cost of running vanilla Sinkhorn in each pair of states. Along the way, we point out that our optimal transport distance exactly matches the common notion of bisimulation metrics between Markov chains, and thus our results also apply to computing such metrics, and in fact our algorithm turns out to be significantly more efficient than the best known methods developed so far for this purpose.

The more structured the objects become, the harder it gets to define appropriate notions of distances, as good notions of proximity need to take into account the possibly complex relationships between the constituent parts of each object. The possibility that the objects in question may be random further complicates the picture, and in such cases it becomes more natural to measure distances between the underlying joint probability distributions. Within the specific context of comparing stochastic processes, two natural notions of distance have emerged over the past decades: the notion of probabilistic bisimulation metrics that takes its root in modal logic and theoretical computer science [Sangiorgi, 2009, Abate, 2013], and the notion of optimal-transport distances that originates from probability theory [Villani, 2009, Peyr\u00e9 and Cuturi, 2019].

Bisimulation emerged within the area of theoretical computer science as one of the most important important concepts in concurrency theory and formal verification of computer systems [Park, 1981, Milner, 1989], and has been extended to probabilistic transition systems by Larsen and Skou [1989]. Within machine learning, bisimulation metrics have become especially popular in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) due to the work of Ferns et al. [2004], and have become one of the few standard tools of representation learning [Jiang, 2018, 2024]. In particular, the work of Ferns et al. [2004] advocates for using bisimilarity as a basis for state aggregation, measuring similarities of states in terms of similarities of two chains $M_{\\mathcal{X}}$ and $M_{\\mathcal{Y}}$ that only differ in their initial state. While this approach has inspired numerous follow-up works [Gelada et al., 2019, Castro, 2020, Agarwal et al., 2021b, Zhang et al., 2021, Hansen-Estruch et al., 2022, Castro et al., 2022], ultimately this line of work has failed to discover efficient algorithms for computing bisimulation metrics and has largely resorted to heuristics for computing similarity metrics.

The recent works of Yi et al. [2021], Brug\u00e8re et al.

Bisimulation was originally devised as a tool for determining whether or not two processes are behaviorally equivalent in the sense that no test can distinguish between the labels they generate. Being a much less demanding notion of equivalence than isomorphism (which is generally NP-hard to verify), the notion of bisimulation has had significant impact in concurrency theory and formal verification of computer systems, and has become a standard tool for model checking.

Their definition can be most simply presented when the two processes live on the same state space and follow the same transition kernel, but are initialized at two different states. In this setup, bisimulation reduces to a relation between individual states, which can be described formally as follows.

[1990] gives a notion of $\\varepsilon$ -bisimulation which relaxes the condition $\\mathcal{L}(x)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}(x^{\\prime})$ in the definition of the hard bisimulation relation given above, and only requires equality to hold up to some $\\varepsilon>0$ . Desharnais et al. [1999, 2004] go further and define a genuinely real-valued extension of bisimulation relations by defining bisimulation metrics as described in the main text (and particularly Equation (4)). A fixed-point characterization of these bisimulation metrics was established by van Breugel and Worrell [2001] and Desharnais et al. [2002]. These works show that the resulting distance notion is in fact a pseudometric, and two processes are bisimilar if and only if they are at distance zero.

Equation 5). Precisely, their definition that we recalled as Equation (4) is admittedly inspired by the Kantorovich dual representation of the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions over metric spaces.

They use their LP formulation as an analytic tool to show the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the fixed-point equations (5) (which essentially amounts to Bellman\u2019s value iteration algorithm implemented in the MDP we describe in Appendix B). Each step of the resulting algorithm solves one optimal-transport problem per state pair via the network simplex algorithm, which is known to be impractical for this purpose in comparison with Sinkhorn-style methods [Cuturi, 2013]. In the context of optimal transport, a closely related linear program has been discovered by Backhoff-Veraguas et al.

The problem of finding an optimal coupling that minimizes the total transport distance can be formulated as a linear program. Historically, the resulting LPs have been solved via standard solvers like the network simplex method or interior-point methods, which lead to algorithms with polynomial runtime guarantees but rather poor empirical performance.

This topic has recently started to receive attention in the OT literature, mostly focusing on stochastic processes with finite horizon [Pflug and Pichler, 2012, Backhoff-Veraguas et al., 2017, Lassalle, 2018]. In this setting (often called \u201cadapted transport\u201d, \u201ccausal transport\u201d, or \u201cbicausal transport\u201d), the problem is to transport mass between joint distributions of sequences of elements, which can be formulated as an optimization problem over the set of causal couplings (i.e., the set of couplings over joint distributions over sequences that respect the temporal order inherent in the process). Backhoff-Veraguas et al. [2017] have observed that, due to the linearity of the causality constraints, this optimization problem can be phrased as a linear program, which however is infinite-dimensional and thus intractable to solve directly. They complement this view by providing dynamic-programming principles for characterizing the structure of the optimal coupling, which, in the special case of Markov processes, boils down to the finite-horizon version of the fixed point equations (3).

When specialized to Markov processes, their algorithm can be seen to be very closely related to ours, the technical explanation being that in finite-horizon Markov processes the entropy of path distributions that they use as regularization can be seen to be equal to the conditional entropy that our method uses for the same purpose. The resulting algorithm performs iterative Bregman projections via backward recursion over the finite time horizon, with computational steps that are essentially identical to applying our Bellman\u2013Sinkhorn operators.

Scherrer 2013) to an appropriately adjusted version of the MDP we describe in Appendix B.

[2024] to solve the discounted problem that is the subject of the present paper, with the difference that their method takes approximate value iteration as its starting point. Both of these approaches are closely related to the alternative fixed-point definition of bisimulation metrics using Sinkhorn divergences due to Kemertas and Jepson [2022b], as mentioned in Section A.1.

The purpose of these works was to define a notion of distance that is less demanding than isomorphism, but is still grounded in fundamental theory and can be computed effectively\u2014which is precisely the reason that the notion of bisimulation was originally introduced in the 1980s in the context of formal verification by Park [1981] and Milner [1989].

In contrast, choosing smaller learning rates enables convergence to better solutions, at the cost of making slower progress initially. An intuitive explanation for this is that for larger values of $\\eta$ , the iterates converge rapidly to the broad proximity of an optimal solution, but then reach a cycle where they continue to perform large updates to the transition coupling which results in large constraint violations, which necessitate large updates, and so on.

First, we estimate a ground truth obtained by running one of the algorithms for a very high number of iterations and a very low level of regularization, and then use this ground truth as a comparator to adjust the hyperparameters of the algorithms so that they are close to this value in as little wall-clock time as possible.

Adjusting these other algorithms by maintaining the couplings in memory and using them to warm-start the subsequent updates makes them competitive with our methods, and in fact doing so makes them quite similar to SVI and SPI.

[2024], which consists of running an instance of Sinkhorn\u2019s algorithm in each pair of states. The computational cost of all these methods can be improved by leveraging the sparsity of transition kernels: in particular, if at most $S$ states are reachable with positive probability in both of the chains, the complexity of the updates can be trivially improved to $|\\mathcal{X}||\\mathcal{Y}|\\bar{S}^{2}$ . We did not pursue this direction in our experiments as our goal was to compare the basic versions of each studied method, and we believe that our conclusions would not be altered if we were to implement this improvement for all methods.

To this end, we have generated 35 different \u201c4-room\u201d instances and computed their pairwise distances. Each instance differs in its initial state and position of the obstacles (amounting to changes in the transition kernel), while maintaining a fixed reward function, with one reward located in each room except for the upper left room. Crossing a door between each room results in a negative reward. For each instance, we have studied the Markov chain induced by the corresponding optimal policy (which amounts to taking the shortest path toward the closest positive reward, modulo the additional randomness inherent to the transitions). Figure 5 presents a 3D visualization (where the $z$ -dimension is represented by a color gradient) generated using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [Kruskal, 1964] based on the computed pairwise distances. One can observe a clear clustered structure, where instances with similar behaviors are grouped closely together. As the figure highlights, the resulting metrics capture the intuitive similarities and symmetries between each process, which indicates the potential usefulness of optimal transport distances and bisimulation metrics for comparing Markov chains under minimal structural assumptions made on the state spaces and the transition functions.

It can be observed how the elements in the same cluster present common features that differentiate them from those in another cluster. In the examples shown in the figure we can see how the instances in which the closest reward involves crossing a door are concentrated in one cluster, while the instances in which the reward and the initial state are located in the same room belong to a different cluster. The remaining clusters correspond to having to cross two doors for a reward (set of green points on the top), or having no reward that is accessible from the initial state (set of blue points in the middle, with large negative $z$ -coordinates).

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
