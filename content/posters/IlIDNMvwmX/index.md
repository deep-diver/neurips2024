### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the third generation of artificial neural networks, are energy-efficient but lag behind traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in performance.  This paper tackles this issue by focusing on the multi-threshold model which enables richer information transmission.  However, existing works on this model did not fully explore its mathematical relationship with ANNs and SNNs.

The paper proposes a novel learnable multi-hierarchical threshold model (LM-HT) which dynamically regulates the global input current and membrane potential.  **LM-HT can be converted to a single-threshold model, enhancing hardware deployment flexibility and enabling mathematical equivalence with quantized ANNs under uniform input**.  The paper also introduces a hybrid learning framework to improve the performance of converted SNNs, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments that show the LM-HT model achieving state-of-the-art results and comparable performance to quantized ANNs.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-threshold SNNs
Multi-threshold Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a significant advancement in SNN research.  By incorporating multiple thresholds within a neuron, **they enhance the network's ability to encode and process information more efficiently**.  This contrasts with traditional SNNs that rely on a single threshold, limiting their representational capacity.  The increased dimensionality offered by multiple thresholds allows for finer-grained temporal coding and potentially **improved learning capabilities**. This is particularly relevant for tasks requiring precise timing information, such as those found in sensory processing.  However, **designing effective learning algorithms for multi-threshold SNNs presents a considerable challenge**.  The complexity introduced by multiple thresholds necessitates the development of sophisticated learning rules that can efficiently update the network weights while accurately capturing the diverse spiking dynamics.  Furthermore, **hardware implementation of multi-threshold SNNs may also pose challenges**.  The increased complexity could lead to higher energy consumption and reduced scalability. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of increased information capacity and efficiency make multi-threshold SNNs a promising area of research with significant potential for advancing the field of neuromorphic computing.

#### LM-HT Model
The LM-HT model, a **learnable multi-hierarchical threshold model**, is proposed to enhance the performance of spiking neural networks (SNNs).  It dynamically regulates global input current and membrane potential leakage, offering **superior learning capability** compared to traditional SNNs.  **Mathematical analysis** reveals its equivalence to vanilla spiking models and quantized artificial neural networks (ANNs), bridging the gap between these network types. This novel framework improves the often-poor performance of converted SNNs, particularly under low latency, by effectively integrating with ANN-SNN conversion methods. The model's design allows for **flexible hardware deployment**, converting seamlessly to a single-threshold model. **Extensive experiments** demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, showcasing its potential to bring SNNs to a level comparable with quantized ANNs.

#### Hybrid Training
The concept of 'hybrid training' in the context of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers a powerful approach to bridge the performance gap between SNNs and their artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts.  It leverages the strengths of both paradigms: the energy efficiency and biological plausibility of SNNs and the superior performance achieved through established ANN training methods. **A key aspect of hybrid training involves pre-training an ANN and then converting it to an SNN, followed by further fine-tuning using a spiking-based learning algorithm such as STBP.** This strategy combines the benefits of ANNs' well-established training procedures with SNNs' inherent advantages.  This approach is particularly valuable for applications demanding low latency and energy efficiency, as it addresses the challenges often encountered with directly training SNNs from scratch. **The effectiveness of hybrid training hinges on the careful selection of the conversion method to minimize performance degradation and the effective integration of the ANN weights into the SNN architecture.** Furthermore, the use of learnable parameters within the SNN, as demonstrated by the LM-HT model in this paper, can further refine this hybrid learning strategy. In essence, hybrid training presents a sophisticated strategy that harnesses the benefits of both ANN and SNN frameworks in the pursuit of superior performance in various machine learning applications.

#### Reparameterization
The reparameterization technique, as discussed in the context of spiking neural networks (SNNs), is a crucial method for enhancing efficiency and deployment flexibility.  **It involves transforming a complex, multi-threshold model (like the LM-HT model presented) into a simpler, single-threshold model (like a vanilla LIF model), facilitating hardware implementation.** This transformation is not merely a simplification; it preserves the essential functionality and performance characteristics of the original model.  **The core idea is to mathematically equate the behavior of the multi-threshold model over multiple timesteps with an equivalent single-threshold model.** This is achieved through a layer-by-layer transformation, carefully re-parameterizing the weights and biases to maintain accuracy.  This process is particularly useful in addressing the challenges of deploying SNNs on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware, where the simplicity of a single-threshold model is advantageous. **The success of the reparameterization hinges on the careful consideration of mathematical equivalency and avoiding information loss during the transformation.**  The resulting single-threshold model offers improved hardware compatibility without significant performance degradation, making SNNs more accessible for real-world applications.

#### Future works
Future research could explore extending the LM-HT model to handle more complex spatiotemporal patterns and diverse neural morphologies.  **Investigating the model's robustness to noise and variations in input data is crucial**, as is exploring its applicability to larger-scale datasets and more complex tasks. **A deeper theoretical analysis** could shed light on the model's capacity for generalization and its relationship with other SNN learning frameworks.  **Developing efficient hardware implementations** of the LM-HT model for neuromorphic computing is another key area.  Finally, comparing the LM-HT model with other multi-threshold models on various benchmarks would offer further insights into its strengths and limitations.  This would help establish its place within the wider field of SNN research and guide the development of even more advanced spiking neural network architectures.

> This figure illustrates the reparameterization process of transforming the LM-HT model (Learnable Multi-hierarchical Threshold model) into a vanilla LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) model for more efficient hardware deployment. The LM-HT model uses a multi-hierarchical threshold mechanism to integrate information over multiple timesteps within a single step. This figure shows how the LM-HT model's parameters (weights, biases, Temporal-Global Information Matrix (T-GIM), and leaky parameters) are transformed to equivalent parameters in a vanilla LIF model, allowing for a lossless conversion that maintains accuracy while simplifying the model's structure for hardware implementation.

> This figure illustrates how the multi-hierarchical threshold (M-HT) model can be reparameterized into a vanilla single-threshold LIF model.  The process involves transforming the multi-step input current weighting scheme of the M-HT model into a single-step LIF model. This transformation allows for more flexible hardware deployment of the model, as many neuromorphic hardware platforms are designed to work with LIF neurons, which only use a single threshold for spiking behavior. The figure shows two stages: the SNN training stage and the SNN inference stage. Both stages demonstrate how the T-GIM matrix and the learnable parameters (Œª and Œ©) are used for this transformation. The transformation ensures that there is no accuracy loss when switching from the M-HT model to the LIF model.
