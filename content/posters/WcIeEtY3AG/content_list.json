In this work, we consider how to incorporate SNNs\u2019 spike-driven and MoE\u2019s conditional computation into a unified framework. However, MoE uses softmax to get the dense conditional weights for each expert and TopK to hard-sparsify the network, which does not fit the properties of SNNs.

Both the experts and the router output spiking sequences, and their element-wise operation makes SEMM computation spike-driven and dynamic sparse-conditional. By developing SEMM into Spiking Transformer, the Experts Mixture Spiking Attention (EMSA) and the Experts Mixture Spiking Perceptron (EMSP) are proposed, which performs routing allocation for head-wise and channel-wise spiking experts, respectively.

In this work, we are committed to exploring the effective integration of MoE and Spiking Transformer. As shown in Fig.1(a), MoE introduces a large number of parameters based on the original Transformer, and the conditional computation is achieved by calculating the routing probability of each token on each expert through the softmax function. Selecting Top-K experts based on the routing probability, MoE achieves hard sparsification. However, SNN calculations need to avoid multiplication and cannot use complex softmax functions. The features in SNNs are dynamically sparse and do not require additional TopK. All the parameters of the expert must be loaded, which aggravates the difficulty of neuromorphic chip deployment. These factors make porting MoE to SNNs non-trivial. To tackle this problem, we develop the Spiking Experts Mixture Mechanism (SEMM), as shown in Fig.1(b), a universal SNN-MoE paradigm with the following three main features. 1) The SEMM is spike-driven. The outputs of the expert and the router are spike sequences, and the element-wise operation between them conforms to the SNN characteristics, i.e., avoiding multiplication. 2) SEMM leverages the sparse spiking activation of SNNs to achieve dynamic conditional computation of MoEs, which is more flexible than the fixed hard sparsification of Artificial Neural Network MoE (ANN-MoE). 3) With reasonable parameter count settings, SEMM enables Spiking Transformers to achieve stable performance gains with negligible overhead.

With redesigned Router-Expert pairs and element-wise spike-driven operations, SEMM is computation-efficient and SNN-compatible. Embedded in Spiking Transformers, SEMM-based EMSA and EMSP can bring stable performance improvement on static and neuromorphic datasets. SEMM paradigm can inspire future exploration of high-performance, high-capacity Spiking Transformers. We hope SEMM can bring vitality to dynamic conditional computation and the design of next-generation architecture for SNNs.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
