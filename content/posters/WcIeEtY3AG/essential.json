SNNs are energy-efficient but lack the capacity of deep learning models, while MoE enhances capacity but is computationally expensive.  This paper aims to combine SNNs' energy efficiency with MoE's capacity for conditional computation.\nThe researchers introduce Spiking Experts Mixture Mechanism (SEMM), which reformulates MoE in the context of SNNs.  SEMM's spike-driven and dynamic sparse nature makes it suitable for SNNs.  By integrating SEMM into Spiking Transformers, they develop Experts Mixture Spiking Attention (EMSA) and Experts Mixture Spiking Perceptron (EMSP), which show significant performance improvements over baseline Spiking Transformers on neuromorphic and static datasets.  The results suggest SEMM is a promising approach to building more efficient and powerful AI systems.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "WcIeEtY3AG/podcast.wav"}
