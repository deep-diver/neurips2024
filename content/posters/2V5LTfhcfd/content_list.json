Understanding when and how a conclusion in one domain, such as a statistical association, can be generalized to a novel, unseen domain has taken a fundamental role in the philosophy of biological and social sciences in the early 21st century. As Campbell and Stanley [8, p. 17] observed in an early discussion on the interpretation of statistical inferences, \u201cGeneralization always turns out to involve generalization into a realm not represented in one\u2019s sample\u201d where, in particular, statistical associations and distributions might differ, presenting a fundamental challenge.

Such developments make various parts of society more efficient, but also require a notion of performance guarantee that is critical for the safety of AI, in which the problem of generalization appears under different forms. For instance, one critical task in the field is domain generalization, where one tries to learn a model (e.g. classifier, regressor) on data sampled from a distribution that differs in several aspects from that expected when deploying the model in practice. In this context, generalization guarantees must build on knowledge or assumptions on the \u201crelatedness\u201d of different training and testing domains; for instance, if training and testing domains are arbitrarily different, no generalization guarantees can be expected from any predictor [12, 40]. The question becomes how to link the domains of data that are used to train a model (a.k.a., the source domains) to the domain where this model is deployed in practice (a.k.a., the target domain).

Examples include assumptions of covariate shift and label shift (among others) [35, 34]. Notably, generalization is justified by the stability and invariance of the causal mechanisms shared across the domains [14, 21], since the distributional/statistical invariances across the domains are consequences of mechanistic/structural invariances governing the underlying data generating process. Although the induced statistical invariances, once exploited correctly, can be used as bases for generalizability. Broadly, invariance-based approaches to domain generalization [27, 29, 2, 40, 24, 20, 7, 6, 13] search for predictors that not only achieves small error on the source data but also maintain certain notions of distributional invariance across the source domains. Since these statistical invariances can be viewed as proxies to structural invariances, in certain instances generalization guarantees can be provided through causal reasoning [17, 31, 39]. This idea can be illustrated in Fig. 1. The value of variables $\\{\\bar{C},Y,W,Z\\}$ are determined as a stochastic function of variables pointing to it, while these functions may differ across domains. The challenge is to evaluate the generalization risk of a model, e.g. $R_{P^{*}}(h)\\,:=\\,\\mathbb{E}_{P^{*}}[(Y-h)^{2}]$ for $h:=h(\\bar{C},W,Z)=\\mathbb{E}_{P^{1}}[Y\\mid\\bar{C},W,Z]$ , without observations from the target $P^{*}$ . General instances of this challenge have been studied under the rubric of the theory of causal transportability, where qualitative assumptions regarding the underlying structural causal models are encoded in a graphical object, and algorithms are designed to leverage these assumptions and compute certain statistical queries in the target domain in terms of the existing source data [26, 4, 5, 19, 11, 17].

We use data drawn from $P^{1,2}(z,y)$ to train predictors using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) [38], Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) [2], and group Distributionally Robust Optimization (group DRO) [32], namely $h_{\\mathrm{ERM}}(z),h_{\\mathrm{IRM}}(z)$ , and $h_{\\mathrm{DRO}}(z)$ respectively; more detailed discussion about the role of invariance and robustness in domain generalization is available in appendix D. Using Neural-TR, we observe in Fig. 4c that the worst-case risk of $h_{\\mathrm{ERM}}$ in a target domain with a discrepancy in the color assignment is approximately 0.95, $h_{\\mathrm{DRO}}$ achieves 0.90 worst-case risk, and $h_{\\mathrm{IRM}}$ achieves 0.65 worst-case risk. Either method perform worse than the baseline, that is random classification with risk 0.5. On this task, a classifier trained on gray-scale images $W$ achieves a worst-case error of 0.25. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Worst-case risk optimization We now ask whether we could learn a theoretically optimal classifier in the worst-case with CRO (Alg. 2). Fig. 6 illustrates the training process over several iterations. Specifically, given a randomly initialized $h$ , we infer the ${\\operatorname{NCM}}\\,{\\hat{\\theta}}^{*}$ that entails worst-case performance of $h$ (in this case, chance performance $R_{P*}(h)\\,=\\,0.5)$ and generate data $D^{*}$ from $\\hat{\\theta}^{*}$ , shown in Fig. 6a. In a second iteration, a new candidate $h$ is trained to minimize worst-case risk on $\\mathbb{D}=D^{*}$ . Note that in $D^{*}$ , we observe an almost perfect association between the color $C=$ green and label $Y=1$ : $h$ therefore is encouraged to exploit color for prediction. Its worst-case error (inferred with Neural-TR) is accordingly close to 1, and the corresponding worst-case $\\operatorname{NCM}{\\hat{\\theta}}^{*}$ entails a distribution of data in which the correlation between color and label is filpped: with a strong association between the color $C=$ \u201cred and label $Y=1$ , as shown in Fig. 6b. In a third iteration, a new candidate $h$ is trained to minimize worst-case risk on the updated $\\mathbb{D}^{*}$ with data samples from the previous two iterations (exhibiting opposite color-label correlations). By construction, this classifier is trained to ignore the spurious association between color and label, classifying images based on the inferred digit which leads to better behavior in the worst-case: achieving a final error of approximately 0.25, as shown in Fig. 6c, which is theoretically optimal. Note, however, that the poor performance of the baseline algorithms is not directly comparable to that of CRO, since CRO has access to background information (selection diagrams) that can not be communicated with the baseline algorithms. CRO may thus be interpreted as a meta-algorithm that operates with a broader range of assumptions encoded in a certain format (i.e., the selection diagram) that enable it to find the theoretically optimal classifier for domain generalization, in contrast to the baseline algorithms.

In practice, evaluating the performance of a given algorithm is non-trivial. Often the performance may vary as a consequence of our uncertainty about the possible target domain, also called a non-transportable setting. In this paper, we provide the first general estimation technique for bounding an arbitrary statistic such as the classification risk across multiple domains. More specifically, we extend the formulation of canonical models and neural causal models for the transportability task, demonstrating that tight bounds may be estimated with both approaches. Building on these theoretical findings, we introduce a Bayesian inference procedure as well as a gradient-based optimization algorithm for scalable inferences in practice. Moreover, we introduce Causal Robust Optimization (CRO), an iterative learning scheme that uses partial transportability as a subroutine to find a predictor with the best worst-case risk given the data and graphical assumptions.

As alluded to in this paper, under-identifiability issues and the difficulty of stating realistic assumptions that are conducive to extrapolation guarantees are pervasive throughout the data sciences. Our hope is that our analysis with a more surgical encoding of structural differences between domains that allow the empirical investigator to determine whether (and how) her/his understanding of the underlying system is sufficient to support the generalization of prediction algorithm is an important addition towards safe and reliable AI. This approach is not without limitations, however. We have shown that selection diagrams are sufficient to ensure consistent domain generalization (through bounds instead of point estimates) but arguably restrict the analysis to a narrow class of problems as graphs or super-structures need to be defined. This stands in contrast with representation learning methods that operate on higher-dimensional spaces, e.g. text, images, which are difficult to reason about in a causal framework. The trade-off is that guarantees for consistent extrapolation are difficult to define and that one-size-fits-all assumptions are difficult to justify in practice. Partial transportability may be understood as a complementary view-point on this problem, applicable in a different class of problems in which structural knowledge is available implying that non-trivial guarantees for extrapolation can be established. Pushing the boundaries of methods based on causal graphs to reach compelling real-world applications is arguably one the most important frontiers for the causal community as a whole. In this work, there is scope for improving posterior estimation and for introducing assumptions on the class of SCMs that are modelled, e.g. linear Gaussian models, etc., that could lead to efficient predictors in higher-dimensional spaces. Similarly, relaxations of selection diagrams, e.g. in the form of equivalence classes or partially-known graphs, could be developed for applications in domains where knowledge of graph structure is unrealistic.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
