### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Bayesian Optimization (BO) is powerful but struggles with high dimensionality and large datasets due to the computational cost of Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing approximate GP methods often result in overly smooth estimations, hindering BO's performance, especially with limited online samples.  Many existing methods focus on problems with large online samples in low dimensions. 

This paper introduces FOCALBO, a hierarchical BO algorithm that uses a novel focalized GP.  **Focalized GP improves local prediction accuracy by strategically allocating representational power to relevant search space regions**. FOCALBO iteratively optimizes acquisition functions over progressively smaller search spaces, efficiently utilizing large offline and online datasets. Experiments show FOCALBO outperforms existing methods on robot morphology design and high-dimensional musculoskeletal system control, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling real-world, large-scale optimization problems.

### In-depth insights


#### Focalized GP
The core concept of "Focalized GP" revolves around **enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of sparse Gaussian Processes (GPs)** within the Bayesian Optimization framework.  Standard sparse GPs, while improving scalability, often suffer from overly smooth estimations due to their global perspective.  Focalized GP addresses this by introducing a **novel loss function** that strategically focuses the model's representational power on relevant sub-regions of the search space. This localized approach is achieved by weighting training data based on its proximity to the region of interest, thereby prioritizing the accuracy of local predictions crucial for effective acquisition function optimization. This technique allows for **more efficient allocation of computational resources**, leading to better performance, particularly in high-dimensional spaces and with large datasets.  The effectiveness of Focalized GP is further enhanced when combined with a hierarchical optimization strategy, as demonstrated by the algorithm FOCALBO.  In essence, Focalized GP offers a refined method for sparse GP training, improving both accuracy and efficiency in Bayesian optimization.

#### Hierarchical BO
Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods address the challenge of efficiently exploring complex, high-dimensional search spaces.  These methods work by recursively decomposing the search space into smaller sub-regions, allowing for focused exploration at different scales.  **A key advantage is the potential for improved efficiency**, as resources are concentrated on promising areas. **Early stages might explore broadly using global models**, then refining the search using local models in increasingly specific areas.  This approach is particularly beneficial for problems with multimodal objective functions or where there's a high degree of heterogeneity across the search space.  **However, careful design is crucial**.  Challenges include selecting appropriate sub-region divisions, managing the interactions between different levels of the hierarchy, and balancing exploration and exploitation effectively at each level. The effectiveness also depends on the choice of surrogate models and acquisition functions used for each level; **poorly chosen methods at any level can hinder overall performance.** A successful hierarchical BO method requires a sophisticated interplay between global and local optimization strategies. 

#### High-D Optimization
High-dimensional optimization (High-D Optimization) presents unique challenges due to the **curse of dimensionality**, where the search space expands exponentially with the number of dimensions.  Traditional methods often fail to scale effectively.  The paper explores **sparse Gaussian processes** as a surrogate model to address this, focusing on efficiently allocating representational power to relevant regions. The **hierarchical optimization strategy** of FOCALBO, which iteratively refines the search space, shows promise in efficiently handling both large offline and online datasets.  This approach is particularly effective when dealing with **heterogeneous functions**, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in complex domains like robot morphology design and musculoskeletal system control.  The combination of **focalized GP** for better local prediction and the hierarchical approach of FOCALBO offers a powerful strategy for tackling High-D Optimization problems, showcasing its capability for solving complex, real-world challenges.

#### Offline Data Use
The effective use of offline data is a crucial, yet often underexplored, aspect of Bayesian Optimization (BO).  Many BO algorithms focus primarily on online data acquisition, neglecting the potential value of pre-existing datasets.  **Leveraging offline data can significantly reduce the number of expensive online evaluations needed,** especially when dealing with high-dimensional or computationally intensive problems.  A well-designed BO method should seamlessly integrate offline data to improve the surrogate model's accuracy and reduce uncertainty. This might involve techniques like **carefully weighting offline data based on relevance to the current search area**, perhaps by proximity to promising regions identified in earlier iterations.  **Strategies for handling the potential heterogeneity and noise levels in offline data are also vital.** Techniques such as robust regression methods or clustering could improve the reliability of the surrogate model.  Furthermore, the computational cost of incorporating large offline datasets must be considered; **scalable methods like sparse Gaussian processes are essential** for efficient handling of massive offline data, but also need to avoid overly-smoothing the surrogate model's estimation of the objective function.   In summary, a robust BO system should be capable of efficiently utilizing offline data to enhance performance, focusing on intelligent data selection, robust modeling, and computationally efficient algorithms.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on scalable Bayesian Optimization (BO) using focalized sparse Gaussian processes could explore several avenues.  **Improving the theoretical understanding** of FOCALBO's regret bounds and convergence properties is crucial. This involves a deeper analysis of the proposed focalized ELBO loss function and its impact on the approximation quality of sparse GPs in high-dimensional spaces.  **Developing more sophisticated acquisition functions** optimized within the hierarchical framework of FOCALBO could further enhance its efficiency.  **Investigating alternative methods** for selecting inducing points or employing other sparse GP formulations may lead to more robust and scalable algorithms.  **Extending FOCALBO to handle constraints** or different types of optimization problems is another significant area for future work.  Finally, **applying FOCALBO to a broader range of real-world applications** beyond robot control and musculoskeletal system design, such as hyperparameter tuning in deep learning or materials science, would demonstrate its generalizability and impact.
