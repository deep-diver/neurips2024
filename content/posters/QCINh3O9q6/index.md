### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Person re-identification (ReID) aims to match individuals across different camera views.  Existing pre-training methods primarily focus on single images or tracklets within a single video, neglecting the valuable information contained in cross-video comparisons of the same person. This limitation hinders the development of highly accurate and robust ReID systems.



The researchers address this by proposing the Cross-video Identity-cOrrelating pre-training (CION) framework. CION models cross-video identity correlation as a multi-level denoising process, enhancing both intra-identity consistency and inter-identity discrimination. This improved pre-training significantly boosts the performance of various ReID models, even with limited training data.  Furthermore, they provide ReIDZoo, a publicly available model zoo, promoting reproducibility and facilitating broader research in this field.

> This figure compares three different pre-training methods for person re-identification: instance-level, single-video tracklet-level, and the proposed cross-video identity-correlating pre-training (CION).  The instance-level method only considers augmentations of a single image. The single-video tracklet-level method considers temporal information within a single video but ignores cross-video identity consistency. In contrast, CION explicitly correlates images of the same person across different videos to learn identity-invariance, resulting in better representation learning.

### In-depth insights


#### Cross-Video ID Correlation
Cross-video identity correlation tackles a critical challenge in person re-identification by considering the identity consistency and discrimination across different video segments.  **The core idea is to correlate images of the same person from multiple videos,** thus going beyond instance-level or single-video tracklet comparisons. This approach directly addresses the limitation of previous methods that neglect the identity invariance across videos. By explicitly modeling the identity correlation as a multi-level denoising problem, the method aims to refine the representation learning process, achieving improved accuracy and robustness.  **This cross-video approach significantly enhances intra-identity consistency and inter-identity discrimination,** which is crucial for reliable person re-identification. The effectiveness is empirically validated through substantial improvements in performance metrics on standard benchmarks.

#### Progressive Multi-level Denoising
The proposed "Progressive Multi-level Denoising" strategy is a key innovation for enhancing identity correlation in person re-identification pre-training.  It tackles the inherent noise in initially extracted person tracklets from videos, stemming from inaccurate tracking and the omission of cross-video identity consistency. The method proceeds in three progressive levels: **Single-tracklet Denoising** refines individual tracklets by iteratively removing outliers based on intra-identity consistency. **Short-range Single-video Denoising** further improves identity correlation within a video by merging similar tracklets and reallocating misidentified samples. Finally, **Long-range Cross-video Denoising** leverages a 'Sliding Range' and 'Linking Relation' mechanism to efficiently correlate identity information across multiple videos, effectively addressing the computational challenges of processing ultra-long video sequences. This multi-level approach is crucial for achieving superior identity invariance, ultimately enhancing the quality of person re-identification models. The progressive nature allows for increasingly robust identity correlation mining by addressing noise at different scales and granularities.

#### Identity-Guided Self-Distillation
The proposed 'Identity-Guided Self-Distillation' method is a crucial component of the Cross-video Identity-cOrrelating pre-traiNing (CION) framework.  It leverages the **identity correlation** established in the preceding multi-level denoising stages to improve the model's learning of identity-invariant features. Unlike traditional self-distillation, which typically focuses on general image representation learning, this method explicitly incorporates identity information. This is achieved by performing contrastive learning on augmented views of images belonging to the same identity, thereby explicitly enforcing **intra-identity consistency**. The use of a teacher-student network paradigm allows the student network to learn from a more robust teacher, leading to improved generalization. The method is **model-agnostic**, meaning it can be readily applied to various network architectures. This adaptability, along with its superior performance using fewer training samples, highlights its potential for broader applications within the field of person re-identification.

#### CION's Superiority
The paper highlights CION's superiority through extensive experiments demonstrating significantly improved performance with fewer training samples.  **CION's cross-video identity correlating approach** outperforms instance-level and single-video tracklet-level methods by explicitly modeling identity invariance across different videos.  **This leads to superior representation learning**, as evidenced by higher mAP scores on benchmark datasets such as Market1501 and MSMT17. The **model-agnostic nature** of CION is further validated by its successful application to diverse model architectures, showcased in the ReIDZoo.  These results collectively establish CION as a leading pre-training framework for person re-identification, offering both efficiency and effectiveness.  The paper's contribution extends to the creation of a publicly available model zoo, furthering research and applications in this field. **CION's superior performance**, particularly with limited data, signifies a crucial advancement for practical person re-identification tasks.

#### ReIDZoo Model Zoo
The proposed ReIDZoo Model Zoo represents a significant contribution to the field of person re-identification (ReID).  By offering a collection of 32 pre-trained models spanning diverse architectures (GhostNet, ConvNext, RepViT, etc.), **ReIDZoo democratizes access to high-performing ReID models**, removing a significant barrier to entry for researchers with limited computational resources. The zoo's model-agnostic nature showcases the generality and effectiveness of the underlying Cross-video Identity-cOrrelating pre-training (CION) framework, **highlighting CION's ability to improve performance across different model backbones**.  This readily available resource accelerates research progress, enabling quicker exploration of novel ReID techniques and facilitating broader adoption of ReID technology in various applications.  **The comprehensive nature of ReIDZoo, including models with varying parameters and structures**, makes it a powerful tool for both academic research and practical deployment, fostering innovation and wider accessibility within the ReID community.

> This figure illustrates the Sliding Range and Linking Relation concepts used in the CION framework for cross-video identity correlation.  A long video sequence is conceptually divided into smaller segments (tracklets) represented by the boxes. The Sliding Range (blue dashed lines) moves across the entire video, considering a window of tracklets at each position. Inside the Sliding Range, the algorithm identifies linking relations (green dashed lines) between tracklets that likely correspond to the same person across different segments, thus correlating images of the same person across different videos.
