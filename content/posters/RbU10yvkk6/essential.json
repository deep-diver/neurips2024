This is because the optimization of codebooks is inefficient and usually only a small subset of entries are actually used.  This paper addresses this by proposing a novel approach called VQGAN-LC.\n\nVQGAN-LC initializes a large codebook (100,000 entries) using a pretrained model. The key is that instead of directly optimizing each codebook entry, it optimizes a projector network that maps the entire codebook to a latent space. This strategy maintains a high codebook utilization rate (99%) and significantly improves performance on various downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, classification, and generation across different generative models. The results demonstrate that scaling up the codebook size significantly improves model performance while incurring almost no additional computational cost.  **This is a significant advancement in image quantization, enhancing the representational capacity of VQGAN and its applications.**", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "RbU10yvkk6/podcast.wav"}
