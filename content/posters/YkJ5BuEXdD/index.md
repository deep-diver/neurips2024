### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are often trained using preference learning algorithms to align their outputs with human preferences.  However, there's limited understanding of these algorithms.  This paper investigates the common assumption that these algorithms improve how models rank outputs in terms of preferences (ranking accuracy).  It finds that this is not the case, as even advanced models show low ranking accuracy on standard datasets.

The researchers delve into the reasons behind this surprising finding. They find that a popular optimization technique, called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), struggles to correct even mild errors in how the original model ranks outputs. The paper provides theoretical analysis and a simple formula to predict the difficulty of learning preferences, and further shows that a commonly used metric, win rate, is only related to ranking accuracy when the model is similar to the original model.  This work offers valuable insights into the challenges and limitations of current LLM alignment practices.

> This figure shows the low ranking accuracy of both reference and preference-tuned LLMs across several datasets.  The left panel displays the accuracy of various pre-trained or fine-tuned reference models, while the right panel shows the accuracy of models fine-tuned using preference learning algorithms (RLHF and DPO).  The 'X' represents the expected accuracy by random chance for each dataset.  The figure highlights that even state-of-the-art preference-tuned LLMs struggle to achieve high ranking accuracy, which is typically below 60%.

> This table shows the idealized ranking accuracy and the actual ranking accuracy achieved by several open-access preference-tuned LLMs on the Alpaca Farm validation dataset. The idealized accuracy is calculated assuming perfect optimization of the DPO or RLHF objective with ground-truth preference data.  The table highlights a significant discrepancy between the idealized and achieved ranking accuracies, indicating a substantial 'alignment gap'.  Minimum, median, and maximum values for the idealized accuracy are presented due to the influence of the hyperparameter Œ≤.





### In-depth insights


#### DPO's Limits
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aims to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly optimizing a ranking objective.  However, this paper reveals crucial **limitations** of DPO.  The authors demonstrate that even with perfect preference data, DPO struggles to surpass the limitations of the initial reference model.  This is because **DPO is highly sensitive to initial model rankings**, and even small inaccuracies make it extremely difficult for DPO to correct rankings during training, even if it successfully decreases the loss.  This is theoretically proven and empirically demonstrated.  **The practical implication is that DPO is less effective than commonly assumed**.  Furthermore, the paper shows that even under idealized conditions, the accuracy of the learned model is limited by the accuracy of the initial model. This reveals a significant gap between the idealized and observed ranking accuracies, highlighting the **alignment challenges** and the need for more robust preference learning methods.

#### Alignment Gap
The concept of "Alignment Gap" in the context of this research paper refers to the **discrepancy between the observed ranking accuracy of preference-tuned LLMs and their theoretically achievable accuracy**.  The authors demonstrate that state-of-the-art models significantly underperform compared to an idealized model perfectly optimizing the DPO or RLHF objective, even on the training data. This gap is attributed to the limitations of the DPO objective, which struggles to correct even small ranking errors in the reference model. The paper highlights the importance of understanding this gap to improve preference learning algorithms and achieve better alignment between LLMs and human preferences. **A key finding is that simply minimizing the DPO loss doesn't guarantee improved ranking accuracy.** The authors also show a strong correlation between ranking accuracy and win rate when the model is close to the reference model, further illuminating the relationship between on-policy and off-policy evaluation metrics in preference learning.

#### Win Rate/Rank
The analysis of win rate versus ranking accuracy reveals a complex relationship between these two metrics. **Early in the training process, both metrics are highly correlated**, suggesting that improving the model's ability to correctly rank preferred outputs also leads to a higher win rate. However, **as training progresses and the model diverges from the reference model**, this correlation weakens, and the metrics may even become anti-correlated. This suggests that solely optimizing ranking accuracy may not be sufficient for effective alignment because a high-ranking model may not generate superior outputs in practice. The study highlights **the importance of considering both win rate and ranking accuracy** when evaluating and fine-tuning LLMs. The discrepancy between these two metrics suggests that DPO may not fully align the model with human preferences, especially when the model significantly deviates from the reference model, motivating further investigation into the tradeoffs between on-policy and off-policy methods.

#### RLHF/DPO Tradeoffs
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) represent two dominant approaches in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.  **RLHF**, an on-policy method, trains reward models using human feedback on LLM generations, then fine-tunes the LLM using reinforcement learning to maximize reward.  **DPO**, an off-policy method, directly optimizes a model to rank outputs according to human preferences.  A key tradeoff lies in their sample efficiency: RLHF is computationally expensive, requiring iterative human feedback and LLM generations. DPO, in contrast, is more sample-efficient, leveraging a pre-existing dataset of human preferences. However, **DPO's performance is heavily reliant on the quality of the initial model's rankings**, struggling to correct even minor ranking errors and potentially suffering from a significant alignment gap. Conversely, RLHF, while computationally intensive, can potentially overcome this limitation by iteratively refining the model. Therefore, the optimal choice between RLHF and DPO depends on the specific context, balancing computational resources with the desired alignment accuracy and the quality of the initial model.

#### Future Work
The paper's "Future Work" section suggests several promising avenues for further research.  **Extending theoretical results** to more realistic settings, such as those with imperfect reference models or noisy preference data, is crucial.  **Analyzing the optimization dynamics** of preference learning algorithms, especially concerning the relationship between ranking accuracy and win rate, could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of various training methods.  **Investigating the interplay between alignment techniques and other calibration metrics** would enhance the understanding of model behavior.  The study also emphasizes the need for **more robust and comprehensive evaluation metrics**, beyond ranking accuracy and win rate, for a deeper understanding of model alignment. Finally, exploring **the generalizability of the findings to different datasets and model architectures** would broaden the scope and impact of the research.
