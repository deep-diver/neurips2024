However, accurately modeling motion in real-world videos, with various speeds and occlusions, has been challenging. Existing methods either linearly combine bidirectional flows or directly predict flows for discrete timesteps, lacking the ability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. \nThis paper introduces Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling (GIMM), a new method for VFI that addresses these issues.  GIMM uses a motion encoding pipeline to extract motion features from bidirectional flows, effectively capturing motion priors. Then, it implicitly predicts arbitrary-timestep optical flows using an adaptive coordinate-based neural network, achieving improved accuracy compared to prior art.  The **integration of GIMM into existing flow-based VFI frameworks** is straightforward and leads to state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "ZlpJLQsr2v/podcast.wav"}
