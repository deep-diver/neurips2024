### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Discovering formulas for mathematical constants is a longstanding challenge. Existing AI methods struggle due to the need for infinite precision, lacking effective distance metrics to guide automated searches. This research introduces a new methodology to overcome this challenge by focusing on the convergence dynamics of the formulas, rather than their numerical values. This enables the development of novel metrics and a clustering algorithm to automatically categorize and identify mathematical formulas based on shared dynamical properties.

The proposed method was tested on a massive dataset of polynomial continued fractions, resulting in the identification of numerous known formulas and the discovery of previously unknown formulas for fundamental constants such as œÄ, ln(2), Gauss', and Lemniscate's constants. **The success showcases the potential of this dynamic-based approach to accelerate mathematical discovery and opens exciting opportunities for developing more general AI models capable of generating formulas with desired mathematical properties.**

> üîº This figure illustrates the two-stage methodology for clustering and labeling polynomial continued fraction (PCF) formulas based on their dynamical metrics.  The first stage involves filtering, feature extraction (using dynamical metrics like irrationality measure and convergence rate), and clustering PCFs with similar metric values. The second stage focuses on labeling clusters by identifying known formulas (anchors) within them and validating the association of other formulas in the cluster to the same constant.  If no anchors are found, further investigation using PSLQ is employed to attempt labeling or identifying inner-cluster connections. The flowchart details the decision-making process at each step.

> Figure 1: Systematic clustering and labeling of formulas by dynamical metrics. Our methodology analyzes Polynomial Continued Fractions (PCFs) in two main stages. Clustering: (a) Filter degenerate PCFs. (b) Evaluate PCFs and extract their dynamics-based metrics (section 3). (c) Choose the best few metrics and use them to cluster the data. Labeling: In every cluster, look for PCFs known in the literature and use them as anchors. (d) If anchors are found in the cluster, validate that they do not contradict, i.e., relate to different constants. (d.1) If all anchors are in agreement, choose a random subset of other points in the cluster and use PSLQ to validate that they also relate to the same constant. If the validation is successful, the cluster is labeled. If not, the cluster should be split. (d.2) If the anchors relate to different constants, the cluster should be split ‚Äì return to step c for finer clustering of the data. When focusing on a specific cluster, the best metrics could be different than those for the full dataset. (e) If no anchor is found in a certain cluster, attempt to label by (e.1) choosing a small subset of PCFs in the cluster and running a PSLQ search for each of them against a large set of potential constants. If a connection is found, the cluster now has an anchor ‚Äì return to step d. (e.2) If an anchor is still not found, attempt to connect a sample of data points within the cluster using PSLQ. If successful, conclude that the cluster is correct, but has no identified constant. Define a new label for that cluster. If PSLQ failed to connect points within the cluster, return to step c for finer clustering. If no further refinement is appropriate, flag the cluster for further analytical investigation.

### In-depth insights


#### Formula Discovery
The formula discovery process detailed in this research paper centers on **unsupervised learning techniques** applied to a vast dataset of polynomial continued fractions (PCFs).  A key innovation is the utilization of **dynamical metrics**, derived from the convergence behavior of PCFs, rather than solely relying on numerical values.  This approach allows for the **automated clustering** of formulas based on their underlying mathematical structure.  The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this method by discovering **both known and novel formulas** for mathematical constants like œÄ, ln(2), and others, highlighting its potential to accelerate mathematical discovery by identifying patterns and relationships within large datasets.  A significant advancement is the development of the **Blind-Œ¥ algorithm**, enabling the efficient calculation of the irrationality measure even without prior knowledge of the formula's limit, which is crucial for evaluating the quality of formula candidates. The success of this methodology hinges on the innovative use of dynamical properties to overcome the challenges of precision-based formula discovery in mathematics, which are often intractable using traditional methods.

#### Dynamic Metrics
The concept of "Dynamic Metrics" in this research paper is crucial.  Instead of relying on the final numerical value of a mathematical formula, **the authors focus on the convergence behavior of the formula itself**. This novel approach uses metrics that capture the formula's convergence dynamics, such as the convergence rate and the irrationality measure.  This shift allows the researchers to define a meaningful "distance" between formulas, even if their limits are unknown or very close, which is a major hurdle in traditional formula discovery. This emphasis on **dynamical systems theory** enables the discovery of new mathematical relationships and opens up avenues for automated formula discovery.  **The Blind-Œ¥ algorithm**, designed to efficiently compute the irrationality measure without prior knowledge of the formula's limit, is a significant contribution.  The effectiveness of this methodology is demonstrably shown through the identification of both known and novel formulas for several mathematical constants, highlighting the power of focusing on the dynamics rather than the static final value.

#### Blind-Œ¥ Algorithm
The Blind-Œ¥ Algorithm presents a novel approach to calculating the irrationality measure (Œ¥) of a continued fraction without prior knowledge of its limit.  This is a significant advancement because traditionally, calculating Œ¥ requires knowing the limit, which is often unknown for many continued fractions.  **The algorithm cleverly bypasses this limitation by focusing on the convergence behavior of the sequence of rational approximations, comparing terms within the sequence rather than comparing to the (unknown) limit.**  This innovative approach allows for the efficient and accurate calculation of Œ¥ across a large dataset of continued fractions, enabling a powerful new metric for clustering and analyzing formulas for mathematical constants.  **The algorithm's core strength lies in its ability to extract crucial information about the convergence dynamics, not directly from the limit itself, but from the internal structure and progression of the sequence, enabling the discovery of previously hidden mathematical structures and formulas.** The Blind-Œ¥ Algorithm is instrumental to the paper's success in discovering both known and novel formulas for mathematical constants.

#### Unsupervised Learning
The application of unsupervised learning in this research is **pivotal**, enabling the discovery of novel mathematical formulas for constants without relying on predefined labels or human intervention.  The methodology leverages **dynamical metrics** derived from the convergence behavior of continued fractions, capturing subtle patterns and relationships that traditional methods overlook.  This unsupervised approach allows for the **identification and clustering of formulas**, unveiling previously unknown structures and connections among mathematical constants.  The **automated clustering** based on these dynamic metrics proves effective in grouping formulas related to the same constant, showcasing the power of this unsupervised approach in discovering hidden relationships within the dataset and facilitating further theoretical investigations.  The success of this technique, particularly in finding new formulas, suggests the potential of **unsupervised learning** as a powerful tool for accelerating mathematical discovery.

#### Future Directions
Future research should explore applying this dynamic metric methodology to broader classes of continued fractions and other mathematical structures.  **Extending to higher-degree polynomials and different types of continued fractions** could unlock new patterns and formulas.  The development of a generative model capable of producing formulas with specific mathematical properties is a crucial next step.  **A focus on enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the clustering and formula validation methods** is needed for handling larger datasets.  **Formal proofs for the numerous novel formulas discovered** would significantly advance mathematical understanding. Exploring the connections between the dynamic metrics, mathematical properties of the constants, and underlying mathematical structures warrants further investigation. This interdisciplinary approach combining AI and mathematics holds immense potential for accelerating mathematical discovery and generating new conjectures.

Analysing the convergence of polynomial continued fraction (PCF) formulas provide dynamical metrics that prove useful for their automated clustering and identification. (a) Irrationality measure Œ¥ vs. PCF depth, for two example formulas of the constants cot(1) and the Silver Ratio. The Œ¥ of these constants is known to be 1 (green dashed lines). The blue dots show the numerical convergence of Œ¥ (Eq.3) to the correct value. The red dots show the evaluated Œ¥-Predictor formula (Eq.5), following the numerical Œ¥ very closely in the Silver Ratio formula, while taking a completely different (and much slower) trajectory in the cot(1) formula; yet both converge to the correct value Œ¥ = 1. For the purposes of clustering, Œ¥predicted was evaluated at n = 109, providing an accurate estimation for Œ¥. (b) Œ¥n (n = 1000) vs. the limit value for PCFs in our dataset. While Œ¥ values seem to follow a pattern, the limit value distribution does not contain relevant information (the higher density of PCFs near the Y axis arises from the small coefficients of the polynomials in our dataset). Our dataset contains 913,056 irrationality-proving formulas, most of which are not yet linked to any known constant. (c) Exponential growth coefficients of ·æ∑n and of Œµ(n) for PCFs with deg(B) = 2deg(A). Note the surprising ‚Äúband-structures‚Äù that this view reveals.
