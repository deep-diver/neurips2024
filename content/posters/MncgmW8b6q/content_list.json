Specifically, AI methods were not effective in creation of formulas for mathematical constants because each such formula must be correct for infinite digits of precision, with \u201cnear-true\u201d formulas providing no insight toward the correct ones. Consequently, formula discovery lacks a clear distance metric needed to guide automated discovery in this realm. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for categorization, characterization, and pattern identification of such formulas. The key to our methodology is introducing metrics based on the convergence dynamics of the formulas, rather than on the numerical value of the formula. These metrics enable the first automated clustering of mathematical formulas. We demonstrate this methodology on Polynomial Continued Fraction formulas, which are ubiquitous in their intrinsic connections to mathematical constants [Lagarias, 2013, Bowman and McLaughlin, 2002, Laughlin and Wyshinski, 2004], and generalize many mathematical functions and structures. We test our methodology on a set of 1,768,900 such formulas, identifying many known formulas for mathematical constants, and discover previously unknown formulas for $\\pi$ $\\mathrm{in}(2)$ , Gauss', and Lemniscate's constants. The uncovered patterns enable a direct generalization of individual formulas to infinite families, unveiling rich mathematical structures. This success paves the way towards a generative model that creates formulas fulfilling specified mathematical properties, accelerating the rate of discovery of useful formulas.

Unfortunately, such formulas are notoriously hard to find on-demand, often relying on a mathematician's profound intuition. Part of the challenge is the lack of a well-defined ^distance', or a metric, between a formula and a given constant. i.e., there is no known way to tell whether a formula is nearly accurate. The formula either works, or it does not. In other fields of science, a prediction accurate to 10o0 digits is precise enough for any practical need. However, in mathematics, if the $1001^{\\mathrm{st}}$ digit is wrong, the formula is incorrect and gives no insight regarding a correct formula.

However, we find that it is not sufficient to use the parameters of the polynomials, and not even the numerical limit of the continued fraction. Instead, we find that it is the dynamics of the continued fraction generated by these polynomials, rather than any direct function on their coefficients, which provides the most useful metrics for analysis. In other words, we find that the useful underlying metrics to extract from each data point are embedded within the intricate progression of the sequence created by the formula, rather than the explicit numerical value (limit) of that formula, or the coefficients defining it.

We expect these dynamical metrics to provide a \u201cfingerprint\u2019 for wider families of formulas and perhaps even for the mathematical constants themselves. This approach was directly applied in this work to higher polynomial degrees, larger polynomial coefficients, and can be expanded to continued fractions not based on polynomials. Looking beyond continued fractions, metrics that are derived from the dynamics of a numerical calculation of certain formulas are an especially good fit for automated computer-assisted investigations. Such metrics can be measured for a variety of mathematical structures, including ones whose evaluation is iterative or recursive, that are defined via an infinite sum, or any other process which produces rational approximants. Any such mathematical structure can be measured, clustered, and identified using the proposed method - treating the generating functions as a black box.

This family of formulas is broader than continued fractions, yet they can be described by the same metrics as PCFs. Another type of mathematical structure successfully analyzed using the same method is hypergeometric functions, showing the applicability of our measurement-clustering-generation approach to a bigger family of mathematical functions. This generalization can be useful in a wide variety of contexts, such as investigations of integral formulas (e.g., Beukers-type integrals [Beukers, 1979, Dougherty-Bliss et al., 2022, Brown and Zudilin, 2022]).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u00b7 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b)  If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
