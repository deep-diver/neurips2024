However, existing machine learning methods often struggle with the high dimensionality and specific symmetries of such data, hindering precision and data efficiency. The limitations of off-the-shelf architectures highlight the need for specialized methods that incorporate the underlying physical symmetries to improve results. \nThis research paper introduces the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a novel architecture designed specifically for high-energy physics problems. **L-GATr leverages geometric algebra to represent the data, incorporating the inherent Lorentz symmetry of relativistic kinematics.** It combines this with a Transformer architecture to ensure versatility and scalability. The effectiveness of L-GATr is demonstrated through three distinct particle physics tasks: a regression problem using QFT amplitudes, a classification problem for top quark tagging, and a generative modeling task for reconstructing particles.  **L-GATr either matches or surpasses the performance of various existing state-of-the-art models in all three applications.**", "affiliation": "Heidelberg University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "X34GKv8sYT/podcast.wav"}
