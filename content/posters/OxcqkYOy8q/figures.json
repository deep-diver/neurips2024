The left panel shows two distributions p1 and p2, which are very similar to each other.  Despite this,  the score functions s1 and s2 are quite different. The right panel illustrates how the probability that the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) has error larger than 0 scales with the number of samples (m). This probability is significantly higher for the L2 metric compared to the proposed Do metric.", "section": "Hardness of Learning in L2"}, {"figure_path": "OxcqkYOy8q/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Given \u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c4, (+) samples from either p1 = (1 \u2013 \u03b7)N(0, 1) + \u03b7\u039d(-R, 1), or p2 = (1 \u2013 \u03b7)N(0, 1) + \u03b7\u039d(R, 1) we will only see samples from the main Gaussian with high probability, and cannot distinguish between them.
