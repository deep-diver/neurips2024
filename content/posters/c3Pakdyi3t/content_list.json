Such re-training requires access to the data used to train the LoRA for the original base model. This is especially problematic for commercial cloud applications where the LoRA modules and the base models are hosted by service providers who may not be allowed to host proprietary client task data. To address this challenge, we propose Trans-LoRA\u2014 a novel method for lossless, nearly data-free transfer of LoRAs across base models. Our approach relies on synthetic data to transfer LoRA modules. Using large language models, we design a synthetic data generator to approximate the datagenerating process of the observed task data subset. Training on the resulting synthetic dataset transfers LoRA modules to new models. We show the effectiveness of our approach using both LLama and Gemma model families.

Despite their great progress, even the largest and strongest LLMs [16] still significantly benefit from fine-tuning to downstream tasks for enhanced specialization and consequent performance improvement [50]. However, it is commonly difficult to gain the computational, memory, and disk resources needed for fine-tuning and later hosting fine-tuned large-scale models, especially when serving model customization APIs to numerous clients. Thus, a common approach to LLM finetuning is to use parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, the most widespread of which are Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) [31, 43], which only train a small number of additional parameters while freezing the base pre-trained model. Using PEFT can lead to more efficient and compute-friendly training without sacrificing final performance [31], as well as allowing efficient serving of large quantities of LoRA models \u2018orbiting\u2019 a common base model \u2018core\u2019 [56]. However, a LoRA model fine-tuned for a specific task is tied to its base model and cannot be used without it, and also cannot be directly transferred to another base model. This is quite problematic in commercial cloud model serving scenarios, where after the base model needs to be deprecated and replaced by a newer LLM, the (potentially thousands of) clients\u2019 LoRA models need to be switched to the new base model. Naively, one would have to re-train all the LoRA models, which, understandably, is a logistic nightmare given that clients\u2019 proprietary task data is commonly confidential and is not retained on the servers of the cloud service provider. Naturally, asking all of the clients to re-send the data for re-training or retraining on their own is neither scalable nor practical.

Surprisingly, in Trans-LoRA we demonstrate it is possible to obtain an effective transfer curriculum for achieving these feats using synthetic data generated from the target base model. However, this by itself is insufficient to obtain the specified guarantees. We discover in Trans-LoRA that we need to additionally train a discriminator model for synthetic data filtering. Our proposed discriminator is trained on a mix of synthetic and real data alongside the source LoRA model and is optimized to ensure the filtered synthetic data most closely resembles the source LoRA training distribution.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
