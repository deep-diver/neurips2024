This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of NATs' effectiveness.\nThe researchers propose EfficientNAT (ENAT) to overcome these limitations. **ENAT disentangles the processing of visible and masked tokens**, encoding visible tokens independently and decoding masked tokens using these encodings.  **It also prioritizes computation of critical tokens and maximizes reuse of pre-computed token representations.** This approach significantly improves efficiency and performance on benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "PhsYFyTeHr/podcast.wav"}
