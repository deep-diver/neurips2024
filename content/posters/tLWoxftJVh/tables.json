The FID, a metric evaluating image quality and similarity, is calculated for different noise levels (\u03c3) and using three types of fine-tuning loss functions (l1, l2, and LPIPS) during the training of the Consistency model.  Lower FID scores indicate better image quality and a higher degree of similarity between purified and original images.  The table helps demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPIPS loss function in preserving semantic information and generating better purified images than l1 or l2 loss.", "section": "3 Theoretical Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "tLWoxftJVh/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Certified Accuracy of Consistency Purification for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64.", "description": "This table presents the certified accuracy results of the Consistency Purification method and several baseline methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64 datasets.
