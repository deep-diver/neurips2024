However, ECG signals are often corrupted by noise and artifacts, or may be incomplete due to missing leads, presenting challenges for accurate analysis.  Existing methods often struggle with these issues. This necessitates robust methods to clean up noisy data and infer complete information from incomplete datasets.\nThis research proposes BeatDiff, a novel denoising diffusion model, specifically designed to generate high-quality 12-lead ECG heartbeats.  They then showcase how BeatDiff can act as a prior for a Bayesian inverse problem, and incorporate it into EM-BeatDiff, an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to solve conditional generation problems.  EM-BeatDiff effectively tackles various ECG challenges such as noise and artifact removal, reconstruction of missing leads, and unsupervised anomaly detection, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Ecole Polytechnique", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "Eu0nYM4BPo/podcast.wav"}
