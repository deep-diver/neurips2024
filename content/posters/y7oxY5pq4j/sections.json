It would represent scene geometry, materials, and lighting implicitly using neural networks, **avoiding explicit geometric representations**.  This approach could offer advantages in handling complex scenes with intricate details and subtle lighting effects.  A key challenge for such a method would be **accurate disentanglement of scene components**, particularly in high-illumination scenarios with strong shadows and specular reflections, where separating lighting from surface properties becomes significantly difficult.  Robust handling of indirect illumination and accurate visibility estimation are crucial for success.

Traditional methods often struggle with intense lighting conditions, resulting in artifacts like shadow baking into albedo and roughness estimations.  ACES's ability to nonlinearly map colors across a wide dynamic range is key, **mitigating information loss** associated with extremely bright or dark areas.

A regularized approach aims to mitigate these inaccuracies by employing techniques that constrain the visibility estimations, making them more robust and less susceptible to noise or artifacts. This might involve incorporating prior knowledge about the scene geometry, using regularized loss functions during training, or employing advanced techniques like octree tracing instead of computationally expensive sphere tracing.  **The key benefit is improved accuracy in BRDF estimation**, enabling a clearer separation of scene components, which directly translates to higher-quality and more physically plausible material reconstruction.  By introducing regularity, the overall quality of the reconstructed albedo and roughness is greatly improved, enabling more robust and realistic relighting applications."}}, {"heading_title": "High-Illumination BRDF", "details": {"summary": "High-illumination BRDF presents a significant challenge in inverse rendering due to the complexities introduced by strong lighting conditions.  **Shadows and specular reflections interfere with accurate material decomposition**, making it difficult to decouple environment lighting, albedo, and roughness.  Existing methods often fail to accurately model visibility in these scenarios, leading to artifacts such as shadow baking in albedo and roughness estimates.  Addressing this necessitates robust techniques, for example, advanced tone mapping (like ACES) to handle the wide dynamic range of intensities and regularized visibility estimation to improve the accuracy of direct and indirect light calculations, enabling more precise BRDF recovery.  **Robust solutions require careful consideration of indirect illumination**, incorporating accurate visibility modeling to avoid inaccuracies caused by shadow interference.
