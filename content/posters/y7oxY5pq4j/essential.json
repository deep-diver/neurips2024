These scenes present challenges because shadows and reflections complicate the separation of object properties (albedo, roughness) from lighting conditions, leading to inaccurate results.\nRobIR tackles this by employing ACES tone mapping to handle intense lighting non-linearly.  A regularized visibility estimation method improves the accuracy of direct light modeling. Combining these techniques with indirect radiance field modeling allows accurate decoupling of environment lighting and object materials.  This leads to high-quality albedo and roughness reconstruction, even in scenes with strong shadows and reflections, outperforming existing implicit inverse rendering methods.
