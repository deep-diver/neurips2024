We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top $95\\%$ quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry; for example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations.

For example, Sclar et al. [2023] revealed that subtle variations in prompt templates in few-shot settings can lead to significant performance discrepancies among several open-source LLMs, with differences as large as 76 accuracy points in tasks from the SuperNaturalInstructions dataset [Wang et al., 2022]. Additionally, they report that the performance of different prompt templates tends to correlate weakly between models. This finding challenges the reliability of evaluation methods that depend on a single prompt template. To measure LLMs sensitivity, the researchers suggested calculating a \u201cperformance spread,\u201d which represents the difference between the best and worst performances observed. Mizrahi et al. [2023] conducted a complementary analysis using state-of-the-art models and subsets of BigBench and LMentry [Srivastava et al., 2022, Efrat et al., 2022]. The authors arrive at similar conclusions with respect to LLMs\u2019 sensitivity to the used prompt templates and empirically showed that the LLM ranking considering different formats are usually weakly or intermediately correlated with each other. As a solution to the lack of robustness in LLM evaluation, the authors propose the use of summary statistics, as the average performance, for LLM evaluation. Some other works, e.g., Voronov et al. [2024], Weber et al. [2023b,a], show that even when in-context examples are given to the models, the prompt templates can have a big impact on the final numbers, sometimes reducing the performance of the strongest model in their analyses to a random guess level [Voronov et al., 2024]. In a different direction, Shi et al. [2024] acknowledges that different prompt templates have different performances and proposes using best-arm-identification to efficiently select the best template for an application at hand.

To accelerate evaluations for classification tasks, Vivek et al. [2023] suggested clustering evaluation examples based on model confidence in the correct class. More recently, Maia Polo et al.

Sentence transformers in general might not be most suitable for embedding prompt templates, thus we also consider fine-tuning BERT [Devlin et al., 2019] as an embedder. To do so, we use evaluation data for all examples and prompt formats from a subset of LLMs (these LLMs are excluded when assessing the quality of our estimators) and fine-tune bert-base-uncased to predict $Y_{i j}$ as in (3.3).

We acknowledge that obtaining such evaluation data for fine-tuning might be expensive, however, it might be justified in some applications if these embeddings provide sufficient savings for future LLM evaluations.   \n\u2022 Discrete prompt covariates. For BBH and LMentry, we coded a heuristic function that captures frequently occurring differences in common prompting templates. Examples of such covariates are the number of line breaks or the count of certain special characters (e.g., dashes or colons).

Using covariates obtained via fine-tuning the BERT model provides some further improvements, for example, for extreme quantiles and small evaluation budget settings on MMLU.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
