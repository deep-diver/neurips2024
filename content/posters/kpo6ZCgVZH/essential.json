However, **sampling from constrained domains (where the data must lie within a specific region)** presents a significant challenge. Existing methods, such as those based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or variational inference (VI), often struggle with constrained domains, either being computationally expensive or lacking accuracy.  They often rely on specific assumptions or intricate techniques tailored to particular types of constraints, limiting their widespread applicability.\nThis paper introduces a novel method called Constrained Functional Gradient Flow (CFG) to address this challenge.  CFG **utilizes a functional gradient flow framework with a key boundary condition to ensure particles stay within the constrained region**.  This approach provides a general solution applicable to domains with various shapes and constraints. The authors provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the method's convergence and further support their claims with extensive experimental results across multiple constrained machine learning tasks. CFG proves to be superior to existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "kpo6ZCgVZH/podcast.wav"}
