Existing methods, like ZeRO, offer limited options and often struggle with heterogeneous network setups where intra-group communication outperforms inter-group communication. This paper aims to address these limitations by proposing improved strategies for LLM training.\nThe authors introduce PaRO (Partial Redundancy Optimizer), a novel framework that offers refined model state partitioning (PaRO-DP) and tailored collective communication (PaRO-CC). PaRO-DP provides more trade-off options between memory and communication costs compared to existing strategies, improving training speed. PaRO-CC optimizes communication by leveraging intra- and inter-group performance differences. Experiments show that PaRO improves training speed significantly, up to 266% faster than ZeRO-3.  The paper provides a guideline for selecting the best PaRO strategy, ensuring minimal performance loss.", "affiliation": "Ant Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "4Un2TD9bNe/podcast.wav"}
