The p-values indicate whether the difference in amounts sent between these two game types is statistically significant for each LLM.  A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests a statistically significant difference, indicating that the LLM's behavior changes between the two game contexts.", "section": "E Statistical Testing"}]
