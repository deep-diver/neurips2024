Existing methods primarily focus on sequence-level tasks like function prediction or text generation from sequences, often neglecting residue-level details. In contrast, MMSite directly tackles the identification of active sites at the residue level, utilizing both protein sequences and rich multi-attribute textual descriptions to achieve a more comprehensive and detailed understanding.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "XHdwlbNSVb/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the MMSite framework.
