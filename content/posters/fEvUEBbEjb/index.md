### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and membership inference attacks, creating a tension between robustness and privacy. Adversarial training enhances robustness but compromises privacy. Visual prompting, a model reprogramming technique, improves model performance, but its security remains unexplored. This paper investigates the adversarial robustness and privacy of label mapping visual prompting (LM-VP) models. 

The study finds that the standard adversarial training approach is ineffective for LM-VP models. Instead, it proposes transferred adversarial training, which achieves a better balance between transferred adversarial robustness and privacy. The research highlights that the choice of pre-trained models significantly influences LM-VP's white-box adversarial robustness. This work offers a novel perspective on adversarial robustness and privacy, particularly in the context of visual prompting, and provides valuable insights for developing more secure and private AI models.

### In-depth insights


#### LM-VP Security
LM-VP, a label mapping visual prompting model, presents a unique security challenge. While it leverages pre-trained models for downstream tasks, enhancing efficiency, its security posture is intricately tied to the pre-trained model's inherent robustness and susceptibility to adversarial attacks and membership inference attacks (MIAs).  **Standard adversarial training (AT), effective for general models, proves ineffective for LM-VP**, highlighting its unique vulnerabilities. The choice of pre-trained model significantly influences the LM-VP model's white-box adversarial robustness, with no clear pattern emerging across different models.  However, **transfer AT, which trains against adversarial examples generated by another model, offers a promising approach.** This technique demonstrably enhances LM-VP's transferred adversarial robustness while simultaneously improving its privacy, showcasing a favorable trade-off against the inherent limitations of standard AT.  This implies that the LM-VP model's security needs to be considered in the context of the chosen pre-trained model and a targeted approach like transfer AT.

#### Transfer AT
The concept of "Transfer Adversarial Training" (Transfer AT) in the context of LM-VP models presents a novel approach to enhancing adversarial robustness.  **Instead of training the LM-VP model directly on adversarial examples generated from the same model**, Transfer AT leverages a separate, pre-trained model to generate adversarial samples. This method is particularly valuable because it addresses the limitations of standard adversarial training within the LM-VP framework. **Standard AT often proves ineffective for LM-VP, as the process of generating adversarial examples relies on the pre-trained model, leading to a domain shift that negatively impacts performance.** Transfer AT circumvents this by using a different model for generating adversarial samples, thus better mimicking real-world attacks and transferring learned robustness to the LM-VP model.  **The results consistently demonstrate that Transfer AT achieves a superior trade-off between transferred adversarial robustness and privacy compared to standard AT.** The approach offers a robust and efficient way to improve the security of LM-VP models in various applications, emphasizing its practical implications for real-world deployment. This technique highlights **the significance of considering the transferability of adversarial robustness**, moving beyond the constraints of within-model adversarial training.

#### Privacy Tradeoffs
The concept of 'privacy tradeoffs' in the context of machine learning models, particularly deep learning models, is a critical area of research.  **Improved adversarial robustness, often achieved through techniques like adversarial training (AT), frequently comes at the cost of reduced privacy.**  AT enhances a model's resistance to adversarial attacks by incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. However, this very process makes the model more susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which can reveal sensitive information about the training data.  This inherent tension arises because AT often leads to overfitting on adversarial examples, increasing the model's reliance on specific training data points, thus making it more vulnerable to MIAs.  Therefore, researchers must carefully consider the balance between security and privacy when employing techniques like AT.  **Finding methods that enhance robustness without significantly compromising privacy is a key challenge in the field.**  This necessitates innovative approaches that go beyond traditional adversarial training and explore more privacy-preserving mechanisms for strengthening the security of machine learning systems.

#### Pre-trained Impact
The choice of pre-trained models significantly impacts the performance of Label Mapping Visual Prompting (LM-VP) models.  **Pre-trained models' inherent adversarial robustness heavily influences the white-box adversarial robustness of LM-VP**, meaning that a robust pre-trained model leads to a more robust LM-VP model, while a less robust pre-trained model results in a weaker LM-VP model.  This highlights the crucial role of the pre-trained model selection process in achieving desired robustness.  Standard adversarial training is shown to be ineffective in improving the adversarial robustness of LM-VP models and may even degrade their performance, emphasizing the limitations of applying standard adversarial training techniques to this novel model architecture.  In contrast, **transfer adversarial training demonstrates a superior trade-off between transferred adversarial robustness and privacy**, consistently across various pre-trained models, showcasing its effectiveness as a suitable approach for enhancing the security of LM-VP models.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could focus on several key areas.  First, **a deeper investigation into the interplay between pre-trained model architecture and LM-VP model robustness and privacy** is warranted.  The study reveals a strong influence of pre-trained models, suggesting the need for a more nuanced understanding of this interaction. Second, **developing more robust and efficient label mapping techniques** is crucial. While the current method shows promise, exploring alternative methods that could improve efficiency and performance would significantly enhance the LM-VP framework.  Third, **the exploration of different adversarial training techniques beyond standard and transfer AT** is essential to further improve the adversarial robustness and privacy trade-off.  Investigating alternative attack methods and defense strategies could reveal additional insights. Fourth, **expanding the evaluation to a wider range of datasets and vision tasks** is needed to verify the generalizability of the LM-VP model's properties.  Finally, **thorough theoretical analysis is needed to provide deeper insights and improve the interpretability of the LM-VP framework.** This could involve developing new theoretical frameworks or adapting existing ones to better understand and explain the observed phenomena.
