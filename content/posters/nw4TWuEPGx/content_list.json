Such intrinsic dynamics should self-organize and self-sustain in the face of fluctuating inputs and biological noise, including synaptic turnover and cell death. An example of such dynamics is the formation of sequences, a ubiquitous motif in neural activity. The sequencegenerating circuit in zebra finch HVC provides a reliable timing scaffold for motor output in song and demonstrates a remarkable capacity for unsupervised recovery following perturbation. Inspired by HVC, we seek a local plasticity rule capable of organizing and maintaining sequence-generating dynamics despite continual network perturbations. We adopt a meta-learning approach introduced by Confavreux et al, which parameterizes a learning rule using basis functions constructed from pre- and postsynaptic activity and synapse size, with tunable time constants. Candidate rules are simulated within initially random networks, and their fitness is evaluated according to a loss function that measures the fidelity with which the resulting dynamics encode time. We use this approach to introduce biological noise, forcing meta-learning to find robust solutions. We first show that, in the absence of perturbation, meta-learning identifies a temporally asymmetric generalization of Oja\u2019s rule that reliably organizes sparse sequential activity. When synaptic turnover is introduced, the learned rule incorporates an additional form of homeostasis, better maintaining sequential dynamics relative to other previously proposed rules. Additionally, inspired by recent findings demonstrating plasticity in synapses from inhibitory interneurons in HVC, we explore the role of inhibitory plasticity in sequence-generating circuits. We find that learned plasticity adjusts both excitation and inhibition in response to manipulations, outperforming rules applied only to excitatory connections. We demonstrate how plasticity acting on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can better shape excitatory cell dynamics to scaffold timing representations.

How might organization of useful circuit dynamics be established and maintained throughout life without the need for feedback? Recent work suggests self-organized computations, once established, can accelerate learning and improve performance when experience is limited: Nicola and Clopath [1] demonstrated that a stable high dimensional time signal could improve a network\u2019s performance on sequential motor tasks (Fig. 1a). Najarro and Risi [2] learned Hebbian plasticity that orchestrated spontaneous walking behavior in quadruped agents; similar work has shown architectural priors increase the sample efficiency and generalization of RL approaches to locomotion [3, 4]. Additionally, in RL settings, supplying agents with a time input permits them to adopt time-dependent policies [5]. The ability of computational primitives, such as timing representations, to self-organize is challenged by the shifting structure of neural circuits.

We employ meta-learning, a supervised method to learn learning rules [19\u201323], in order to discover rules that self-organize a sequence. Our approach stems from a rich history of learning local plasticity rules, including rules that extract representations from data [24], enhance artificial agent performance on familiarity and navigation tasks [2, 25], and explore biologically-plausible replacements or complements to backpropagation [19, 20, 26]. In this study, we parameterize the space of plasticity rules with a basis of activity- and synapse size-dependent terms. The set of coefficients weighting these terms and associated time constants are adjusted to minimize a loss function.

Further, dependence on these terms persisted when we trained networks with turnover on $\\mathrm{E{\\rightarrow}E}$ synapses or $\\mathrm{I}{\\rightarrow}\\mathrm{E}$ synapses (Supp. Fig. 6). As expected, we also found that solutions depended heavily upon terms that acted upon $\\mathrm{E}{\\rightarrow}\\mathrm{I}$ and $\\mathrm{I}{\\rightarrow}\\mathrm{E}$ synapses, but this plasticity was more difficult to interpret due to increased trial to trial variability in the discovered rules.

We used discovered learning rules to organize sequences and then performed three varieties of in silico manipulations of individual E cells within these networks. In the first, we scaled down the excitatory afferents to the targeted E cell by $50\\%$ (Fig. 6a, diagram). In the second, we scaled up the same connections by $50\\%$ (Fig. 6b). In the last, we increased the rate of the targeted cell\u2019s input Poisson process by a factor of 10 (Fig. 6c). This final manipulation mirrored the viral insertion of NaChBac to $\\mathrm{HVC}_{\\mathrm{RA}}$ neurons in Wang et al., which causes these cells to become hyper-excitable [18, 45, 46].

Scaling down the excitatory afferents initially causes both the peak amplitude and duration of response to decrease (Fig. 6d; light purple points), but these responses largely recover after ${\\sim}25$ activations of the network (Fig. 6d; blue points). When we instead strengthened E afferents to the targeted cell, we found these connections weakened and recurrent inhibition strengthened in compensatory fashion (Fig. 6b). In these networks, we found that targeted E cell responses that were initially lengthened with increased peak amplitude (Fig. 6e; light purple points) were reduced back to their pre-perturbation values of duration and amplitude (Fig. 6e; black points show initial responses; blue points, responses after 25 activations). Finally, rendering the targeted E cell hyper-excitable caused it to scale down its excitatory afferents and increase its recurrent inhibition in a manner that restored its typical firing pattern. In summary, plasticity rules on excitatory afferents and recurrent inhibition operate in tandem to maintain the firing pattern of the neuron (see Supp. Sec. 7 for additional details).

We hypothesized that distinct plasticity on different sets of synapses might confer a robust representation of time if these rules governed distinct aspects of the desired network function. For instance, within our HVC-like circuit, peak firing of E neurons might be controlled by $\\mathrm{E{\\rightarrow}E}$ plasticity while total activity might be controlled by $\\mathrm{I}{\\rightarrow}\\mathrm{E}$ plasticity. Since excitatory and inhibitory inputs to E cells differ in their timescales (E inputs are transient while I inputs are relatively tonic), we reasoned plasticity on both sets of synapses should increase the control of the postsynaptic response. While it is already known that multiple plasticity mechanisms can sharpen the responses of neurons to stimuli [37], prior work has not addressed whether similar plasticity might be leveraged to preserve the timing of such responses, which is crucial to timing representations. To explore this, we constructed a simplified model of a single neuron responding to a broad range of excitatory inputs, characterized by varying peak amplitudes and durations, and a tonic inhibitory input. We compared the responses of the neuron when both the excitatory and inhibitory input synapses (Fig. 6h) evolved under plasticity rules to responses produced when only the excitatory synapse evolved under a plasticity rule (Fig. 6g) and found the two rule model was able to better constrain the duration, peak amplitude, and timing of the postsynaptic response the E neuron (Fig. 6i-j; see Supp. Sec. 8 for full description of reduced model).

Training $\\mathrm{E{\\rightarrow}E}$ plasticity (plasticity on all synapses) across 10 networks in batch typically required 24 (72) hours of compute on 30 Cascade Lake or Ice Lake Intel CPU cores to yield reasonable solutions. Two, meta-learning tends to generate different solutions based on the seed; due to the expensive nature of each trial, we did not carry out enough trials to claim full knowledge of the solution space. Three, the plasticity rules learned were quite dense in our choice of basis, limiting interpretation, and we ultimately employed perturbations to better understand the critical terms. Four, the choice of basis limits the space of discoverable rules; for instance, we did not include feedback-modulated plasticity in this study.

Metalearning discovers a temporally asymmetric (STDP-like) generalization of Oja\u2019s rule that organizes and maintains sparse, sequential activity out of initially random connectivity, which outperforms other models of sequence generation in the presence of synaptic turnover by permitting flexible rescaling of inputs to restore dynamics. Additionally we found that plasticity rules learned on all sets of synapses outperform plasticity rules applied only to E connections.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
