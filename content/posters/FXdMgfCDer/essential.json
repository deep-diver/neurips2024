Existing methods often struggle with these issues, leading to degraded performance.  This paper focuses on Graph Class-Incremental Learning (GCIL), where the goal is to learn a sequence of tasks, each with unique classes, from graph data without using task IDs during inference.  This is challenging because the model needs to separate classes from different tasks while remembering previous information, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.\nThis research proposes a novel Task Profiling and Prompting (TPP) approach to address these challenges. The method introduces a task profiling technique based on Laplacian smoothing to accurately predict the task ID of a test sample. This helps to isolate the classification space for each task, eliminating inter-task class separation. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, the TPP approach learns a small, task-specific graph prompt for each task, effectively creating separate classification models for each task without requiring data replay. Experiments demonstrate that TPP achieves 100% task ID prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 18% in average accuracy across four benchmark datasets. Importantly, TPP is completely forget-free.", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Continual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "FXdMgfCDer/podcast.wav"}
