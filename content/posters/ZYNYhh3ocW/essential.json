Recent attempts using Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) show promise but suffer from issues like overfitting, structural bias, and imbalanced learning, leading to inaccurate and inefficient circuit generation.  These problems result in a high sensitivity to hyperparameters and an inability to scale to large, complex circuits. \nThe proposed T-Net framework addresses these challenges.  It uses a multi-label transformation of training data, a novel triangle-shaped network architecture aligned with circuit structure, and a regularized training loss to prevent overfitting and ensure efficient learning. An evolutionary algorithm assisted by reinforcement learning further optimizes the generated circuits.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate T-Net's superiority in accuracy, scalability, and performance over existing DNAS methods and traditional techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results.**", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Hardware Design"}, "podcast_path": "ZYNYhh3ocW/podcast.wav"}
