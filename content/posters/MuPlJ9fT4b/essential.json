This requires a large amount of PDE data, which needs expensive numerical PDE solutions.  This partially undermines the original goal of avoiding these expensive simulations. This paper addresses this data efficiency challenge in scientific machine learning by proposing unsupervised pretraining for PDE operator learning to reduce the need for training data.\nTo improve the data efficiency, the authors propose unsupervised pretraining for neural operator learning on unlabeled PDE data without simulated solutions to reduce the need for training data with heavy simulation costs. Physics-inspired reconstruction-based proxy tasks are used to pretrain neural operators.  In addition, they propose a similarity-based method for in-context learning that allows neural operators to flexibly leverage in-context examples without incurring extra training costs or designs. Extensive empirical evaluations on various PDEs demonstrate that their method is highly data-efficient, generalizable, and outperforms conventional vision-pretrained models.", "affiliation": "Simon Fraser University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MuPlJ9fT4b/podcast.wav"}
