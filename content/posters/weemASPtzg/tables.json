We note that all studies assume linear transformation.", "description": "This table compares the identifiability results of the current paper's proposed methods with those of existing works in multi-node interventional causal representation learning (CRL).  It shows the latent model type (Linear or General), the intervention type (Soft, Hard, or do), the main assumptions made about the interventions, and the resulting identifiability (ID) achieved (Perfect ID, ID up to ancestors, or ID up to surrounding).  The table highlights that the current paper achieves comparable or better identifiability guarantees even under more relaxed assumptions regarding the interventions.", "section": "Multi-node interventional CRL"}, {"figure_path": "weemASPtzg/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: UMNI-CRL for a linear causal model with UMN interventions (mean \u00b1 standard error)", "description": "This table presents the results of the UMNI-CRL algorithm on linear causal models with unknown multi-node interventions.  It shows the performance of the algorithm for both soft and hard interventions, across different numbers of latent variables (n) and observed variables (d).  The metrics reported include the structural Hamming distance (SHD) measuring the difference between the true and estimated causal graphs, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) assessing the accuracy of latent variable recovery, and the incorrect mixing ratio (l) indicating the proportion of incorrectly mixed latent variables in the recovery.  The results are averaged over 100 runs and include standard errors.", "section": "5 Simulations"}]
