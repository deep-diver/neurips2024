The results are for n = 5 latent nodes and d = 20 observed variables, 104 samples, and for average of 100 runs. (a): SHD(Gtc, G) versus SNR (soft) and SHD(G, \u011c) versus SNR (hard). (b): Incorrect mixing ratio lsoft versus SNR (soft) and lhard versus SNR (hard).", "description": "This figure shows the sensitivity analysis of the UMNI-CRL algorithm for quadratic latent causal models.  Two subfigures are presented: (a) shows the structural Hamming distance (SHD) between the true DAG (for hard interventions) or its transitive closure (for soft interventions) and the estimated DAG, plotted against the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  (b) shows the incorrect mixing ratio, a measure of latent variable recovery accuracy, also plotted against the SNR, for both soft and hard interventions.", "section": "B Additional simulations"}]
