One-shot pruning offers a solution by removing redundant weights without retraining, but current methods often rely on heuristics, leading to suboptimal compression.  This creates a bottleneck for efficient LLM deployment and scalability. \nThis research introduces ALPS, a novel optimization-based framework that addresses these issues. ALPS uses operator splitting and a preconditioned conjugate gradient method for efficient pruning and theoretical convergence guarantees.  **ALPS outperforms state-of-the-art techniques**, achieving significant reductions in test perplexity and improvements in zero-shot benchmarks, particularly in the high-sparsity regime.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "0lBx844upd/podcast.wav"}
