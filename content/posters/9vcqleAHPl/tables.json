The instance-level and bag-level AUC (Area Under the Curve) are reported for each method and setting, providing a measure of classification performance.  The final row shows the results of a fully supervised method for comparison, representing the upper bound of performance.", "section": "4.3 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "9vcqleAHPl/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Results on TCGA-RENAL dataset", "description": "This table presents the results of the few-shot WSI classification experiments on the TCGA-RENAL dataset. It compares the performance of FAST against several other methods including zero-shot CLIP, Tip-Adapter-F, and Tip-Adapter, across different numbers of bag shots and instance shots. The metrics used are instance-level AUC and bag-level AUC for each of the three renal cancer subtypes (ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC), as well as the mean AUC across all subtypes.

It shows the impact of including the cache branch, making the feature cache learnable, incorporating the prior branch, and using a learnable label cache on the model's performance, measured by instance-level and bag-level AUC. By systematically removing components, the table highlights the relative importance of each part of the FAST architecture for achieving high accuracy.", "section": "4.3 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "9vcqleAHPl/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Results of FAST on the CAMELYON16 dataset under different core set sizes", "description": "This table presents the results of the FAST model on the CAMELYON16 dataset under different core set sizes.

For each combination, the instance-level and bag-level AUC scores are shown for different core set sizes (100, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000). This helps to illustrate the model's performance in relation to the amount of data used to build its cache. The purpose is to find an optimal core set size that balances model performance and resource usage.", "section": "4.3 Experimental Results"}]
