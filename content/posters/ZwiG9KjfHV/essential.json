Existing quantization methods, aimed at reducing these costs, struggle with severe performance degradation when bit-widths are extremely low.  This is mainly due to drastic precision loss at extremely low-bit weight representation, impacting the linear projection, a crucial operation in LLMs.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the paper introduces OneBit, a novel 1-bit model compressing framework. OneBit utilizes a novel 1-bit parameter representation to better quantize LLMs and incorporates an effective parameter initialization method.  Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that OneBit achieves robust training processes and good performance (at least 81% of non-quantized performance) using only 1-bit weight matrices, outperforming previous 2-bit baselines. This significantly advances extremely low-bit LLM deployment.", "affiliation": "Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval,Harbin Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ZwiG9KjfHV/podcast.wav"}
