The training times are presented for three datasets: Communities and Crime, Law School, and Adult.  For each dataset, the average training time is reported for three methods: DP-postproc (the proposed method), ADW-1 (Agarwal et al. method trained with both labeled and unlabeled data), and ADW-2 (Agarwal et al. method trained only with labeled data). The table provides a comparison of the computational efficiency of the proposed method relative to the existing method.", "section": "Numerical illustration"}, {"figure_path": "UtbjD5LGnC/tables/tables_28_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The average training time (in seconds) for one \u025b threshold.", "description": "This table shows the average training time, in seconds, required for one epsilon threshold using three different methods: DP-postproc, ADW-1, and ADW-2.
