Among these methods, quantization replaces the float numbers with quantized ones and substitutes multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with integer arithmetic for significant efficiency enhancement. Due to the intractability of the training data and the unbearable training cost of LVLMs, post-training quantization [33, 36, 48] is leveraged to reduce bitwidths of weights and activations, which only searches rounding functions with a small calibration set with frozen network parameters. Searching rounding functions that minimize model prediction errors causes extremely high search cost due to the large space, and conventional methods [12, 29] sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing the activation discretization errors.

The instruction-following ability and multi-modal representations extracted by LVLMs are general across tasks, which are usually applied in a wide variety of multi-modal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering [45, 28], embodied instruction following [1] and robot navigation [2, 16]. Early attempts introduced rich commonsense in LLMs to visionlanguage representation learning, which effectively exploits LLMs by treating visual inputs as conditional information. In particular, BLIP [25, 24] leveraged data filtering techniques to enhance performance in tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning. While these models exhibited extraordinary vision-language reasoning capabilities, their zero-shot abilities were limited due to the absence of explicit instruction during training. Recent studies including LLaVA [31] and InstructBLIP [30] aim to enhance LVLMs\u2019 zero-shot capabilities by aligning them more closely with human preferences. They finetuned LVLMs with visual instruction samples where the models were required to complete the human instruction according to the visual information. Despite the notable performance gains from the large model sizes, the computational complexity and the storage cost prohibit LVLMs from being deployed in resource-limited devices for realistic deployment.

Recently, post-training quantization (PTQ) [11, 33, 44, 10, 42, 41] has aroused extensive interest, which leverages a small calibration set to search for the optimal threshold in rounding functions with significantly reduced data demand and optimization cost. Choukroun et al. [7] minimized the $l_{2}$ distance between quantized and full-precision tensors to mitigate evident task performance degradation, while Zhao et al. [52] duplicated channels with outliers and halved their values to reduce clipping loss without amplifying rounding errors. Liu et al. [33] preserved relative ranking orders of self-attention in vision transformers to mitigate information loss during post-training quantization and explored a mixed-precision quantization strategy based on the nuclear norm of attention maps and features. Zero-shot PTQ further extends the boundaries for efficiently quantizing neural networks without real image data. Cai et al. [5] optimized pixel values of generated images to align sample batch statistics with those of batch normalization (BN) layers in full-precision networks. Li et al.

As far as we know, we are the first to complete multi-modal LVLMs under W4A4 setting, so we conduct a series of baseline methods by combining the conventional state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods for fair comparison. For weight quantization, we follow the experiment setting of AWQ [29] and QLoRA [9]. Meanwhile, as the activations in language modal exhibit significant variations in value range across different channels, we reproduce RPTQ [50] with per-channel activation quantization. As the activation distribution appears larger variance across different tokens in vision modal, we utilize per-token quantization following Outlier Suppression [44].

AWQ searched the optimal scale to protect the salient weight channels and decreased the quantization errors for weight quantization, while weight-only quantization scaling significantly increased outlier in activation and led to significant quantization loss. QLoRA with RPTQ employs sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors. However, ignoring cross-layer dependency of discretization errors fails to acquire the optimal rounding strategy and degrades the performance significantly. On the contrary, our Q-VLM mines the cross-layer dependency of output distribution across layers and decomposes the large search space from the entire model to blocks containing multiple layers, which minimizes the block-wise discretization errors to avoid suboptimal quantization, and further optimizes the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained search space decomposition. As a result, our method outperforms QLoRA by 2.26 (79.79 vs. 77.53) for answering accuracy in ScienceQA dataset under 4-bit in LLaVA-7B model. The computational cost remains the same for baseline methods and our Q-VLM due to the stored rounding parameters.

The proxy of entropy prompts the efficient and optimal block partition for rounding function search with the goal of minimizing the block-wise discretization errors.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
