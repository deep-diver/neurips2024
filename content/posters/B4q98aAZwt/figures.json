The SMILES generation part uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) based policy (\u03c0\u03b8) to generate SMILES strings representing molecules. These molecules are then evaluated using a reward function (O(x)) and are stored in a buffer (D). The graph-based genetic search part takes molecules from the buffer (D) as a population, applies crossover and mutation operations, and generates offspring molecules which are then evaluated and added to the buffer (D). The policy (\u03c0\u03b8) is trained using GFlowNet training to sample molecules proportionally to their rewards, which helps refine the molecules to higher-reward ones.", "section": "3 Genetic-guided GFlowNets"}, {"figure_path": "B4q98aAZwt/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The optimization curve of the average scores of Top-10 over the score function calls.
