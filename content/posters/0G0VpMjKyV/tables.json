It highlights the ambient dimension independence achieved by the proposed method under the assumption of Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition and approximate restricted strong smoothness (RSS). In contrast, prior work exhibits a dependence on the ambient dimension under the assumption of strong convexity and \u03b2-smoothness.
