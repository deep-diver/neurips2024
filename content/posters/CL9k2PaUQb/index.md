### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Recovering the true order of preferences from many individuals is challenging.  Existing methods like Condorcet's Jury Theorem often fail when the majority is misinformed. The Surprisingly Popular (SP) algorithm provides a solution but requires complete preference information, making it impractical for large datasets. This limits its use in many real-world problems involving crowdsourcing and preference aggregation.

This research introduces two new versions of the SP algorithm, Aggregated-SP and Partial-SP, that only need partial preference data.  They demonstrate superior performance in recovering ground truth rankings compared to traditional methods via large-scale crowdsourced experiments. Furthermore, the study provides theoretical analysis offering sample complexity bounds, showcasing the methods' efficiency and practical applicability. These contributions make a significant advance toward efficient and robust preference aggregation in various domains.

> This figure shows the workflow of a participant in the study. Participants first provide consent and preview the experiment before completing a tutorial. They then answer six questions using elicitation format 1, followed by a review and six more questions using the same format. Then they submit their answers and take a quiz before proceeding with elicitation format 2. The process is repeated with six questions, review, and then a second tutorial.

> This table presents a sample preference profile used to illustrate common voting rules.  It shows four different preference orderings (A>B>C>D, B>C>D>A, C>D>B>A, and D>C>B>A) held by varying numbers of voters (44, 24, 18, and 14 respectively). This data is used in the paper to demonstrate the application and outcomes of the various voting aggregation methods, including Borda count, Copeland method, Maximin method, and Schulze method.





### In-depth insights


#### SP Voting: Partial Prefs
The heading "SP Voting: Partial Prefs" suggests a focus on adapting the Surprisingly Popular (SP) voting algorithm to handle situations where voters provide only partial preference rankings instead of complete rankings.  This is a significant advancement because eliciting complete rankings can be impractical, especially when dealing with a large number of alternatives. **The core idea is to leverage the wisdom of the crowd by incorporating both votes and predictions about other voters' votes, even with incomplete information.** This approach likely explores different ways to elicit partial preferences (e.g., top-k choices, pairwise comparisons, approval sets), and investigates how to effectively aggregate this partial information to recover the underlying ground truth ranking. **The effectiveness of the method is crucial, especially when a majority of voters might be misinformed.** The study will probably compare the performance of different aggregation strategies for partial preferences against the original SP and traditional voting methods, likely using metrics like Kendall-Tau distance or Spearman's rho.  The research likely also examines the sample complexity required to achieve accurate results under the partial preference setting.  **Scalability is also a key concern**, as the original SP algorithm doesn't scale well to many alternatives, so this work probably addresses that issue. Overall, this research aims to make SP voting more practical for real-world applications by handling the limitations of obtaining complete rankings from voters.

#### MTurk Experiment
The MTurk experiment section of the research paper is crucial for validating the claims about the effectiveness of the proposed SP voting algorithms.  It details the **large-scale crowdsourcing effort** conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, involving numerous participants who provided both votes and prediction information regarding different datasets (geography, movies, paintings).  The methodology and setup are key elements for assessing the validity and reliability of the results, including how participants were recruited, compensated, and instructed. The description should clearly state **elicitation formats** used (Top, Approval(t), Rank), which affect the complexity and cognitive load on the participants.  The analysis of the collected data includes the **assessment of different metrics** (Kendall-Tau, Spearman's correlation, Pairwise/Top-t hit rates) comparing SP algorithms to traditional methods and highlighting the statistical significance of the findings.  Finally, the **discussion of participant behavior**, including the proportion of experts and their influence on the results, is important, especially when related to models of voter behavior.  The quality and depth of this section significantly impacts the credibility and overall contribution of the research.

#### Mallows Model Fit
A Mallows model fit, in the context of rank aggregation, assesses how well the model's parameters capture the observed voting patterns.  A good fit indicates that the model accurately represents the voters' preferences.  This is crucial because it validates the model's assumptions and justifies its subsequent use in tasks like ground truth recovery or preference prediction. **Key aspects of evaluating a Mallows model fit include assessing its likelihood, examining residual errors, and comparing it to alternative models.**  Model parameters, such as the dispersion parameter, reveal the level of noise in the voting data. A low dispersion indicates highly consistent preferences, while high dispersion suggests significant variability. **Further analysis involves comparing the model's predictions to actual rankings** using metrics such as Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho, which measure the rank correlation between predicted and actual rankings.  A high correlation signifies a better fit. The concentric mixtures of Mallows model, often used to accommodate both expert and non-expert voters, adds complexity to the fitting process. Evaluating its fit requires considering the contribution of each mixture component to the overall likelihood and assessing the separation between expert and non-expert distributions. Ultimately, **successful Mallows model fitting enables the development of robust rank aggregation algorithms** providing theoretical guarantees and accurate predictions, which are particularly important when dealing with partial or noisy preference data.

#### Sample Complexity
The section on Sample Complexity provides **theoretical guarantees** for the Surprisingly Popular (SP) voting algorithms, particularly focusing on their scalability with partial preferences.  It delves into the number of samples needed to reliably recover the true ranking, a crucial aspect for practical applications.  The analysis likely involves intricate probabilistic models, potentially utilizing a concentric mixtures of Mallows model, to represent voter behavior and the noise inherent in partial rankings. Key to understanding the sample complexity is the interplay between the proportion of expert voters (those with accurate information), noise levels (the dispersion in non-expert votes), and the size of the sampled subsets of alternatives. **Theoretical bounds** are derived to provide insights into the relationship between these factors and the number of samples required for accurate ranking recovery. This analysis helps determine the feasibility and efficiency of the SP algorithms in large-scale applications with limited data or partial information.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending the Surprisingly Popular (SP) voting framework beyond the binary expert/non-expert categorization to encompass more nuanced scenarios such as informed but not expert voters or the presence of malicious actors.  **Investigating the impact of different preference elicitation methods** on the efficiency and accuracy of SP voting under various conditions (e.g., varying levels of noise, different group sizes) would be valuable.  **Theoretical analysis to determine sample complexity** under alternative probabilistic models could also refine understanding and provide stronger theoretical guarantees. Finally, applying the SP algorithm to high-stakes real-world problems such as election polling or online content moderation, while carefully considering ethical implications, could demonstrate its practical efficacy and reveal valuable insights.
