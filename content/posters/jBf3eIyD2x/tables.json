It contrasts the performance of the proposed Greedy Coordinate Query (GCQ) attack against the existing Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) transfer attack, highlighting the improved effectiveness of GCQ in this specific task. The results are shown for different combinations of proxy models and target models, revealing variations in transferability and attack success rates.", "section": "4.2 Comparison to other attacks"}, {"figure_path": "jBf3eIyD2x/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of various attacks in the harmful string setting", "description": "This table compares the success rates of different attack methods in generating harmful strings.
