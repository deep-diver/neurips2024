Concept-based explanations provided by inherently interpretable methods are generally more comprehensible than post-hoc approaches. However, most existing methods treat concept features alone as the determination of the predictions. This approach overlooks the intrinsic feature embeddings present within medical images, thus degrading accuracy [44]. Moreover, while these concepts are human-understandable, they lack semantic meanings, thus questioning the faithfulness of their interpretability [39]. To improve further human trust, several recent works [3] aim to leverage syntactic rule structures to concept embeddings. However, there are still several potential issues. First, unlike CBMs, current concept models with logical rules mainly focus on the supervised concept case, which is quite strict for biomedical images as concept annotation is expensive. Second, while current concept models (with logical rules) provide interpretations via concepts, we found that the importance of these concepts is misaligned with other explanations, especially the explanation given by saliency maps [70, 16].

This also establishes alignment between image information and concept embeddings by utilizing a concept encoder, leading to the derivation of predictive concept scores. Furthermore, we align concept semantics with concept embeddings by incorporating neural symbolic layers. Thus, we effectively align image information with concept semantics and concept saliency maps, achieving comprehensive multidimensional alignment.

The Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) [35] has emerged as an innovative deep-learning approach for image classification and visual reasoning by incorporating a concept bottleneck layer into deep neural networks.

Secondly, CBM extensively depends on meticulous dataset annotation. To solve these problems, researchers have delved into potential solutions. For example, [7] have extended CBM into interactive prediction settings by introducing an interaction policy to determine which concepts to label, ultimately improving the final predictions. Additionally, [41] has addressed the limitations of CBM by proposing a novel framework called Label-free CBM, which offers promising alternatives.

Research on the interpretability of deep learning in medical image processing provides an effective and interactive approach to enhancing medical knowledge and assisting in disease diagnosis. User studies involving physicians have revealed that doctors often seek explanations to understand AI results, especially when the outcomes are related to their own hypotheses or differential diagnoses [60]. They also turn to explanations to resolve conflicts when their judgments differ from those of AI [6], thereby enhancing the intelligence of medical models. Previous studies have visualized lesion areas through methods such as heatmaps [59] and attention visualization [12], aiding in the identification of lesion regions and providing visual evidence. Additionally, utilizing language model-based methods like LLM or LMM to generate medical reports complements the interpretation of model results (ChatCAD [58], XrayGPT [52], Med-PaLM [49]). Saliency maps have emerged as the most common and clinically user-friendly explanation for medical imaging tasks [53, 68, 69]. Recent research underscores the importance of understanding the pivotal features influencing AI predictions, particularly when clinicians must compare AI decisions with their own clinical assessments in cases of decision incongruity [54].

In concept reasoning rules, we can deduce the model classification criteria, further explaining the model decisions. Additionally, during the evaluation process, we can generate saliency maps for the data, providing an intuitive understanding of how pixels in the image influence the image classification result aligned with semantic concepts.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
