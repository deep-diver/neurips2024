Panel (a) shows the actual physical system, where the output signal g(u) is the sum of the ideal transformation f(u) and various errors:  device imperfections (\u0394fdev), laser jitter (\u0394fjit), and other unmeasurable errors (\u03b7). Panel (b) shows the computer modeling and training process. The ideal transformation f(u) is combined with a deep neural network (DNN) that learns to compensate for the errors based on input-output training data pairs and quantifiable physical information (e.g., the range of \u0394fjit and the value of \u0394fdev). The integration of this physical information improves the precision of the simulation and reduces discrepancies between experimental and simulated results.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "QhUXU2ilIG/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: (a) Schematic of an image classification optical neural network with an error-compensating DNN incorporating quantitative physical information.
