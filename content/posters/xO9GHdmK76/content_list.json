Therefore, the feature representation space scaling is limited to increase model channel width and depth [14, 19]. Nevertheless, this scaling approach has witnessed model development from the very small-scale MLPs or LeNet[20] to the recent huge ConvNext V2 [41].

Interaction in neural networks has undergone a long period of change.

And then, as the potential of the attention mechanism was realized, model development is towards an element-wise multiplication way. This trend is punctuated by the emergence of models such as Non-Local [39], Transformer [38], and ViT [11]. Recent insights suggest that the crux of the attention mechanism lies in high-order information interactions, rather than the mechanism of \"Attention\" itself [4, 35, 43]. This revelation has spurred the development of innovative neural network architectures. For example, HorNet [35], QuadraNet [44] and MogaNet [22] examines high-order models from the perspective of spatial interactions through multiplication-integrated architecture design.

The combination of Gaussian processes with neural networks to create Deep Kernel Learning [40] adjusts model complexity based on data while maintaining Bayesian inference. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) [18] framework establishes a direct connection between infinitely wide neural networks at initialization and kernel methods. Specifically, NTK shows that as the width grows, the network\u2019s training dynamics can be described by a kernel function, linking the neural network\u2019s behavior to that of kernel methods.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
