Traditional methods often lack interpretability and require subject-specific models and extensive trials. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting a novel framework. \nThe framework integrates 3D brain structures with visual semantics using Vision Transformer 3D and Large Language Models. This unified feature extractor efficiently aligns fMRI features with multiple levels of visual embeddings, eliminating the need for subject-specific models and enabling extraction from single-trial data.  **The integration with LLMs enhances decoding, enabling tasks such as brain captioning, complex reasoning, and visual reconstruction.** The method demonstrates superior performance across these tasks, enhancing interpretability and broadening the applicability of non-invasive brain decoding.", "affiliation": "Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ohi00YhT3T/podcast.wav"}
