Existing methods struggle with the high computational complexity of constructing and searching causal orderings. This limits their applicability to real-world problems with numerous variables. \nThe proposed QWO method significantly addresses these scalability issues. It introduces a novel algorithm that efficiently computes the optimal causal graph for a given permutation.  **QWO boasts an O(n\u00b2) speedup over existing methods**, making it highly scalable.  Furthermore, **QWO is theoretically sound and easily integrates with existing search strategies**, enhancing their performance and broadening the range of problems solvable by permutation-based approaches.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments, confirming its scalability and accuracy in various scenarios.", "affiliation": "College of Management of Technology, EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "BptJGaPn9C/podcast.wav"}
