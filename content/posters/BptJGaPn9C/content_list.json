The primary assumptions underpinning QWO are that the underlying causal model is a LiGAM\u2014that is, it assumes linear relationships among variables, additive Gaussian noise, and an acyclic causal graph structure. These assumptions, though common in many applications, restrict the applicability of our method to scenarios where these conditions hold. In real-world datasets, relationships may be nonlinear, noise may not be Gaussian, or the causal graph may contain cycles due to feedback loops or reciprocal relationships among variables. Notably, our experiments indicate that QWO maintains competitive performance even when the Gaussian noise assumption is violated, achieving similar accuracy on models with non-Gaussian noise distributions such as exponential and Gumbel (see Appendix B). However, the acyclicity assumption can be particularly limiting in domains where feedback mechanisms are inherent, such as economics, biology, and control systems, where causal graphs are cyclic and methods designed for acyclic graphs are not directly applicable.
