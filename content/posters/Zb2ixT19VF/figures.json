It starts with relation-aware clustering to model relationships between the child and parent tables. Augmented tables are created by incorporating latent variables from the clustering. A cluster classifier and a conditional group size distribution are used to model the relationship between the latent variables and child table rows.  The diffusion process synthesizes both parent rows and child rows.  The final output is the generation of synthetic data for both tables.", "section": "4.1 Modeling generative process for two-table relational databases"}, {"figure_path": "Zb2ixT19VF/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Smoothed model performance on Berka dataset regarding different k (measured by AVG 2-way), where k = \u221e represents assigning each row a unique class.", "description": "This figure displays the results of an ablation study on the number of clusters (k) used in the ClavaDDPM model.  The x-axis represents the number of clusters (k) on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 1 to infinity (where each row is assigned a unique cluster). The y-axis shows the average 2-way correlation, a metric used to assess the quality of the synthetic data generated by the model. The blue line represents a smoothed version of the data points, which provides a better visualization of the trend. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of the results. This plot helps illustrate the optimal number of clusters for the ClavaDDPM model based on maximizing the average 2-way correlation.", "section": "D.2 Selecting Number of Clusters k"}, {"figure_path": "Zb2ixT19VF/figures/figures_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: DCR distributions of four selected tables.
