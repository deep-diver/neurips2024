The results are shown for various values of the alpha parameter (\u03b1) and for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Lower FID scores indicate better image generation quality.  The table also includes results for the IWAE (\u03b1=0) and standard VAE (\u03b1=1) baselines for comparison.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "HfQF8LoLhs/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) on CIFAR-10 and CelebA.
