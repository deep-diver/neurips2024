However, KL divergence has limitations, notably its tendency to underestimate variance, leading to suboptimal results. Recent works have explored alpha-divergence, a more general family of divergences that offers flexibility in adjusting the trade-off between accuracy and variance, but a theoretical understanding of its asymptotic properties has been lacking. This research directly addresses this gap.\nThis research focuses on the convergence properties of alpha-divergence minimization algorithms.  It establishes sufficient conditions to guarantee convergence to a local minimum at a geometric rate, particularly for exponential families. The paper also introduces a novel unbiased algorithm that overcomes the limitations of previous biased gradient estimators.  This unbiased approach is proven to converge almost surely to a local minimum with a given convergence rate. The work then extends the algorithm to variational autoencoders (VAEs) and presents a detailed empirical analysis demonstrating the improved performance of the novel algorithm over existing methods for both toy and real datasets, providing detailed proofs of convergence and rates.", "affiliation": "Telecom Sud-Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "HfQF8LoLhs/podcast.wav"}
