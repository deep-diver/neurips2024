Current methods struggle to achieve satisfactory adaptation to unseen target datasets because of geometric misalignment between the source and target domains.  There are also constraints on resources, such as training models and collecting annotations.\nThe proposed UDGA framework addresses these issues.  **It introduces Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint**, which leverages the strong association between multiple views to reduce geometric misalignment.  It also incorporates **Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation**, handling unfamiliar targets with limited labeled data while maintaining source domain knowledge.  Experiments on large-scale benchmarks show that UDGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "lxuXvJSOcP/podcast.wav"}
