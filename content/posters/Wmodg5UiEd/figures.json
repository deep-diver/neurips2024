The x-axis represents the number of epochs, and the y-axis represents the cumulative regret.  The total number of adversarial feedbacks is set to the square root of the total number of rounds.

For this specific experiment, we employ the \"greedy attack\" method to generate the adversarial feedback. C is selected from the set [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200] (10 adversarial levels).", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between the cumulative regret and the number of adversarial feedback (C) for four different algorithms: MaxInp, COLSTIM, MaxPairUCB, and RCDB.  The \"greedy attack\" method was used to generate the adversarial feedback, meaning the adversary only flipped labels for the first C rounds.  The x-axis represents the number of adversarial feedbacks (C), ranging from 20 to 200 in increments of 20. The y-axis represents the cumulative regret.  The figure demonstrates the linear relationship between the cumulative regret and the number of adversarial feedback C, and shows how RCDB consistently demonstrates superior robustness against adversarial feedback compared to other algorithms.", "section": "6.3 Robustness to Different Numbers of Adversarial Feedback"}]
