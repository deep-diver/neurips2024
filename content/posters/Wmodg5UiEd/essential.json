However, human feedback can be unreliable, and even manipulated by adversaries. This paper focuses on contextual dueling bandits, a specific type of machine learning problem where the goal is to learn which of two items is preferred based on observed preferences. The challenge is that an adversary might flip the true preference label to mislead the algorithm. Existing methods often have limitations in handling this adversarial feedback, particularly in scenarios with a large number of actions and contextual information.\nThis research proposes a new algorithm called Robust Contextual Dueling Bandits (RCDB) which addresses the issue of adversarial feedback. RCDB incorporates uncertainty-dependent weights into the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) process. These weights are designed to reduce the impact of potentially unreliable feedback.  The algorithm achieves a near-optimal regret bound, indicating its efficiency in learning preferences accurately even in the presence of adversarial feedback.  The researchers also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RCDB's performance under various types of adversarial attacks, demonstrating its robustness and superiority over existing methods.
