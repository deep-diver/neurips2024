### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning datasets suffer from **label noise**, where the assigned labels for images are incorrect, thereby degrading model performance. Existing methods to address this problem either require strong assumptions about the data or rely on memorization effects, limiting their applicability. 



This paper proposes NoiseGPT, a novel method that uses **multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)** to detect and rectify noisy labels. It leverages the observation that clean and noisy examples exhibit different probability curvature patterns when processed by MLLMs.  By designing a token-wise Mix-of-Feature (MoF) technique and an In-Context Discrepancy (ICD) measure, NoiseGPT identifies noisy labels and uses a zero-shot classifier to find better matching labels.  Experiments show that NoiseGPT significantly improves classification accuracy on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of label noise.

### In-depth insights


#### NoiseGPT: Overview
NoiseGPT is a novel approach to label noise detection and rectification in machine learning datasets.  It leverages the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to identify noisy labels by observing a **probability curvature effect**.  Clean examples exhibit smooth probability curves under perturbation, while noisy examples show erratic behavior.  A key component is the token-wise Mix-of-Feature (MoF) technique, which perturbs input data in a way that preserves semantic meaning while enhancing the curvature effect. The resulting In-Context Discrepancy (ICD) measure enables NoiseGPT to distinguish clean from noisy data points effectively.  **NoiseGPT's zero-shot capability is a major strength**, eliminating the need for extensive dataset-specific training.  Furthermore, its integration with existing label noise reduction methods further boosts classification performance. While effective, **limitations include potential bias in detecting certain categories as noisy** and computational costs associated with MLLM inference.  Future improvements could focus on mitigating these biases and optimizing computational efficiency.

#### Curvature Effect
The concept of "Curvature Effect" in the context of label noise detection using large language models (LLMs) is intriguing.  It posits that the probability output of LLMs when presented with perturbed versions of clean and noisy data points will exhibit different curvature patterns. **Clean data points tend to reside on smooth, convex curves**, indicating consistent and predictable LLM responses to minor variations. In contrast, **noisy examples result in fluctuating or non-convex curves,** highlighting the model's sensitivity to perturbations of noisy data. This difference in curvature provides a signal for identifying noisy samples. The effectiveness of this method hinges on the assumption that **MLLMs are inherently optimized to recognize consistent patterns and are thus sensitive to inconsistencies** introduced by label noise. The proposed token-wise Mix-of-Feature technique is a crucial component, generating these perturbed versions for comparison. While the curvature effect itself is an observation rather than a rigorously proven mathematical property, it offers an intuitive and potentially powerful technique for label noise detection. The practicality is further enhanced by the incorporation of a classifier for label rectification, utilizing the zero-shot capabilities of the model for proposing corrected labels.

#### MoF Technique
The Mixture-of-Feature (MoF) technique, as described in the research paper, is a crucial preprocessing step designed to introduce controlled perturbations into input image data.  **Its primary goal is to generate a set of augmented image versions, each subtly different from the original, thereby revealing the underlying structure of the data and making it easier to differentiate between clean and noisy examples**.  The MoF process carefully avoids substantial alterations to the input image's main features to avoid creating mismatches between the image and its corresponding text representation in the context of multi-modal language models. Instead, it focuses on injecting minor noisy signals to highlight subtle nuances and inconsistencies that might otherwise go unnoticed.  By using a token-wise approach, MoF ensures a fine-grained perturbation of the input features, leading to a more precise evaluation of how robust a model's predictions are under various conditions. The effectiveness of MoF in noise detection is a critical aspect of the paper's approach, proving essential for distinguishing between clean and noisy examples based on the probability curvature observed from multi-modal language models.

#### ICL in NoiseGPT
The effectiveness of NoiseGPT hinges on its innovative use of In-Context Learning (ICL).  Instead of relying on extensive retraining, NoiseGPT leverages the pre-trained capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to identify noisy labels.  **ICL allows NoiseGPT to adapt to new, unseen data without needing to adjust its internal parameters**. This is crucial for real-world applications where datasets often contain significant label noise.  The paper highlights how ICL enables the NoiseGPT model to function as a powerful 'knowledge expert' for evaluating the credibility of image-label pairs.  **This zero-shot ability dramatically reduces the need for manual intervention**, thereby improving the efficiency and scalability of noise detection and rectification.  However, the reliance on ICL also presents a limitation; the accuracy of NoiseGPT's assessments is directly tied to the quality and robustness of the underlying MLLM.  Therefore, future work might focus on mitigating the impact of potential biases or inconsistencies within the MLLM on NoiseGPT's performance.

#### Future Works
Future research directions stemming from this NoiseGPT study could explore **improving the robustness of the probability curvature detection method**.  The sensitivity to hyperparameters like MoF weight and perturbation strength should be further investigated to enhance reliability across diverse datasets.  **Incorporating uncertainty quantification** into the label rectification process would provide more nuanced handling of noisy data, especially for borderline cases.   Investigating the **transferability of NoiseGPT to other modalities** such as audio or video would broaden its applicability. Additionally, a **deeper exploration of the underlying reasons behind the differences in probability curvature between clean and noisy data** is warranted, potentially leveraging techniques from explainable AI.  Finally, combining NoiseGPT with state-of-the-art noisy label learning methods in a more sophisticated way may lead to even greater improvements in classification accuracy.  These avenues will provide a more robust and widely applicable framework for addressing the ubiquitous challenge of noisy labels.
