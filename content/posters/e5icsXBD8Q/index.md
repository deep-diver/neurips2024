### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but can memorize sensitive information, raising concerns about privacy and safety.  Unlearning, the process of removing unwanted knowledge from an LLM, is challenging due to the large model size and the potential for damaging unintended knowledge removal. Current methods often involve computationally expensive retraining or fine-tuning, which hinders their application on state-of-the-art models. 

This paper introduces Embedding-Corrupted (ECO) Prompts, a novel unlearning framework.  Instead of directly modifying the LLM, ECO prompts use a classifier to identify prompts containing unwanted information.  These flagged prompts are then 'corrupted' via modifications to their embeddings, learned offline via optimization.  This approach achieves effective unlearning at nearly zero side effects across numerous LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, without increasing computational costs.  The superior efficiency and scalability of ECO offers a promising solution to the unlearning challenge for real-world LLM applications.

> This figure illustrates the ECO (Embedding-Corrupted) Prompts framework for large language model unlearning.  It shows a two-step process: First, a prompt classifier determines if an incoming prompt is within the scope of knowledge to be forgotten. Second, if the classifier flags the prompt for unlearning, the prompt embedding is corrupted using a learned corruption function (parameterized by œÉk) before being fed into the model. This corruption is learned offline via zeroth-order optimization.  The figure highlights that this process does not involve updating the original LLM weights; instead, it modifies the input at inference time to achieve the unlearning effect. The difference between the original output and the unlearned output is displayed to emphasize the result of applying the corrupted prompt.

> This table presents the multiple-choice accuracy results for five different large language models (LLMs) on two benchmark datasets: WMDP (for unlearning) and MMLU (for retaining knowledge).  The table compares the performance of several unlearning methods: original model, prompting, RMU, and the proposed ECO method.  For each model, it shows the accuracy on four sub-tasks of WMDP and the overall accuracy on the MMLU dataset.  The results demonstrate ECO's effectiveness in achieving near random-guessing accuracy on the WMDP (unlearning) task while maintaining performance on the MMLU (retaining knowledge) task, outperforming other baseline methods which often suffer from either low unlearning effectiveness or a significant drop in MMLU performance.





### In-depth insights


#### ECO Prompt Method
The ECO Prompt method is a novel approach to large language model (LLM) unlearning that focuses on manipulating prompts during inference rather than modifying model weights.  **This lightweight method avoids the computational cost and potential risks associated with retraining or fine-tuning large models.** It functions by first employing a prompt classifier to identify whether incoming prompts fall under the scope of the data intended for unlearning. If flagged, these prompts are selectively corrupted in their embedding space using a learned corruption function, preventing unwanted outputs. The use of a classifier enhances the system's efficiency and reduces the risk of unintended side effects, particularly in managing knowledge entanglement. This approach significantly reduces collateral damage and offers a practical solution for efficient and effective unlearning in LLMs, demonstrated by its scalability across various model sizes without additional cost.  **The offline learning of corruption parameters improves both efficiency and precision.**  This technique holds immense promise for promoting responsible and safe usage of LLMs by offering a robust yet minimally invasive unlearning approach.

#### Unlearning Threat Model
A robust unlearning threat model for large language models (LLMs) must consider various attack vectors.  **Adversarial attacks**, aiming to manipulate the model into revealing sensitive information, are crucial.  These could involve carefully crafted prompts designed to elicit specific responses or exploit vulnerabilities in the unlearning process itself. **Data poisoning**, where malicious data is injected into the training or unlearning datasets to compromise the model's integrity, presents another significant risk.  Furthermore, the model's **architecture** itself could be a source of weakness, susceptible to attacks targeting specific parameters or layers to circumvent the unlearning mechanism.  **Implementation weaknesses** in the unlearning algorithm can be exploited, leading to incomplete removal of sensitive data or unintentional side effects. A comprehensive threat model needs to evaluate these risks across different model architectures and unlearning strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of LLMs.

#### Zeroth-Order Opt.
Zeroth-order optimization, in the context of embedding-corrupted prompts for large language model (LLM) unlearning, offers a **computationally efficient alternative** to traditional gradient-based methods.  Instead of directly calculating gradients, which are expensive for large LLMs, it estimates the impact of small changes to the prompt embeddings on the model's output.  This is particularly useful for unlearning because it avoids the need for computationally demanding backpropagation. The **offline learning phase** of this approach is crucial; here, the optimal corruption parameter is determined before interacting with the model, eliminating any additional cost during inference. The strategy offers a compelling way to induce forgetting without directly modifying the model's weights, thus **reducing the risk of catastrophic interference** and enabling scalability to massive LLMs. However, this approach has inherent limitations such as the accuracy of the zeroth-order approximation and its dependence on a well-trained prompt classifier.

#### LLM Unlearning Tasks
LLM unlearning tasks present a significant challenge in aligning AI with human values and safety.  **Effective unlearning necessitates the ability to selectively remove knowledge from large language models (LLMs) without causing unintended side effects or degrading overall performance.**  These tasks can be categorized into various types, each requiring different strategies to address their unique challenges. For instance, **entity unlearning** aims to remove sensitive information about specific individuals, **hazardous knowledge unlearning** focuses on eliminating harmful or misleading information, while **copyrighted content unlearning** tackles the removal of data subject to intellectual property rights. Each task demands precise control and rigorous evaluation methods to ensure that the intended knowledge is successfully removed without compromising the utility of the LLM for other purposes.  The development of robust and reliable unlearning techniques is crucial for establishing trust and promoting the responsible deployment of LLMs.

#### ECO Limitations
The ECO method, while promising for LLM unlearning, has limitations.  **It only works with models accessible via APIs**, relying on a classifier and a corruption function, making it vulnerable to adversaries with direct model access.  **The prompt classifier's accuracy is critical**, and a compromised classifier could lead to ineffective unlearning or unintended information removal. The method's reliance on a limited context window in the prompt classifier might allow attackers to bypass the system using carefully crafted prompts.  **The need for a task-specific surrogate metric (√ªr) limits generalizability**, necessitating a task-agnostic method. Finally, **the method's reliance on prompt corruption rather than direct weight modification raises concerns about its efficacy for certain tasks** and the potential for unintended collateral damage to the model's general functionality.

> This figure shows the trade-off between model utility and forget quality for two different LLMs (Phi-1.5 and Llama-2-7B-Chat) after unlearning different percentages (1%, 5%, and 10%) of the TOFU dataset.  It compares the performance of the ECO method to several baseline unlearning methods (GA, GD, KL, PO, Prompting, NPO, NPO-KL, NPO-RT). The plot demonstrates that ECO achieves high forget quality with no loss in model utility, unlike most baseline methods which either fail to forget sufficiently or suffer significant utility loss.

> This figure illustrates the ECO framework for large language model unlearning.  It shows how a prompt classifier first identifies whether a given prompt should be forgotten (i.e., falls within the scope of the unlearning target).  If it should be forgotten, the framework selectively corrupts dimensions within the tokens' embeddings using a corruption function learned offline (through zeroth-order optimization). This corruption results in an output resembling the model's response had it never been trained on the data to be forgotten. Crucially, this method does not require updating the LLM's weights, just manipulating inputs during the inference stage.

The goal was to assess the model's ability to prevent knowledge recovery after applying ECO (Embedding-Corrupted Prompts) unlearning. The x-axis represents the three sub-categories of the WMDP (Winning at Machine Deception Prediction) benchmark dataset (Bio, Chem, Cyber). The y-axis represents the accuracy of the linear probe.  The dashed line indicates random chance.  The figure demonstrates that before unlearning (Original), the probes achieve relatively high accuracy. After unlearning with ECO (Unlearned), however, the accuracy drops to near random chance, indicating that ECO successfully prevents the extraction of sensitive information directly from the model's logits.

> This table presents the multiple-choice accuracy results of five different Large Language Models (LLMs) on two benchmark datasets: WMDP (for unlearning) and MMLU (for retaining knowledge).  The models were subjected to an unlearning process where a subset of the knowledge (WMDP) was to be removed. ECO is an unlearning method described in the paper, while other methods are baselines (LLMU, SCRUB, SSD, Prompting). The table shows that the ECO method effectively unlearns the targeted information in WMDP (achieving close to random-guess accuracy), while maintaining the original performance on the MMLU dataset. Other unlearning methods in the comparison either perform poorly on the unlearning task, or show a significant drop in performance on the knowledge retention task.
