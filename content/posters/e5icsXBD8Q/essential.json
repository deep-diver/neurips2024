Unlearning, the process of removing unwanted knowledge from an LLM, is challenging due to the large model size and the potential for damaging unintended knowledge removal. Current methods often involve computationally expensive retraining or fine-tuning, which hinders their application on state-of-the-art models. \nThis paper introduces Embedding-Corrupted (ECO) Prompts, a novel unlearning framework.  Instead of directly modifying the LLM, ECO prompts use a classifier to identify prompts containing unwanted information.  These flagged prompts are then 'corrupted' via modifications to their embeddings, learned offline via optimization.  This approach achieves effective unlearning at nearly zero side effects across numerous LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, without increasing computational costs.  The superior efficiency and scalability of ECO offers a promising solution to the unlearning challenge for real-world LLM applications.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Cruz", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "e5icsXBD8Q/podcast.wav"}
