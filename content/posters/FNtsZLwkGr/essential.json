In the study of gene regulatory networks, understanding the relationships between genes is crucial, but existing neural network models often struggle to reveal this information effectively. Current pruning techniques, while useful for making models computationally efficient, often fail to capture the biologically relevant structure. \nThis research introduces DASH, a new framework for pruning neural networks. DASH uses available biological knowledge to guide the pruning process, leading to sparser and more easily interpretable models.  Experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that DASH significantly outperforms standard pruning techniques, resulting in models that are both more accurate and more biologically relevant.  The method is easily adaptable to other biological modeling applications and potentially other scientific domains.", "affiliation": "Harvard University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "FNtsZLwkGr/podcast.wav"}
