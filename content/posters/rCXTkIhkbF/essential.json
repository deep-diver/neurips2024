Traditional weight decay, a common regularization technique, uniformly penalizes model parameters to combat overfitting but can be too restrictive or insufficient for individual parameters. This paper identifies this as a key problem limiting the performance of deep learning models. \nThe authors introduce a novel regularization method called Constrained Parameter Regularization (CPR) that addresses this issue. Instead of uniform penalization, CPR dynamically adjusts the regularization strength for each parameter based on its statistical measure (like L2-norm), ensuring neither over nor under-regularization. Experiments across various deep learning tasks (image classification, language modelling, and medical image segmentation) demonstrated that CPR outperforms traditional weight decay, improving both pre-training and fine-tuning performance. Moreover, CPR achieves this with minimal hyperparameter tuning, showcasing its practicality and efficiency.
