{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses the critical issue of **task interference** in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), a significant challenge hindering the development of truly generalist models.  The proposed MoME architecture offers a novel solution by incorporating a **mixture of vision and language experts**, leading to improved performance across various vision-language tasks. This work will directly benefit researchers seeking to enhance the generalizability and performance of MLLMs, paving the way for more robust and versatile multimodal AI systems.", "summary": "MoME, a novel Mixture of Multimodal Experts, significantly improves generalist Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by mitigating task interference through specialized vision and language experts, achieving superior performance across vision-language tasks.", "takeaways": ["MoME, a mixture of multimodal experts, effectively addresses task interference in MLLMs.", "Adaptive Deformable Transformation and dynamic routing mechanisms enhance the utilization of diverse vision encoders.", "MoME demonstrates significant performance improvements across various vision-language tasks compared to existing generalist MLLMs."], "tldr": "Generalist Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often underperform compared to specialist models due to task interference, which arises from the diverse nature of vision-language (VL) tasks. This paper introduces MoME (Mixture of Multimodal Experts) to tackle this problem.  Existing approaches primarily focus on text-based interference, ignoring the equally crucial visual aspects. \nMoME cleverly tackles task interference through two key components:  MoVE (Mixture of Vision Experts) adaptively aggregates features from different vision encoders and MoLE (Mixture of Language Experts) incorporates sparsely gated experts into LLMs.  Extensive experiments demonstrate MoME significantly enhances the performance of generalist MLLMs across various VL tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in handling task differences in both vision and language modalities.  The adaptive routing mechanisms ensures that MoME dynamically selects the most appropriate experts based on task requirements, highlighting its adaptability and robustness.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Xskl7Da34U/podcast.wav"}
