### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline visual reinforcement learning faces challenges like overfitting and overestimation bias, hindering accurate reward prediction and effective policy learning. Current solutions tend to be too conservative, limiting exploration. This paper introduces CoWorld, a novel model-based approach addressing these challenges. 

CoWorld uses online simulators as "testbeds" for offline policies, transferring knowledge to enhance value estimation. It introduces a cross-domain critic model that mitigates discrepancies in the state and reward spaces between online and offline environments. This approach allows for more flexible constraints in value estimation without impeding exploration, resulting in superior performance compared to existing methods.  Experiments show CoWorld's effectiveness in various benchmark environments.

### In-depth insights


#### Offline Visual RL
Offline visual reinforcement learning (RL) presents unique challenges due to the high dimensionality of visual data and the limitations of offline datasets. **Overfitting** is a major concern, as models trained on limited visual data may fail to generalize well to unseen situations.  **Value overestimation** is another significant problem; offline algorithms often overestimate the value of actions, leading to poor performance when deployed in the real world.  Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of representation learning and value function approximation.  **Model-based methods** that learn a world model from data have shown promise in offline RL, as they can leverage the model to generate synthetic data for training and improve generalization. However, model-based methods are computationally expensive, and their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the learned model.  Approaches incorporating **domain adaptation or transfer learning** from related online environments are also actively being researched to alleviate data scarcity and overfitting issues in offline visual RL.  **Conservative Q-learning** techniques attempt to mitigate overestimation, but can sometimes overly restrict exploration, limiting the potential for discovering high-reward actions.  Future research will likely focus on creating more robust methods for representation learning, value estimation, and data augmentation, possibly combining elements from model-based and model-free approaches to leverage their respective strengths.

#### CoWorld Model
The CoWorld model is a novel model-based transfer reinforcement learning approach designed to address the challenges of offline visual reinforcement learning.  **It tackles overfitting and overestimation issues by leveraging readily available online simulators as auxiliary training domains.**  The core concept involves training separate world models and agents for both the offline (target) and online (source) domains.  **A key innovation is its iterative training strategy focusing on state and reward space alignment between these models.** This alignment ensures that knowledge gained from the interactive source environment can effectively transfer to guide and constrain the learning of the offline agent.  **The resulting 'mild-conservatism' of the target value estimation avoids excessively penalizing exploration, unlike overly conservative approaches.**  CoWorld's modular design allows for flexible integration of multiple source domains, enhancing its generalizability and robustness.  The architecture facilitates robust knowledge transfer across distinct visual and dynamic settings, significantly enhancing the performance of offline visual RL.

#### Domain Alignment
In bridging the gap between offline and online visual reinforcement learning, **domain alignment** is paramount.  It tackles the critical challenge of transferring knowledge learned in an online, readily-available simulator to an offline dataset, which often suffers from limited data and domain shift. This involves carefully aligning both the state and reward spaces between the two domains.  **State alignment** ensures that the latent state representations generated from visual observations in the offline and online environments are comparable, allowing for effective knowledge transfer. **Reward alignment** focuses on adjusting the reward function to achieve consistency between the offline and online domains, ensuring that the agent's learned behavior translates seamlessly.  **Careful consideration of discrepancies in visual inputs, physical dynamics, and action spaces is necessary** to accomplish successful domain alignment.  Ultimately, effective domain alignment is **crucial for leveraging the benefits of online interactions**, leading to the development of more robust and capable offline visual reinforcement learning models.

#### Cross-Domain Transfer
Cross-domain transfer in this context likely refers to the method of leveraging knowledge from a source domain (e.g., a readily available simulator) to enhance learning in a target domain (e.g., a challenging offline visual RL dataset).  **The core idea is to bridge the gap between differing data distributions and task characteristics.** This is crucial because directly applying offline RL algorithms to visual tasks often leads to overfitting and overestimation bias. By carefully aligning representations and rewards between the source and target domains, the method aims to transfer valuable knowledge, improving performance and generalization in the target domain. The effectiveness depends heavily on **successful domain alignment techniques** that minimize cross-domain discrepancies, ensuring that the knowledge transferred is relevant and beneficial, not detrimental.  **A key challenge is balancing the transfer of useful information with avoiding negative transfer** caused by mismatched features or inappropriate mappings.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising directions. **Extending CoWorld to handle more complex visual environments** with significant variations in lighting, viewpoint, or object appearance would enhance its robustness and generalizability.  Investigating the impact of different simulator choices on performance is crucial. **Developing more sophisticated domain adaptation techniques** beyond simple alignment could improve knowledge transfer.  **Analyzing the tradeoffs between computational cost and performance gains** is important, especially when employing multiple source domains.  Finally, applying CoWorld to a wider range of tasks and robotics platforms would demonstrate its broader applicability and practical value.  Further investigation into the theoretical underpinnings of the CoWorld model and a detailed analysis of its limitations would strengthen the research.

> This figure illustrates the core idea of CoWorld in addressing value overestimation in offline RL.  Panel (a) shows the problem of overestimation in offline RL, where the estimated values are higher than the true values, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Panel (b) demonstrates how directly penalizing overestimated values can lead to over-conservatism, preventing exploration of potentially high-reward states. In contrast, CoWorld (c, d) leverages an online auxiliary domain and a cross-domain critic to provide more flexible value constraints. The online critic reassesses the offline policy, resulting in a milder form of conservatism (d) that balances the risk of overestimation and the need for exploration.

The left subplot shows the learning curves for the complete model and the versions with each stage removed, illustrating their individual contributions. The right subplot visualizes the value overestimation problem, comparing the estimated values of different models against the true values.

> This figure shows the sensitivity analysis of three hyperparameters used in the CoWorld model: the domain KL loss scale (Œ≤2), the target-inclined reward factor (k), and the target critic value loss scale (Œ±). Each subfigure shows how the episode return varies with different values of a specific hyperparameter while holding the other two hyperparameters constant.  The plots reveal the optimal range for each hyperparameter to achieve the best performance. For instance, a smaller Œ≤2 value leads to lower episode return, while an excessively larger Œ± value results in value over-conservatism in the target critic.
