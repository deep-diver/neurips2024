The study examines two key aspects: (1) the choice of loss function (L) for training the model, and (2) the use of conditioning dropout (Pdrop) during training. The results show that the proposed semantic-aware Chamfer distance significantly improves performance compared to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and a standard Chamfer distance.
