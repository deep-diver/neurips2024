It is better to misclassify an image labeled as 'excitement' as 'awe' than to misclassify it as 'anger'.

(a) illustrates the concept of emotional distance, highlighting that misclassifying \"excitement\" as \"anger\" is more severe than misclassifying it as \"awe\" due to their psychological proximity. (b) presents a comparison of accuracy (ACC) and emotional misclassification confidence (EMC) across various state-of-the-art models.  While accuracy has improved significantly, EMC has not, indicating that although models classify images correctly more often, the severity of misclassifications remains a concern.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "nLSLbJgL7f/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) Mikel's emotion distance.

Panel (a) shows the workflow of the study:  a set of misclassified images from two different models were presented to participants; participants were asked to choose which of three emotional labels (the incorrect label predicted by one model, the incorrect label predicted by the other model, or \"Indistinct\") was closest to the image's actual emotion.  Panel (b) displays the results: a bar chart showing the number of votes for each option (ACC, Indistinct, and ECC) for each of 30 test images.
