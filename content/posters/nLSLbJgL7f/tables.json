The experiments compare the performance of the proposed method with multiple classical baseline methods.  The performance is measured using three metrics: Accuracy (ACC), Emotion Confusion Confidence (ECC), and Emotional Misclassification Confidence (EMC), for different alpha values (0, 0.2, and 1.0) which represents a hyperparameter in the loss function.
