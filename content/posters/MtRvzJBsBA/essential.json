This significantly limits the progress in 3D vision research. Existing 3D datasets, while useful, often lack diversity and completeness, hindering the development of truly robust and generalizable 3D reconstruction models.  The lack of high-quality, easily accessible 3D data creates a significant bottleneck for researchers in the field.\n\nThis paper introduces LRM-Zero, a novel approach that addresses these limitations. LRM-Zero uses a **procedurally generated synthetic dataset called Zeroverse** to train a large reconstruction model. Zeroverse, unlike existing datasets, ignores realistic global semantics but is rich in locally complex geometric and textural details.  The results demonstrate that LRM-Zero achieves high-quality reconstruction of real-world objects, competitive with models trained on real-world data like Objaverse. This work **highlights the potential of fully synthetic data for 3D reconstruction**, paving the way for more accessible and scalable research in 3D vision.", "affiliation": "Adobe Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "MtRvzJBsBA/podcast.wav"}
