The left panel shows the unfair area percentage (UAI) for each method,  a lower UAI indicating better fairness, on three different datasets (Adult, COMPAS, and synthetic linear SCM) with a sensitivity threshold (A) set to 0.05. The right panel displays the prediction accuracy for the same methods and datasets.
