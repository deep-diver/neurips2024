[{"figure_path": "0DE1dLMW2b/tables/tables_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Main results. In this work, n is the number of buyers, m is the number of goods, and \u03b5 indicates the additive error of the computed values to the minimally-achievable EG objective value. The memory complexity for the quantum algorithm (annotated with *) refers to the use of quantum query access to classical memory, achievable by QRAM (see Definition 3), instead of classical RAM. As the computed competitive equilibrium consumes O(mn) memory, our quantum algorithm does not provide the entire bid matrix, but instead provides quantum query access (QA) and sample access (SA) to the competitive equilibrium. The result preparation column refers to the additional runtime cost of preparing QA and SA.", "description": "This table summarizes the main results of the paper by comparing the performance of the classical proportional response (PR) dynamics algorithm and the proposed quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation.  It shows the number of iterations, runtime, memory usage, and the time required to prepare the results for both algorithms. The comparison highlights the quantum algorithm's polynomial speedup in terms of runtime and memory.", "section": "Main results"}]
