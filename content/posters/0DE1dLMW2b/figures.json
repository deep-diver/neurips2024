[{"figure_path": "0DE1dLMW2b/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experimental results. We perform our experiments on n = 16384 buyers and goods given the same amount of queries for all algorithms. We observe in Figure 1a that over different distributions, our quantum algorithm (green) significantly outperforms the PR dynamics (blue), which aligns with our theoretical results. Furthermore, our results also show that both our quantum algorithm and the PR dynamics outperform projected gradient descent (orange) in the mid-accuracy regime. Figure 1b shows the convergence of a single run of the quantum algorithm despite its instability from faulty updates, as well as the variance over the multiple runs (shaded in grey).", "description": "This figure presents the results of numerical simulations comparing the performance of three algorithms for computing market equilibrium: the Proportional Response (PR) dynamics, projected gradient descent, and the proposed quantum algorithm.  The top row (1a) shows the convergence of the EG objective function for four different scenarios (uniform, uniform CEEI, normal, normal CEEI) against the number of queries. The bottom row (1b) displays the convergence behavior of the quantum algorithm, highlighting its faster convergence in the mid-accuracy regime.  It illustrates how the quantum algorithm outperforms both PR dynamics and projected gradient descent, supporting the paper's theoretical findings.", "section": "5 Numerical simulations"}]
