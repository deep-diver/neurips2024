The main challenge lies in the computational cost of these algorithms which grows proportionally with the number of buyers and goods.  This necessitates the need for more efficient algorithms that can solve the market equilibrium problem faster, especially in the large-scale settings prevalent in today's applications.\nThis research introduces a novel **quantum algorithm** that significantly improves the computational efficiency of market equilibrium computations.  By leveraging the power of quantum computing, this algorithm achieves **sublinear performance**, outperforming existing classical algorithms. This translates to a significant speedup, especially when dealing with many buyers and goods. The theoretical findings are also supported by experimental results, demonstrating the **practical efficacy of the quantum algorithm**.", "affiliation": "Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "0DE1dLMW2b/podcast.wav"}
