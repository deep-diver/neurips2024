It shows the impact of different components on the performance, including adding an identity shortcut, using consistent-pixel downsampling/upsampling, incorporating channel-shuffle fusion, and applying timestep-aware redistribution and activation functions. The results are evaluated on the Manga109 dataset using a 2x upscaling factor, after training the models on DIV2K and Flickr2K datasets. The table demonstrates a gradual improvement in performance with the addition of each component.

The comparison is done across different metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and datasets (Set5, B100, Urban100, Manga109) at two upscaling factors (\u00d72, \u00d74). The table also includes the model parameters (M) and operations (G) for each method. The best and second-best results for each metric and dataset are highlighted in red and blue, respectively, demonstrating BI-DiffSR's superior performance.", "section": "4.3 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods"}]
