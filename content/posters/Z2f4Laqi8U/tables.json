These scores are based on information-theoretic measures (mutual information) and incorporate a factorized Normalized Maximum Likelihood (fNML) complexity term to account for finite sample sizes. The scores consider different orientations (X \u2192 Y, Y \u2192 X, X \u2194 Y) and are symmetrized for Markov equivalence using averaging where appropriate.  They are a key component of the two-step optimization process for edge orientations within the algorithm.", "section": "3.2 New search-and-score method based on higher-order local information scores"}, {"figure_path": "Z2f4Laqi8U/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Local scores for the orientation of a single directed or bidirected edge.", "description": "This table presents the local scores used for edge orientation in the MIIC_search&score algorithm.  It shows how the algorithm calculates scores for directed and bidirected edges based on information-theoretic measures and a factorized normalized maximum likelihood (fNML) complexity term. These scores consider the conditional mutual information and the fNML complexity to assess how likely an edge is oriented in a given way. Markov equivalence is maintained by using symmetrized fNML complexity terms where appropriate.", "section": "3.2 New search-and-score method based on higher-order local information scores"}, {"figure_path": "Z2f4Laqi8U/tables/tables_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Model 1, X2 - X4 Model 2, X2-X4 Model 3, X2 - X4 Model 3, X4 - X6", "description": "This table presents the results of testing the MIIC_search&score method's ability to predict bidirected edges in three simple ancestral models of varying complexity.  The models differ in whether the endpoint nodes share parents (Model 1: no shared parents; Model 2: some shared parents; Model 3: bidirected edge in longer path). The percentage of replicates displaying directed (incorrect) vs bidirected (correct) orientations is shown for different sample sizes (N).  The results demonstrate the model's increasing accuracy in predicting bidirected edges as the sample size increases.", "section": "E Toy models"}]
