These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure.

A natural approach to constructing a surrogate model is to optimize a recurrent neural network (RNN) to mimic the recorded neural activity.

First, in single-trial settings, one has access to measurements of dynamics only in a restricted condition or set of conditions, so it may be impossible to observe how changes in input or in internal state affect the circuit of interest [8]. Second, the system of interest is only partially observed: one can only usually record from a subset of the neurons in a given circuit, and certainly cannot simultaneously record all of their inputs [7]. Third, measurements of neural activity are noisy, and may be biased to capture only certain components of neural activity. For example, intrinsic indicator dynamics mean that calcium imaging may effectively low-pass filter neural activity, even if one is only interested in firing rates and not precise spike times [21, 22]. Fourth, it can be challenging to account for the presence and structure of intrinsic neuronal noise.

Given a dataconstrained model, one can identify attractor properties using dynamical systems analysis [13, 26, 27]. These macroscopic dynamical properties are of substantial neuroscientific interest, as low-dimensional attractors are believed to underlie observed neural activity across a variety of neural circuits and tasks [24]. In particular, line attractors\u2014sets of stable fixed points organized along lines in neural activity space\u2014have been proposed to underlie cognitive functions requiring short-term or working memory, including sensory integration, decision making, and even aggressive behavior [12, 13, 24, 26, 28, 29]. Importantly, low-dimensional structures in data should be relatively robustly detectable even under partial observation [7], so there is reason to be optimistic that data-constrained models could correctly recover line attractor dynamics.

Specializing to $\\phi(z)=\\operatorname{tan\\bar{h}}(z)$ , the Jacobian of the teacher dynamics at the origin is simply $-I_{D}+B$ , and that of the student is analogously $-I_{d}+A$ . Therefore, connectivity matrix eigenvalues of real part greater than 1 would imply that the fixed point at the origin is unstable, and thus the network must support other dynamical behavior (e.g, other stable fixed points, limit cycles, and/or chaos). In the linear case, eigenvalues of real part greater than 1 were never spuriously discovered, as that would yield exponentially divergent activity. However, with a saturating nonlinearity, this extreme eigenvalue overestimation is no longer pathological. Indeed, when we infer the weights of a student network using MAP estimation, we find that at small subsampling fractions the student can learn eigenvalues of real part greater than one from a teacher with no such eigenvalues if the teacher connectivity is non-normal. Strikingly, this can lead to the discovery of spurious limit cycles (Fig. 5a) and fixed points (Fig. F.6).

The conceptual argument given at the end of $\\S2$ suggests that this should hold more broadly for low-dimensional student networks learning from partial observations of high-dimensional teachers, but this is a heuristic argument, not a rigorous test. We therefore applied several other commonly-used inference methods [14, 51, 52] to fit student dynamics in the low-rank nonlinear teacher setting. All of the methods produced mismatched attractor structure, with many showing a propensity to overestimate eigenvalues, yielding spurious limit cycles (Fig. 5).

", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "As noted in $\\S2$ , an intuitive explanation of our results for linear networks is that low-dimensional dynamical systems are limited in the longest timescales they could generate through functionally feedforward integration, and thus are inherently biased towards line-attractor-like mechanisms when fit to observations of slow dynamics. Though our focus has been on partial observation as a driver for this dimensional restriction, most approaches to data-constrained modeling with latent dynamics explicitly bias model selection towards smaller latent spaces. In particular, it is standard to select the smallest latent space dimension that captures more than a certain threshold fraction of the variance in the data [13, 18]. This will necessarily favor approximate-attractor-like solutions. Indeed, if one applied such a model selection procedure to the integrator models studied in Figure 1, one would select at most a two-dimensional latent space (see Figure F.8), and thus fall victim to the failure mode noted there. This bias in model selection procedures illustrates a wider issue: benchmarking and model selection based on explained variance for a restricted set of measured dynamics alone are not necessarily sufficient to diagnose mechanistic mismatches [23, 53]. It highlights a tension between the desire to recapitulate mechanism and our intuitive conception of low dimensionality as a signature of model parsimony. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Here, we have focused on the setting in which one measures dynamics over a single trial for inputs that are either fully known or white noise. Previous works have shown how failure to account for unobserved inputs can lead to incorrect eigenvalue estimation [19]. Moreover, most previouslyproposed methods to disentangle input-driven versus autonomous dynamics require repeatable trial structure [10, 19, 54]. Our work focuses only on the effects of unobserved neurons, and does not attempt to address this additional source of mechanistic mismatch. Observation of a network under a restricted set of input conditions poses a particularly striking challenge if it has a spectrum of heterogeneous integration timescales. If inputs drive activity along only a subset of dimensions, it is easy to imagine how a heterogeneous spectrum of time constants could be reductively interpreted as low-dimensional attractor structure [38, 39, 55]. When studying circuits whose upstream inputs are not well-understood dynamically, inferences about circuit-intrinsic attractor structure become even more tenuous.

Though we do not address this issue in the present work, the obvious candidate for conclusive validation of attractor dynamics is of course direct experimental perturbation of neural activity. In recent work, O\u2019Shea, Duncker, and colleagues have used targeted optogenetic perturbations to interrogate putative low-dimensional dynamics in primate motor cortex [25]. There, they show that data-constrained models with unconstrained weight matrices do not readily predict perturbation responses, while those with weight matrices constrained to be low-rank capture the fast recovery of the dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace. After the completion of our work, Vinograd et al. [56] have begun to interrogate putative line attractor dynamics in hypothalamus using similar perturbations. An important question for future work will be to determine how specifically targeted a patterned optogenetic perturbation must be in order to distinguish between the line attractor and functionally-feedforward integrator networks studied here. Another important question is how to relate patterned stimuli in silico and in vivo, particularly for latent variable models where a possibly ill-posed inversion of the latent state to observed neuron mapping would be required.

There is a substantial literature on performance guarantees for parameter estimation for linear systems, which largely focuses on predictive accuracy rather than qualitative features [44\u201347, 57]. There are also a host of methods which leverage delay embeddings; in addition to predictive accuracy, these methods prioritize accurately inferring the dimensionality and topological structure of an underlying system [20, 58\u201360]. However, such methods are \u201cequation-free\", and thus are not ideal for identifying how dynamical variables are coupled [61]. Consequently, such methods might not be suitable for distinguishing between mechanistically distinct circuit hypotheses that generate similarly low dimensional neural activity. Indeed, delay embeddings do not appear to distinguish between the two integrator circuits studied here (Fig. F.7).
