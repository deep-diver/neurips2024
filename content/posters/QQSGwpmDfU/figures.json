The framework consists of two stages: the first stage employs contrastive learning with centroid prototypes to learn well-discriminative representation, and the second stage introduces contrastive learning with hard and dynamic prototypes to further focus on divergence and variety.", "description": "The figure illustrates the proposed PCLHD framework, which consists of two stages. Stage I employs contrastive learning with centroid prototypes to learn a discriminative representation.  Stage II introduces contrastive learning with hard and dynamic prototypes to enhance the model's focus on divergence and variety within clusters.  The framework starts with an unlabeled dataset which is passed to both an online and momentum backbone network. The output of these networks populates the memory and is then passed to the progressive contrastive learning stage.  This stage integrates the centroid, hard, and dynamic prototype approaches to optimize the model.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "QQSGwpmDfU/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) The effect of hyper-parameter \u03bb with different values.

Panel (a) shows the effect of varying the hyperparameter \u03bb (weighting parameter balancing Hard and Dynamic Prototype Contrastive Learning loss functions) on Rank-1 accuracy and mAP.  Panel (b) illustrates the influence of changing hyperparameter k (number of hard samples) on model performance. Panel (c) compares the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) metric, measuring clustering quality, of the PCLHD method against several other USVI-ReID methods.", "section": "4.2 Results and Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "QQSGwpmDfU/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The t-SNE visualization of 10 randomly selected identities.

Different colors represent different identities.  Circles represent visible features while pentagrams represent infrared features. The visualization aims to show how well the proposed PCLHD method clusters samples of the same identity compared to a baseline method.  Well-clustered samples indicate effective feature extraction and identity discrimination.", "section": "4.4 Further Analysis"}]
