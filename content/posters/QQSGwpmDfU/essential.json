Existing methods often rely on simple cluster-based contrastive learning, focusing primarily on the common features of individuals and neglecting the inherent divergence and variety in the data. This leads to inaccurate pseudo-label generation and hinders performance. \nThis paper introduces a novel method called Progressive Contrastive Learning with Hard and Dynamic Prototypes (PCLHD) to address these limitations.  **PCLHD generates hard prototypes by selecting samples furthest from cluster centers, emphasizing divergence. It also employs dynamic prototypes, randomly chosen from clusters, to capture the data's variety.**  The method incorporates a progressive learning strategy, gradually focusing on divergence and variety as training progresses. Experiments on two standard datasets (SYSU-MM01 and RegDB) show that PCLHD outperforms existing USVI-ReID methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the accuracy and reliability of person re-identification in cross-modal scenarios.", "affiliation": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Xiamen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Person Re-identification"}, "podcast_path": "QQSGwpmDfU/podcast.wav"}
