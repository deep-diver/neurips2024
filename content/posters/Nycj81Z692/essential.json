These UKGs are vital for diverse smart city applications, but their construction is laborious and inefficient. Current approaches often rely heavily on manual efforts, hindering their potential.\n\nUrbanKGent tackles this challenge by introducing a unified large language model (LLM) agent framework. This framework uses a knowledgeable instruction set to guide the LLM, incorporates a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance geospatial reasoning, and employs hybrid instruction fine-tuning for improved performance.  This approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, enabling the construction of richer and more comprehensive UKGs with drastically reduced data requirements.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Smart Cities"}, "podcast_path": "Nycj81Z692/podcast.wav"}
