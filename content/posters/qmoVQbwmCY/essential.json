Existing methods often rely on strong assumptions, like additive decoders, that limit their applicability. This is problematic because high-dimensional data requires more flexible models and lacks such guarantees. \nThis paper introduces a probabilistic slot attention algorithm that addresses these limitations. By imposing a mixture prior over slot representations, the method provides theoretical identifiability guarantees. The authors demonstrate this approach's efficacy and scalability using both simple 2D datasets and high-resolution image benchmarks, empirically verifying their theoretical findings. This work has significant implications for building more robust and reliable object-centric representation learning models.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qmoVQbwmCY/podcast.wav"}
