The comparison is based on two metrics: SMCC (Slot Mean Correlation Coefficient), which measures the correlation between estimated and ground truth slot representations, and R2, which quantifies the goodness of fit between the estimated and ground truth slot representations. Higher SMCC and R2 values indicate better slot identifiability.  The table shows PSA achieving higher scores than the baselines, demonstrating its improved capability in learning identifiable object-centric representations.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
