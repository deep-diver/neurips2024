In contrast, hyperbolic representation learning, renowned for its ability to model hierarchical and complex relationships between events, has the potential to amplify the discrimination between visually similar events. Inspired by these, we develop a novel Dual-Space Representation Learning (DSRL) method for weakly supervised VVD to utilize the strength of both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, capturing the visual features of events while also exploring the intrinsic relations between events, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of the features. DSRL employs a novel information aggregation strategy to progressively learn event context in hyperbolic spaces, which selects aggregation nodes through layer-sensitive hyperbolic association degrees constrained by hyperbolic Dirichlet energy. Furthermore, DSRL attempts to break the cyber-balkanization of different spaces, utilizing cross-space attention to facilitate information interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic space to capture better discriminative features for final violence detection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSRL.

However, it is expensive to annotate each frame in a video so that we can train a VVD model with supervised learning. To address this, current methods often utilize weakly supervised settings to formulate the problem as a multiple-instance learning (MIL)[19] task. These methods treat a video as a bag of instances (i.e., snippets or segments), and predict their labels based on the video-level annotations. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "According to the modality type of the input data, existing weakly supervised VVD methods can be roughly divided into two categories, unimodal with only vision input and multimodal with vision and audio input. The unimodal methods [29, 36, 8, 10, 20] learn the different distributions of normal and violent events through video-level labels, focus on finding valuable visual cues that are distinct from non-violent events and use them to detect violent events, i.e., fighting. However, relying on visual cues to identify violent events is sometimes unreliable, especially when facing visually ambiguous events, like normal physical collisions and fighting behavior in hockey games. To alleviate this problem, Wu et al [34] released a large multimodal violence dataset, named XD-Violence, and accelerated a series of multimodal VVD methods [34, 35, 22, 37, 23]. Multimodal VVD methods incorporate not only visual cues but also complementary audio information for improving the discrimination of violent events. Previous methods have employed Euclidean space representation learning and achieved good results in many other computer vision tasks[27, 28, 15, 32]. Despite advancements in audio-visual violent video detection (VVD) methods, their performance remains unsatisfactory in recognizing normal events that are visually similar to violent events (i.e., ambiguous violence) due to the limitations of Euclidean space. While visual features are fully extracted in Euclidean space, these methods fail to adequately capture and utilize the intrinsic relations between events.

An ambiguous violent event is confusing at the current category level or happening moment, but may easily be detected if we can grasp the hierarchical relations. Fortunately, hyperbolic representation learning, characterized by exponentially increasing the metric distances and naturally reflects the hierarchical structure of data, has gained attention and shown promising performance in computer vision tasks, like semantic segmentation [1], medical image recognition [38], action recognition [24, 17], anomaly recognition [12]. At present, only one method, HyperVD [25], makes a preliminary attempt on the VVD task via hyperbolic representation learning. HyperVD introduces the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN) [3], an extended version of Euclidean graph convolution for representation learning in hyperbolic space, to learn discriminative representations. However, HGCN employs a hard node selection strategy during the message passing, where the nodes whose correlation is higher than the threshold (a manual parameter) are selected for message aggregation and otherwise discarded, which leads to insufficient hierarchical relation learning. In addition, existing VVD methods deploy feature embedding either in Euclidean or hyperbolic spaces. Representation learning in a single space is like picking the sesame and losing the watermelon, where the feature embedding is insufficient to guarantee the performance of VVD. On the one hand, hyperbolic representation learning strengthens the hierarchical relation of events but weakens the expression of visual features, on the other hand, Euclidean representations emphasize visual features but ignore relations between events. Therefore, leveraging the advantages of both spaces is essential for improving the performance of VVD methods, shown in Figure 1(b).

Instead of adopting the hard node selection strategy in HGCN, HE-GCN selects nodes for message aggregation by our introduced layer-sensitive hyperbolic association degrees, which are dynamic thresholds determined by the message aggregation degree at each layer. To better align with the characteristics of hyperbolic spaces, we introduce the hyperbolic Dirichlet energy to quantify the extent of message aggregation. Benefiting from the dynamic threshold, the layer-by-layer focused message passing strategy adopted by HE-GCN not only ensures the efficiency of information excavation but also improves the model\u2019s comprehensive understanding of the events, thus enhancing the model\u2019s ability to discriminate ambiguous violent events. Although hyperbolic representation learning enhances the understanding of hierarchical relations of events, the role of visual representations in violence detection cannot be discarded. However, fusing representation in different spaces remains a challenge, to break the information cocoon, DSI utilises cross-space attention to facilitate information interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic space to capture better discriminative features, where Euclidean representations have effectiveness on the significant motion and shape changes in the video, while hyperbolic representations accelerate the comprehension of hierarchical relations between events, working together to improve the performance of violence detection in videos.

Weakly supervised VVD requires identifying violent snippets under video-level labels, where the MIL [19] framework is widely used for denoising irrelevant information. Recently, progress has been made in weakly supervised VVD, with approaches categorized into two main categories: vision-based and audio-visual-based methods. Employing exclusively visual cues, vision-based VVD endeavours to discern the occurrence of violent events within videos. Most existing works [7, 26, 30, 33] consider VVD as solely a visual task, and CNNbased networks are utilized to encode visual features. However, these approaches overlook the interaction between different modalities and the relevant audio information, which could negatively impact the accuracy of violence detection. To alleviate this problem, Wu et al [34] released a large multimodal violence dataset, named XD-Violence, and accelerated a series of multimodal VVD methods [34, 35, 22, 37, 23, 18, 25].

Subsequently, many studies [22, 23] have focused on the integration of visual and audio information. There is also work[37] focused on solving the modality asynchrony problem.

Then, HE-GCN is employed and the representations from different spaces are simply concat at this stage, benefti from the hierarchical context of events, resulting in an improvement of $2.42\\%$ on multimodal setting and $1.75\\%$ on unimodal setting respectively $3^{r\\bar{d}}$ row).

In Table $2(2^{n d}$ and $3^{r d}$ rows), we present experiments comparing HGCN used in HyperVD [25], which employs a hard node selection strategy (nodes selected by a fixed threshold), with HE-GCN, which uses our introduced layer-sensitive hyperbolic association degrees for node selection in message aggregation. The performance of AP improved by $1.45\\%$ in the multimodal setting and by $1.77\\%$ on the unimodal setting.

We put up qualitative visualizations of DSRL when handling ambiguous violence. Figure 5 demonstrates that DSRL effectively resolves ambiguous violence, which single-space representation learning struggles with. In Figure 5(a), the first frame shows smoke caused by fire. Euclidean space representation, relying on visual features, misidentifies the smoke as violence. Hyperbolic space representation, considering contextual information, also misidentifies it due to preceding violent frames. DSRL, however, combines both perspectives: Euclidean space flags the smoke as a potential violence indicator, while hyperbolic space recognizes the fire context. This integration allows DSRL to accurately classify the smoke as non-violent. This supports our motivation: hyperbolic representation enhances hierarchical event relations but weakens visual feature expression, while Euclidean representation emphasizes visual features but overlooks event relationships. DSRL effectively addresses ambiguous violence, which is challenging for either space alone. More performance visualizations are included in the Appendix.

To achieve this, we introduce the LSHAD construction rule, which calculates an LSHAD threshold based on the number of the current layer $K$ and hyperbolic Dirichlet energy of the current layer. As the $K$ increases and the hyperbolic Dirichlet energy decreases, the LSHAD threshold increases and is limited to 0 and 1 by the sigmoid function. If there is no $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ , the threshold in the first layer will be strict $(>0.5)$ , causing the overlook of some global context information. Therefore, to make our node selection threshold conform to the Global-first principle, we introduced the two hyperparameters in LSHAD, where $\\beta$ controls the influence of the number of current layer $k$ and $\\gamma$ acts as a bias to fine-tune the threshold.
