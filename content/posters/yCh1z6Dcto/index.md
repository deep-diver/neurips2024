### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Adapting pre-trained models on edge devices is challenging due to **memory constraints of backpropagation** and the limited training capabilities of most low-power processors.  Existing methods for reducing memory footprint during training, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, do not fundamentally solve this problem because they still require storage of intermediate activations.  The paper investigates a new approach using **forward gradients** which only requires a pair of forward passes for gradient estimation, saving memory substantially. 

This paper introduces **quantized forward gradient learning**, applying quantized weight perturbations and gradient calculations to adapt models on devices with fixed-point processors. The researchers propose algorithm enhancements to mitigate noise in the gradient approximation and demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through extensive experiments. The results show that on-device training with quantized forward gradients is feasible and achieves comparable accuracy to backpropagation, paving the way for more practical and resource-efficient edge AI applications.

> This figure illustrates the process of fixed-point forward gradient learning. It starts with quantized weights which are perturbed using a random perturbation vector.  These perturbed weights are then used in two forward passes through the model, resulting in two loss values.  These loss values are used to calculate the quantized forward gradients. Finally, these gradients are used to update the quantized weights, completing one iteration of the training process.  The entire process is designed to be performed using fixed-point arithmetic, suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

### In-depth insights


#### On-device training
On-device training presents a compelling solution to overcome the limitations of cloud-based machine learning, particularly concerning **privacy, latency, and bandwidth**.  The core challenge lies in the resource constraints of edge devices, including limited memory, processing power, and energy.  This paper explores the viability of on-device training by employing **forward gradient learning**, a memory-efficient alternative to backpropagation, which requires storing intermediate activations for gradient calculation. By leveraging forward gradients computed from two forward passes, **memory consumption is drastically reduced**, making it feasible for resource-constrained environments. The paper further investigates **fixed-point arithmetic** for on-device training, addressing the practical limitations of existing low-power neural processing units. This approach simplifies the hardware requirements and improves efficiency. **Quantization strategies** are employed to further minimize the memory footprint and reduce the computational complexity.  The results show promising performance of this method across various benchmarks, demonstrating its **practical feasibility and potential for widespread adoption**.  However, further research into improving the robustness and scalability of on-device training using forward gradients, particularly for larger models, remains crucial.

#### Forward gradients
The concept of "forward gradients" presents a compelling alternative to traditional backpropagation in model training, especially beneficial for resource-constrained edge devices.  **Its core advantage lies in significantly reducing memory consumption** by eliminating the need to store intermediate activation values during the backward pass. This is achieved by estimating gradients using only forward computations, typically involving multiple forward passes with perturbed inputs or weights.  While this approach introduces noise into gradient estimation, the paper explores methods such as sign-m-SPSA to mitigate this, demonstrating that **competitive accuracy can be achieved even with fixed-point quantization**, a crucial aspect for low-power hardware.  The analysis of training trajectories and loss landscapes provides further insights into the effectiveness and practical feasibility of this technique.  However, **challenges remain concerning the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency**, particularly as model complexity increases, along with considerations surrounding the sensitivity of the approach to hyperparameter tuning and initialization schemes.

#### Quantized methods
The concept of quantization in the context of deep learning is crucial for deploying models on resource-constrained devices.  **Quantized methods** reduce the precision of numerical representations (e.g., weights and activations) from 32-bit floating-point to lower bit-widths (e.g., 8-bit integers). This significantly reduces memory footprint and computational cost, making deep learning feasible for edge devices.  However, quantization introduces a trade-off: while it enhances efficiency, it can also negatively impact model accuracy. The paper investigates strategies to mitigate the accuracy loss associated with quantization, particularly focusing on **fixed-point arithmetic** for both forward gradient calculations and weight updates. By carefully managing the quantization process, the authors aim to minimize the discrepancy between quantized and floating-point models, demonstrating the practicality of deploying deep learning for on-device training in low-resource environments. **The success of these methods hinges on the selection of appropriate quantization schemes and the development of algorithms that effectively handle quantized data, without substantial loss in performance.**

#### Few-shot learning
The research explores **few-shot learning** within the context of on-device model adaptation.  This is a crucial area because it addresses the challenge of training large models on resource-constrained edge devices where data is limited.  The core idea is to leverage pre-trained models and adapt them to new tasks using only a small number of labeled samples. The study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using fixed-point forward gradients, a memory-efficient alternative to backpropagation, for this few-shot learning scenario.  **Key findings** highlight the method's capability to achieve competitive accuracy compared to backpropagation, particularly when utilizing stronger model architectures like ViT. The results suggest that this approach is practical for model personalization on resource-limited edge devices, opening doors for more widespread on-device machine learning applications where collecting large amounts of training data is impractical or expensive.  However, there's also a clear trade-off between training efficiency and accuracy, particularly with smaller models and lower-resolution inputs. **Future research** could focus on refining techniques to improve accuracy in more challenging scenarios and expanding exploration to a broader range of tasks and model architectures.  **Overall**, this work presents a significant contribution towards enabling efficient on-device few-shot learning.

#### OOD adaptation
The section on "OOD adaptation" in the research paper investigates the model's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data.  This is crucial for real-world applications where the model encounters data different from its training distribution. The experiments using the Cifar10-C dataset, with its various corruptions, are particularly insightful.  **The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed quantized forward gradient learning method, even when dealing with significant data perturbations**.  Interestingly, the study also explores the impact of applying sparsity techniques, suggesting that a substantial reduction in model size can be achieved without significant performance degradation. The findings underscore the **practical value of the method for resource-constrained edge devices**, where both memory efficiency and robustness to unexpected input variations are critical concerns.  Further research into the interactions between sparsity, quantization, and OOD robustness will likely reveal more refined strategies for developing highly efficient and robust models deployable in real-world environments. The performance comparison with backpropagation across different network depths and fine-tuning methods provides a robust evaluation of the technique's versatility and general applicability.
