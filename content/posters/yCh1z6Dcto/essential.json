Existing methods for reducing memory footprint during training, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, do not fundamentally solve this problem because they still require storage of intermediate activations.  The paper investigates a new approach using **forward gradients** which only requires a pair of forward passes for gradient estimation, saving memory substantially. \nThis paper introduces **quantized forward gradient learning**, applying quantized weight perturbations and gradient calculations to adapt models on devices with fixed-point processors. The researchers propose algorithm enhancements to mitigate noise in the gradient approximation and demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through extensive experiments. The results show that on-device training with quantized forward gradients is feasible and achieves comparable accuracy to backpropagation, paving the way for more practical and resource-efficient edge AI applications.", "affiliation": "Qualcomm AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "yCh1z6Dcto/podcast.wav"}
