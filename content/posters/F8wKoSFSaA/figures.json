The standard EG method involves two proximal gradient steps for both x and y updates, while ZO-GDEGA simplifies the x update using a proximal gradient descent step and uses an extra gradient ascent step for y update to leverage concavity and improve robustness. Both methods aim to minimize the Moreau envelope of the objective function and bound the error term (\u2206t) related to the EG ascent steps.", "section": "Theoretical Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "F8wKoSFSaA/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of the results for the logistic regression model attacked by poisoned data generated by ZO-AGP and ZO-GDEGA on the synthetic dataset.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of ZO-AGP and the proposed ZO-GDEGA algorithm on a synthetic dataset for a data poisoning attack against a logistic regression model.  It shows plots of the stationary gap (a measure of convergence), the objective function value, training accuracy, testing accuracy, CPU time, and poisoning ratio.  The results demonstrate that ZO-GDEGA converges faster and achieves a lower testing accuracy (indicating a more effective attack) than ZO-AGP, especially for larger values of the smoothing parameter (q).", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "F8wKoSFSaA/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of the attack results for data poisoning attack on the large-scale epsilon_test dataset.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of ZO-AGP and ZO-GDEGA in a data poisoning attack on the large-scale epsilon_test dataset.

The results demonstrate that ZO-GDEGA converges faster and achieves a lower objective function value compared to ZO-AGP, suggesting improved efficiency and robustness.
