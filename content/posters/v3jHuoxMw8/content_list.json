Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP) to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model.

VLN is typically considered as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [2], where future states are determined only by the current state and current action without explicit rewards. Therefore, the central challenge for VLN is to learn an effective navigation policy. In this context, existing neural agents [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] are naturally constructed as data-driven policy networks by imitation learning (IL) [7] and bootstrapping from expert demonstrations, i.e., ground-truth trajectories [1].

This classifier is supervised by the cross-entropy loss to minimize 1-step deviation error of single-step decision along trajectories [18]. However, the prediction of current action affects future states during the global execution of the learned policy, potentially leading to catastrophic failures [9, 12]. In other words, solely optimizing the conditional action probabilities (i.e., policy) remains unclear for the underlying reasons of the expert behaviour, yet fails to exploit complete information in the state-action distribution $P(s,a)$ induced by the expert [14].

We reinterpret the VLN model as an energy-based model to learn the expert policy from the expert demonstrations. Specifically, ENP models the joint distribution of state-action pairs, i.e., $P(s,a)$ , by energy function, and assigns low energy values to the state-action pairs that the expert mostly performs. For optimization, this energy function is regarded as the unnormalized log-density of joint distribution, which can be decomposed into the standard cross-entropy of action prediction and marginal distribution of the states $P(s)$ . During training, ENP introduces persistent contrastive divergence [21, 22] to estimate the expectation of $P(s)$ , and samples by Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics [23]. In this way, ENP simulates the expert by maximizing the likelihood of the action and incorporates prior knowledge of VLN by optimizing state marginal distribution in a collaborative manner, thereby leveraging the benefits of both energy-based and discriminative approaches.

Therefore, ENP performs prioritized optimization for entire trajectories rather than the single-time step decisions in BC, and achieves a global alignment with the expert policy.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
