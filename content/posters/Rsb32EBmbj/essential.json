{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working with deep state space models (SSMs) and adversarial robustness.  It **addresses the critical gap in understanding how to enhance the adversarial robustness of SSMs**, a burgeoning area with significant security implications. The proposed adaptive scaling mechanism offers a practical solution to improve robustness without overfitting, opening up new avenues of research and development.", "summary": "Deep state space models (SSMs) gain adversarial robustness through an adaptive scaling mechanism, improving performance without overfitting issues.", "takeaways": ["Attention mechanisms significantly improve the adversarial robustness of SSMs but can lead to robust overfitting.", "A simple adaptive scaling mechanism can effectively enhance adversarial training performance of SSMs without overfitting issues.", "Fixed-parameterized SSMs struggle to benefit from adversarial training due to error bounds related to their parameters."], "tldr": "Deep state space models (SSMs) are powerful tools for sequential data processing but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant challenge.  Existing adversarial training methods aren't very effective with SSMs, and enhancements like attention mechanisms, while improving performance, also introduce robust overfitting issues, limiting generalization.  This paper investigates various SSM structures and their behavior under adversarial training, revealing the limitations of existing methods.\nThis study proposes a novel adaptive scaling (AdS) mechanism to improve the adversarial robustness of SSMs.  **The AdS mechanism significantly enhances robustness by effectively scaling output error during training**, addressing the robustness-generalization trade-off.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdS brings adversarial training performance close to that of attention-integrated SSMs while avoiding robust overfitting. The findings offer valuable insights into designing more robust SSM architectures.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "Rsb32EBmbj/podcast.wav"}
