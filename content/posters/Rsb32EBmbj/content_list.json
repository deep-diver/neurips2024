Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear. While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues. To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while inputdependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity. Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO.

These models capture temporal dependencies in sequences via structured state space transitions [2, 3, 4]. By leveraging their inherent recurrent nature and linear discretized transmission form, SSMs excel in long-sequence modeling with linear computational complexity [3, 5]. This makes SSMs highly competitive in various downstream tasks, with the potential to surpass classical architectures like convolutional networks and Transformers [6, 7, 8]. While the superior performance of SSMs on clean data has been well established across various tasks, these models may face significant security risks from meticulously crafted Adversarial Perturbations (APs) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]in real-world scenarios. Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly explore and discuss the Adversarial Robustness (AR) of SSMs. Previous work [14] has conducted preliminary robustness evaluations on visual SSMs. However, their assessment was limited to the VMamba structure. More importantly, they did not specifically evaluate and analyze the performance of SSMs under Adversarial Training (AT) [10, 15, 16]. This aspect is crucial for enhancing the AR of SSMs, as AT is the mainstream approach for improving a model\u2019s AR [16, 17, 18].

Do many component designs that have proven effective in boosting SSM performance under Standard Training (ST) [19, 20] similarly enhance SSMs when subjected to AT? Adversarial attacks aim to induce erroneous predictions by adding meticulously crafted small perturbations [9, 10], which may cause a more pronounced negative impact on SSM models. This is because SSMs heavily rely on sequential dependencies in inputs, causing errors to accumulate through state propagation. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether commonly employed AT frameworks, such as PGD-AT [16] and TRADES [21], can effectively improve the AR of SSMs. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "2. How do various components influence the robustness-generalization trade-off in AT? Due to the trade-off between robustness and generalization [22, 23], AT often leads to a decrease in the accuracy of deep learning models on clean data, thus hindering their generalization. Additionally, deep learning models are prone to Robust Overfitting (RO) [24, 25], where models trained adversarially overfti to the AT samples but fail to generalize to adversarial test samples, significantly limiting the effectiveness of AT. We aim to investigate how existing structural variants of SSMs, such as diagonalized [26] and Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) SSM [27], affect the robustness-generalization trade-off and RO issues in SSMs, thereby providing insights for designing more robust SSM structures.

Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive robustness evaluations to assess their performance. Specifically, we obtain the following observations: 1)A Clear Robustness-Generalization Trade-off in SSM Structures. We observe a significant decrease in the Clean Accuracy (CA) of SSMs following AT. Specifically, for the S4 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, the CA dropped by nearly $15\\%$ compared to ST. This indicates a pronounced robustness-generalization trade-off in SSM structures. 2) Pure SSM structure struggles in benefit from AT. Despite expanded to data-dependent SSM, Mamba fails to show distinct superiority over the fixed-parameterized counterparts (S4 and DSS) under AT, even though all are SISO systems. 3) Only the incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances both the CA and RA of SSMs after AT.

Furthermore, incorporating attention mechanisms provides additional adaptive scaling of the SSM\u2019s output error, facilitating better alignment of outputs corresponding to adversarial and clean inputs. However, this also increases complexity, raising the risk of RO. Inspired by this, we explore whether a low-complexity adaptive scaling operation could assist SSMs in output alignment while avoiding RO issues. To this end, we designed a simple Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism to aid in output alignment. Our results indicate that this design effectively enhances the AT performance of SSMs and reduces output errors without introducing RO issues.

All models benefit from AT, achieving higher RA with both PGD-AT and TRADES frameworks. Some intriguing phenomenons occurs on the MNIST dataset, where models trained under the PGD-AT framework exhibit a marked decrease in CA and almost no RA under AA. In contrast, TRADES does not lead to a significant reduction in CA and substantially improves robust accuracy under AA. This disparity is not observed on CIFAR-10 and Tiny-Imagenet. The phenomenon can be elucidated by findings from [37], which indicate that MNIST\u2019s limited semantic information may lead PGD-AT to fit to spurious rather than causal features, resulting in overfitting to $\\ell_{\\infty}$ PGD attacks. On the other hand, TRADES explicitly constrains the KL divergence between clean and adversarial sample logits, ensuring that the model learns causal features from clean data while adapting to adversarial distributions. Besides, on the MNIST dataset, all model architectures fail to converge when trained with YOPO. This advanced adversarial training strategy relies on the parameters of the model\u2019s input layer for auxiliary calculations, making it difficult to simply extend and be effective on non-convolutional structures.

Notably, Mamba exhibits an over 40 times increase in KL and MSE on both the training and test sets after training with TRADES, significantly higher than the changes observed in other fixed-parameterized SSMs. These findings are consistent with our theoretical analysis, indicating that SSMs inherently struggle to reduce output discrepancies through AT, while data-dependent SSMs may experience an explosion of output errors during AT. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is noteworthy that both the linear layers and the Attention mechanism exhibit a significant reduction in MSE and KL divergence, implying that they indeed serve to diminish the discrepancy between feature sequences of clean and adversarial input during AT. This explains why SSMs integrated with Attention and linear layers achieve higher CA and Robust RA in AT. Compared to linear layers, Attention induces a more pronounced reduction in MSE and KL divergence. However, while Attention after PGD-AT achieves more than a $90\\%$ decrease in MSE and KL divergence on the training data, it only yields about a $60\\%$ reduction on the test set, which is significantly weaker than the improvements observed on the training set. In contrast, other components do not exhibit such a notable degradation in difference reduction on the test set, indicating that the RO issue essentially stems from Attention itself, rather than other components. In fact, the incorporation of Attention introduces excessive model complexity, which, according to the conclusions in previous work [39], also limits the model\u2019s RG. According to eq. (11), the introduction of Attention effectively allows the model to adaptively scale the output error: E $\\mathbf{\\nabla}[\\|A(\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime})\\mathbf{y}-A(\\mathbf{y})\\mathbf{y}\\|_{2}^{2}]$ , where $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ denotes the SelfAttention operation. This inspires us to consider: whether incorporating an Ads to the SSM\u2019s output sequence y with minimal added complexity could enable fixed-parameterized SSMs to approach the AT performance of Attention while avoiding the introduction of RO? ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "To answer this question, we introduced an AdS module after the SSM of S4 and DSS, to adaptively scale the SSM output y: $\\pmb{{y}}_{k}=\\sigma(\\mathbb{L}_{1}(\\pmb{{y}}_{k}))\\odot\\pmb{{y}}_{k}+\\sigma(\\mathbb{L}_{2}(\\pmb{{y}}_{k}))$ , where $\\mathbb{L}_{1}$ and $\\mathbb{L}_{2}$ are learnable linear mappings, $\\mathbb{L}_{2}(\\pmb{y}_{k})$ is used to assist in adaptive scaling to adjust the output bias, and $\\sigma$ is an activation function, which includes ReLU, Tanh, or Sigmoid. We conduct AT on SSMs with AdS integrated with different activations on CIFAR-10 and MNIST using PGD-AT and TRADES, and record the best and final CA and RA. As shown in the results in Table 2, regardless of the type of activation integrated, S4 and DSS with AdS showed more than a $3\\%$ improvement in CA and over a $2\\%$ improvement in RA. In particular, the AdS with ReLU as activation brought a $4.1\\%$ improvement in CA and a $3.97\\%$ improvement in RA for DSS when trained with TRADES, nearly matching Mega\u2019s performance in terms of CA and RA under PGD-10 and AA, without exhibiting RO issues observed in Mega with PGD-AT. The experimental results on Tiny-ImageNet (Tab. 6) also support the same conclusion. To further confirm that AdS can indeed help reduce SSM output discrepancies, similar to the effect of Attention, we also quantify the differences in the intermediate layer feature sequences for each component of S4 and DSS after integrating AdS, as shown in Fig. 4. The feature sequence differences before and after AdS, in terms of both KL divergence and MSE, shows a decrease, indicating that the introduction of AdS does help in reducing the disparity between clean and adversarial feature sequences. This provides an affirmative answer to our question, suggesting that the primary advantage of Attention in enhancing SSM\u2019s performance in AT is due to its adaptive sequence scaling. Incorporating a low-complexity adaptive scaling module can improve the SSM model\u2019s CA and RA in AT while preventing RO issues.

Our findings reveal the robustness-generalization trade-off inherent in SSMs during AT. Although the integration of Attention improves both the CA and RA of SSMs, it also increases model complexity, leading to RO issues. Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pure SSM structures hardly benefit from AT, whereas Attention facilitates further reduction of output error through sequence scaling. Inspired by this, we show that introducing a simple and effective AdS module to SSMs effectively enhances their AT performance and prevents RO. This provides valuable guidance and insights for the future design of more robust SSM structures.
