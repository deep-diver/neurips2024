For instance, Sphinx-2k [32] adopts 2,890 visual tokens, while InternLM-Xcomposer2-4KHD [11] even uses up to 8,737 visual tokens. Concatenating such a long sequence of visual tokens to text tokens results in a dramatic increase in computational overhead for both training and inference. Specifically, current MLLMs are usually pre-trained on web-crawled image-text pairs, which usually have very short texts, with an average word count of 10.95 for LAION2B [51] and 8.99 for LAION-COCO [1].

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a key technique for finetuning large pre-trained models, including LLMs and MLLMs. PEFT methods freeze the backbone and only fine-tune a small number of parameters, which can be typically categorized into three classes: adapters [17, 49, 54, 63], prefix-tuning [29, 26, 38], and Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) [18, 37, 10]. Houlsby et al. [17] design bottleneck adapters and insert two adapters into the transformer layers, one after the attention module and one after the feed-forward network. LLaMA-Adapter [63] inserts learnable prompts into $L$ of $N$ decoder layers and uses zero-initialized attention for stable training. Prefix-tuning [29] prepends a set of learnable prefix vectors at the query and key of the self-attention module for every layer. Prompt-tuning proposes to only prepend learnable vectors to the input prompt with no intermediate-layer prefixes. LoRA [18] uses learnable low-rank matrices to approximate the backbone\u2019s weight updates, and the low-rank matrices can be merged with the backbone during inference without extra inference burden. Considering the pre-training stage, current MLLMs usually freeze the unimodal backbones and project visual tokens through a learnable projector, then prepend visual tokens into the input sequence of LLMs, which can be seen as prefix-tuning methods. Our VLoRA is closer to the style of LoRA.

Similar to Sect. 3.4, we assume the LLM has $d$ blocks and hidden states dimension of $h$ , the input text length is $C$ , and the number of visual tokens is $L$ . Therefore, the FLOPs of the self-attention module and the feed-forward network are $8L h^{2}{+}4L^{2}h$ and $16L h^{2}$ . Since visual tokens are not introduced, then LLM has a computational overhead of $24C d h^{2}+4C^{2}d h$ for text token sequence input. For training, we use perceptual weights as branches of LLM weights. The extra computation comes from three parts: 1) the matrix multiplication of the two perceptual weights with FLOPs of $24k r h^{2}$ . 2) The multiplication of the text token and the perceptual weights with FLOPs of $12C k h^{2}$ . 3) The output coming out of the perceptual weights is to be added to the output of the LLM weights with FLOPs of $14C k h$ . Therefore, the total FLOPs of VLoRA during training is $24C d h^{2}+4C^{2}\\bar{d h}+24k r h^{2}+12C k h^{2}+14C k h$ . For inference, we merge the perceptual weights with LLM\u2019s weights.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
