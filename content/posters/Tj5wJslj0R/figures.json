In discriminative modeling (a-c), the model learns tasks separately and fails to discriminate between classes from different tasks at test time, even if it remembers individual classes (dotted line in (c)). Generative modeling (d-f), on the other hand, learns a joint representation that allows for successful discrimination between all classes. Thus, the figure visually demonstrates the core argument of the paper that generative models overcome task confusion, while discriminative models do not.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "Tj5wJslj0R/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Task Confusion in Discriminative and Generative Modeling.", "description": "This figure visually represents task confusion (TC) in both discriminative and generative modeling within the context of class-incremental learning.  In the discriminative model (left), the diagonal blocks represent intra-task discrimination (within the same task), while the off-diagonal blocks represent inter-task discrimination (between different tasks).  The discriminative model shows a high degree of task confusion (red blocks) because it cannot discriminate between tasks easily, while also suffering from catastrophic forgetting (lighter green). The generative model (right), on the other hand, demonstrates significantly less task confusion, as evidenced by the largely empty inter-task blocks. This is because generative modeling naturally avoids TC.", "section": "Theorem 1 (Infeasibility Theorem)"}, {"figure_path": "Tj5wJslj0R/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Task Confusion in Discriminative and Generative Modeling.", "description": "This figure illustrates the difference between task confusion (TC) in discriminative and generative modeling in class incremental learning.  The left side shows discriminative modeling, where sequentially training on tasks leads to forgetting (lighter green) and an inability to discriminate between tasks (red). This is due to the focus on minimizing intra-task losses only. Generative modeling, on the right side, avoids this issue because it minimizes both intra and inter-task losses simultaneously.", "section": "2 Mathematical framework for Class-IL"}, {"figure_path": "Tj5wJslj0R/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Generative classifiers like SLDA and GenC mitigate TC and CF (CIFAR-10).", "description": "This figure displays confusion matrices for six different class-incremental learning strategies on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  Each matrix visualizes the performance of a classifier, showing the relationship between true and predicted classes. The strategies are EWC, SI, AR1 (all discriminative methods), DGR (generative replay), SLDA, and GenC (both generative classifiers).  The color intensity represents the number of correctly classified samples for each class pair, with darker colors indicating more correct classifications. The figure demonstrates the superior performance of the generative classifiers (SLDA, GenC) compared to discriminative methods in mitigating task confusion (TC) and catastrophic forgetting (CF). GenC achieves the highest accuracy (0.59), significantly outperforming the other methods.", "section": "3 Optimality analysis of Class-IL strategies"}, {"figure_path": "Tj5wJslj0R/figures/figures_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure F.1: In this figure, Synaptic Intelligence (SI) [2] with \u03bb = 1 is adopted.

In task-IL, where task IDs are provided, SI demonstrates a considerable mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (CF), as indicated by a smaller performance drop on previously learned tasks.  However, in the class-IL setting (no task IDs), SI is largely ineffective at mitigating task confusion (TC), shown by a substantial decline in accuracy as new tasks are introduced.  This highlights that while SI reduces forgetting in the setting where task boundaries are known, it fails to address the more significant problem of task confusion when tasks are presented incrementally without task IDs.", "section": "Appendix F"}]
