Consequently, there are numerous different unit cells for the same crystal as shown in Figure 1. A unique and invariant unit cell must therefore be selected for each crystal. Second, it is crucial that this unit cell can be represented in a one-dimensional (1D) sequence that maintains invariance under arbitrary rotations and ensures completeness, allowing the full reconstruction of the crystal structure from its sequence representation. To tackle these complexities, we introduce Mat2Seq, a method that systematically transforms 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences. This is achieved by first identifying $S O(3)$ equivariant unit cells and subsequently converting these into $S E(3)$ invariant sequences. By integrating these unique and complete sequences into LLMs, we develop conditional generation capabilities for novel crystal structures.

To prove that Mat2Seq is periodic invariant and unit cell $S E(3)$ invariant, we first show that the unit cell $\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{u},\\mathbf{P}_{u},\\mathbf{L}_{u}\\right)$ determined in Sec. 3.2 is $S O(3)$ equivariant and periodic invariant. In other words, after applying arbitrary $S O(3)$ transformations $\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}\\in\\bar{\\mathbb{R}}^{3\\times3}$ , $|\\mathbf{R}|=1$ with $\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and periodic transformations, the resultant unit cell should change from $\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{u},\\mathbf{P}_{u},\\mathbf{L}_{u}\\right)$ to $(\\mathbf{A}_{u},\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{P}_{u},\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{\\bar{L}}_{u})$ . To begin with, because Euclidean distances $a,b,c$ , bond angles $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma$ , and whether three vectors form a right-hand system are $S E(3)$ and periodic invariant, which means after arbitrary $S O(3)$ transformation $\\mathbf{R}\\ \\dot{\\in}\\ \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3},|\\mathbf{R}|\\ =\\ 1$ with $\\textbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and periodic transformation, the same but rotated lattice matrix $\\mathbf{RL}_{u}$ will be determined.

Hence, when applying arbitrary $S O(3)$ transformation $\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$ , $|\\mathbf{R}|=1$ , $\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and periodic transformation to $(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{P},\\mathbf{L})$ , the resultant primitive unit cell will be $(\\mathbf{A}_{u},\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{P}_{u},\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{L}_{u})$ .

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
