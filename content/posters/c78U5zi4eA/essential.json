Recent research has explored enhancing CF with message passing (MP) from graph neural networks (GNNs), but the reasons for MP's effectiveness remain unclear, and many assumptions made by previous works are inaccurate.  This has led to computationally expensive methods. The paper addresses this gap by formally investigating the benefits of MP in CF.\nThis paper introduces TAG-CF, a novel test-time augmentation framework. TAG-CF applies MP only once during inference, effectively leveraging graph knowledge without the significant computational cost of training-time MP.  Evaluated on various datasets, TAG-CF consistently enhances CF models by up to 39.2% on cold users and 31.7% overall, with minimal extra computation. This challenges the assumption that MP improves CF in a manner similar to its benefits for other graph-based tasks.  The findings demonstrate that MP's benefits stem from additional representations during the forward pass, rather than backpropagation updates, and primarily aid low-degree nodes.", "affiliation": "University of California, Riverside", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "c78U5zi4eA/podcast.wav"}
