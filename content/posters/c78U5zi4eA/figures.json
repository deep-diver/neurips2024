The top panels display the NDCG@20 scores for LightGCN and MF, highlighting the performance difference between the two methods. The bottom panels depict the percentage improvement achieved by LightGCN over MF. These plots reveal a key insight: the benefit of message passing is more pronounced for low-degree nodes (users with fewer interactions) and diminishes as the degree increases. This indicates that message passing in CF primarily helps users with limited historical data, whose preferences are harder to predict solely based on matrix factorization.", "section": "3.2 Message Passing in CF Helps Low-degree Users More Compared with High-degrees"}, {"figure_path": "c78U5zi4eA/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performances of LightGCN and Matrix Factorization w.r.t. the user degree across datasets.

It demonstrates that the performance improvement gained by using message passing in collaborative filtering is more significant for low-degree users (users with fewer interactions) compared to high-degree users.  The improvement decreases as the user degree increases, illustrating a key finding of the paper that challenges common assumptions about the benefits of message passing.", "section": "3.2 Message Passing in CF Helps Low-degree Users More Compared with High-degrees"}, {"figure_path": "c78U5zi4eA/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performances of LightGCN and Matrix Factorization w.r.t. the user degree across datasets. The performance improvement brought by message passing decreases as the user degree goes up.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of LightGCN and Matrix Factorization methods with respect to the user degree (number of interactions) on different datasets.  It visually demonstrates that the performance improvement from adding message passing (LightGCN) is more significant for low-degree users (users with fewer interactions) than for high-degree users. This contrasts with the typical behavior of GNNs on general graph learning tasks where high-degree nodes benefit more from message passing. This observation suggests a key difference in how message passing impacts collaborative filtering compared to other graph learning applications.", "section": "3 How Does Message Passing Improve Collaborative Filtering?"}, {"figure_path": "c78U5zi4eA/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performances of LightGCN and Matrix Factorization w.r.t. the user degree across datasets.

The x-axis represents the number of user interactions (user degree), and the y-axis represents the NDCG@20 performance.  Separate subplots are provided for each dataset. The top row presents the raw NDCG@20 scores for MF and LightGCN, while the bottom row illustrates the performance improvement gained by LightGCN over MF for each degree.  The results reveal that the performance improvement from LightGCN over MF is more significant for users with lower degrees and diminishes as the user degree increases.", "section": "3 How Does Message Passing Improve Collaborative Filtering?"}]
