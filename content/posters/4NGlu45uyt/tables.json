It shows the different settings (e.g., whether the orthogonal transformation is the identity matrix), the performance metrics used (overlap and transport cost), the dimensional regimes considered (high-dimensional, low-dimensional, etc.), and the conditions under which exact or approximate recovery of the permutation and orthogonal transformation is possible. The table provides a concise overview of the key findings across multiple studies, highlighting the contributions of the current paper.", "section": "Discussion and related work"}]
