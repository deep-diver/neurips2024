Existing methods often ignore or inadequately address this challenge, leading to performance degradation, especially in complex scenes with frequent occlusions. \n\nTo mitigate this, the paper proposes MonoMAE, a novel approach that leverages masked autoencoders. MonoMAE incorporates a depth-aware masking strategy to selectively mask portions of non-occluded objects during training, simulating the effect of occlusions.  A lightweight query completion network then reconstructs these masked features, enabling the model to learn robust representations that are less sensitive to occlusions.  Experiments demonstrate that MonoMAE significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with high occlusion rates.  This showcases its effectiveness in handling real-world conditions and advancing the state-of-the-art in monocular 3D object detection.", "affiliation": "UCAS-Terminus AI Lab, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "wiK6bwuxjE/podcast.wav"}
