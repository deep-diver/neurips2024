### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning models are computationally expensive, creating challenges for deployment on resource-limited devices. Existing adaptive depth networks that adjust model depth to match resource availability are often complex and time-consuming to train. This research addresses these issues by presenting a novel method for building adaptive-depth networks that drastically reduces the training time. The core of the method is dividing each residual stage of a network into two paths - a mandatory path for core feature learning and a skippable path for refinement. A self-distillation strategy is used to train these paths, where the skippable path is optimized to minimize performance degradation when skipped. This allows the network to efficiently select various depths at testing time without needing to retrain. 

The approach achieves this by applying a self-distillation technique. The largest and smallest networks are used as teacher and student, respectively. Instead of retraining each sub-network, this strategy significantly reduces training time. At testing time, the network can select different depths by combinatorially selecting which sub-paths to use. This allows selection of sub-networks with various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs from a single model.  The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on several deep learning models, including CNNs and transformers, showing improved performance compared to traditional approaches. This work provides an architectural pattern and training strategy generally applicable to various network architectures. It also delivers a theoretical foundation explaining why this method can reduce errors and minimize the impact of skipping sub-paths.

### In-depth insights


#### Adaptive Depth Nets
Adaptive depth networks represent a significant advancement in neural network efficiency.  By strategically enabling the skipping of certain layers during inference, **latency and computational costs are reduced** without severely compromising accuracy. This adaptability is achieved through a novel training approach that divides each residual stage into two sub-paths: a mandatory path crucial for feature learning and a skippable path designed for refinement.  **A key innovation is the self-distillation strategy**, which trains these sub-paths to minimize performance degradation even when skipped, eliminating the need for exhaustive training of all possible sub-networks.  The resulting single network can dynamically adapt to various resource constraints at test time, providing a **superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off** compared to traditional static networks. The formal analysis provided further solidifies the theoretical foundation of this adaptive technique, demonstrating its efficacy in reducing prediction errors while maintaining feature representation quality.

#### Self-Distillation
The concept of self-distillation in this research paper centers on **training sub-networks within a larger network to minimize performance degradation when certain layers are skipped.** This is achieved by using a self-supervised learning strategy where the largest and smallest sub-networks (super-net and base-net) act as teacher and student respectively, ensuring efficient transfer of knowledge without exhaustive training of every potential sub-network. This approach is particularly effective due to its **simplicity and ability to reduce training time**. The core idea revolves around optimizing skippable sub-paths to preserve feature level information, essentially mimicking the properties of residual blocks and refining features without significantly altering the input. This method is shown to **improve prediction accuracy and resource efficiency**, while offering a more general and robust approach to adaptive depth networks compared to prior methods.

#### Skippable Subpaths
The concept of "Skippable Subpaths" introduces a novel approach to adaptive depth networks.  The core idea revolves around dividing each hierarchical residual stage into two distinct sub-paths: a **mandatory path** essential for hierarchical feature learning and a **skippable path** designed to refine features while minimizing performance degradation if skipped.  This architecture enables efficient inference by dynamically selecting sub-networks with various accuracy-latency trade-offs at test time through combinatorial activation of the sub-paths.  A crucial aspect is the training strategy that utilizes **self-distillation** to optimize the skippable paths to preserve the essential feature distributions even when skipped, which reduces overall prediction errors while avoiding exhaustive sub-network training. The **formal analysis provided supports the effectiveness of this technique by demonstrating that the residual functions in the skippable paths reduce errors iteratively without significantly altering feature distributions.** This approach enhances both the efficiency and adaptability of deep networks.

#### Formal Analysis
The heading 'Formal Analysis' suggests a section dedicated to mathematically rigorous justification of the proposed method.  It likely delves into the theoretical underpinnings of the adaptive depth network's efficiency, specifically addressing why skipping certain sub-paths during inference doesn't significantly impact performance. This involves demonstrating that the trained skippable sub-paths primarily act as **feature refinement** units, making minimal alterations to the overall feature representation. **Taylor expansion** might be used to approximate the loss function, showing that the impact of skipping these paths is minimal. The analysis would likely provide a formal guarantee, establishing a connection between the training methodology and the reduced prediction error even with fewer layers.  Crucially, **the formal analysis would aim to prove that the trained model behaves as intended** and isn't merely an empirical observation. The ultimate goal is to provide a mathematical foundation explaining the success of their proposed architecture.

#### On-device Efficiency
On-device efficiency is a crucial aspect of deploying deep learning models, especially in resource-constrained environments.  The paper likely investigates methods to optimize model inference for reduced latency and energy consumption.  This could involve techniques like **model compression**, **quantization**, or **adaptive computation**.  The results section probably showcases a comparison of the proposed approach against existing techniques, highlighting improvements in terms of **speed** and **power efficiency**.  A key consideration is the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency; the paper would likely demonstrate that the proposed methods maintain reasonable accuracy despite the optimizations.  Therefore, the focus is on practical deployment, showing how improvements translate to real-world benefits on target devices, particularly concerning **power usage** and **inference time**.

While the first (blue) sub-path is mandatory for hierarchical feature learning, the second (orange) sub-path can be skipped for efficiency. The layers in the skippable sub-path are trained to preserve the feature distribution from  hbase to hsuper using the proposed self-distillation strategy. Having similar distributions, either hbase or hsuper can be provided as input h to the next residual stage. In the mandatory sub-path, another set of batch normalization operators, called skip-aware BNs, is exploited if the second sub-path is skipped. These sub-paths are building blocks to construct sub-networks of varying depths.

The consistent increase in validation accuracy for many of the networks shows that depth adaptation provides a performance boost.
