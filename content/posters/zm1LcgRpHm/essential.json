However, this may not always be true, particularly for complex real-world time series where dependencies may exist between non-adjacent sections. This paper explores the impact of alternative time series arrangements on representation learning by introducing a novel plug-and-play layer called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3).  The existing approaches may struggle to capture these long-range dependencies, hindering effective representation learning. \nThe proposed S3 layer addresses this by creating non-overlapping segments of the original time series and then shuffling those segments in a learned manner determined by the downstream task.  This shuffled sequence, combined with the original sequence via a learned weighted sum, is then passed to the rest of the model.  The results on various benchmark datasets (including classification, forecasting and anomaly detection) show significant improvements in model performance compared to various state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.  Furthermore, it is shown that S3 makes training more stable, with a smoother training loss curve.", "affiliation": "Queen's University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "zm1LcgRpHm/podcast.wav"}
