This creates challenges for scalability and parallel processing, particularly when dealing with non-Euclidean graph data.  Existing non-backpropagation methods have limitations when directly applied to GNNs. \nThe paper introduces DFA-GNN, a novel forward learning framework that addresses these challenges. DFA-GNN uses a dedicated forward training mechanism and extends the principles of Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) to GNNs. It incorporates graph topology into feedback links to handle non-Euclidean data and uses a pseudo-error generator for semi-supervised learning, effectively spreading errors from labeled nodes to unlabeled ones.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance and robustness against various types of noise and attacks, outperforming both traditional BP and other non-BP approaches.**", "affiliation": "Beijing Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hKVTwQQu76/podcast.wav"}
