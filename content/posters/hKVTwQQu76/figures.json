[{"figure_path": "hKVTwQQu76/figures/figures_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Illustrations of BP, FF, FORWARDGNN and proposed DFA-GNN.", "description": "The figure illustrates four different training methods for graph neural networks (GNNs): Backpropagation (BP), Forward-Forward (FF), FORWARDGNN, and the proposed Direct Feedback Alignment-GNN (DFA-GNN).  It visually compares the flow of information, including forward and backward passes, weight updates, and the handling of errors for each method. BP uses traditional backpropagation with a complete backward pass to adjust weights. FF uses two forward passes, one with positive and one with negative samples. FORWARDGNN uses layer-wise training with data augmentation. DFA-GNN, in contrast, leverages a direct feedback alignment mechanism, extending the principles of DFA to adapt to the unique structure of GNNs and the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, incorporating graph topology into feedback links.  For semi-supervised learning, it includes a pseudo error generator to address the unavailability of true errors for all nodes.", "section": "4 Proposed DFA-GNN"}, {"figure_path": "hKVTwQQu76/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: For a three-layer GCN model trained by DFA-GNN on Cora, (a) the accuracy and angle between W and B; (b) the change in loss across different stages; (c) the change in angle between W and B across different stages; (d) difference in optimization direction between BP and our method.", "description": "This figure visualizes various aspects of the DFA-GNN training process on the Cora dataset using a three-layer GCN model. Subfigure (a) shows the training accuracy and the angle between the forward weights (W) and feedback weights (B) over training epochs, illustrating the alignment between them. Subfigure (b) demonstrates the training loss across three distinct stages of training: training layers 1 and 2 while freezing layer 3, freezing layers 1 and 2 while training layer 3, and training layers 1 and 2 while freezing layer 3. Subfigure (c) presents the dynamic changes in the angle between W and B across these training stages.
