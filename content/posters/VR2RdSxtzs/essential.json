Current methods like Tree of Thought (ToT) and Graph of Thought (GoT) are limited in their effectiveness and generalizability. These approaches often require specific prompts tailored to individual problems, hindering their applicability to diverse scenarios.  This necessitates the development of a more robust and versatile solution.\nThe researchers propose the Multi-Agent System for Condition Mining (MACM) prompting method. MACM addresses the limitations of existing methods by employing a multi-agent interactive system. It extracts the conditions and objectives of a problem, iteratively mining new conditions that aid in achieving the objective.  This approach improves accuracy by over 10 percentage points and exhibits strong generalizability across various mathematical contexts.  In experiments, MACM increased GPT-4 Turbo's accuracy in solving challenging mathematical problems by over 20%, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art techniques.", "affiliation": "University of Minnesota", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "VR2RdSxtzs/podcast.wav"}
