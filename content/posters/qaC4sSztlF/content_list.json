To address these issues, researchers have explored various approaches, such as dataset flitering, adversarial perturbations, machine unlearning, and inference-time refusals.

In these VL2I methods, especially with diffusion models, some use both images of a subject and written descriptions to render the subject in a new context, which is called subject-driven generation [1, 2]. Others take original images and instructions for changes to create altered images, known as image editing [3]. Early approaches either fine-tune models on new images [4, 2, 5, 6, 7] or directly inject image features into the U-Net of diffusion models [8, 9, 1, 10]. However, these methods struggle to jointly model multi-modal inputs and fully leverage the generalization ability of the diffusion model. BLIP-Diffusion [11] is a notable advancement because it creates object representations by blending images with random backgrounds, allowing for the generation of single objects without prior examples. Building on this, Kosmos-G [12] expands to generate multiple objects without examples, using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) instead of the original CLIP text encoder to encode different kinds of inputs into a single feature set.

Filtering the dataset involves removing images containing explicit or objectionable content, such as nudity and violence, to ensure the safe generation of diffusion models. However, the advent of zero-shot learning introduces challenges, as it enables diffusion models to transfer unseen objects and styles, complicating copyright protection and security review processes. While adversarial perturbations offer a means to safeguard specific images from manipulation, their efficacy is hampered by the need for training and adaptation to diffusion models with varying parameters. This lack of scalability arises from the requirement to train different adversarial perturbations for each model, despite their structural similarities. Similarly, unlearning-based methods address inherent model defects but fall short in addressing the use of external unsafe images for concept transfer by users. Moreover, existing inference-time refusals predominantly target unsafe concepts describable by language, thus exhibiting limited effectiveness in multi-modal zero-shot generation scenarios.

These techniques rely on textual descriptions of unsafe concepts, encoded using a CLIP text encoder, to provide negative guidance for denoising.

We provide a comparison between images generated by Kosmos-G and Kosmos-G-Neg in Appendix-D. This anomaly suggests that the MLLM encoder struggles to interpret the explicit \u201cwithout\u201d command in the prompt. SLD adjusts the noise prediction of U-Net in diffusion models using auxiliary guidance, making it suitable for localized image detail retouching. However, its effectiveness in object removal appears limited. ProtoRe performs well in most categories but struggles when dealing with large objects (e.g., church) that occupy a significant portion of the image. In contrast, our proposed CRE method demonstrates superior unsafe concept removal capabilities across all categories.

This dataset comprises 158 images, all featuring simple objects and backgrounds, which facilitates successful style transfer.

As the number of unsafe concepts increases, the performance of SLD and ProtoRe decreases. This decline is attributed to the length of negative text prompts, which increases with the number of unsafe concepts. Different prompt lengths are encoded into fixed lengths by the encoder, and overly long prompts may lead to information distortion during encoding. While SLD and ProtoRe perform better when dealing with a single unsafe concept, they may not be suitable for tasks requiring simultaneous governance of multiple unsafe concepts in practical scenarios. In contrast, our method exhibits consistent performance, with almost no difference in performance between processing a single unsafe concept and multiple unsafe concepts (the performance gap is less than $0.1\\%$ ). In particular, when multiple unsafe concepts require supervision, both SLD and ProtoRe tend to retain some additional concepts in the generated image. As illustrated in Figure 4, the little yellow duck generated by SLD and ProtoRe, after the removal of the Disney style, still retains concepts such as brown hair.

As evidenced in Table 3 and Figure 4, as the number of unsafe concepts requiring simultaneous governance increases, the adverse impact of inadequate discriminator performance becomes more pronounced. Secondly, in comparison to safe generation methods that utilize fine-tuned diffusion models, representation editing introduces additional inference overhead. Nevertheless, since CRE is only applied in the cross-attention layer during a specific causal period, this additional overhead remains within a tolerable range.

By leveraging causal periods, CRE allows for precise and efficient removal of unsafe elements from generated images while preserving the integrity and quality of the generated content. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation highlights CRE\u2019s superiority over existing methods in both safe object and style transfer tasks. Specifically, CRE effectively reduces the presence of unsafe concepts, demonstrating its robustness across a variety of scenarios. Moreover, CRE exhibits strong scalability, maintaining consistent performance when managing multiple unsafe concepts simultaneously. This scalability is critical for real-world applications where the diversity and complexity of unsafe concepts can vary significantly. The ability of CRE to handle multiple unsafe concepts with minimal performance degradation ensures its applicability in dynamic and complex environments. In addition, CRE underscores the importance of representation-based interventions in generative models. Unlike methods that rely heavily on textual descriptions for unsafe concepts, CRE\u2019s representation editing approach proves to be more adaptable and effective, especially in multi-modal zero-shot generation scenarios. Overall, CRE represents a significant advancement in safe concept transfer, offering a robust, scalable, and effective solution for mitigating unsafe content.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
