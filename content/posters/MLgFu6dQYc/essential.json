Traditional boosting methods, while successful, often rely on first-order information (gradients), restricting their use to specific types of loss functions.  A major limitation is that many existing zeroth-order methods require assumptions such as loss function convexity or differentiability for their convergence proofs to hold, which restricts their applicability to a subset of loss functions. \nThis research introduces a novel boosting algorithm, SECBOOST, which directly tackles these limitations.  **SECBOOST uses v-derivatives (a generalization of derivatives from quantum calculus) and Bregman secant distortions to optimize loss functions without any assumptions regarding differentiability or convexity**. This is a major advancement as it significantly extends the applicability of boosting to a broader range of loss functions commonly encountered in ML problems. The algorithm introduces a new \"offset oracle\" component to further enhance its convergence properties. The theoretical analysis proves that SECBOOST converges to an optimal solution and provides a formal framework for understanding boosting without the reliance on traditional assumptions.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "MLgFu6dQYc/podcast.wav"}
