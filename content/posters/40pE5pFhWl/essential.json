However, existing methods struggle to efficiently explore the vast chemical space and often lack the ability to incorporate physical constraints.  Current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models use pre-specified forward processes, limiting their generative capacity. \nThis paper introduces Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model that addresses these limitations. END uses a learnable forward process, parameterized through a time- and data-dependent transformation equivariant to rigid transformations.  Benchmark results demonstrate END's superior performance in both unconditional and conditional molecule generation compared to existing methods. The results highlight the advantages of learnable forward processes in diffusion models, making it a promising approach for generating molecules with desired properties.", "affiliation": "Technical University of Denmark", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "40pE5pFhWl/podcast.wav"}
