Existing closed-loop methods often require extensive data collection within a single session, while inherent variability in neural activity across sessions further complicates the process.  This necessitates the development of novel approaches that can effectively manage the large parameter space and address data variability.\nTo tackle these issues, the paper introduces MiSO (MicroStimulation Optimization), a novel closed-loop brain stimulation framework.  **MiSO integrates three key components**: a neural activity alignment method to combine data across sessions, a CNN model to predict brain responses to untested parameters, and an online optimization algorithm to adaptively adjust stimulation parameters.  **Experiments using electrical microstimulation in non-human primates demonstrate MiSO's success in navigating a significantly larger parameter space than previous approaches, effectively driving neural activity towards specified states and achieving novel activity patterns.**", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Gb0mXhn5h3/podcast.wav"}
