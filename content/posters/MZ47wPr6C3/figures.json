The heatmap visualizes the ratio of correlations between SCCA and CCA for different combinations of s1 and s2. It provides insights into the maximum sparsity that SCCA can achieve while maintaining a high correlation with the full data.", "section": "5.2 Illustration of the impact sparsity levels on SCCA"}]
