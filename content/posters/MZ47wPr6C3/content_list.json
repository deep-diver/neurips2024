To the best of our knowledge, the work [36] was the first paper that introduced the concept of SCCA to select only small subsets of variables to better explain the relationship between many genetic loci and gene expression phenotypes. A handful subset of features enhances interpretability, a desirable property, especially in complex data analysis, which has been successfully demonstrated in Sparse PCA [25]. To obtain sparse canonical loadings $\\left({\\pmb x},{\\pmb y}\\right)$ , [39] first applied elastic net penalty to the classical CCA via an iterative regression procedure. In a seminal work on SCCA [41], the authors proposed a rigorous formulation by enforcing the $\\ell_{1}$ constraints on variables $\\left({\\pmb x},{\\pmb y}\\right)$ and developed a penalized matrix decomposition method to solve the penalized CCA problem. Then, extensive research has focused on various penalty norm functions to obtain sparse canonical loadings (see, e.g., [20, 26, 39, 42, 10]). In particular, [10] penalized multiple canonical loadings by $\\ell_{1}$ norm and computed the sparse solution by the linearized Bregman method. It should be noted that under the assumption that the leading canonical loadings are sparse, [7, 17, 18] established theoretical guarantees of iterative approaches for estimating sparse solutions. Another research direction in SCCA introduced penalty functions based on group structural information of input data and developed group SCCA methods [29, 30]. For a comprehensive overview of CCA and SCCA methods, we refer readers to the survey by [44] and the references therein. These approaches, however, do not strictly enforce the exact sparsity requirement but only approximate the sparsity requirement (i.e., the $\\ell_{0}$ norm) by a convex function. Another relevant work [40] introduced binary variables to recast SCCA as a mixed-integer nonconvex program under the assumption of positive definite matrices $B,C$ , based on which they designed a branch-and-bound algorithm. Different from the literature, our work does not require positive definiteness assumption of matrices $B,C$ , and we are able to obtain mixed-integer conic and semidefinite programming reformulations, allowing for better exact and approximation algorithms.

Analogous to SCCA, both sparse PCA [13, 25] and sparse SVD [28] select small subsets of variables to improve the interpretability of dimensionality reduction methods: PCA and SVD. Considerable investigation has been conducted on solving sparse PCA and sparse SVD from three angles: convex relaxations [12\u201314], approximation algorithms [6, 9, 28], and exact algorithms [2, 27, 28]. As mentioned before, in sparse PCA and sparse SVD, the covariance matrices $B,C$ are identity. Such a setting dramatically simplifies the subset selection problems of sparse PCA and sparse SVD compared to that of SCCA, as in these problems, it suffices to focus on the selection of a submatrix of the matrix $\\pmb{A}$ . Specifically, it is shown in [11, 27, 35] that sparse PCA reduces to selecting a principal submatrix of $\\pmb{A}$ to maximize the largest eigenvalue(s) and sparse SVD reduces to selecting a possibly non-symmetric submatrix of $\\pmb{A}$ to maximize the largest singular value(s) [28]. Quite differently, the combinatorial reformulation (1) of SCCA aims to simultaneously select a sized- $\\left(s_{1}\\times s_{1}\\right)$ principal submatrix of $_B$ , a sized- $\\left(s_{2}\\times s_{2}\\right)$ principal submatrix of $_{C}$ , and a sized- $\\left(s_{1}\\times s_{2}\\right)$ submatrix of $\\pmb{A}$ .
