However, current masked-reconstruction training strategies often suffer from insufficient contextual information extraction.  This is largely due to the use of noisy-to-noisy reconstruction, where the model reconstructs masked noisy patches from unmasked noisy patches, hindering proper contextual understanding.\nThe paper introduces MC-DiT, a novel approach that addresses these issues by using clean-to-clean masked reconstruction.  Instead of reconstructing noisy patches from other noisy patches, MC-DiT trains the model to reconstruct clean patches from other clean patches. This allows the model to better utilize contextual information and avoids the negative impacts of noise.  Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, MC-DiT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods in terms of image quality and training speed.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "y9sHKrdnRt/podcast.wav"}
