### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Generative models like diffusion models and flow-based models are widely used for data generation, but they often lack a strong theoretical foundation, leading to limitations in performance and applicability.  Existing methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo use predetermined force fields which is not ideal.  This paper addresses these issues by exploring the potential of designing customized force fields for Hamiltonian ODEs.

This paper introduces **Hamiltonian Velocity Predictors (HVPs)** to design force fields for Hamiltonian ODEs. Using HVPs, the authors develop **Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM)** for score function estimation and **Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs)** for generative modeling.  **HGFs** generalize diffusion models and flow-matching, while **HSM** offers a novel score matching metric with lower variance.  The authors validate their methods through experiments demonstrating the superiority of HGFs and HSM.

> This figure shows the results of applying the Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM) method to a Gaussian mixture dataset. Panel (a) displays the true density of the data distribution. Panel (b) shows the learned score function, which is a vector field representing the gradient of the log-density.  As expected, the learned score function accurately captures the gradients of the true density. Panel (c) shows the learned velocity predictor, which ideally should be zero everywhere according to theory.  The near-zero values in this panel demonstrate the effectiveness of the HSM method.

> This table presents a comparison of the performance of various generative models on three image generation benchmarks: CIFAR-10 (unconditional), CIFAR-10 (class conditional), and FFHQ.  The metrics used for comparison are the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), a measure of sample quality, and the number of function evaluations (NFE), which reflects computational cost.  The results show that the proposed Oscillation HGF model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.





### In-depth insights


#### HVP Score Matching
Hamiltonian Velocity Predictors (HVPs) represent a novel approach to score matching, leveraging the power of Hamiltonian dynamics.  **HVP score matching cleverly circumvents the limitations of traditional methods** by directly estimating the velocity from the Hamiltonian ODE, without needing explicit knowledge of the score function. This avoids issues like high variance and computational cost associated with existing techniques.  The core idea is to learn a velocity predictor network that, when integrated with a parameterized Hamiltonian ODE, accurately predicts the velocity given a location in data space. The proposed Hamiltonian Score Discrepancy (HSD) metric quantifies the difference between the learned velocity predictor and the true velocity, serving as an effective loss function during training.  **The use of HVPs is innovative and potentially more efficient**, because it bypasses the explicit calculation of the score, leading to a more straightforward training process and potentially broader applicability to a wider range of generative modeling tasks.  Ultimately, **HVP Score Matching offers a significant advancement in score matching techniques**, providing a fresh perspective and superior performance on complex datasets.

#### HGF Generative Flows
Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs) represent a novel generative modeling framework that leverages Hamiltonian dynamics.  **HGFs unify existing methods like diffusion models and flow matching by parameterizing the Hamiltonian ODE's force field and marginalizing out the velocity.**  This approach offers a flexible and expressive design space.  A key contribution is the Hamiltonian Velocity Predictor (HVP), enabling efficient score function estimation and sample generation.  **The theoretical foundation highlights how a zero force field in HGFs recovers diffusion models, while specific force fields (e.g., harmonic oscillators in Oscillation HGFs) yield unique generative properties.**  This framework provides a new perspective for generative modeling and is particularly promising for integrating physical systems and dynamics into the generative process.

#### Oscillation HGFs
The proposed Oscillation HGFs represent a novel generative model stemming from the Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs) framework.  **Instead of relying on zero force fields like diffusion models or employing learned force fields as in other HGF variants, Oscillation HGFs leverage a harmonic oscillator-inspired force field.** This specific choice is motivated by its inherent scale-invariance, meaning the model's behavior is consistent across different scales.  The authors' experiments reveal that this scale-invariance translates to improved performance, rivaling leading generative models without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. The simplicity and effectiveness of the Oscillation HGFs highlight the potential of deliberately designing force fields within the HGFs framework to achieve better generative modeling results. This approach also suggests a new avenue for future research: exploring other physically-inspired force fields to further enhance the performance and capabilities of generative models.

#### HSM Experimental
Hypothetical 'HSM Experimental' section would likely detail empirical evaluations of the Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM) method.  It would present results demonstrating HSM's performance in score matching tasks, comparing it against existing methods like denoising score matching (DSM). Key aspects would include the datasets used (likely Gaussian mixtures initially, progressing to more complex datasets), metrics employed (e.g., Hamiltonian Score Discrepancy,  explicit score matching loss), and an analysis of HSM's variance characteristics.  **A core focus would be validating the theoretical claims made about HSM's ability to provide accurate score estimations with lower variance**, especially when compared to DSM at lower noise levels.  The experiments might involve analyzing the impact of hyperparameters (e.g., training time, trajectory length) on HSM's performance.  Visualizations, such as plots showcasing the correlation between HSM loss and existing metrics, or comparisons of learned score fields with ground truth, would be crucial. The discussion would critically evaluate the advantages and limitations of HSM, potentially highlighting its suitability for specific applications and its computational costs.

#### Future Directions
Future research should explore **more sophisticated force fields** within the Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs) framework, potentially incorporating knowledge from physics or other domains.  Investigating **alternative optimization strategies** beyond the current min-max approach for Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM) is crucial for improved efficiency and scalability.  A particularly promising avenue is to explore **denoising Hamiltonian score matching**, leveraging the strengths of both HSM and denoising score matching.  Additionally,  **adapting HGFs to manifold-valued data** is key to expanding its applicability to scenarios such as molecular dynamics or other applications involving complex data structures. Finally, a deeper investigation into **the theoretical underpinnings of HGFs**, particularly exploring the connection between different classes of force fields and the resulting generative properties, would yield valuable insights for model design and interpretation.
