The metrics used for comparison are the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), a measure of sample quality, and the number of function evaluations (NFE), which reflects computational cost.  The results show that the proposed Oscillation HGF model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "section": "9.2 HGF experiments - Image Generation"}]
