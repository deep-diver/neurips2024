{"importance": "This paper challenges the common assumption that pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) always improve model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL).  **It reveals that PVRs often fail to enhance sample efficiency or generalization in MBRL**, highlighting the need for further investigation into effective representation learning strategies within this model-based setting and opening new avenues for research in efficient RL.", "summary": "Contrary to expectations, pre-trained visual representations surprisingly don't improve model-based reinforcement learning's sample efficiency or generalization;  data diversity and network architecture are key for out-of-distribution performance.", "takeaways": ["Pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) do not consistently improve the sample efficiency or generalization of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL).", "Data diversity and network architecture are more important than PVR properties (e.g., language conditioning, sequential data) for out-of-distribution generalization in MBRL.", "The quality of the learned dynamics model, particularly reward prediction accuracy, significantly impacts overall MBRL performance. Models trained from scratch often produce superior dynamics models compared to those using PVRs."], "tldr": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to improve sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning (RL), often by incorporating pre-trained visual representations (PVRs). However, the effectiveness of PVRs in MBRL remains largely unexplored.  Many existing studies focus on model-free RL, leaving the MBRL context largely unaddressed. This creates a critical gap in our understanding of how to best leverage visual information for efficient and generalizable RL agents. \nThis paper rigorously benchmarks various PVRs on challenging control tasks using a model-based RL approach.  The study reveals a **surprising finding**: current PVRs do not improve sample efficiency and often hinder generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to learning visual representations from scratch. The research further highlights that **data diversity and network architecture are the most critical factors** determining OOD generalization performance. Analyzing learned dynamics models showed that those trained from scratch had better accuracy, particularly in reward prediction.", "affiliation": "Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LvAy07mCxU/podcast.wav"}
