Soft constraints often fail to strictly satisfy these conditions, while domain decomposition methods can be computationally expensive.  Also, inefficient sampling strategies can hinder convergence and accuracy.\nThis research proposes solutions to these issues.  First, it derives a new formula to systematically enforce hard constraints, ensuring that boundary and initial conditions are precisely met.  Secondly, it introduces Dynamic Amplitude-Focused Sampling (DAFS) to strategically allocate sampling points for better accuracy. Finally, an algorithm is developed to find the optimal domain size, improving computational efficiency for large-scale problems.  These combined strategies provide a more accurate and efficient framework for solving acoustic wave equations.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "nu2Sqrsnr7/podcast.wav"}
