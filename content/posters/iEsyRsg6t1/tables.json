The ID problem identifies causal effects for the entire population; c-ID extends this to conditional causal effects; s-Recoverability focuses on inferring causal effects from a sub-population for the entire population; and the S-ID problem focuses on uniquely identifying a causal effect within a specific sub-population.", "section": "Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "iEsyRsg6t1/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Various causal effect identification problems.
