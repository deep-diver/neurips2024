While the unbiased sampler draws samples uniformly at random, the biased sampler selects samples based on certain criteria, forming a sub-population.", "description": "This figure illustrates two types of data used in causal inference: observational and interventional data.  Observational data is collected from an unbiased sampler, drawing samples uniformly from the entire population and providing the distribution P(V). Interventional data involves an intervention on a subset of variables (X) and then observing the effect on other variables (Y) in the population; an unbiased sampler would then give the distribution P<sub>x</sub>(Y).  The figure also shows how a biased sampler selects a sub-population based on criteria (S=1) resulting in conditional distributions P(V|S=1) for observational data and P<sub>x</sub>(Y|S=1) for interventional data.  These sub-population distributions are the central focus of the s-ID problem.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "iEsyRsg6t1/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: ADMG GS in Example 1.", "description": "This ADMG represents the causal relationships between variables in Example 1 of the paper, which discusses the effect of a cholesterol-lowering medication (X) on cardiovascular disease (Y), considering diet and exercise (Z) as a confounder and socioeconomic status as a latent variable influencing both the medication choice and the diet/exercise habits (S).  The directed edges show direct causal effects, while the bidirected edge represents confounding between X and Z due to the latent variable, which further affects the subpopulation indicator (S).
