[{"figure_path": "lvcWA24dxB/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results.", "description": "This table presents quantitative results comparing MOTIONCRAFT and T2V0 across different video generation scenarios.  The metrics used are Frame Consistency (average cosine similarity of CLIP embeddings of consecutive frames) and Motion Consistency (SSIM metric between the first frame and the second frame after applying reverse optical flow).  Higher scores indicate better consistency and realism.  The results show that MOTIONCRAFT outperforms T2V0 in both metrics, suggesting higher visual quality in generated videos.", "section": "4 Experimental results"}]
