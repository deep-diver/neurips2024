An artificial agent explores room(s) defined by a unique set of WSM signals, as depicted in panel a. Agents receive location-specific sensory experience vectors ex,y = R[:, x, y], where ex,y \u2208 RD. The agent's trajectory within a trial is thereby converted into a sequence of experience vectors. At every training step, we randomly sample Nbatch segments of T, seconds from episodic memories within a Tw second window. These segments form a stack of memories used to train the RAE. Every EV in this stack is randomly masked to occlude between rmin to rmax% of the signal with added Gaussian noise \u20ac. The RAE is trained to reconstruct complete, noiseless experience vectors.
