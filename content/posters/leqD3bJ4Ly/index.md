### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Procedure learning from videos is challenging due to temporal variations (non-monotonic actions, background frames) and inconsistencies across videos.  Existing methods often rely on frame-to-frame matching or assume monotonic alignment, leading to suboptimal results.  This limits the ability to accurately identify key steps and their sequential order in a complex task. 

To address these challenges, the authors propose OPEL, a novel procedure learning framework that uses optimal transport (OT) to model the distance between video frames as samples from unknown distributions. This allows for the relaxation of strict temporal assumptions.  **OPEL further incorporates optimality and temporal priors, regularized by inverse difference moment and KL-divergence, to enhance the OT formulation and improve temporal smoothness.**  The resulting framework outperforms the state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and F1-score.

> This figure illustrates the challenges in procedure learning.  It shows three example videos (V1, V2, V3) of someone making brownies. Each video shows the same five key steps (break egg, mix egg, add water, add oil, mix contents), but the order and timing of the steps vary across videos. Some videos include extra frames that are not part of the main procedure (background frames), while others show steps that are out of order (non-monotonic frames). The figure also shows how OPEL addresses these issues by learning an embedding space where frames with the same semantics (representing the same key step) are grouped together, regardless of temporal inconsistencies or extra frames.

### In-depth insights


#### Optimal Transport PL
Optimal Transport Procedure Learning (PL) presents a novel approach to procedure learning by framing the problem within the context of optimal transport.  **This method moves beyond traditional frame-to-frame comparisons, allowing for more flexible and robust alignment of video sequences, even in the presence of variations in speed, non-monotonic actions, or irrelevant frames.** By treating video frames as samples from probability distributions, the technique calculates distances using optimal transport, promoting alignment of semantically similar frames across different videos.  **The integration of optimality and temporal priors further enhances the method's ability to handle temporal irregularities.** The use of a contrastive loss prevents trivial solutions and improves overall performance.  **This approach demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets.** The advantages stem from its ability to account for diverse temporal dynamics, making it more adaptable to real-world scenarios.

#### Prioritized OT Alignment
Prioritized Optimal Transport (OT) alignment is a crucial concept for tasks involving the alignment of sequences with varying lengths or non-monotonic relationships.  **Standard OT struggles with these scenarios, often leading to suboptimal or misleading alignments.**  A prioritized approach addresses this by incorporating a mechanism to weight or rank the importance of different alignment matches.  This prioritization could leverage external information, such as temporal proximity, semantic similarity, or confidence scores derived from other modules of a larger system.  **The weights would then be integrated into the OT cost matrix**, influencing the final transport plan. This method allows for a more robust and accurate alignment, especially in complex scenarios involving noise or missing data, making it particularly valuable in applications like video alignment or procedural learning.  **Prioritization offers flexibility,** enabling the integration of various heuristics or domain-specific knowledge to guide the alignment process beyond basic distance metrics. However, **careful design of the prioritization scheme is essential**, to avoid introducing bias or unintended consequences.  A poorly designed prioritization could overshadow important, albeit less salient, matches.  Therefore, effective prioritization necessitates careful consideration of the specific application and potential sources of bias in the data.

#### Egocentric & Exocentric PL
A comparative analysis of egocentric and exocentric perspectives in procedure learning (PL) reveals crucial differences in data acquisition and model training. **Egocentric PL**, using first-person viewpoints, captures the learner's subjective experience, potentially including irrelevant details, while **exocentric PL**, employing third-person views, offers a more objective perspective, focusing on task-relevant actions.  However, egocentric data may reflect natural human behavior and provide richer contextual information that exocentric data might miss.  Model training strategies should be tailored to each perspective's strengths and weaknesses; egocentric models may benefit from techniques to filter out irrelevant information, while exocentric models may need to incorporate methods to infer hidden contextual clues from observed actions.  Comparative evaluations across both perspectives are critical for developing robust and generalizable PL models that can adapt to various scenarios and capture the full spectrum of human procedure execution.

#### OPEL Framework
The OPEL framework, as described in the research paper, centers around **optimal transport (OT)** for procedure learning.  It innovatively treats video frames as samples from distributions, calculating distances using OT. This approach elegantly handles temporal irregularities in videos, such as non-monotonic actions or irrelevant frames. **Two regularization terms** enhance the OT formulation.  The first, inverse difference moment regularization, promotes alignment of homogeneous frames in embedding space that are also temporally close. The second, KL-divergence based regularization, prioritizes alignment conformity to the OT solution while enforcing temporal priors.  **The framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods** on various benchmarks. A key component involves integrating an additional virtual frame in the OT matrix to specifically handle background or redundant frames, improving accuracy. Ultimately, OPEL showcases the power of OT for procedure learning by successfully addressing limitations of previous approaches that relied on strict assumptions or suboptimal alignment strategies.

#### Ablation & Future Work
An 'Ablation & Future Work' section would critically analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed optimal transport guided procedure learning (OPEL) framework.  **Ablation studies** would systematically remove or alter parts of OPEL (e.g., the optimality prior, temporal prior, contrastive loss) to assess their individual contributions and the overall system's robustness.  This would help determine the relative importance of each module and justify design choices. The **future work** section could then explore promising avenues of improvement. This might include investigating alternative distance metrics beyond optimal transport for frame alignment; exploring ways to incorporate additional modalities (e.g., audio, text) to enhance accuracy and generalization; and developing methods to handle more complex scenarios, such as those with significant variations in speed, actions, or objects between demonstrations.  Addressing the limitations of relying on similar object usage for successful key-step identification across videos is crucial for broader applicability. **Ultimately**, this section should position OPEL for future advances and suggest directions for broader impact within the field of procedure learning.

> This figure presents a qualitative comparison of the proposed OPEL method against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches for procedure learning on two benchmark datasets: MECCANO and PC Assembly.  Each row represents a different method (Ground Truth, Random, CnC, GPL+I3D, GPL, and OPEL), and each column shows the results for one of the datasets. Within each row and dataset, the vertical bars represent the frames of the video, and each color corresponds to a different key-step in the procedure. Gray represents frames that were not assigned to a key-step. The figure shows that OPEL significantly improves the accuracy of key-step identification and alignment compared to the SOTA methods.  This improvement is attributed to OPEL's ability to handle unmatched frames through the use of a virtual frame in its optimal transport formulation.

> This figure compares the probability density functions (PDFs) of Laplace, Gaussian, and Uniform distributions.  It highlights that the Laplace distribution is better suited for modeling the alignment of video frames because it has heavy tails, which can better capture outliers or non-monotonic alignments that deviate significantly from the mean. The Gaussian distribution is more sensitive to outliers and lacks the ability to capture such deviations, while the Uniform distribution does not accurately reflect the true distribution of frame alignments, which is likely to be skewed.
