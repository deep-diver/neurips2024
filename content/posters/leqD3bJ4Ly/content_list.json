For both third-person and first-person (egocentric) videos, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods aim at finding correspondences across videos in time to accomplish procedure learning. However, to establish temporal relationships within the sequences, these methods often rely on frame-to-frame mapping, or assume monotonic alignment of video pairs, leading to sub-optimal results. To this end, we propose to treat the video frames as samples from an unknown distribution, enabling us to frame their distance calculation as an optimal transport (OT) problem. Notably, the OTbased formulation allows us to relax the previously mentioned assumptions. To further improve performance, we enhance the OT formulation by introducing two regularization terms. The first, inverse difference moment regularization, promotes transportation between instances that are homogeneous in the embedding space as well as being temporally closer. The second, regularization based on the KL-divergence with an exponentially decaying prior smooths the alignment while enforcing conformity to the optimality (alignment obtained from vanilla OT optimization) and temporal priors.

This motivates us to explore unsupervised procedure learning from videos.

In a supervised setting, the reliance on per-frame annotations demands extensive manual labor. Conversely, weakly supervised methods involve using either ordered or unordered lists of key-steps. The generation of these lists requires either direct observation of the videos or specific heuristics, both of which pose significant scalability challenges [3]. Consequently, recent studies [1, 8] have shifted focus towards self-supervised learning, which do not require frame-wise labeling. Such a learning paradigm leverages the structured nature of accomplishing a complex task, which typically unfold in a predictable sequence of steps. For example, the act of preparing a \"brownie\" might involve breaking an egg, adding water, oil, mixing the contents, and then baking in the oven. The alignment of video frames is commonly performed in a monotonic manner [15], which presupposes a consistent order of actions across sequences. However, real-world sequences frequently deviate from this pattern, exhibiting temporal non-uniformities as depicted in Figure 1. These deviations can be categorized as follows: (i) background frames: frames irrelevant to the primary activity and should thus be excluded from alignment; (ii) redundant frames: these frames appear only in one sequence but not in others and do not contribute to the task; (iii) non-monotonic frames: these frames are characterized by a non-monotonic sequence of actions. Such frames challenge the assumption of monotonic progression and highlight the complexity of real-world activities. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods adopt custom approaches to counter these irregularities such as removing background frames from processing [2], using extra information (e.g. gaze, depth) [16], or simply ignore them leading to suboptimal results [1].

The differentiable OT loss facilitates the alignment of non-monotonic sequences through frame-wise matching based on individual frame features. However, it typically overlooks the temporal smoothness and the inherent ordering relationships within the videos. To overcome this deficiency, we integrate two priors into the transportation matrix. First, the optimality prior favors the positions dictated by the OT, whereas the temporal prior discourages transport between temporally distant frames. Both these priors are modeled using a Laplace distribution with exponentially decaying probability from the corresponding centers. We introduce an additional virtual frame into the OT matrix to address background and redundant frames. Furthermore, to avoid the common issue of converging to trivial solutions in temporal video alignment [15], we employ a novel inter-video contrastive loss, which acts as a regularizer.

Additionally, the dependence on imperfect Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems necessitates subsequent manual corrections. Moreover, multiple modalities require additional memory and compute.

The graph clearly shows that the Laplace distribution captures this behavior suitably compared to Uniform and Gaussian. Similarly, for the temporal prior, the $\\mathbf{X}$ -axis denotes the temporal distance between the frames, and the y-axis denotes the corresponding probability of alignment. The graph shows that Laplace distribution facilitates alignment of the frames when they are temporally aligned (close to center), and its long tail distribution enables better correlation of non-monotonic frames compared to Gaussian or Uniform. As a result, as shown in Fig. A1, even at far away locations from the center (temporally distant frames), alignment is possible if indeed these frames have a high match feature-wise. In this case, the Laplace temporal prior provides non-zero probability to that far away frame (due to its long tail) unlike other distributions and the optimality prior gives a large score (due to feature match), resulting in improved handling of non-monotonicity.
