{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in protein engineering and computational biology.  **MutaPLM offers a novel framework for interpreting and engineering protein mutations**, moving beyond limitations of existing protein language models.  Its open-source nature and comprehensive dataset accelerate progress in understanding protein evolution and design, opening **new avenues for drug discovery, biomaterial development, and disease research.**", "summary": "MutaPLM: a novel protein language model, provides human-understandable mutation explanations and designs novel mutations with desirable properties using a unique protein delta network and chain-of-thought learning.", "takeaways": ["MutaPLM uses a protein delta network to explicitly model protein mutations, providing insightful explanations.", "MutaPLM leverages chain-of-thought learning to integrate mutation knowledge from biomedical text, improving explanation and engineering accuracy.", "MutaDescribe, a large-scale dataset with rich textual annotations, enables cross-modal supervision for better protein mutation modeling."], "tldr": "Many protein mutations remain unexplored, despite their significance in biology and medicine. Existing protein language models (PLMs) struggle to provide understandable explanations for mutational effects or design new mutations with specific properties due to their implicit treatment of mutations and limited supervision.  They often focus on evolutionary plausibility rather than human-defined criteria. This necessitates explainable and engineerable tools for mutation studies.\nMutaPLM addresses these issues. This unified framework uses a novel protein delta network to explicitly model mutations and incorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) learning to extract knowledge from biomedical literature.  A new, large-scale dataset, MutaDescribe, provides cross-modal supervision for this model.  The results demonstrate MutaPLM's superior performance in providing human-understandable explanations for mutation effects and prioritizing mutations with desirable properties.  **The open-sourced code, model, and data significantly advance research in protein mutation analysis and engineering.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "yppcLFeZgy/podcast.wav"}
