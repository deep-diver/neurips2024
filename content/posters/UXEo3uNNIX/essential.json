State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show promise in improving this process by modeling sequential data effectively but they still have limitations. \nThe researchers introduce Coupled Mamba, a novel SSM-based approach. It enhances multi-modal fusion by efficiently coupling state chains of multiple modalities. The model uses an inter-modal hidden state transition scheme and a global convolution kernel for parallel computing, leading to faster inference and lower memory usage.  Experiments demonstrate that Coupled Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets, showcasing improved accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "UXEo3uNNIX/podcast.wav"}
