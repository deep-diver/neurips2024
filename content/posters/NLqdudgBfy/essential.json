While invariant SSL (I-SSL) methods have achieved success, they often sacrifice useful features. Equivariant SSL (E-SSL) addresses this by learning features sensitive to data augmentations, but lacks theoretical understanding.  This paper tackles this gap by focusing on the simplest rotation prediction method.\nThis research uses an information-theoretic perspective to analyze E-SSL's generalization ability.  It reveals a critical synergy effect where learning class-relevant features improves equivariant prediction, which in turn benefits downstream tasks.  The study establishes theoretical principles for effective E-SSL design, encompassing lossy transformations, class relevance, and shortcut pruning.  It further uncovers model equivariance as a key factor to improve performance.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "NLqdudgBfy/podcast.wav"}
