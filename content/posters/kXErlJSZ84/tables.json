These variations include using a general model versus an English-trained model, with and without random erasing during training, and different finetuning strategies (optimizing only class embedding versus end-to-end finetuning), again with and without random erasing.", "section": "4.2 Ablation and analysis"}, {"figure_path": "kXErlJSZ84/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 5: Symbol Error Rate (SER, in %) on ICDAR 2024 Competition on Handwriting Recognition of Historical Ciphers.", "description": "This table presents the Symbol Error Rates (SER) achieved by different methods in the ICDAR 2024 Competition on Handwriting Recognition of Historical Ciphers.
