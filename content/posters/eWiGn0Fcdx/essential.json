State space models (SSMs) offer an efficient alternative with linear computational complexity, but their efficiency can be further enhanced.  Existing token pruning techniques for ViTs fail to deliver good performance when directly applied to SSMs, motivating the search for SSM-specific pruning methods. This disruption of the token order causes performance degradation.\nThis paper addresses this issue by introducing a novel token pruning method specifically designed for SSMs. The key innovation is a pruning-aware hidden state alignment that stabilizes the neighborhood of remaining tokens, thereby mitigating the accuracy drop from naive application.  The authors also propose a new token importance evaluation method tailored to SSMs to effectively guide token selection and pruning.  Their method demonstrates significant computational speedups and minimal impact on performance across different benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Northeastern University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "eWiGn0Fcdx/podcast.wav"}
