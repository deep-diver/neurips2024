Current methods either lack expressiveness or are difficult to interpret.  This work focuses on the limitations of existing functional data analysis techniques, especially their inability to capture complex relationships and scale to large datasets. \nThis paper introduces a new approach called semi-structured functional networks (SSFNNs).  SSFNNs improve upon current models by combining a structured, interpretable part with a deep neural network. A novel orthogonalization technique is used to resolve issues with model identifiability. The experimental results demonstrate that SSFNNs provide **accurate signal recovery**, **enhanced predictive performance**, and better **scalability** compared to existing methods, making it highly relevant for researchers dealing with complex functional datasets.", "affiliation": "Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "WJAiaslhin/podcast.wav"}
