The weight surface shows the influence of the input function x(s) on the output function y(t). Three areas are highlighted to illustrate this influence: a) An isolated positive weight multiplied with a positive feature signal produces a spike in the response, b) A negative weight multiplied with positive features produces a bell-shaped negative outcome, and c) a large positive weight region multiplied with positive features produces a slight increase in the response.", "section": "Function-on-function regression"}, {"figure_path": "WJAiaslhin/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Different semi-structured architectures.", "description": "This figure shows two different architectures for semi-structured functional neural networks.
