### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Analyzing functional data, such as sensor readings over time, requires methods that balance interpretability and predictive power.  Current methods either lack expressiveness or are difficult to interpret.  This work focuses on the limitations of existing functional data analysis techniques, especially their inability to capture complex relationships and scale to large datasets. 

This paper introduces a new approach called semi-structured functional networks (SSFNNs).  SSFNNs improve upon current models by combining a structured, interpretable part with a deep neural network. A novel orthogonalization technique is used to resolve issues with model identifiability. The experimental results demonstrate that SSFNNs provide **accurate signal recovery**, **enhanced predictive performance**, and better **scalability** compared to existing methods, making it highly relevant for researchers dealing with complex functional datasets.

> This figure visualizes an example of a function-on-function regression by showing the weight surface, feature signal and the resulting response signal. The weight surface shows the influence of the input function x(s) on the output function y(t). Three areas are highlighted to illustrate this influence: a) An isolated positive weight multiplied with a positive feature signal produces a spike in the response, b) A negative weight multiplied with positive features produces a bell-shaped negative outcome, and c) a large positive weight region multiplied with positive features produces a slight increase in the response.

### In-depth insights


#### Functional SSN
The concept of "Functional SSN", or Functional Semi-Structured Networks, represents a significant advancement in machine learning, particularly within the realm of functional data analysis.  It cleverly combines the interpretability of additive models with the expressive power of deep neural networks. This fusion addresses a critical limitation of traditional functional data analysis methods, which often struggle with higher-order interactions and non-linearities, especially in high-dimensional datasets. **The key innovation lies in adapting the SSN framework to handle functional data**, effectively modeling complex relationships between functional inputs and outputs while maintaining a degree of interpretability. This is achieved by carefully integrating functional regression components into the SSN architecture, allowing for the extraction of interpretable feature effects alongside the ability to capture complex non-linear patterns. The use of tensor-product basis functions further enhances scalability and efficiency.  **The post-hoc orthogonalization technique is crucial for ensuring the identifiability of the additive model component**, a common challenge in SSN approaches, guaranteeing that the model's interpretability is not compromised by the deep learning part. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments, including both simulated and real-world biomechanics datasets, showcasing its superior performance and scalability compared to competing methods. **This methodology holds significant promise for various applications**, particularly those involving large-scale functional data where interpretability and scalability are both essential.

#### Interpretable FDA
Interpretable Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is a crucial area bridging the gap between the complex nature of functional data and the need for understandable insights.  **Current FDA methods often sacrifice interpretability for model complexity and predictive power.**  The challenge lies in balancing the richness of functional data representations, which capture intricate patterns in data evolving over time or space, with the ability to extract clear, human-interpretable rules and relationships.  **Developing interpretable FDA requires innovative approaches** that move beyond simple visualizations and descriptive statistics.  This could involve incorporating techniques from explainable AI (XAI), such as LIME or SHAP values, to highlight the influential aspects of functions in the predictive process. **Feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods tailored to functional data are also critical** to manage the complexity inherent in functional objects, and in ensuring that resulting models are not overly complex. Ultimately, successful interpretable FDA will require a multi-faceted approach combining innovative algorithms, effective visualization methods, and careful consideration of the domain context to ensure both model accuracy and meaningful insights.

#### Scalable Methods
Scalable methods are crucial for handling large datasets, a common challenge in functional data analysis.  The paper addresses this by proposing a functional semi-structured network (SSN) approach that improves upon existing functional regression techniques.  **Key to scalability is a careful implementation of the structured part of the SSN, avoiding the unfavorable scaling found in classical FFR and boosting methods.** This is achieved through two main improvements: array computations, which avoid the formation of an explicitly large matrix during forward passes, and basis recycling, reusing pre-computed bases to reduce memory costs.  These optimizations, coupled with an efficient implementation of the deep neural network component, allow the model to efficiently handle datasets with high numbers of features, observations, and time points.  **The result is a method that maintains accuracy while being scalable to larger-scale functional datasets**, a significant advance in functional data modeling.

#### Biomechanics App
The application of machine learning in biomechanics research, particularly concerning joint moments, offers **significant advantages**.  Analyzing joint moments provides insights into muscular activities, motor control strategies, and injury risks.  The use of machine learning allows researchers to predict these 'expensive' signals using more readily available sensor data from mobile devices, overcoming limitations of traditional laboratory data collection.  **Existing methods, however, struggle with generalization and lack a clear understanding of the learned relationship.**  This necessitates more sophisticated methods that can accurately capture all interactions and non-linearities while scaling well for large datasets.  The research highlights the potential for **improving both scalability and predictive accuracy** using innovative approaches that improve the interpretability of functional data analysis.

#### Future Research
The paper suggests several promising avenues for future research.  **Extending the model to handle non-linear functional relationships** is crucial for broader applicability.  The current model relies on additive structures, limiting its ability to capture complex interactions.  Investigating more expressive non-linear models while maintaining interpretability is key.  **Incorporating sparsity penalties** in high-dimensional settings would improve computational efficiency and potentially enhance generalization.  The high dimensionality of functional data often necessitates careful regularization, and sparse models could be more robust and interpretable.   Finally, exploring the **extension of post-hoc orthogonalization techniques** to more complex network architectures will help maintain identifiability and interpretability in even more complex functional data models. This is particularly important as larger, more detailed datasets become available.

(a) shows a shared encoder-decoder approach, where both the interpretable and deep parts share the encoding and decoding steps. (b) shows an architecture with a separate deep functional neural network that takes the functional input directly and combines the output with the interpretable part. Both architectures aim to combine the interpretability of structured models with the flexibility of deep neural networks.
