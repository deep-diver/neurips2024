Existing GNN explainers mostly focus on local explanations, failing to reveal the global reasoning process. This lack of interpretability limits the trust and adoption of GNNs in sensitive application domains like healthcare and finance. \nTo tackle this, the paper introduces GRAPHTRAIL, a novel global explainer that translates GNN predictions into human-interpretable logical rules (boolean formulas). It achieves this by efficiently mining discriminative subgraph-level concepts using Shapley values and then employing symbolic regression to map GNN predictions to these concepts.  Extensive experiments showcase that GRAPHTRAIL significantly outperforms existing global explainers in generating faithful and interpretable logical rules, making it a valuable tool for enhancing GNN understanding and deployment in diverse fields.", "affiliation": "IIT Delhi", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "fzlMza6dRZ/podcast.wav"}
