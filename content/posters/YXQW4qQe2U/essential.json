Existing 'top-2' methods, while efficient, struggle to determine the optimal probability of selecting the best arm and computationally expensive plug-in methods exist but are difficult to implement.  These methods also suffer from high sample complexity. \nThis research introduces a novel anchored top-two algorithm that addresses these limitations.  By anchoring allocations at a threshold and dynamically choosing between the best and next-best arms, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality, matching information-theoretic lower bounds. Its analysis employs fluid dynamics, showing that the algorithm's asymptotic behavior follows a set of ordinary differential equations which ensures the algorithm maintains its efficiency.", "affiliation": "TIFR Mumbai", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "YXQW4qQe2U/podcast.wav"}
