Efficiently upcycles pre-trained models into powerful Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational costs.", "takeaways": ["BAM efficiently utilizes pre-trained dense models for MoE initialization, improving performance and reducing training costs.", "BAM's novel soft-routing attention mechanism enhances MoE training stability and performance.", "Parallel attention transformer architecture in BAM improves computational efficiency."], "tldr": "Training large language models is computationally expensive.  Mixture of Experts (MoE) models offer a solution by activating only a subset of parameters for each input. However, training MoEs from scratch is prohibitively expensive.  Existing methods initialize MoEs using pre-trained dense models, but they often underutilize the available knowledge. This leads to suboptimal performance.\nThis paper introduces BAM, a simple yet effective method that fully leverages pre-trained dense models by initializing both the FFN and attention layers in MoEs. BAM utilizes soft-routing attention, which assigns each token to all attention experts, and a parallel attention transformer architecture for better efficiency. Experiments show that BAM outperforms previous methods on various benchmarks with equivalent computational and data resources.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "BDrWQTrfyI/podcast.wav"}
