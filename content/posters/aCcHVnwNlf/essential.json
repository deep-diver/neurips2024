However, many datasets possess inherent low-dimensional structures, which are often not exploited by DP algorithms.  This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on subspace estimation, a crucial task in various applications such as machine learning and data mining, where DP algorithms typically face a significant dependence on input dimensionality. The challenge is identifying when reduced points are sufficient and necessary, and measuring a given datasets \"easiness\".\nThis research introduces new measures quantifying dataset easiness for private subspace estimation by using multiplicative singular-value gaps. The study supports these measures with new upper and lower bounds, effectively demonstrating the first gap types sufficient and necessary for dimension-independent subspace estimation.  The authors further develop a practical algorithm reflecting their upper bounds, showcasing its effectiveness in high-dimensional scenarios, thus, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of DP subspace estimation.", "affiliation": "Georgetown University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "aCcHVnwNlf/podcast.wav"}
