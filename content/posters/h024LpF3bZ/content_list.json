However, evaluating such open-ended generation often relies on human or model-based assessments [46]. As tasks grow in complexity, such as longer output requirements, human evaluations become less feasible due to the extensive time and effort required to accurately judge long, complex scenarios created by LLMs. Moreover, model-based evaluations typically depend on more advanced models, thereby restricting their capacity to evaluate newer, state-of-the-art models. This reliance may also introduce biases, such as a preference for the first choice [46]. Consequently, there is a pressing need to rethink the evaluation framework of the benchmark for assessing emerging LLMs. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this paper, we seek to explore and elicit the lateral thinking ability of LLMs. However, accurately evaluating this capability poses significant challenges due to the complexity of measuring creative thinking [28, 18] and the difficulty of obtaining relevant data. The generation of novel ideas is inherently non-trivial, even for humans [12, 13]. Considering these challenges, we propose the exploration of lateral thinking in LLMs by situation puzzles as a primary research tool. A situation puzzle, often referred to as a lateral thinking puzzle, involves a scenario, usually presented as an unusual situation, and the goal is to figure out what is going on. Players ask yes-or-no questions to gather more information and solve the puzzle. These puzzles challenge players to think outside the conventional bounds of the scenario\u2019s information, using creativity and indirect reasoning to uncover the underlying explanation for the situation described. In this context, we introduce SPLAT, a benchmark that leverages Situation Puzzles for evaluating and eliciting LAteral Thinking of LLMs, which contains 975 high-quality situation puzzle pairs. As shown in Figure 1, for better assessment, we categorise these puzzles into three difficulty levels\u2014Easy, Medium, and Hard\u2014each annotated by human evaluators.

However, this paradigm (e.g., [46]) typically relies on using an evaluation model that is stronger than the models being tested. This creates a challenge in accurately evaluating models that may be superior to the evaluator itself. Therefore, there is a need for alternative methods that can effectively assess the advanced models without this limitation. To this end, inspired by the situation puzzle game, we propose a multi-turn player-judge framework. This framework emulates an interactive game where the model (player) queries the evaluation model (judge) about a given incomplete story, striving to collect information to unravel the intricate scenario it implies. Conversely, the evaluation model (judge) is tasked solely with responding to questions based on the detailed reference scenario or evaluating whether the scenario deduced by the player aligns semantically with the reference one1.

In Table 2, the high level of agreement between the LLM-based judges and humans (e.g., WizardLM-2 achieves $100\\%$ , $87.50\\%$ , $88.24\\%$ agreements with humans in three difficulties, respectively) indicates that LLMs can well align with human standards of reasoning and judgement within this specific context of lateral thinking puzzles.

However, generating multiple reference scenarios/answers for situation puzzles is challenging. As an alternative, we repeatedly run each situation puzzle multiple times (denoted as $R$ ), and then choose one (maybe $r$ -th) that is closest to the reference scenario from these iterations as the final result.
