Existing methods often provide oversimplified explanations or struggle with high-dimensional data.  This limits their usefulness in high-stakes applications where decisions must be transparent and reliable.\nThis paper introduces a new method, using a Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree) to break down data distributions and a Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm to refine boundaries, generating an interpretable rule set. Experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate superior explanation accuracy, fidelity, and robustness, improving the interpretability of black-box anomaly detection and enhancing trust in automated systems.  The method is especially relevant for high-stakes sectors like cybersecurity and IoT.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "h6o6qXLmHZ/podcast.wav"}
