It starts with data preprocessing and normalization, followed by anomaly detection using various learning models (AE, IForest, SVM, Neural Networks). The SCD-Tree then segments the data based on the anomaly scores, and GBD refines the boundaries within each segment. Finally, rules are extracted to explain the model's decisions. The figure visually depicts each step of the process, including data representation, model outputs, tree structures, and boundary delineation, providing a comprehensive overview of the method's workflow.", "section": "3.3 Anomaly detection pipline"}, {"figure_path": "h6o6qXLmHZ/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Integrated Anomaly Detection and Interpretation Pipeline Using SCD-Tree and GBD", "description": "This figure illustrates the integrated pipeline for anomaly detection and interpretation using the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree) and Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD).  The pipeline starts with data preprocessing, followed by anomaly detection using a black-box model. The SCD-Tree segments the data based on the anomaly scores produced by the black-box model. Then GBD refines the boundaries between the segments. Finally, rules are extracted from these boundaries and interpreted to explain the model's decisions.  The figure visually shows the flow of data through each stage of the pipeline, illustrating the integration of the SCD-Tree and GBD in enhancing interpretability.", "section": "3.3 Anomaly detection pipeline"}]
