This is due to BN's design for discrete networks, leading to variable step sizes and issues with time grids in Neural ODEs' forward pass, hindering accurate statistics calculation for normalization. This also impacts performance, particularly with small batch sizes and outliers.\n\nTo overcome this, the researchers introduce Temporal Adaptive Batch Normalization (TA-BN), a novel technique that adapts to the continuous-time nature of Neural ODEs. TA-BN utilizes adaptive time grids and interpolation to estimate population statistics. Experiments on image classification and physical system modeling show that TA-BN significantly improves Neural ODE performance, enabling deeper models and surpassing existing approaches, particularly concerning parameter efficiency.  It enables the stacking of more layers and achieves 91.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ARLEUVVfTL/podcast.wav"}
