[{"heading_title": "Pref. Data Challenges", "details": {"summary": "The challenges posed by preferential data in machine learning, particularly within the context of density estimation using normalizing flows, are multifaceted and significant.  **Data sparsity** is a major hurdle; preferences, unlike direct samples from a distribution, are inherently limited in their information content.  Each preference comparison or ranking only reveals relative probabilities, not absolute values, leading to inherent ambiguity.  This ambiguity makes it difficult to accurately estimate the underlying probability density, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.  Furthermore, **model collapse** or **divergence** become significant problems; flexible models like normalizing flows can easily overfit to the limited data, leading to unrealistic densities concentrating probability mass in unintended regions or failing to capture the full range of probabilities.  The problem is compounded by the fact that the candidates being compared aren't random samples from the target distribution, but rather come from an unknown, potentially non-representative, source.  Therefore, a direct application of standard density estimation or variational inference techniques is not feasible. Overcoming these challenges requires innovative approaches, such as incorporating robust priors to guide model learning and prevent overfitting, and careful design of elicitation queries to maximize information gain from each preference judgment."}}, {"heading_title": "Flow Prior Design", "details": {"summary": "Designing effective priors for normalizing flows is crucial for successful density estimation, particularly when dealing with limited data, as in expert knowledge elicitation.  A poorly chosen prior can lead to model collapse or divergence, hindering accurate belief density representation.  This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel **functional prior** for the flow. This prior is **decision-theoretic**, rooted in a random utility model that reflects how humans make choices based on their beliefs. The prior's design directly incorporates the structure of preferential data by focusing on the most preferred points (winners) from multiple comparisons.  This approach is **empirical**, using the k-wise winner distribution as a basis, and elegantly addresses the problems of collapsing or diverging mass by focusing probability mass towards higher probability regions. The prior's incorporation into a function-space maximum a posteriori (FS-MAP) estimation framework provides a principled and robust learning approach. This innovative approach significantly improves the learning process, enabling accurate density inference even from a limited number of preferential judgments."}}, {"heading_title": "FS-MAP Inference", "details": {"summary": "Function-space maximum a posteriori (FS-MAP) inference offers a novel approach to learning the parameters of a normalizing flow by directly optimizing the posterior distribution over the function space, rather than the parameter space. This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with limited data, such as in expert knowledge elicitation where only preferential comparisons or rankings are available. **By directly modeling the posterior over the function space, FS-MAP effectively incorporates prior knowledge about the desired properties of the belief density**, such as smoothness or concentration around preferred regions. This is crucial as it helps mitigate the challenges of collapsing or diverging probability mass commonly encountered when training flexible models like normalizing flows with limited data.  **The functional prior used in FS-MAP plays a vital role in shaping the posterior distribution**, guiding the learning process towards more realistic and informative belief densities, thereby enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations show the effectiveness of FS-MAP in accurately inferring belief densities from preferential data, even with small sample sizes."}}, {"heading_title": "LLM as Expert", "details": {"summary": "Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) as an expert source presents a compelling avenue for eliciting high-dimensional probability distributions.  This approach sidesteps the limitations of relying solely on human experts, who may struggle with complex multivariate assessments or be limited by time constraints. The LLM, in this context, serves as a readily available, tireless source of probabilistic information.  **However, crucial considerations arise concerning the biases and limitations inherent in LLMs.**  The LLM's belief density is not a ground truth; rather, it reflects the patterns and information encoded within its training data, potentially including biases present in that data.  **Therefore, the elicited distribution is a reflection of the LLM's knowledge, not an objective measure of reality.** This approach's success hinges on the quality and breadth of the LLM's training data, making careful selection of the model and rigorous validation of its outputs crucial. The process also necessitates a critical evaluation of how well the LLM\u2019s internal representation of uncertainty maps onto true probabilistic uncertainty."}}, {"heading_title": "Future Extensions", "details": {"summary": "Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the methodology to handle more complex preference elicitation tasks** such as partial rankings or pairwise comparisons with confidence levels would enhance the model's practical applicability.  Investigating different noise models beyond the exponential distribution, and exploring non-parametric approaches to model the expert's utility function are crucial.  **Developing more efficient inference techniques** that scale better to high-dimensional data and larger datasets is a key challenge. The current function-space MAP approach, while effective, may benefit from more sophisticated techniques.  **Incorporating active learning strategies** would greatly improve efficiency by strategically selecting the most informative queries.  Finally, evaluating the method's performance on diverse real-world applications and comparing it against existing knowledge elicitation methods is essential to demonstrate its practical utility and robustness."}}]
