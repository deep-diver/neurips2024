Therefore, an analysis of their ability to operate safely and reliably, especially in contexts where cooperation is necessary. Multi-agent interaction is a fundamental feature across many scales of human life. When cooperation between agents (and humans) is possible, better outcomes for all through joint effort are possible [27, 39, 40, 62]. If AI agents take on complex decision-making roles in multi-agent contexts, they are likely to face cooperation challenges that are similar to those faced by people.

To evaluate the robustness of the norms formed by LLMs in GOVSIM, we introduce a greedy newcomer who is unfamiliar with an already formed norm (i.e., the agent does not observe the prior history of interactions). This perturbation increases inequality across agents and, in some cases, leads to the collapse of cooperation.

See Figure 2 for prompt sketches regarding this scenario. In the second scenario, pasture, and following Hardin [27] and Greene [26], agents are shepherds and control flocks of sheep. Each month, they decide how many sheep they\u2019ll allow on a shared pasture. Like the fish, the pasture can support up to 100 hectares of grass; each sheep consumes 1 hectare per month, and the remaining grass doubles up to its capacity.

Additional studies have explored the capabilities and potential issues of current LLMs [17, 31, 52]. These methods do not address the complexities inherent in multi-agent interactions and broader real-world scenarios, and more effort is needed to guarantee the safety of multi-agent systems [13\u201315].

In contrast, more recent efforts evaluate LLMs on complex tasks that resemble real-world applications [18, 38, 75] or involve A/B testing with human feedback [10]. For these complex tasks, recent work has started deploying generative agents [59, 60] for task-specific simulations, such as collaborative agent systems for software engineering [32, 46, 53, 72] and other domains [33, 36, 49, 69].

Analysis of LLM behaviors suggests that the lack of sustainable governance may result from an inability to mentally simulate the long-term effects of greedy actions on the equilibrium of the multi-agent system. To address this challenge, we find that prompting agents to consider the universalization of their action significantly improves survival time by 4 months.

If collective demand is less than the availability of the resource in the common pool, a direct allocation occurs. In contrast, in scenarios where demand exceeds supply, we simulate a distribution process by randomly allocating each unit to each agent until there are no more resources left or the demand of the agent is satisfied.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
