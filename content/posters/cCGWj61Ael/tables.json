The comparison is based on two metrics: maximum prediction error and ranking loss.  The plug-in designs vary in the number of rounds used for initial exploration before plugging in an estimate of the model parameter. The table shows that Dope achieves a good balance between prediction error and ranking loss, outperforming the plug-in baselines with smaller numbers of exploration rounds, while being reasonably close to the optimal performance.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "cCGWj61Ael/tables/tables_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Computation time of policy \u03c0* in (6) as a function of the number of lists L.", "description": "This table shows how the computation time for the optimal design policy (\u03c0*) scales with the number of lists (L).  The computation time is measured in seconds and increases roughly linearly with L.

The ranking loss is the evaluation metric used to assess the performance of the algorithm in ranking items.
