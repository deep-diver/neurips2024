A hardware-friendly approach to address this is N:M sparsity, where a subset of weights are non-zero in each group of weights. However, previous attempts using Straight-Through Estimators (STE) for 2:4 sparse pre-training suffer from optimization issues due to the discontinuous nature of the pruning functions. These issues lead to incorrect gradient descent, inability to predict descent amounts and sparse mask oscillations. \nThis paper introduces a new method, S-STE, to overcome the shortcomings of existing STE-based approaches. S-STE employs a continuous pruning function and fixed scaling factor to ensure smooth optimization. The authors use Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimation for the activation gradient and leverage FP8 quantization for additional speedups.  **Experimental results show that S-STE outperforms existing 2:4 pre-training methods across various tasks, demonstrating improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and achieving results comparable to those of full-parameter models.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "8abNCVJs2j/podcast.wav"}
