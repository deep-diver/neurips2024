### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current incremental learning methods struggle with fine-grained compositionality, neglecting various states (e.g., color, material) attached to objects. This leads to limitations in recognizing state-object compositions and handling ambiguous boundaries.  This paper introduces a new task called Compositional Incremental Learning (composition-IL) and proposes CompILer, a prompt-based model that addresses these challenges.

CompILer uses multi-pool prompt learning to learn states, objects, and compositions separately. It incorporates object-injected state prompting, guiding state selection.  The selected prompts are fused using generalized-mean fusion to eliminate irrelevant information.  Experiments show CompILer achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its ability to learn new compositions incrementally without forgetting previous knowledge.  The paper also contributes by reorganizing two existing datasets and making them suitable for composition-IL.

> This figure illustrates the differences between three incremental learning paradigms: Class Incremental Learning (class-IL), Blurry Incremental Learning (blur-IL), and Compositional Incremental Learning (composition-IL).  Class-IL strictly prohibits the recurrence of previously seen object classes in new tasks. Blur-IL relaxes this constraint, allowing for the random reappearance of previously seen classes. Composition-IL focuses on learning state-object compositions (e.g., 'brown pants', 'yellow dress'). While object and state primitives can reappear across tasks, the specific state-object combinations are unique to each task, preventing redundancy. This visual comparison helps to understand the novel compositional incremental learning problem introduced in the paper.

> This table presents a comparison of the performance of various incremental learning methods on two datasets: Split-Clothing (with 5 incremental tasks) and Split-UT-Zappos (with both 5 and 10 incremental tasks).  The metrics used are Average Accuracy (Avg Acc), which measures the overall classification accuracy, and Forgetting Rate (FTT), which assesses the degree of catastrophic forgetting.  The table shows that CompILer outperforms other methods in most cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in compositional incremental learning.





### In-depth insights


#### Compositional IL
Compositional Incremental Learning (Compositional IL) presents a novel approach to incremental learning by focusing on the **compositionality of state-object pairs**.  Unlike traditional class incremental learning which primarily focuses on object classes, Compositional IL addresses the limitations of neglecting the nuanced states associated with objects.  This is particularly crucial for complex real-world scenarios where understanding the interactions between object attributes (like color or material) and the object itself is essential. The core idea is that the model learns to recognize state-object compositions as holistic entities.  **This requires overcoming the challenge of ambiguous composition boundaries**, a problem that Compositional IL directly tackles through innovative techniques like prompt-based learning. This approach not only improves the fine-grained understanding of compositions but also enhances the model's ability to reason about unseen compositions incrementally, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.  A key strength of Compositional IL lies in its **suitability for real-world applications** where objects possess numerous attributes and continually new combinations of object and state emerge.

#### Prompt-based Learner
A prompt-based learner leverages the power of prompts to guide the learning process, offering a flexible and efficient approach to various machine learning tasks.  **Prompts act as instructions or constraints**, shaping the model's behavior and directing its attention towards specific aspects of the data. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios with limited data, where explicitly providing instructions or examples through prompts can significantly improve performance.  **The effectiveness of a prompt-based learner heavily depends on prompt design and selection**.  Well-crafted prompts can lead to remarkable results, while poorly designed ones can hinder performance. Additionally,  **prompt engineering is a crucial component of a prompt-based system**, requiring careful consideration of the task, data, and model architecture.  A successful prompt-based learner often combines prompt engineering with advanced techniques such as prompt tuning, multi-task learning, or transfer learning to further enhance its capabilities and address various challenges.

#### Ambiguous Boundaries
The concept of "ambiguous boundaries" in compositional incremental learning highlights a critical challenge: **models struggle to distinguish between compositions that share the same object but differ in state**.  This ambiguity arises because existing methods prioritize object recognition over state recognition, leading to indistinguishable compositions. For example, a model might confuse "red shirt" and "blue shirt", failing to capture the state (color) information effectively.  **This problem is further exacerbated in incremental learning settings**, where the model continually learns new compositions.  Addressing this requires novel approaches that give equal importance to states and objects.  **Prompt-based methods offer a potential solution by learning state and object representations independently**, providing better boundary separation between similar compositions.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques, **such as incorporating hierarchical or relational prompts** to better capture the complex relationships between objects and their states.  Investigating **alternative prompt fusion methods** beyond generalized-mean pooling, perhaps incorporating attention mechanisms or other neural network architectures, could further improve performance.  Another promising area is developing **more robust and diverse datasets** for compositional incremental learning, addressing the challenges of long-tailed distributions and ambiguous composition boundaries. Finally, exploring the application of compositional incremental learning to **different domains and tasks beyond object recognition**, such as natural language processing or time-series analysis, would open exciting new avenues for research and development.

#### Limitations of CompILer
While CompILer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in compositional incremental learning, several limitations warrant consideration.  **The reliance on a pre-trained backbone limits adaptability** to different domains and may hinder generalization to unseen object or state types.  **The multi-pool prompt learning strategy, while effective, introduces a larger number of parameters**, increasing computational cost and potentially making it less memory efficient.  Furthermore, **the success of object-injected state prompting depends on the quality of object feature extraction**, suggesting potential limitations when dealing with ambiguous or poorly defined object classes.  **The dataset construction methodology, involving re-organization of existing datasets**, introduces potential bias and may not fully represent the complexities of real-world scenarios.  Finally, the current experimental scope could be broadened.  More comprehensive testing across a wider variety of datasets and tasks would offer stronger validation of the approach's generality and robustness.

> This figure shows the data distribution for the three experimental settings used in the paper: Split-Clothing (5 tasks), Split-UT-Zappos (5 tasks), and Split-UT-Zappos (10 tasks). Each setting is represented by a semicircular chart, divided into sections corresponding to the different tasks. The size of each section is proportional to the number of images in that task.  The figure demonstrates that the number of images per task is relatively balanced across all three experimental settings. This ensures a fair comparison between different tasks and experimental setups.

> This figure uses t-SNE to visualize the feature distributions of seven compositions from the Split-Clothing dataset learned by both the L2P and CompILer models.  The visualization shows that CompILer is better able to distinguish between compositions that share the same object but differ in state (e.g., different colors of dresses).  This highlights CompILer's improved ability to model fine-grained compositionality compared to L2P.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/2LRZhbTDtA/figures_4_1.jpg)

> This figure illustrates the architecture of the CompILer model, which is designed for Compositional Incremental Learning.  The model consists of three main components: 1) Multi-pool prompt learning that uses separate prompt pools for states, objects, and compositions; 2) Object-injected state prompting, which uses object prompts to guide the selection of state prompts; and 3) Generalized-mean prompt fusion, which combines the selected prompts to reduce irrelevant information. The figure shows how the different components interact, starting with feature extraction from an image and ending with classification based on the fused prompts. 


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/2LRZhbTDtA/figures_5_1.jpg)

> This figure illustrates the object-injected state prompting mechanism.  A query feature vector, q(x), representing the input image, acts as the query (Q) in a cross-attention layer.  The fused object prompt (Po), a composite of learned prompts representing object features, simultaneously serves as both the key (K) and value (V) vectors in this cross-attention operation.  The output of the cross-attention is a refined query feature, qs(x), which is object-informed and used for selecting state prompts. This injection of object information helps to guide the selection of relevant state prompts, improving the state representation learning process.

Different colors represent different types of prompts: yellow for composition, green for state, and blue for object. The separation demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-pool prompt learning in distinguishing between these concepts.
