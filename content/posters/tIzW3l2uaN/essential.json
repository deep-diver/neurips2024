Recent advancements leverage pre-trained models for few-shot AD, but accuracy remains limited by direct feature comparison between query and normal images. This direct comparison neglects subtle differences and hinders adaptation to complex domains.\nThis paper introduces 'anomaly personalization,' using a customized generation model to transform query images into anomaly-free counterparts, closely aligning them with the normal data manifold.  A novel triplet contrastive inference strategy enhances robustness through comprehensive comparison between query, personalized, and anomaly-free data. Experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the superior performance and flexible transferability of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art AD techniques. **The generated anomaly-free data significantly improves other AD methods' accuracy.**", "affiliation": "West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Anomaly Detection"}, "podcast_path": "tIzW3l2uaN/podcast.wav"}
