This heightened interest is primarily attributed to its only reliance on normal samples and its adoption of an unsupervised learning paradigm, where it typically learns from the distribution of normal samples to identify anomalies by detecting outliers [46, 39]. Traditional AD methods, including auto-encoder based [43, 40], GAN-based, and knowledge-based approaches [3, 8, 35], and others. Moreover, some diffusionbased methods [24, 11] have also emerged recently.

For example, WinCLIP [16] first uses pre-trained CLIP, employing carefully designed text prompts and image feature comparisons to perform few-shot anomaly detection. AnomalyGPT [10] eliminates the need for manually setting thresholds and supports multi-round dialogues. InCTRL [45] achieves general anomaly detection through incontext residual learning. Despite these innovations, the latest SOTA methods often rely on direct feature matching between few-shot normal images (i.e., reference images) and the query sample. However, without deeply exploring their subtle features, it is often difficult to achieve precise feature comparisons, which can easily lead to unstable results, since the non-anomalous differences between query and references can severely impact the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the limited number of normal images serving as independent references also makes their prediction insufficient.

Figure 3 compares the normal images (i.e., reference images), query images, and our resulting personalized images. As depicted, there are some differences between the normal image and the query image in terms of non-anomalous features, such as position, shape, and texture. Our personalized image retains most of the normal regions from the query image, with the anomalous regions largely converted to normal regions. This visualization further substantiates the precision of our method compared to existing few-shot AD approaches.

Notably, for the RegAD method, the AUC is improved by $6.8(\\%)$ , $8.7(\\%)$ , and $10.2(\\%)$ , respectively. Additionally, we compare our generated strategy with five other AD datasets. After incorporating our anomaly-free samples, the four AD methods show varying degrees of improvement on industrial and medical datasets (Visa, KSDD, AFID, OCT2017, and headCT). In particular, the Patchcore and RegAD methods exhibit significant improvements on the OCT2017 dataset, with increases of $10.9(\\%)$ and $8.6(\\%)$ , respectively.

Here, we discuss the impact of each branch in our triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, analyzing datasets across three different domains. Table 4 validates the effectiveness of our strategy, showing that it is optimal in most datasets. When only text prompts are used $(S_{t e x t})$ , meaning there is no reference image input, particularly low results are observed in the medical datasets OCT2017 and RESC. However, when reference images are supplied (either $S_{P}$ or $S_{N}$ ), a significant improvement is observed. This might be because the model lacks an inherent understanding of specific medical domains, thus requiring normal images as references. When each strategy is used individually, we find that most results are not as good as when the strategies are combined, indicating that these strategies complement each other. When all three strategies are employed together, most datasets demonstrate optimal performance. However, in certain cases, such as the KSDD dataset\u2014which focuses on surface defect inspection\u2014utilizing all scores does not consistently yield the best results. This inconsistency may stem from the high diversity in the distribution of normal images, which presents challenges for the AD model\u2019s learning process. Nevertheless, across the majority of datasets, the combined use of three strategies leads to relatively strong performance, showcasing that our triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy effectively enhances accuracy.

Our triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy further stabilizes results by incorporating personalized images, anomaly-free samples and text prompts, facilitating a more comprehensive comparison. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets in industrial, medical, and semantic domains demonstrate the method\u2019s generalizability and effectiveness.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
