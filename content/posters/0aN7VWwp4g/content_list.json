Specifically, we report the MAE and SSIM to show the pixel-wise and structural accuracy; LPIPS and FVD to show the deep perceptual similarity to ground truth; FSS and RHD to measure the similarity of the intensity distribution in different regions. For radar echo datasets, we further include the CSI and pooled CSI to reveal the models\u2019 capability of identifying potential extreme weather. Such a combination of metrics is believed to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the pros and cons of the current state-of-the-art in precipitation nowcasting.

However, the nature of the MovingMNIST is highly deterministic, which does not resemble the chaotic nature of the atmospheric system. Previous adaptations attempted to simulate the physical dynamics by introducing a set of complex motions such as rotation and scaling [10] or by applying an external force on collision [46]. We argue that the fundamental reason causing the blur in precipitation nowcasting is the intrinsic stochasticity of the motion caused by external factors unseen in the weather dataset, such as orographic effects, vertical wind shear, interaction with other weather systems, etc. Trained with such stochasticity, regular models with pixel-wise loss could consistently fail to provide quality prediction in the future lead time. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "To verify our claim, we introduce a simplistic modification to the Moving-MNIST dataset. The standard Moving-MNIST dataset contains handwritten digits sampled from the MNIST dataset moving and bouncing with a constant velocity $(u_{0},v_{0})$ on the $64\\times64$ image plane. To introduce stochasticity, we perturb the velocity with a random Gaussian noise $\\epsilon$ at each time step. Details of the perturbation are shown in Appendix A. In the upcoming sections, we dub this dataset Stochastic Moving-MNIST and apply the experimental setting to this synthetic dataset. The performance of combinations of different losses and models can be found in Table 1 and qualitative visualizations of the corresponding methods are shown in Figure 2 and Appendix N. Note that the Stochastic Moving-MNIST is used in both training and evaluation to ensure that the models are well exposed to motion randomness. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "In Table 1, our modification drastically improves the sharpness and realisticity for all tested models, as reflected by the vast reduction in LPIPS and RHD. In particular, FACL reduces up to $57\\%$ of LPIPS and $71\\%$ of RHD for the ConvLSTM model. The pixel-wise and structural metrics between the two losses are comparable. On the other hand, generative models result in much poorer MAE and SSIM, with skill scores like FSS still being worse than most of the baseline models. In Figure 2, we can observe that the model trained with MSE cannot reconstruct a clear spatial pattern, especially in the subsequent frames, while the model trained with FACL yields much sharper and higher quality outputs. Consequently, we can conclude that in this setting with the synthetic Stochastic MovingMNIST, FACL demonstrates a significant improvement in perceptual metrics and skill scores, with the quality on par with that of generative models.

For some models, we observe a tiny decay in pixel-wise and structural metrics. For example, the Earthformer model trained with FACL on SEVIR has a $6.4\\%$ increase in MAE, which is believed to be a natural trade-off since pixel-wise metrics have no tolerance for spatial transformation. Despite poorer pixel-wise performance, the perceptual metrics and skill scores always improve, as further illustrated by Figure 3 that only FACL predicts fine-grained extreme values. Regarding those generative models, although they could perform the best in deep perceptual scores like LPIPS and FVD, we still observe that they usually result in poorer skill scores.

First of all, pixel-wise and structural metrics appear to be insensitive to blur, which exhibits a huge difference compared with the other transformations in Figure 10. Such a characteristic discourages small translation which is undesired for precipitation nowcasting. Perceptual metrics such as LPIPS behave the opposite, where blur is the most penalized and value scaling (brightening and darkening) is the most rewarded transformation. Despite this, we believe LPIPS penalizes too little on brightening and darkening as they could result in wrong alerts for extreme weather. For the skill scores, we again observe that CSI with larger pooling tolerates more translation and rotation. In other words, CSI with a large pooling size can be a good metric to penalize blur. However, since CSI discourages false positives, low-range prediction usually wins in CSI which is undesirable for extreme weather forecast. On the other hand, FSS results in unstable behavior for brightening and darkening, due to a single threshold which causes a huge error within a binary cutoff. Among the metrics, we find that RHD is more robust to spatial and pixel-wise transformation while penalizing blur. With the multi-class behavior of RHD, it is also much more stable without bias over overestimation or underestimation.
