While existing attack methods have partially addressed the Digital-to-Physical transition, none have systematically investigated the Physical-to-Digital transition. Our proposed CAP attack introduces a Camera Proxy Network to model this crucial transition and comprehensively evaluates attack performance across diverse unseen imaging devices.", "description": "This table compares several existing patch-based physical adversarial attacks against person detection methods.  It highlights whether each method considers the digital-to-physical and physical-to-digital transitions, the types of physical transformations used, and whether a black-box camera evaluation was performed.  The table emphasizes the novelty of the CAP attack in explicitly addressing the often-overlooked physical-to-digital transition and evaluating performance across diverse cameras.", "section": "2 Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "2Inwtjvyx8/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Defenses against CAP attacks.

The Average Precision (AP) metric in the digital space and the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in the physical space are reported for a non-attack baseline and three variations of the CAP attack: CAP*, CAP\u2020, and the full CAP method. CAP* excludes the camera ISP module, CAP\u2020 excludes adversarial optimization, and CAP represents the full method. The three defense strategies are JPEG compression, Self-Attentional Classifier (SAC), and adversarial training.", "section": "5 Discussions"}, {"figure_path": "2Inwtjvyx8/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Defenses against CAP attacks.

The Average Precision (AP) metric, reflecting the accuracy of person detection, is measured in a digital setting.  The Attack Success Rate (ASR), indicating the effectiveness of the attack, is assessed in a physical context. The three defense strategies compared are JPEG compression, Self-Attentional Convolutional network (SAC), and adversarial training. The table shows how each defense strategy affects the CAP attack's performance (both variants and the full method), providing a quantitative comparison of their effectiveness in mitigating the attack.", "section": "5 Discussions"}]
