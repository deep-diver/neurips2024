In particular, s is the length scale in all covariance models.", "description": "This table presents the formulas for computing the optimal step size (\u03b7*) for the Random Function Descent (RFD) algorithm.  It shows the general formula and simplified formulas for three different covariance models: Mat\u00e9rn (with \u03bd = 3/2 and \u03bd = 5/2), Squared-exponential, and Rational quadratic.  The formulas depend on the gradient norm (||\u2207J(w)||), the difference between the average cost (\u03bc) and current cost (J(w)), the length scale (s), and the rational quadratic parameter (\u03b2).  The \u2018A-RFD\u2019 column gives the asymptotic step size (as the cost approaches the average, \u03bc).", "section": "The RFD step size schedule"}]
