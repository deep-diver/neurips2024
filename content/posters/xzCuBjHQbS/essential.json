Existing Bayesian optimization methods, while theoretically sound, are computationally expensive and impractical for high-dimensional problems.  This creates a need for new theoretical frameworks that better bridge the gap between theory and practice.\nThe paper introduces Random Function Descent (RFD), a novel optimization algorithm based on a 'random function' framework. RFD rediscovers gradient descent, offering scale invariance and an explicit step size schedule.  This framework offers theoretical explanations for established heuristics like gradient clipping and learning rate warmup, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches.  Empirical results on the MNIST dataset demonstrate RFD's effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "University of Mannheim", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "xzCuBjHQbS/podcast.wav"}
