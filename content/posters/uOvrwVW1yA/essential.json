This paper tackles this challenge by proposing a novel data-driven approach using **neural networks to learn a mapping from problem instances to the best-performing algorithm.** This is particularly relevant to branch-and-cut methods in mixed-integer optimization, where efficient algorithm selection is crucial for reducing computational time. \nThe authors formalize this idea and develop rigorous sample complexity bounds for the proposed approach, ensuring the learned algorithm generalizes well to unseen data.  They then apply this method to branch-and-cut, demonstrating its efficacy through extensive computational experiments. **Results show significant reductions in branch-and-cut tree sizes compared to traditional methods**, highlighting the potential impact of this neural network approach in improving the efficiency of solving complex optimization problems.
