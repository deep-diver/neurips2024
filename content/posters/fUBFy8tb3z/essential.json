Existing methods often struggle with generalization across different scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance. They typically model feature spaces of future trajectories based on high-dimensional historical trajectories, often ignoring the intrinsic similarity between past and future movements.\nTrajCLIP tackles these limitations by employing contrastive learning and idempotent networks. By pairing historical and future trajectories and applying contrastive learning, the method enforces consistency in the encoded feature space. Idempotent loss and tightness loss manage complex feature distributions, preventing over-expansion in the latent space.  The use of trajectory interpolation and synthetic data further enhances model capacity and generalization. Evaluation across multiple datasets reveals that TrajCLIP surpasses existing methods in accuracy and demonstrates strong adaptability to new scenarios.", "affiliation": "Institute of Computing Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "fUBFy8tb3z/podcast.wav"}
