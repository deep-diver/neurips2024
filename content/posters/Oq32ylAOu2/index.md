### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a performance gap between English and other languages, particularly those with limited resources.  Existing methods either retrain LLMs for each language or rely on translation, often underutilizing LLMs' inherent reasoning and language understanding capabilities. This leads to suboptimal performance and high computational costs.

MindMerger, a novel method, directly addresses these issues. It merges LLMs with external multilingual language understanding models using a two-stage training scheme to integrate external capabilities without modifying the core LLM parameters. Experiments show that MindMerger significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse multilingual datasets, achieving notable improvements in both high- and low-resource languages.  **This approach demonstrates a new paradigm for leveraging existing multilingual resources to enhance LLM performance.**

> This figure shows two examples of math word problems, one in English and one in Chinese, and how a large language model (LLM) attempted to solve them.  The examples highlight the challenges of multilingual reasoning for LLMs. In both cases, the LLM correctly understands and solves the English version, but its performance varies greatly with the Chinese version. In the first problem, the LLM correctly calculates the answer.  However, in the second problem, the LLM fails to fully grasp the logic of the Chinese version, resulting in an incorrect answer. This illustrates the significant discrepancy in the LLM's ability to handle reasoning tasks in different languages.

> This table presents the experimental results of various multilingual reasoning models on two benchmark datasets: MGSM and MSVAMP.  The results are broken down by language, distinguishing between low-resource and high-resource languages. The table compares the performance of MonoReason (a baseline), several relearning-based models (MultiReason-Lora, MultiReason-Full, QAlign), two replacement-based models (Translate-En, LangBridge), and the proposed MindMerger method (both hard and soft versions).  The average accuracy across low-resource languages (Lrl.), high-resource languages (Hrl.), and all languages (Avg.) are reported to provide a comprehensive comparison.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM Reasoning Boost
LLM reasoning capabilities, particularly in non-English languages, **remain a significant challenge**.  Boosting these capabilities is crucial for broader LLM adoption and utility.  Approaches focusing on fine-tuning or translation often underutilize the inherent reasoning abilities already present within LLMs.  A more effective strategy might involve merging LLMs with external knowledge sources, such as multilingual models, to leverage existing language understanding skills and enhance reasoning without complete retraining. **A two-stage training process**, embedding external capabilities and then fostering collaborative use with internal LLM capabilities, offers a promising direction.  This approach can significantly improve multilingual reasoning, especially for low-resource languages. The efficiency of this method, particularly in reducing parameter updates and maintaining the integrity of pre-trained models, highlights its **practical advantages** over complete fine-tuning.

#### MindMerger's Approach
MindMerger's approach ingeniously tackles the challenge of boosting Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in non-English languages.  **Instead of retraining LLMs from scratch or solely relying on translation**, it leverages the inherent reasoning and language understanding capabilities already present within LLMs.  This is achieved by merging LLMs with external multilingual models, specifically using a two-stage training process. The first stage, **mapping**, embeds the external language understanding capabilities into the LLM's space. The second stage, **augmentation**, trains collaborative utilization of these capabilities alongside the LLM's built-in abilities. This two-pronged strategy efficiently enhances multilingual reasoning without significant parameter updates, yielding notable performance gains, particularly in low-resource languages.  The use of undecoded query representation from the external model further mitigates translation quality issues.  **MindMerger's innovative merging strategy and two-stage training** provide a powerful and efficient method for improving LLM reasoning across languages.

#### Multilingual Merging
Multilingual merging in large language models (LLMs) aims to **enhance the multilingual reasoning capabilities** of these models by integrating external multilingual resources.  This approach addresses the performance gap between English and other languages in LLMs, which often underutilize built-in reasoning skills. **Instead of retraining or replacing non-English inputs**, multilingual merging leverages existing language understanding features from multilingual models.  This is achieved by merging the LLM with external capabilities, **preserving the LLM's inherent strengths**. The effectiveness of this merging hinges on careful training strategies that integrate external resources without disrupting the LLM's internal knowledge.  A key challenge lies in **harmonizing representation spaces** between the external model and the LLM to ensure seamless collaboration. Successful multilingual merging offers a **parameter-efficient method** to boost multilingual performance, especially in low-resource languages, by focusing on enhancing existing capabilities rather than extensive retraining.

#### Ablation Study Insights
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In this context, an ablation study would likely assess the impact of each module in the proposed MindMerger architecture.  **Removing the mapping layer** might reveal whether the model can effectively integrate external multilingual capabilities without this intermediate transformation. **Removing the augmentation stage** would show whether the collaborative utilization of internal and external LLM capabilities is crucial for performance gains, specifically in low-resource languages. By analyzing the performance changes after each ablation, researchers can pinpoint crucial components, **highlighting the relative importance of different modules**. This offers insights into the design and effectiveness of the architecture and can inform future improvements or modifications.  **The results might demonstrate the necessity of both the mapping and augmentation stages** for optimal multilingual reasoning, especially in cases where LLM internal capabilities are limited.

#### Future Enhancements
Future enhancements for multilingual LLM reasoning could involve exploring more sophisticated model merging techniques, such as **attention-based mechanisms** that dynamically adjust the contribution of external and internal LLM capabilities.  Investigating **different architectural designs** beyond simple concatenation, perhaps integrating the external model's features more deeply within the LLM architecture itself, warrants further exploration.  Additionally, research into **finer-grained control over the merging process** would allow for more targeted improvements for specific language families or task types.  Addressing limitations in low-resource languages remains crucial, potentially through techniques like **data augmentation**, **cross-lingual transfer learning**, or **meta-learning** approaches. Finally, **evaluating the robustness of MindMerger to adversarial attacks** and exploring methods to improve its interpretability and explainability would significantly enhance its reliability and trustworthiness.
