### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Finding efficient algorithms for computing equilibria in extensive-form games (EFGs) is a major challenge in AI.  First-order methods (FOMs) are promising but their performance hinges on a crucial parameter: the choice of distance-generating function (DGF).  The paper addresses the challenge of selecting the optimal DGF for FOMs in EFGs, noting previous approaches have relied on indirect analysis using iterate equivalence with existing algorithms. This equivalence prevents fully understanding the optimality of previous solutions and also limits the ability to refine algorithm design to leverage the chosen DGF. 

This research introduces novel primal-dual treeplex norms to directly analyze the strong convexity of the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) DGF.  **The analysis shows DilEnt achieves a near-optimal diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio**, matching the state-of-the-art performance of existing algorithms (KOMWU) while offering a direct and more insightful analysis. Furthermore, **a new regret lower bound is proven**, confirming the near-optimality of DilEnt.  The paper showcases the new analytic techniques by using them to refine the convergence rate of Clairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

### In-depth insights


#### Dilated Entropy
The concept of "Dilated Entropy" emerges as a **crucial regularizer** within the context of first-order optimization methods used for solving extensive-form games.  Its significance lies in its ability to **improve the convergence rate** of algorithms by optimizing the relationship between the diameter and strong convexity modulus of the strategy space.  The paper highlights the **optimality** of dilated entropy (up to logarithmic factors) compared to other distance-generating functions. This optimality is not only theoretically proven but also demonstrates practical value through improved performance when used with online mirror descent and clairvoyant online mirror descent algorithms, leading to **state-of-the-art results** for approximating coarse correlated equilibria.

#### Regret Minimization
Regret minimization, a core concept in online learning, focuses on minimizing the difference between an algorithm's cumulative performance and that of the best fixed strategy in hindsight.  In the context of extensive-form games, **regret minimization algorithms aim to find strategies that perform well against a diverse set of opponents**, iteratively improving performance over time. The paper explores various regret minimization techniques, including online mirror descent (OMD) which uses a distance-generating function to efficiently find approximate equilibria. **The choice of distance-generating function significantly impacts the algorithm's performance**, and the paper analyzes the properties of dilated entropy and its variants for optimizing OMD.  **Lower bounds on achievable regret are derived**, showing the near-optimality of dilated entropy up to logarithmic factors. This optimality analysis demonstrates that DilEnt is computationally efficient and theoretically sound.

#### Treeplex Norms
The concept of "Treeplex Norms" in the context of extensive-form game solving is intriguing.  It suggests a novel approach to analyzing the strong convexity of distance-generating functions (DGFs), a critical component for the efficiency of first-order optimization methods. The paper likely introduces **novel primal and dual norms** tailored to the tree-like structure of extensive-form games, which should facilitate the analysis of algorithms like online mirror descent (OMD).  This approach is significant because **standard analysis techniques often struggle to capture the nuances of such structured spaces.** The use of treeplex norms seems intended to **provide a more natural analytical framework** that is better suited to the recursive structure of the game tree, potentially yielding tighter bounds on strong convexity and improved convergence rate guarantees for algorithms used to find approximate equilibria.  The success of this approach hinges on the ability of the treeplex norms to offer a tighter characterization of the geometry of the strategy space, leading to a more refined analysis of optimization algorithms within that space.  Further research could investigate the generality of treeplex norms and explore their application in other tree-structured problems.

#### EFG Optimality
The concept of "EFG Optimality" in the context of extensive-form games (EFGs) centers on identifying the optimal algorithms and strategies for solving these complex games.  **First-order methods (FOMs)** are often employed, relying on a distance-generating function (DGF) to regularize the strategy space.  Research focuses on determining the ideal DGF, as the ratio between its strong convexity and diameter significantly impacts FOM performance.  **Dilated entropy (DilEnt)** emerges as a prominent candidate, exhibiting iterate equivalence with state-of-the-art algorithms like KOMWU. However, **a key contribution is the introduction of novel primal-dual treeplex norms**, providing a refined analytical framework to demonstrate DilEnt's near-optimality, up to logarithmic factors, in terms of its diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio.  This optimality is further solidified by matching regret lower bounds, showing that DilEnt is not just efficient but nearly optimal for solving EFGs using FOMs.

#### Lower Bounds
The section on lower bounds is crucial for establishing the optimality of the proposed Dilated Entropy (DilEnt) regularizer.  It rigorously demonstrates that **no algorithm can achieve significantly better regret than DilEnt**, thereby validating its near-optimal performance.  The authors derive a lower bound on the regret, showcasing that any algorithm solving extensive-form games must incur regret at least within a logarithmic factor of DilEnt's bound. This result is particularly important because it directly addresses the core claim of the paper, which posits DilEnt's near-optimality.  **The lower bound proof leverages a carefully constructed hard instance**, highlighting the fundamental limitations in online learning for this problem.  A matching upper bound further strengthens the overall argument, showing that DilEnt's performance is essentially the best achievable up to a logarithmic factor. This rigorous analysis provides a strong theoretical underpinning for the practical efficacy of DilEnt.
