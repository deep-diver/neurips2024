(a) shows jobs arriving randomly in queues (agents), with unknown utility values between queues and servers (arms). (b) depicts how a scheduler assigns each queue to a server. Finally, (c) demonstrates that each server stochastically accepts at most one assigned job based on its preference, serving the accepted job while rejected jobs remain.", "section": "Problem Statement"}, {"figure_path": "0TUMAAb3of/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Experimental results for (left) average queue length and (right) regret", "description": "The left plot shows the average queue length over time for the proposed UCB-QMB and TS-QMB algorithms, compared to several baselines (MaxWeight-UCB, Q-UCB, DAM-UCB, and ETC-GS).  The proposed algorithms exhibit significantly lower average queue lengths, demonstrating their effectiveness in stabilizing the queueing system. The right plot shows the cumulative regret for the same algorithms and baselines, revealing that the proposed algorithms achieve sublinear regret compared to the baselines, indicating their efficiency in learning the optimal scheduling policy. Error bars represent standard deviation.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "0TUMAAb3of/figures/figures_46_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Experimental results for (left) average queue length and (right) regret", "description": "The figure presents the experimental results for two key metrics: average queue length and regret.  The left panel displays the average queue length over time, comparing the performance of several algorithms (UCB-QMB, TS-QMB, MaxWeight-UCB, Q-UCB, DAM-UCB, ETC-GS) against an oracle (MaxWeight).  The right panel shows the cumulative regret of the same algorithms.  Error bars (standard deviation) are included to represent the variability of the results. The results demonstrate the stability and regret performance of the proposed algorithms (UCB-QMB and TS-QMB) compared to the other approaches.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
