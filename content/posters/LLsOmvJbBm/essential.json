Existing methods struggle with the interplay of fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and optimization constraints.  Traditional control algorithms, designed for solid systems, often fail to handle the infinite degrees of freedom inherent in fluid flows.\nNeuralFluid offers a novel solution by integrating a fast, differentiable Navier-Stokes solver with a low-dimensional geometry representation and a control-shape co-design algorithm.  This end-to-end differentiable framework allows gradient-based optimization, enabling efficient exploration of the design space and leading to designs and controllers that outperform gradient-free methods in various benchmark tasks.  The framework's Gym-like simulation environments make it easily accessible for researchers.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "LLsOmvJbBm/podcast.wav"}
