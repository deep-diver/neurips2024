Overly aggressive optimization can lead to overfitting and poor generalization, while insufficient regularization may not adequately constrain the model's parameters, impacting its robustness to unseen data.  Existing methods addressing this challenge either have limitations in their usability or require significant computational overhead.\n\nThis paper introduces Selective Projection Decay (SPD), a novel weight decay method that selectively regularizes model parameters based on a carefully designed condition. **SPD prioritizes layers with consistent loss reduction and thus constrains those layers exhibiting inconsistent performance.**  Experimental results on image classification, semantic segmentation, and large language model fine-tuning across various benchmarks demonstrate that SPD significantly improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, outperforming existing methods in simplicity and effectiveness.  **The compatibility of SPD with PEFT methods further enhances its applicability to large-scale models.**", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "4neqdBz8eG/podcast.wav"}
