It regularizes ||Wt \u2013 Wo||2 for full fine-tuning and ||\u2206Wt||2 for PEFT fine-tuning.", "description": "This figure illustrates how Selective Projection Decay (SPD) applies regularization differently in full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). In full fine-tuning, SPD constrains the distance between the fine-tuned model's weights (Wt) and the pre-trained model's weights (Wo) (||Wt \u2013 Wo||2).  In PEFT, where only a small set of parameters are updated (\u2206Wt), SPD focuses on regularizing the change in these parameters (||\u2206Wt||2).  The diagram uses a visual metaphor of containers and springs to represent the model weights and the regularization.", "section": "3 Methods"}]
