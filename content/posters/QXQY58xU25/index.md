### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many computational tasks are best solved by combining neural networks and programs (neural programs).  However, training these composites is challenging when the program part is a black-box (e.g., an API call or LLM). Existing methods either struggle with sample efficiency or require modifying the program for differentiability. 

This paper introduces ISED, a novel algorithm tackling this problem. ISED uses reinforcement learning to estimate gradients using only input/output examples.  It's tested on various tasks, showing better performance and efficiency than baselines, especially in tasks using modern LLMs. The improved data efficiency addresses a significant bottleneck in the field.

> This figure illustrates the decomposition of a scene recognition task into a neural model and a program. The neural model (MŒ∏) processes an image and identifies objects within the scene. The output of the neural model is then fed into a program (P) that utilizes a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-4 in this instance, to determine the room type based on the identified objects. The input image shows a kitchen scene with a sink, cup, dish and paper towel. The neural model detects these objects and provides this information as input to the program. The program then utilizes this input to query the LLM, resulting in the final output of 'kitchen.'

### In-depth insights


#### Neural Program Learning
Neural program learning combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic programming, aiming to overcome limitations of each.  **Neural networks excel at perception and pattern recognition, but struggle with reasoning and symbolic manipulation.**  Conversely, **symbolic methods are strong at reasoning but lack the ability to learn from data efficiently.** Neural program learning seeks to bridge this gap by expressing tasks as a composition of a neural model (e.g., for feature extraction) followed by a program (e.g., for reasoning or decision-making). This hybrid approach leverages the data efficiency of neural networks and the reasoning power of symbolic programming.  Key challenges in this field include making the program component differentiable (or approximating gradients effectively), handling programs written in non-differentiable languages, and achieving efficient learning when dealing with large or complex programs.  **The ultimate goal is to create systems that can learn and reason effectively in a way that is both data efficient and capable of solving complex tasks that cannot be solved by either neural networks or symbolic programs alone.**

#### ISED Algorithm
The ISED algorithm, introduced for data-efficient learning with neural programs, cleverly addresses the challenge of gradient calculation with black-box components.  **ISED's core innovation lies in its infer-sample-estimate-descend (ISED) framework.**  It begins by inferring a probability distribution over program inputs using a neural model. Then, it samples representative inputs and executes the black-box program to generate corresponding outputs, effectively creating a summarized symbolic program.  This allows ISED to estimate gradients using reinforcement learning principles without directly differentiating the black-box.  **This indirect gradient approach is key to ISED's data efficiency, as it sidesteps the limitations of REINFORCE and other black-box gradient methods.** However, while efficient, ISED's scalability may be limited by the dimensionality of the program's input space; the choice of aggregator function also impacts the final accuracy.  **Despite these limitations, ISED demonstrates comparable or superior performance across various neural program benchmarks compared to other neurosymbolic and neural-only approaches, highlighting its potential in scenarios with limited labeled data.**

#### Benchmark Tasks
The selection of benchmark tasks is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of a novel neural program learning algorithm like ISED.  **A diverse set of tasks is needed to demonstrate the algorithm's generalizability and robustness.** The paper's choice to include tasks involving modern LLMs (like GPT-4) is a **strong point**, showcasing the algorithm's applicability beyond traditional neurosymbolic domains.  **The inclusion of established neurosymbolic benchmarks provides a fair comparison** against existing methods, allowing a more nuanced evaluation of ISED's performance.  However, **the specific choice of tasks and datasets requires careful consideration.**  It's important to examine whether the selected tasks adequately represent the full range of potential applications for neural program learning, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation rather than focusing solely on specific problem types.  Ultimately, the success of the evaluation depends on the representativeness and difficulty of the benchmark tasks; the paper should justify the choices made in this aspect.

#### Sample Efficiency
Sample efficiency, a crucial aspect in machine learning, is thoroughly investigated in this research.  The authors demonstrate that their proposed ISED algorithm significantly improves upon existing methods, such as REINFORCE and IndeCateR, in terms of data requirements for achieving comparable accuracy.  **ISED's enhanced sample efficiency stems from its unique approach to gradient estimation**, which leverages sampled symbol-output pairs to create a summarized logic program, thereby providing a stronger learning signal than REINFORCE-based alternatives.  This advantage is particularly pronounced when dealing with complex programs or large input spaces, as demonstrated by the experimental results showing ISED's superior performance across various benchmarks.  **The improved sample efficiency translates to reduced computational costs and faster training times**, making ISED a more practical solution for real-world applications where data is often scarce or expensive to acquire. The study highlights the trade-off between sample complexity and model complexity; while ISED shines in sample efficiency, limitations emerge with high-dimensional inputs, pointing to a potential avenue for future research and improvements.

#### Future Directions
The paper's exploration of future directions highlights several key areas for improvement and expansion.  **Addressing the scalability limitations of ISED with high-dimensional input spaces** is paramount, suggesting the need for advanced sampling strategies perhaps borrowing from Bayesian optimization.  Another crucial direction lies in **combining the strengths of white-box and black-box methods**, potentially creating a more robust and efficient neurosymbolic programming language.  **This would leverage ISED's ability to handle black-box components while integrating the benefits of explicit symbolic reasoning where appropriate.**  Further research could focus on enhancing ISED's performance with complex programs by investigating superior gradient estimation techniques.  Finally, a significant area for exploration involves **applying ISED to a broader range of tasks and domains**, demonstrating its generalizability and practicality for real-world applications. This could involve expanding beyond the benchmarks already tested and exploring its compatibility with diverse programing languages and APIs.

The input is a leaf image, which is processed by a neural model to predict three leaf characteristics: shape, margin, and texture.
