These limitations hinder the creation of high-fidelity dynamic scenes, especially those with complex deformations.\nGrid4D tackles these issues by employing a novel 4D decomposed hash encoding, breaking from the low-rank assumption. This, combined with a directional attention module and smooth regularization, significantly improves rendering quality and speed. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by experiments that show superior results compared to state-of-the-art models across various datasets.", "affiliation": "Nankai University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "eyfYC19gOd/podcast.wav"}
