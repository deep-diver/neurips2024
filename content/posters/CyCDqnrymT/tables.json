Key metrics used for comparison are the mean absolute error (MAE) in degrees and the accuracy (Acc) in percentage. The table also shows the type of network (SNN or ANN), the number of parameters (in millions), and the number of time steps (T) used in each model. The results show that the proposed SNN-based SSL framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in terms of both MAE and accuracy.", "section": "4.1 Comparison with SOTA Models"}, {"figure_path": "CyCDqnrymT/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of sound source localization systems.", "description": "This table compares the performance of various sound source localization (SSL) systems, including both spiking neural network (SNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) based models.
