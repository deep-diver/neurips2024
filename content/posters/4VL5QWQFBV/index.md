### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The rise of powerful text-to-image models raises concerns about unauthorized use of datasets used in their training.  Existing methods like watermarking or introducing perturbations are often easily bypassed.  This poses a significant challenge for copyright protection, especially for artists whose style might be replicated without their consent. 

This paper presents a new solution, focusing on disentangling style domains.  Instead of embedding watermarks directly into images, it generates watermarks from these disentangled style domains, making them more resistant to removal.  The use of identifier z and dynamic contrastive learning further strengthens the watermarking process. The method achieves One-Sample-Verification and a watermark distribution approach to handle copyright infringements, even hybrid ones, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.

> This figure illustrates the three main phases of the proposed dataset copyright verification method: Mimic Fine-tune Phase, Generation Phase, and Verification Phase. In the Mimic Fine-tune Phase, an attacker uses unauthorized data to fine-tune a mimic model. In the Generation Phase, the attacker uses the mimic model to generate images based on a given prompt.  The defender then employs a watermark extractor, utilizing specific watermark mapping relationships and an identifier z, to analyze these generated images in the Verification Phase. This process aims to detect unauthorized dataset usage by focusing on the style domain rather than traditional embedding and extraction techniques.  The figure shows a clear flow of information and how the watermark extractor identifies similarities and dissimilarities in the style domain between the protected datasets and the images generated by the mimic model.

> This table presents the results of the watermark distribution experiments. It shows the number of samples in different watermark accuracy ranges (0-20%, 20-40%, ..., 90-100%) for both mimic and non-mimic models across five different datasets (CelebA, CUB, Dreambooth, Artists, and Als). The average watermark accuracy (Avg acc) and the percentage of samples with 100% watermark accuracy (t@k@100%wd) are also reported for both cases. The table demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed z-watermarking method, which achieves significantly higher accuracy for the protected datasets.





### In-depth insights


#### Style-Based Watermarking
Style-based watermarking presents a novel approach to copyright protection in AI-generated content, particularly images.  Instead of embedding imperceptible data directly into the image, **it leverages the inherent stylistic characteristics** of the original artwork.  The core idea involves extracting a style representation ‚Äì a kind of 'fingerprint' ‚Äì from the original artwork's features. This fingerprint acts as a watermark, and any image generated using unauthorized access to the original training data will likely retain traces of this style representation. This approach offers **greater resilience against adversarial attacks**, as directly altering the image's style is more noticeable and difficult than subtly modifying embedded data.  Furthermore, style-based watermarking potentially **enables One-Sample Verification**, allowing copyright holders to assert ownership based on a single, potentially publicly available instance, which significantly improves the feasibility of enforcement.  However, challenges exist in **robustly capturing and comparing styles**, requiring sophisticated techniques to account for variations in generation and the effects of different training processes.  The effectiveness will depend heavily on the **distinctness and generalizability** of the extracted style features. Therefore, research into efficient, robust style encoding and comparison methods is critical for the practical application of style-based watermarking.

#### Zero-Watermark Scheme
A zero-watermark scheme is a novel approach to copyright protection in the realm of AI-generated images, specifically focusing on protecting the unique style and content of datasets used in training models. Unlike traditional watermarking techniques that embed visible or invisible information directly within the image, a zero-watermark scheme leverages the **disentanglement of style and content** within the image generation model. This approach is significant because it bypasses vulnerabilities associated with traditional methods, such as adversarial attacks designed to remove embedded watermarks.  The core of the scheme lies in the **creation of implicit watermarks derived from the disentangled style domain**. This means generating a unique watermark, specific to the protected dataset, which is inherently linked to the style of the images generated using it. The watermark's presence or absence serves as a robust indicator of dataset usage. This method exhibits **self-generalization and mutual exclusivity**; making unauthorized use detectable even if the AI model is further fine-tuned or adapted. The approach tackles the complex problem of hybrid infringements by introducing a **watermark distribution mechanism**, enabling the precise determination of the presence and extent of copyright violation, even in instances of partial unauthorized usage.

#### Copyright Boundary
The concept of "Copyright Boundary" in the context of AI-generated content is crucial and complex.  It speaks to the **line between legitimate use of training data and infringement**.  The paper likely explores how to define this boundary, given that AI models learn from vast datasets often containing copyrighted material.  A key challenge is **distinguishing between inspired creations and direct copying**.  The paper's approach might involve techniques to embed watermarks or other identifiers in training data to track unauthorized usage and demonstrate ownership of unique artistic styles, thus establishing a verifiable copyright boundary.  **The goal is to enable artists and creators to protect their intellectual property** within the context of AI, a rapidly evolving landscape demanding clear legal and technical frameworks. The research likely highlights the difficulties in establishing such boundaries due to the inherent nature of AI's learning process and the potential for style mimicry, even without direct copying.

#### AI Mimicry Robustness
AI mimicry robustness in copyright protection is crucial.  **Robust watermarking techniques** are needed to withstand various attacks.  **Adversarial attacks**, such as fine-tuning on altered datasets or using data augmentation, aim to remove or obfuscate embedded watermarks. The effectiveness of watermarking schemes depends on their ability to resist these sophisticated manipulations. The research needs to investigate the robustness of the proposed method against different classes of attacks. The ability to **detect unauthorized data usage** under these attacks is vital to safeguarding copyright in the age of AI mimicry. **One-sample verification**, even under duress, is a significant benchmark for practical application.  Finally, **generalization across various models and APIs** is a key factor determining real-world effectiveness, especially in the face of rapidly evolving AI technologies.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this disentangled style domain watermarking method could explore several key areas.  **Improving robustness against more sophisticated attacks** is crucial; current methods, while effective, might be vulnerable to advanced adversarial techniques.  **Expanding the scope of supported image generation models** beyond the tested diffusion models would broaden applicability. The current method's reliance on a pre-trained style encoder might limit its generalizability;  investigating alternative or self-supervised training methods to enhance universality is warranted.  **Developing more efficient watermark extraction methods** is important, as the computational cost could become a limiting factor at scale.   Finally, extending the framework to protect not only styles, but also the *content* of images to truly address full copyright infringement, is another significant and potentially challenging goal.

> This figure shows the pipeline of the proposed z-watermarking method. The pipeline consists of three phases: Disentangling Styles and Contents, Mutual Exclusivity, and Self-Generalization. In the first phase, the style domain encoder disentangles each protected unit into its style representation, serving as the center anchor of the contraction domain. In the second phase, the contraction domain is generalized by the dynamic contrastive learning between central samples and boundary samples of the specific protected unit. Finally, the domain achieves the maximum concealed offset of probability distribution through both the injection of identifier z and dynamic contrastive learning. This results in an implicit watermark due to the mutual exclusivity of contraction domains, rather than embedding invisible information into datasets.
