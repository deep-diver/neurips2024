In the Mimic Fine-tune Phase, an attacker uses unauthorized data to fine-tune a mimic model. In the Generation Phase, the attacker uses the mimic model to generate images based on a given prompt.  The defender then employs a watermark extractor, utilizing specific watermark mapping relationships and an identifier z, to analyze these generated images in the Verification Phase. This process aims to detect unauthorized dataset usage by focusing on the style domain rather than traditional embedding and extraction techniques.  The figure shows a clear flow of information and how the watermark extractor identifies similarities and dissimilarities in the style domain between the protected datasets and the images generated by the mimic model.

Here, z serves as the key or special bias of the disentangled style domain Sz of protected units, and Q denotes the dynamic historical negative queue.", "description": "This figure shows the pipeline of the proposed z-watermarking method. The pipeline consists of three phases: Disentangling Styles and Contents, Mutual Exclusivity, and Self-Generalization. In the first phase, the style domain encoder disentangles each protected unit into its style representation, serving as the center anchor of the contraction domain. In the second phase, the contraction domain is generalized by the dynamic contrastive learning between central samples and boundary samples of the specific protected unit. Finally, the domain achieves the maximum concealed offset of probability distribution through both the injection of identifier z and dynamic contrastive learning. This results in an implicit watermark due to the mutual exclusivity of contraction domains, rather than embedding invisible information into datasets.", "section": "3.2 The overview of z-Watermarking"}, {"figure_path": "4VL5QWQFBV/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Main results for z-watermarking.
