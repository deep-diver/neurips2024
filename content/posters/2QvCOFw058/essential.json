Existing methods like gradient descent often struggle with slow convergence and the presence of numerous saddle points, especially in overparameterized settings where the number of parameters exceeds the necessary minimum.  These challenges hinder efficient model training and limit practical applicability.\nThis paper introduces an Approximated Gauss-Newton (AGN) method to overcome these limitations. AGN achieves **global Q-linear convergence** from random initialization, meaning it converges to the optimal solution linearly and consistently, regardless of the starting point. This is a significant improvement over existing methods whose convergence rates are often sub-linear or slower in the presence of saddle points. The AGN method also boasts **computational efficiency** comparable to gradient descent, making it a highly practical approach for LRMS.", "affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xidian University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "2QvCOFw058/podcast.wav"}
