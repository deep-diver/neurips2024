The comparison considers the initialization method (random or spectral) and shows the iteration complexity required to achieve a desired level of accuracy (\u03b5). The results highlight the different convergence rates and the influence of the condition number (\u03ba) and initialization on the efficiency of each algorithm.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "2QvCOFw058/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of computational time for methods on matrices with varying dimensions n, measured in seconds.

The comparison is made for matrices of sizes 100x100 and 500x500, with condition numbers (\u03ba) of 10 and 50.  The plus sign (+) indicates that the computation time exceeded 500 or 5000 seconds, showing the significant speed advantage of the AGN method, particularly for larger matrices and higher condition numbers.", "section": "6 Numerical experiments"}]
