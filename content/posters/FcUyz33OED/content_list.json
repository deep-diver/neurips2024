In this work, we introduce the Target-Guided Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer, termed APCT, a novel architecture designed to augment global structure capture through an adversarial feature erasing mechanism predicated on patterns discerned at each step during training. Specifically, APCT integrates an Adversarial Significance Identifier and a Target-guided Promptor. The Adversarial Significance Identifier, is tasked with discerning token significance by integrating global contextual analysis, utilizing a structural salience index algorithm alongside an auxiliary supervisory mechanism. The Target-guided Promptor, is responsible for accentuating the propensity for token discard within the self-attention mechanism, utilizing the value derived above, consequently directing the model attention towards alternative segments in subsequent stages. By iteratively applying this strategy in multiple steps during training, the network progressively identifies and integrates an expanded array of object-associated patterns.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
