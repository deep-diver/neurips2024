This significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios demanding robust 3D perception.  This paper tackles this critical challenge by introducing a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture global structure, reducing reliance on easily corrupted localized patterns. \nThe proposed method, APCT, uses two key modules.  The Adversarial Significance Identifier identifies important features, while the Target-guided Promptor directs attention away from potentially corrupted parts of the point cloud. Through iterative training, APCT progressively learns to rely on a broader range of patterns, improving its resilience. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its potential for building more robust and reliable 3D perception systems.", "affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "FcUyz33OED/podcast.wav"}
