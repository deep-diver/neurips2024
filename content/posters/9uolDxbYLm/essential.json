Existing methods often suffer from decision boundary shifts, especially with one-sided counterfactuals. This paper proposes Counterfactual Clamping Attack (CCA) which utilizes a unique loss function to improve model reconstruction accuracy using only one-sided counterfactuals.  \nCCA addresses decision boundary shifts by treating counterfactuals differently, improving fidelity. The paper presents novel theoretical relationships between reconstruction error and counterfactual queries, using polytope theory for convex boundaries and probabilistic guarantees for ReLU networks.  Experiments across multiple datasets show improved fidelity with CCA compared to existing approaches.", "affiliation": "University of Maryland", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "9uolDxbYLm/podcast.wav"}
