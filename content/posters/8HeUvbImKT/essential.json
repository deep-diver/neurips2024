This can lead to incorrect predictions and unreliable results, particularly in safety-critical applications. Existing methods address this challenge by analyzing either the model's logits (outputs) or the activations of its penultimate layer. However, these methods sometimes fail to effectively distinguish OOD data, especially when it is similar to the training data. \nThis paper introduces WeiPer, a novel approach to OOD detection that addresses these limitations. WeiPer works by slightly perturbing the weights of the final fully connected layer of the model, thereby creating a more informative representation of the input data.  The researchers demonstrate that WeiPer enhances existing OOD detection techniques and introduce a new method, called WeiPer+KLD, that achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. **The simplicity and general applicability of WeiPer make it a valuable tool for improving the robustness of machine learning models**.", "affiliation": "Free University of Berlin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "8HeUvbImKT/podcast.wav"}
