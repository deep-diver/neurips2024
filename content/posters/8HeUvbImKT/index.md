### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Machine learning models often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) data ‚Äì data that differs significantly from the training data.  This can lead to incorrect predictions and unreliable results, particularly in safety-critical applications. Existing methods address this challenge by analyzing either the model's logits (outputs) or the activations of its penultimate layer. However, these methods sometimes fail to effectively distinguish OOD data, especially when it is similar to the training data. 

This paper introduces WeiPer, a novel approach to OOD detection that addresses these limitations. WeiPer works by slightly perturbing the weights of the final fully connected layer of the model, thereby creating a more informative representation of the input data.  The researchers demonstrate that WeiPer enhances existing OOD detection techniques and introduce a new method, called WeiPer+KLD, that achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. **The simplicity and general applicability of WeiPer make it a valuable tool for improving the robustness of machine learning models**.

A single perturbation of the class-associated vector yields already a reduction of the false positive rate (FPR) from 1.34% to 0.79%. Visually, we confirm that OOD data mostly resides close to 0, extending into the positive cluster in a particular conical shape, which is exploited by the cone of WeiPer vectors.

### In-depth insights


#### OOD Detection
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial aspect of robust machine learning, aiming to identify inputs that deviate significantly from the training data distribution.  **Existing methods often leverage either logit information or penultimate layer activations**, but these approaches can be limited.  This paper introduces WeiPer, a novel technique that uses **weight perturbations of class projections to create a richer representation of the input**, leading to improved OOD detection performance.  **WeiPer augments the feature space**, enabling better discrimination between in-distribution and OOD samples.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated across multiple benchmarks, showcasing **state-of-the-art results, particularly in challenging scenarios with OOD samples positioned close to the training distribution**. WeiPer's flexibility allows for its integration with various OOD detection methods, enhancing their performance. However, the approach requires careful consideration of hyperparameters and computational cost.

#### WeiPer Method
The WeiPer method, introduced for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, cleverly enhances existing methods by introducing perturbations to the weight vectors of a neural network's final fully connected layer.  **Instead of relying solely on the original class projections, WeiPer generates a cone of perturbed vectors around each original weight**, creating a richer representation of the input data. This simple yet effective trick significantly improves the ability to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, especially in challenging scenarios where OOD data points are positioned close to the training set distribution.  **The method's strength lies in its ability to capture additional structural information from the penultimate layer**, leading to better separation of ID and OOD data.  Furthermore, WeiPer's flexibility allows its integration with various OOD detection scores, such as MSP and a novel KL-divergence based approach (WeiPer+KLD), which further leverages the augmented WeiPer space for enhanced accuracy.  **The cone of perturbed vectors is generated through carefully controlled weight perturbations**, ensuring that all perturbed vectors maintain a consistent angular deviation from the original weight vector.  This design enables the method to extract additional structural information while preserving the essential class information present in the original weights.

#### Empirical Results
The empirical results section of a research paper is crucial for validating the claims and hypotheses presented.  A strong empirical results section will thoroughly describe the experimental setup, including datasets, metrics, and baselines used. **It should clearly present the results of the experiments using visualizations like tables and graphs, emphasizing key findings that support the paper's contributions.** The discussion should interpret the results, addressing both expected and unexpected outcomes.  **A critical analysis of the results, including potential limitations and comparisons to prior work, is necessary for a robust evaluation.** It is important to show how the results support the paper's claims and also to explore any limitations or uncertainties in the data interpretation.  **Statistical significance of results should be clearly stated to ensure confidence in the findings.** Ultimately, a compelling empirical results section strengthens the overall persuasiveness and impact of the research by providing tangible evidence supporting the presented claims.

#### Limitations
The WeiPer method, while showing strong performance improvements, presents some limitations.  A significant drawback is the **increased number of hyperparameters** compared to existing methods, potentially increasing the computational cost of tuning and potentially impacting generalization.  Additionally, the improved performance comes at the cost of **higher memory consumption**, particularly noticeable when using larger WeiPer spaces to capture more of the input distribution's structure. This might restrict the applicability of WeiPer to devices with limited memory resources.  Further investigation into the effect of dimensionality and memory usage is warranted. Finally, although WeiPer demonstrates consistent improvement across benchmarks and models, the extent of its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific dataset and architecture used, highlighting the **need for further testing and analysis** across a wider range of scenarios to fully understand its generalizability and robustness.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **extending WeiPer to other modalities beyond images**, such as text or time-series data, to assess its generalizability.  Investigating the impact of different perturbation methods and distributions on the performance of WeiPer would refine its effectiveness.  A crucial area for improvement is addressing the **computational cost of the method**. Exploring techniques to reduce memory requirements, possibly through dimensionality reduction or approximation methods, would be particularly valuable.  Finally, further theoretical analysis is needed to **establish stronger theoretical foundations for WeiPer's effectiveness**, possibly connecting it to existing theoretical frameworks of OOD detection or statistical learning theory. This would enhance the understanding of its strengths and limitations, providing insights into its performance in diverse scenarios.

We report the mean and the minimum to maximum range (transparent). We set r = 5 instead of r = 100 for ImageNet to save resources. Thus the noise on the results is stronger for the ImageNet ablations. All of the parameters except the kernel sizes only have a single local maximum which indicates that they should be easy to optimize. The most important parameters seem to be the kernel sizes s1 and s2 that we use for smoothing followed by nbins. Note that s1 and s2 have a different optimum, which means it is not possible to simply choose s1 = s2 and reduce the count of hyperparameters. Œª1 = 0 is the score function without the KLD specific WeiPer application. Œª2 is the application of MSPWeiPer which is not beneficial for CIFAR10, but shows to be effective on ImageNet.

> üîº This table presents the hyperparameters used for creating the density plots shown in Figures 3, 7, and 8.  Specifically, it lists the number of bins used in the histograms (nbins), the kernel size (s) used for smoothing the density estimates, and the maximum value of the mean density of the penultimate layer activations (maxp).  These parameters are crucial for visualizing and analyzing the activation distributions in both the original and perturbed feature spaces, which are key components in understanding and evaluating the performance of the WeiPer method.

> üîº This table presents the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance of the proposed WeiPer method and several state-of-the-art methods across three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.  The table shows AUROC and FPR95 scores for both near and far OOD datasets. It highlights WeiPer+KLD's superior performance, particularly in challenging near OOD scenarios with ResNet backbones, and also points out its relative weakness with ViT backbones.  Ablation studies comparing WeiPer+KLD with and without MSP, and with random projections are also presented for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

> Table 2: OOD Detection results of top performing methods on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks (For a comparison with every other evaluated method of OpenOOD and standard deviation over the CIFAR models, see Appendices A.5 and A.6). The top performing results for each benchmark are displayed in bold and we underline the second best result. Due to WeiPer's random nature, we report the median AUROC score over 10 different seeds. For an easy comparison, we portray the following ablations for CIFAR10 which are seperated by a line: The KLD results are the WeiPer+KLD results without MSP and RP is WeiPer+KLD with weight independent random projections drawn from a standard Gaussian. While WeiPer+KLD performs strongly especially on near datasets using ResNet backbones, its performance deteriorates with ViTs (see Section 4 for discussion).

> üîº This table presents the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) and the False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95) for various OOD detection methods on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.  The table compares WeiPer against other state-of-the-art methods, highlighting WeiPer's performance, particularly on datasets where OOD samples are similar to in-distribution samples.  Ablation studies are also included for CIFAR10, showing the performance of WeiPer+KLD with and without Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) and with random projections.  The results show that WeiPer+KLD performs well on ResNet backbones, but its performance declines when using Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones.
