This performance gap stems from \"neuron starvation,\" where irregular connections lead to many neurons not firing during inference, resulting in information loss. \n\nThe paper introduces TAS-GNN, which tackles this by grouping neurons based on node degree (topology-aware grouping) and dynamically adjusting their thresholds (group-adaptive). This ensures more neurons participate in computation.  Experiments show TAS-GNN significantly outperforms existing SGNNs, achieving substantial accuracy improvements across diverse datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the topology-aware approach and highlighting its potential for energy-efficient graph classification.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "znBiAp5ISn/podcast.wav"}
