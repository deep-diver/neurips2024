It shows the performance of four methods (CMAES, Monolithic Proxy, Cascaded Proxy, and the proposed RL method) using two different target types: expert-curated targets and randomly generated targets.  The metrics used are PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and the number of queries to the image processing pipeline. The table highlights the superior efficiency and image quality of the proposed RL-based method which requires significantly fewer queries than other methods while achieving higher PSNR, SSIM, and lower LPIPS scores.", "section": "4.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "4kVHI2uXRE/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Experimental results demonstrating efficiency across varying input resolutions.

The study uses FiveK Random-Target dataset for photo finishing tuning.  The baseline (RL) uses a naive CNN-based encoder.  Subsequent experiments add one component at a time: dual-path feature representation (FD), photo statistics representation (FS), and historical actions embedding (FH). The PSNR and SSIM metrics are used to evaluate the performance, showing incremental improvements with the addition of each component. ", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study on State Representation"}]
