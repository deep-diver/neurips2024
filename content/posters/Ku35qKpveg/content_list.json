The inclusion of these extra parameters offer potential for the activation to eliminate irrelevant noise.

Extensive experiments showcase that DPA is compatible with various mainstream ANN architectures, can achieve sparser neural representations and outperform other activation counterparts, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Therefore, the proposed DPA aims to denoise these channels (i & ii), thus achieving sparser representations and remarkable accuracy improvements.

Specifically, for the $c$ -th channel, given an input sample $x$ and the channel weight $\\mathbf{W}_{c}$ , it generates a channel response $f(x;\\mathbf{W}_{c})$ . Channel pruning operates by setting the weights of certain channels to zero, resulting in no responses on pruned channels for samples of any category (This is why channel pruning typically leads to a decrease in model accuracy.). In contrast, channel denoising operates by suppressing the responses of certain channels to zero, in which case, the channel weights are not necessarily zero, and the suppressed channels can vary for samples of different categories.   \n\u2022 Channel pruning needs post-processing to remove irrelevant channel weights and some need further fine-tuning, while channel denoising is conveniently trained end-to-end from scratch and does not require any post-processing or fine-tuning.   \n\u2022 The objective of channel pruning is trying to reduce computation and storage requirements without sacrificing accuracy, while the objective of channel denoising is trying to improve accuracy without increasing computational overhead.

The proposed DPA still has a gap to achieve the ideal performance as Observation 2 shows. This limitation can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the confirmatory experiment in Observation 2 assumes the category label is always known, but in applications, the category label is unknown during the testing phase. Therefore, to address this challenge, we introduced channel denoising during training, allowing the network to learn how to reduce the response from irrelevant channels in the testing stage when the category label is unknown. Through this approach, we expect to approximate the way of manually removing irrelevant channels in Observation 2 as much as possible. However, the joint criterion devised for identifying irrelevant channels is not always precise, highly depending on the historical context of each training moment, and some categories that share similarities at the representation level could add to the difficulty of precise denoising while still preserving category discrimination. At present, we are actively researching these areas and are confident that it will achieve more promising results. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tasks.
