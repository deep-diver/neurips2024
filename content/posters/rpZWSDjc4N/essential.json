Previous approaches mainly focus on image-based models and are unsuitable for point cloud data. This creates a critical need for methods that can explain 3D detectors' decisions.\n\nThis paper introduces FFAM, a novel method that generates high-quality visual explanations for 3D detectors. FFAM utilizes non-negative matrix factorization to identify and aggregate important features, then refines these explanations using object-specific gradients and voxel upsampling for better visualization. Evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that FFAM outperforms existing techniques, improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of 3D detectors.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "rpZWSDjc4N/podcast.wav"}
