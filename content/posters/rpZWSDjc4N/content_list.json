Considering the similarity between pixels in an image and points in a point cloud, we employ Deletion and Insertion to evaluate FFAM. In outdoor point cloud scenes, objects are relatively small compared to global scenes, so we only operate on points within twice the diagonal length of an object\u2019s bounding box from its center. We use IoU between a prediction and ground truth as the measure score. Average IoU curves are presented in Figure 5(a-b), and Table 2 reports the area under the curve (AUC) for different categories. A lower Deletion AUC indicates a steeper drop in the IoU score, reflecting a more pronounced impact of removed salient points. Conversely, a higher Insertion AUC suggests a larger increase in the IoU score per step, indicating the significance of added salient points. Our methods have the fastest performance drop and largest increase for Deletion and Insertion, showing points highlighted in our saliency maps have a greater effect on detector predictions than the other methods.

On the other hand, OccAM and Grad-CAM exhibit lower performance on this metric.

In this evaluation, a hit is recorded if the point with the highest saliency value falls within the ground truth bounding box, while a miss is counted otherwise. The PG metric measures the accuracy of saliency maps by calculating the ratio of hits to the total number of hits and misses. Furthermore, we report the energy-based PG metric (enPG) proposed in [33], which considers the energy within the ground truth region compared to the global scene. As shown in Table 3, our FFAM surpasses previous methods on all metrics, indicating its superior ability to focus on the explained object. Notably, Grad-CAM performs poorly on both PG and enPG, which aligns with the VEA results presented in Table 1.

A detection is considered a true positive if correctly classified and the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the prediction box and ground truth exceeds a threshold. Otherwise, it is a false positive. The IoU thresholds are 0.7, 0.5, and 0.5 for car, pedestrian, and cyclist objects, aligning with the KITTI official metric [7]. To reveal detection modes, we compute average saliency maps separately for true positives and false positives. Results are shown in Figure 6. First, we observe the average saliency maps of false positives exhibit similarities to those of true positives. The detector predicts a false positive because it detects a similar pattern to that of a true positive. Second, false positives tend to be surrounded by more noise points, with a point density of approximately one-third of true positives. We believe noises and sparse density may be significant factors contributing to the occurrence of false positives. Lastly, the ratio of car, pedestrian, and cyclist objects in true positives is approximately 36:5:2, while in false positives, it is 13:8:2. This suggests car objects are less prone to false positives compared to pedestrian and cyclist objects.

FFAM utilizes non-maximum matrix factorization to obtain a global concept activation map, which is then refined using object-specific gradients. To align the granularity of the input point cloud and intermediate features, we introduce a voxel upsampling strategy. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our FFAM provides more interpretable and compact visual explanations than previous methods. The limitation of FFAM is that it needs to access the feature maps within 3D detectors. In future work, we will explore using visual explanations to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of 3D detectors.
