This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g., pre-trained on 16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g., 128 frames). Our preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency components. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spatiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity of long video generation.

Our research reveals that directly generating long videos from short video diffusion models results in poor quality, primarily due to high-frequency distortion. To resolve this issue, we employ the SpectralBlend Temporal Attention (SpectralBlend-TA) mechanism, which blends low-frequency global features with high-frequency local features to enhance consistency and fidelity in long videos. Our experiments demonstrate that FreeLong significantly outperforms existing models, achieving superior temporal consistency and video fidelity. Our experiments show that FreeLong significantly outperforms existing models, achieving better temporal consistency and video fidelity. FreeLong also supports coherent multi-prompt generation, offering a practical solution for high-quality long video creation without extensive retraining.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
