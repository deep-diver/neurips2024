Existing neural network-based methods often struggle to capture fine details and tend to smooth out local features, limiting the accuracy of the final reconstruction. This is mainly due to the lack of ground truth data or ambiguities in estimating SDFs directly from raw point clouds.\nMultiPull tackles this challenge by introducing a novel framework that learns multi-scale implicit fields from raw point clouds.  **It progressively pulls multi-level query points onto the surface via a multi-step optimization process**. This approach leverages the power of frequency features to capture geometry at different levels of detail. Furthermore, by incorporating spatial distance and normal consistency constraints during optimization, the method significantly improves the accuracy of the SDF estimates and achieves superior performance in 3D surface reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on widely-used benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "XxE8mL1bCO/podcast.wav"}
