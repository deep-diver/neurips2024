Existing approaches train multiple ViT models of different sizes to accommodate varying hardware capabilities; however, this necessitates training and storing each model separately, resulting in inefficiency and scalability limitations.  This necessitates the development of flexible and adaptable ViT architectures.\nHydraViT addresses this by employing stochastic training to induce multiple subnetworks within a single ViT model. By dynamically selecting subsets of attention heads and embedding dimensions during inference, HydraViT achieves scalability across various hardware constraints without sacrificing performance.  **Experimental results demonstrate that HydraViT achieves better accuracy than existing methods with similar GMACs and throughput.** This flexible approach resolves the scalability issue, making ViTs more adaptable to resource-limited scenarios.", "affiliation": "Kiel University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "kk0Eaunc58/podcast.wav"}
