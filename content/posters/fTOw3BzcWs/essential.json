This work is relevant to various fields, including sales, healthcare and robotics, where data is often limited and expert knowledge is available. The proposed method, ExID, offers a practical and effective approach for enhancing offline RL algorithms in data-scarce settings, opening new avenues for further research in data-efficient reinforcement learning.", "summary": "ExID: Offline RL excels with limited data by incorporating intuitive expert insights for improved generalization.", "takeaways": ["ExID, a novel offline RL algorithm, uses domain knowledge to improve performance with limited data.", "ExID incorporates expert knowledge through a teacher network and adaptive regularization, mitigating erroneous actions for sparse samples and unobserved states.", "Empirical evaluations show ExID substantially outperforms existing methods in various environments with limited datasets, demonstrating significant performance gains."], "tldr": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with limited and region-specific datasets, hindering the learning of appropriate actions for unseen situations. Existing offline RL algorithms often fail to generalize well in such scenarios, resulting in suboptimal performance.  This paper tackles this problem by proposing a novel method to integrate human-obtainable expert knowledge to improve the performance of offline RL.\nThe proposed method, ExID, incorporates domain expertise via a teacher network that guides the offline RL agent during training. This teacher network is not static but rather adaptively refined based on the critic network's performance. ExID effectively regularizes the learning process, mitigating incorrect actions, especially in areas with sparse data or missing states.  Through rigorous empirical evaluation across various benchmark environments and real-world sales promotion data, ExID demonstrates substantial improvements in average performance compared to other offline RL algorithms, especially in scenarios with limited data. **ExID's success is attributed to its effective combination of data-driven learning and expert-guided regularization**.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fTOw3BzcWs/podcast.wav"}
