The comparison is based on three key aspects: whether the method is template-free, whether it relies on pre-trained features, and the number of entities it can reconstruct (single vs. multiple). This helps to highlight the novelty and advantages of TFS-NeRF, particularly its ability to handle multiple interacting entities in a template-free manner without the need for pre-trained features.", "section": "Related Works"}, {"figure_path": "UPxFYvHsyN/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Scene reconstruction results on BEHAVE [31] dataset.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for 3D scene reconstruction on the BEHAVE dataset.
