{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses the critical issue of **goal misalignment** in reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing **interpretable concept bottlenecks**.  This allows for easier inspection and correction of suboptimal agent behaviors, leading to more human-aligned RL agents.  The approach is particularly relevant given the increasing complexity and opacity of deep RL models, and opens avenues for future work in explainable AI (XAI) and safe RL.", "summary": "Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents (SCoBots) improve reinforcement learning by integrating interpretable layers, enabling concept-level inspection and human-in-the-loop revisions to fix misalignment issues, achieving competitive performance.", "takeaways": ["SCoBots use concept bottlenecks to make the decision-making process of RL agents more transparent and understandable.", "SCoBots successfully mitigate issues like goal misalignment in RL through concept-level inspection and human interaction.", "Experimental results demonstrate that SCoBots achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art deep RL agents on various tasks."], "tldr": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from issues like **goal misalignment**, where they optimize unintended side-goals instead of the true objective.  This is particularly problematic due to the \"black-box\" nature of deep neural networks, making it difficult for human experts to understand and correct suboptimal policies. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods often fail to provide sufficient insight for effective intervention.\nThis paper introduces Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents (SCoBots), a novel approach to address these issues. SCoBots integrate consecutive concept bottleneck layers that represent concepts not only as properties of individual objects but also as relations between them. This relational understanding is crucial for many RL tasks. By allowing for multi-level inspection of the decision-making process, SCoBots enable human experts to identify and correct suboptimal policies, leading to more human-aligned behavior.  The experimental results demonstrate that SCoBots achieve competitive performance, showcasing their potential for building more reliable and safe RL agents.", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, TU Darmstadt", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZC0PSk6Mc6/podcast.wav"}
