We see this paper as more of an existence proof that such a direction exists, rather than a careful study of how best to extract it, and we leave methodological improvements to future work. Furthermore, our analysis of adversarial suffixes does not provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon, and is restricted to a single model and a single adversarial example. Another limitation is that it is difficult to measure the coherence of a chat model, and we consider each metric used flawed in various ways. We use multiple varied metrics to give a broad view of coherence. Finally, while our work identifies a single direction that mediates refusal behavior in each model, we acknowledge that the semantic meaning of these directions remains unclear. Though we use the term \u201crefusal direction\u201d as a functional description, these directions could represent other concepts such as \u201charm\u201d or \u201cdanger\u201d, or they may even resist straightforward semantic interpretation.
