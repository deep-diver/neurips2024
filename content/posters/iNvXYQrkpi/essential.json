Existing model compression methods often require retraining, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive.  These limitations restrict the deployment of such models on standard hardware. \n\nThis paper introduces Streamlined Inference, a training-free framework addressing these issues. It integrates three key components: Feature Slicer (partitions input features), Operator Grouping (processes sub-features efficiently), and Step Rehash (skips unnecessary steps).  **Experiments demonstrate significant reductions in peak memory and computational overhead**, making high-quality video generation feasible on consumer-grade GPUs such as the 2080Ti. The method is applied to various models, achieving comparable visual quality with improved efficiency.", "affiliation": "Northeastern University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "iNvXYQrkpi/podcast.wav"}
