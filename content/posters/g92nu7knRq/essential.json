Existing optimization methods often sacrifice performance or require extensive retraining. This research addresses these limitations.  The paper focuses on the redundancy within MHA's heads. \nThe researchers propose Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA), a novel method that adaptively configures group sharing for key and value heads across different layers.  They achieve this by transforming existing MHA checkpoints into the DHA model, leveraging the parametric knowledge of the original model via linear fusion. **Experimental results show that DHA requires significantly less pre-training than existing approaches while achieving high performance**, resulting in substantial savings in both computational resources and training time.", "affiliation": "Baidu Inc.", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "g92nu7knRq/podcast.wav"}
