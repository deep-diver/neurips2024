Current methods struggle with the multiscale nature of molecules, often failing to capture both coarse-grained structural features and fine-grained atomic details.  Existing diffusion models are also not ideally suited to this task because random noise indiscriminately affects both scales. This paper addresses these challenges.\nThis work introduces Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), a novel method that uses a two-stage process. First, it generates a coarse-grained representation of the molecule using readily available tools. Second, a diffusion model is used to refine the atomic details, guided by the coarse-grained structure and ensuring that the final model is accurate and consistent. **EBD significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and diversity of generated conformers.**  The method is also computationally efficient, requiring far fewer steps to produce high-quality results.", "affiliation": "Texas A&M University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Aj0Zf28l6o/podcast.wav"}
