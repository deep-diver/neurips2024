### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Multi-task learning (MTL) and pretraining plus finetuning (PT+FT) are widely used to train neural networks for multiple tasks. However, the inductive biases that shape how these methods impact learning and generalization have been poorly understood, causing suboptimal model performance. This paper investigates this gap by analyzing the implicit regularization penalties associated with these methods in different network architectures.

The researchers introduce a novel technique of weight rescaling following pretraining, which allows PT+FT to leverage the "nested feature selection" regime. This regime biases the network towards reusing a sparse set of features learned during pretraining, leading to improved generalization. Their experiments validate this finding in both simple and deep neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements on Image Classification tasks when the weight rescaling is applied. Their results highlight a previously uncharacterized inductive bias for finetuning.

### In-depth insights


#### Multitask Learning Bias
Multitask learning (MTL), while offering potential benefits like improved sample efficiency and generalization, introduces inherent biases.  **A core bias stems from the network's tendency to reuse features learned during training on auxiliary tasks when tackling the main task.** This feature reuse, while sometimes advantageous, can lead to the propagation of biases from the auxiliary tasks to the main task.  The extent of feature reuse depends on factors like task similarity, network architecture, and optimization algorithms. Understanding these biases is crucial for effective MTL, as they can significantly affect performance and generalization.  **The paper investigates these biases, exploring how various training paradigms impact the way features are reused and the resulting implicit regularizations.** This analysis provides insights into the inductive biases of MTL, contributing to a deeper understanding of how this approach shapes the learning process and what techniques can mitigate potential downsides.  **The study highlights a "conservation law" showcasing a trade-off between feature reuse and sparsity** indicating that methods promoting sparsity may indirectly limit feature reuse.  By carefully considering these biases and their implications, researchers can better harness the power of MTL while avoiding its potential pitfalls.

#### Feature Reuse Regimes
The study's core contribution lies in its exploration of **feature reuse regimes** in multi-task learning (MTL) and pretraining-finetuning (PT+FT).  It reveals that MTL and PT+FT, while both promoting feature reuse, exhibit distinct biases.  **MTL displays a bias toward overall feature sparsity and reuse**, while **PT+FT demonstrates a more nuanced "nested feature selection" regime**. This regime prioritizes a sparse subset of features learned during pretraining, especially effective when the main task shares a significant overlap with the auxiliary task.  The paper further introduces a novel weight rescaling technique to enhance the nested feature selection effect in PT+FT, leading to improved performance in deep networks.  This highlights the critical role of architecture and training strategy in shaping the inductive biases, with implications for optimizing feature reuse in different contexts. **Weight rescaling improves performance by promoting the nested feature selection, revealing a crucial inductive bias for finetuning neural networks.**

#### Weight Rescaling Impact
The research explores how rescaling network weights before finetuning impacts performance, particularly focusing on the nested feature selection regime.  **Weight rescaling, a simple technique, is shown to improve accuracy in ResNets**, suggesting its potential practical value.  The study validates this finding by analyzing network representations and showing that effective weight rescaling pushes networks into this beneficial regime.  **Importantly, the effect of rescaling is shown to differ across network architectures**.  While ResNets exhibit improved performance with rescaling, Vision Transformers do not, suggesting architecture-specific considerations are necessary. The core insight is that effective rescaling causes the network to rely on a lower-dimensional subspace of its pretrained representation, a key characteristic of the nested feature selection regime that promotes efficient learning in downstream tasks. This highlights **the importance of carefully considering both network architecture and weight initialization in order to successfully leverage the benefits of nested feature selection.**

#### Nested Feature Selection
The concept of "Nested Feature Selection" presented in the research paper offers a novel perspective on the inductive biases inherent in fine-tuning neural networks.  It posits that **finetuning, unlike multi-task learning, exhibits a bias towards selecting a sparse subset of features from the pretrained model**, rather than learning entirely new features or reusing all previously learned features. This 'nested' approach is particularly beneficial when the target task shares features with the auxiliary task but doesn't require all of them. The theoretical analysis, supported by empirical results, suggests that this bias is an important inductive factor, potentially explaining the success of finetuning in various scenarios.  **Weight rescaling emerges as a crucial technique for triggering or enhancing this nested selection process**, emphasizing its role as a control mechanism over feature reuse behavior. The study highlights a trade-off between sparsity and feature dependence, implying that **models can achieve good performance by judiciously selecting a small but relevant set of pretrained features.**  This framework is not limited to shallow networks but extends to deep convolutional and transformer models, opening up potential avenues for optimizing finetuning strategies and advancing the theoretical understanding of transfer learning.

#### Deep Network Analysis
Analyzing deep networks presents unique challenges due to their high dimensionality and complexity.  Standard linear model analysis is insufficient.  Instead, methods focusing on **representation learning**, such as analyzing the dimensionality of learned feature spaces (e.g., via participation ratio) and the alignment between feature representations across different tasks (e.g., via effective number of shared dimensions), offer valuable insights. Investigating how the network's internal structure changes throughout training (e.g., weight rescaling effects)  can reveal implicit regularisation patterns.  Furthermore, understanding the interplay between feature sparsity and reuse across tasks is critical. **Teacher-student model approaches** are useful for isolating the impact of specific inductive biases, while **empirical validation on image classification tasks** provides insights into the generalization of theoretical findings to real-world scenarios.  Careful study of weight changes and feature subspace dimensionality offers a pathway to uncover how deep networks achieve their performance, ultimately revealing important insights into the inductive biases driving feature reuse and the benefits of weight rescaling in finetuning.

> üîº This figure shows that in ReLU networks, PT+FT outperforms both MTL and STL when the main and auxiliary tasks have correlated features.  The advantage of PT+FT over STL is particularly noticeable when the features are highly correlated (cosine similarity of 0.9). However, this advantage disappears when the magnitude of the main task features is significantly smaller than that of the auxiliary task features, even with high correlation.  MTL does not show the same trend. The result suggests that PT+FT is more sensitive to the similarity in direction and magnitude between main and auxiliary features than MTL.
