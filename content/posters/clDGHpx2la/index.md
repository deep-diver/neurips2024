### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Understanding how neural networks function is hindered by the "black box" nature of their internal processes.  Existing methods for interpreting neural activations have limitations in scope and often require researchers to predefine what information to extract. This is where **InversionView shines**.  It addresses these challenges by focusing on the pre-image of activations, i.e., the inputs that yield similar activation patterns. By sampling from the pre-image, this method allows researchers to directly infer the information encoded by each activation vector.



InversionView is applied to several case studies, including character counting, indirect object identification, and 3-digit addition, using various models from small transformers to GPT-2. Results show that InversionView effectively reveals valuable information in activations, **confirming the decoded information via causal intervention**.  It successfully uncovers both basic and complex information like token identity, position, counts, and abstract knowledge. This generalized approach significantly improves the interpretability of neural networks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their decision-making processes and advancing AI safety research.

> üîº This figure from the Methodology section illustrates the concept of InversionView by showing how different activation sites in a neural network encode different types of information. The top panel shows an activation site that encodes the semantics of 'being on leave', while the bottom panel shows an activation site that encodes information about the subject of the sentence (John).  The different colored points represent different input sentences, and their clustering demonstrates how similar inputs result in similar activations. This visualization helps explain how InversionView uses the geometry of the activation space to identify the information encoded in a given activation vector.

### In-depth insights


#### InversionView Intro
The hypothetical 'InversionView Intro' section would likely introduce the core concept of InversionView, positioning it as a novel method to understand neural network inner workings.  It would emphasize the **black box** nature of neural networks and the challenges in interpreting their internal representations.  The introduction would highlight the significance of deciphering information encoded within neural activations and propose InversionView as a general-purpose solution.  It would briefly touch upon existing methods for interpreting neural activations and their limitations, setting the stage for InversionView's unique approach.  **The core novelty** of InversionView might involve its focus on the pre-image of activations ‚Äì the set of inputs producing similar activations ‚Äì arguing that this pre-image directly embodies the information content.  The introduction would likely hint at the practical application of InversionView, perhaps mentioning the use of a trained decoder model to sample from the pre-image and how this facilitates a deeper understanding of transformer model algorithms.  Finally, a concise overview of the paper's structure and the case studies used to demonstrate the efficacy of InversionView would conclude the introduction, promising valuable insights into the inner workings of neural networks.

#### Decoding Activations
Decoding neural network activations is crucial for understanding their internal workings.  This involves translating the high-dimensional vector representations into human-interpretable insights. **InversionView**, as presented in the research paper, offers a novel approach by focusing on the pre-image of activations‚Äîthe set of inputs that produce similar activation patterns.  This differs from techniques like supervised probes which rely on pre-defined tasks. **Instead, InversionView leverages a trained decoder to sample inputs based on a given activation, revealing the underlying information encoded in these vectors**. The method's strength lies in its generality and applicability across diverse model architectures and tasks.  **It facilitates the discovery of algorithms implemented by the models by allowing researchers to examine the commonalities within this sampled pre-image**. However, challenges include the scalability of sampling from potentially large input spaces and the inherent complexity of interpreting the decoded information. Nonetheless, **InversionView demonstrates promise as a principled tool for gaining a deeper understanding of neural network behavior and deciphering the information content of their internal activations**, ultimately paving the way for better model transparency and control.

#### Transformer Circuits
The concept of "Transformer Circuits" represents a significant advancement in neural network interpretability.  It posits that complex neural networks, particularly transformer models, can be understood not as monolithic black boxes, but rather as a collection of interconnected, modular circuits.  These circuits, potentially consisting of attention heads, MLP layers, and other components, perform specific sub-computations. **Understanding these circuits requires identifying the information flow and processing within each component and how they interact.**  This approach moves beyond simple visualization of activations to a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithmic processes.  The success of this approach hinges on the ability to identify the functional roles of individual circuits by observing how they transform input information.   **By dissecting the network into smaller, more manageable units, the Transformer Circuits framework makes the internal workings of large, deep networks more comprehensible.**  Furthermore, this approach facilitates targeted interventions and analyses which can provide detailed explanations for the model's decisions and behavior.  Challenges include the complexity of identifying and mapping these circuits, and the variability in behavior that may emerge from interactions between circuits.

#### InversionView Limits
InversionView, while powerful, has limitations.  **Scalability** is a concern; exhaustively searching the preimage becomes computationally expensive with high-dimensional data and large models.  The reliance on a trained decoder introduces an additional layer of complexity and potential bias, and the **decoder's accuracy directly impacts the reliability of the results**.  Moreover, the method's reliance on a threshold parameter requires careful consideration as it impacts the granularity and scope of the information revealed. The success of InversionView also depends on the **representational geometry** of the activations, which is model-specific and may not always be intuitive or consistent. Finally, interpreting the preimages themselves, while potentially aided by LLMs, remains a **labor-intensive and subjective process**, highlighting the need for further automation to fully harness its potential.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Scaling InversionView to larger models and datasets** is crucial, requiring efficient methods for handling high-dimensional activation spaces and potentially more sophisticated decoder architectures.  **Automating the interpretation process** further, perhaps by leveraging large language models to analyze the generated samples and formulate hypotheses, would significantly increase efficiency and scalability.  Investigating the **applicability of InversionView across different neural network architectures and modalities**, such as vision and audio, would broaden its impact and reveal potential insights into how information is processed in various contexts.  A deeper exploration of **the relationship between InversionView and other interpretability methods**, such as causal intervention and activation patching, may lead to more powerful and comprehensive techniques. Lastly,  investigating how different **distance metrics and threshold selection techniques** influence the results and exploring optimal choices for different scenarios and model types would be valuable.

B and E denote beginning and end of sequence tokens. The query activation conditions the decoder to generate samples capturing its information content. We show non-cherrypicked samples inside and outside the e-preimage (‚Ç¨ = 0.1) at three activation sites on the same query input. Distance for each sample is calculated between activations corresponding to the parenthesized characters in the query input and the sample. 'True count' indicates the correct count of the target character in the samples (decoder may generate incorrect counts). (a) MLP layer amplifies count information. Comparing the distances before (left) and after (right) the MLP, we see that samples with diverging counts become much more distant from the query activation. (b) In the next layer (':' exclusively attends to target character ‚Äì copying information from residual stream of target character to the residual stream of ':'), the count is retained but the identity of the target character is no longer encoded ('c', 'm', etc. instead of 'g'), as it is no longer relevant for the predicting the count. Therefore, observing the generations informs us of the activations' content and how it changes across activation sites.

We can see patching ate accounts for the whole effect, and when a¬ø¬∫ is already patched, patching a1,0 has almost no effect. Bottom: On the other hand, if we patch cumulatively from right to left, a1,0 accounts for the whole effect while patching a has no effect if a¬π,0 has been patched. So we verified that a1,0 solely relies on ate a and this path is the one by which the model performs precise counting. The patching effect is averaged across the whole test set. (b) IOI.

> Figure 11: Addition Task: Exhaustive verification of the decoder's completeness for 8 random query activation. Failure of completeness would mean that some inputs result in an activation very close to the query activation but nonetheless are assigned very small probability. Here, we show that this does not happen, by verifying that all inputs within the e-preimage are assigned higher probability by the decoder than most other inputs. We also show that by increasing the temperature and adding random noise, we can increase the probability of inputs near the boundary of e-preimage. Each sub-figure ‚Äì (a), (b), (c) ‚Äì contains 8 scatter plots, each of which contains 810000 dots representing all input sequences in the 3-digit addition task. The y-axis of scatter plots is the log-probability of the input sequence given by the decoder (which reads the query activation), the x-axis is the distance between the query input and the input sequence. As before, distance is measured by the normalized Euclidean distance between the query activation (the activation site, query input, and selected position are shown in the scatter plot title) and the most similar activation along the sequence axis. In addition, the red vertical line represents the threshold e, which is 0.1 in the case study. (a) Temperature —Ç = 1.0, no noise is added. (b) Temperature r = 2.0, no noise is added.

> Figure 5: InversionView applied to 3-digit addition: Visually inspecting sample inputs inside and outside the e-preimage of the query allows us to understand what information is contained in an activation. The color on each token in generated samples denotes the difference in the token's likelihood between a conditional or unconditional decoder (Appendix G). The shade thus denotes how much the generation of the token is caused by the query activation (darker shade means a stronger dependence). In (a‚Äìc), the colored tokens are most relevant to the interpretation. We interpret two attention heads (a, b) and the output of the corresponding residual stream after attention (c). In (a), what's common throughout the e-preimage is that the digits in the hundreds places are 6 and 8. Inputs outside the e-preimage don't have this property. In (b), what's common is that the digits in tens places are 1, 6, or numerically close. Hence, we can infer that the activation sites a0,0 and a0,3 encode hundreds and tens place in the input operands respectively; the latter is needed to provide carry to A1. Also, the samples show that the activations encode commutativity since the digits at hundreds and tens place are swapped between the two operands. In (c), the output of the attention layer after residual connection combining information from the sites in (a) and (b) encodes ‚Äú6‚Äù and ‚Äú8‚Äù in hundreds place, and the carry from tens place. Note that a0,1 and a0,2 contains similar information as a0,0. These observations are confirmed across inputs. Taken together, InversionView reveals how information is aggregated and passed on by different model components.

In (a), what's common throughout the e-preimage is that the digits in the hundreds places are 6 and 8. Inputs outside the e-preimage don't have this property. In (b), what's common is that the digits in tens places are 1, 6, or numerically close. Hence, we can infer that the activation sites a0,0 and a0,3 encode hundreds and tens place in the input operands respectively; the latter is needed to provide carry to A1. Also, the samples show that the activations encode commutativity since the digits at hundreds and tens place are swapped between the two operands. In (c), the output of the attention layer after residual connection combining information from the sites in (a) and (b) encodes ‚Äú6‚Äù and ‚Äú8‚Äù in hundreds place, and the carry from tens place. Note that a0,1 and a0,2 contains similar information as a0,0. These observations are confirmed across inputs. Taken together, InversionView reveals how information is aggregated and passed on by different model components.

The diagrams illustrate how information is processed and routed through the network. The color-coding represents the type of information being passed, while alternating colors signify a combination of information types. The flow is depicted from left to right, simulating the model's processing, and from bottom to top within each diagram. This is an approximation based on qualitative analysis using InversionView and attention patterns; consistently occurring paths are retained, but less frequent paths are omitted for clarity.

The computation is done from left to right (or simultaneously during training), and from bottom to top in each sub-figure. Note that the figure represents what information we find in activation, rather than the information being used by the model. Also note that the graphs are based on our qualitative examination using InversionView and attention pattern, and are an approximate representation of reality. We keep those stable paths that almost always occur. Inconsistently present paths such as routing the ones place when predicting A1 are not shown.

The table highlights the limitations of DLA for interpretability in cases where information is indirectly contributing to the final prediction.

> Table 4: Applying DLA to the heads in IOI circuit. Except the first row, all heads do not directly connect to final output according to the IOI circuit, the results show DLA cannot decode their information. We do not include those heads in which only position information is encoded. 'Top 30 promoted (suppressed) rate' means the fraction of input examples where the expected name (IO name for the first row, S name for other rows) is inside the top 30 tokens promoted (suppressed) by the head's output. 'Top 30 promoted (suppressed) & 1st name rate' means the expected name is not only inside the top 30 promoted (suppressed) tokens, but also the most promoted (suppressed) name among a list of common and single-token names, so it does not count when another name is ranked higher. Note that a name can be associated with two tokens (with and without a space before it), when calculating the rate, either of them satisfying the condition will count. The rate is calculated over 1000 random IOI examples. As we can see, except for the first row, the expected name is not observable most of the time.

> üîº This table presents the results of applying Direct Logit Attribution (DLA) to the attention heads in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) circuit of a GPT-2 small model.  It compares the ability of DLA to identify the expected indirect object (IO) name against the findings from the InversionView method presented in the paper. The table shows that DLA struggles to decode information from most attention heads that don't directly affect the final output, highlighting a limitation of the DLA approach compared to InversionView.

> üîº This table summarizes the qualitative results of applying InversionView to the IOI (Indirect Object Identification) circuit in GPT-2 small.  It compares the findings of Wang et al. [54] with those of the current paper, showing the function, observed behavior, position, and consistency of each attention head in the circuit.  Key differences in interpretation between the two studies are highlighted in bold.

> Table 2: Column ‚ÄúPosition‚Äù means the query activation is taken from that position. ‚ÄúS1+1‚Äù means the token right after S1. Rows are ordered according to the narration in the original paper. When we say ‚ÄúS name‚Äù, it means the the name of S in the query input, but the name is not necessarily S in the samples. This also applies to ‚ÄúIO name‚Äù. The information learned by InversionView which is different from the information suggested by Wang et al. [54] is in bold.

> üîº This table summarizes the findings from the InversionView analysis across different activation sites and positions for a 3-digit addition task. For each activation site and position, it describes what information is present in the activations, whether the information is precise or fuzzy, and how the information changes across layers. The table also notes cases where the information is similar between different sites and positions, indicating consistent representation.

> üîº This table summarizes the information discovered by InversionView for each activation site (e.g., a0,0, a1,0, etc.) and position in the 3-digit addition task. For each activation site and position, it lists the information that is consistently present in the e-preimage (the set of inputs giving rise to similar activations). This information may include specific digits from the operands (F1, F2, F3, S1, S2, S3), carries (C2, C3), and digits in the answer (A1, A2, A3, A4).  The table also notes when there are no significant patterns or when the information varies substantially across different inputs.

> üîº This table presents the results of applying Direct Logit Attribution (DLA) to various attention heads in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) circuit within the GPT-2 small model.  The table highlights the limitations of DLA in cases where model components do not directly influence the final output. For each attention head, it reports the percentage of times the expected name (IO or subject) appears within the top 30 promoted or suppressed tokens, illustrating the difficulty of accurately interpreting these components using DLA alone.
