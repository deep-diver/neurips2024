Existing methods for interpreting neural activations have limitations in scope and often require researchers to predefine what information to extract. This is where **InversionView shines**.  It addresses these challenges by focusing on the pre-image of activations, i.e., the inputs that yield similar activation patterns. By sampling from the pre-image, this method allows researchers to directly infer the information encoded by each activation vector.\n\nInversionView is applied to several case studies, including character counting, indirect object identification, and 3-digit addition, using various models from small transformers to GPT-2. Results show that InversionView effectively reveals valuable information in activations, **confirming the decoded information via causal intervention**.  It successfully uncovers both basic and complex information like token identity, position, counts, and abstract knowledge. This generalized approach significantly improves the interpretability of neural networks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their decision-making processes and advancing AI safety research.", "affiliation": "Saarland University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "clDGHpx2la/podcast.wav"}
