Despite recent advances, existing methods fail to capture important domain-specific knowledge, while also ignoring differences in data distribution across different domains. This leads to a large performance gap between efficient universal solutions and expensive approaches utilising a collection of specialist models, one for each domain. In this work, we make significant strides towards closing this gap, by introducing a new learning technique, dubbed UDON (Universal Dynamic Online distillatioN). UDON employs multi-teacher distillation, where each teacher is specialized in one domain, to transfer detailed domainspecific knowledge into the student universal embedding. UDON\u2019s distillation approach is not only effective, but also very efficient, by sharing most model parameters between the student and all teachers, where all models are jointly trained in an online manner. UDON also comprises a sampling technique which adapts the training process to dynamically allocate batches to domains which are learned slower and require more frequent processing. This boosts significantly the learning of complex domains which are characterised by a large number of classes and longtail distributions. With comprehensive experiments, we validate each component of UDON, and showcase significant improvements over the state of the art in the recent UnED benchmark.

Such a product is the ultimate goal of fine-grained and instance-level visual recognition. The key component enabling such an application is a general-purpose image representation, or equivalently image embedding, designed to handle imagery of varied domains at scale. Traditionally, image embedding models have been developed for specific domains separately [29, 34, 17, 9], such as landmarks [32], products [41], clothes [22], faces [40], to name just a few. However, as visual recognition applications grow in popularity and scope [47, 1, 2], it is impractical to handle images of different object types with specialized, per-domain models. A potential solution for this problem is to leverage recent foundation models, such as CLIP [33] or DINOv2 [26], which have been proposed to enable a wide variety of multimodal applications. Even though these models possess a broad visual understanding, they tend to lack detailed fine-grained knowledge off-the-shelf [45], which is critical in practice. For this reason, recent efforts aim at developing universal embedding solutions that can generalize to handle multiple fine-grained object types with a single model [45, 39], ensuring scalability in real-world scenarios.

To overcome this issue, a naive multi-teacher distillation approach (middle) first trains one specialized teacher per domain (with a classification loss) to capture domain specifics, then distils them to the universal embedding (student). Our proposed Universal Dynamic Online distillatioN \u2013 UDON (right) jointly trains the specialized teacher embeddings and the universal embedding (student) with classification and, at the same time, distills the teacher embeddings to the universal embedding.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "There are two main challenges in training such universal models addressed in the paper. First, it is difficult to encode detailed knowledge about many image domains in a single model. In several cases, features that are helpful for one object type may be useless for others. One example is the importance of color: while for food recognition it is critical to discriminate red curry from green curry, when recognizing car models both a red and a green Toyota Corolla LE 2024 would belong to the same class. This makes the training of universal models from data of different domains particularly hard, since the data may present confilcting peculiarities across domains, leading to sub-optimal learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, where one teacher model is trained for each domain individually, and a student universal embedding model learns from the collection of teachers. This setup allows the specialized teachers to capture domain-specific knowledge, which is then transferred into the universal embedding. However, if this distillation setup is deployed naively, one may incur substantial costs, as a separate teacher model would need to be trained for each domain. For this reason, we propose to share the backbone between all teachers and the universal student, reaching a solution that achieves high performance and incurs small additional training costs, as all models are jointly trained in an online manner \u2013 see Figure 1. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second main challenge we highlight is that different domains may present data with vastly different distributions: e.g., while one domain may present a moderate number of classes with a roughly balanced number of samples, in others, the number of classes may be very large, and the distribution of samples long-tailed. This means that different domains may require different training curricula for a model to properly learn their characteristics. This leads us to propose a sampling technique that dynamically selects which domains will be processed at each point in the learning process based on the losses measured on the fly. With this method, we demonstrate significant improvements to the performance of the most challenging domains, which are learned slower and require more frequent processing compared to other domains.

(1) We leverage knowledge distillation to infuse the universal embedding model with the learnings of specialist, perdomain teacher models. In our novel training setup, the model backbone for all teacher embeddings and the student universal embedding is shared, leading to an efficient method where all models are jointly trained in an online manner. Our findings show that sharing the backbone facilitates the distillation process significantly, even reaching performance that surpasses the distillation from separate specialist teachers. (2) To enable an appropriate training regime in a universal embedding setup, we propose to adapt the learning process dynamically, adjusting the sampling of image domains based on their losses, which appears suitable to visual knowledge spanning a range of fine-grained domains. We show that this can help substantially with more complex domains that require more frequent model updates to enhance their performance. (3) We perform comprehensive experiments on the recent UnED [45] dataset, that highlight the value of each proposed component, as well as compare our technique against competitor approaches.

Initially proposed to transfer the knowledge of large and complex models to smaller and faster ones [14], standard KD trains a light student to mimic the softmax outputs produced by a heavy teacher. Tailoring KD to representation learning, [27, 28] distill relations between image representations and [19] focus on retrieval rankings. Online KD [12] lifts the need for separate two-stage training for the teacher and the student and trains them simultaneously. Multiteacher KD [20, 15] aims to transfer the knowledge of multiple teachers into one student model. [24] performs multi-teacher KD for a single domain visual retrieval, by aggregating the teacher relations in a single target that the student should mimic. Differently than [15], which proposes an online multiteacher distillation approach that trains a different backbone for each teacher, we propose to share a common backbone between all the teachers and the student, showing improved performance while also being much more efficient. [50] combines online and multi-teacher knowledge distillation in a single multi-branch network, training an ensemble of teachers on the fly. Differently from [50, 24], each of the teachers in our KD approach is specialized to only a fraction of the data (a single domain), being relevant only to part of the universal embedding task. Similarly to [50], we also create an online multi-branch architecture, however the teachers are not updated by the other teachers\u2019 knowledge, as they are related to different visual domains. Additionally, our teachers transfer relational knowledge to the student, since our focus is on learning image embeddings, in contrast to [50] which only focuses on classification. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Universal representation learning. Learning a representation that generalizes and can be reused efficiently across visual domains is a long-standing goal in computer vision. [4] introduces domainspecific normalization to make classification networks generalize to multiple visual domains, while [35] introduces adapter modules to improve the accuracy of domain-specific representations. [23] proposes a multi-task vision and language universal representation trained on 12 different datasets. However, this body of work assumes knowledge of the test time domain, which does not hold in our setup. Recent large visual foundational models [26, 33] that are trained on large amounts of data with diverse objectives show great zero-shot performance on a number of downstream visual tasks, making them great candidates for universal embedding applications. However, [45] shows that these models, even though generalizing to many diverse domains, cannot effectively handle instance-level and fine-grained domains (which are the focus of this work) without further fine-tuning. [37] shows that appending an MLP projector between the objective and the representation used for the downstream tasks improves the generalisability of the representation, inspiring a multi-domain variant we use as a baseline in this work. In [3], a multi-domain representation for fine-grained retrieval is learned, which utilizes no labels for training. Differently from it, we focus on the supervised task setup of [45], which constitutes a much larger-scale problem that additionally includes instance-level domains. [20] introduces distillation as a way to learn universal representations, while [10] tailors multi-teacher distillation to universal embedding learning. Differently from [20, 10], we do not use task-specific backbones that are costly to scale across a large number of domains. While [10] tackles a universal embedding setup, the effectiveness of their method is only assessed on a small dataset, where three small domains at a time are distilled into a universal representation. In contrast, we tackle learning in a more practical large-scale setup, with an efficient approach that distills knowledge from eight diverse visual domains into the universal embedding. Recently, the UnED dataset was introduced in [45] as a new large-scale benchmark for universal embeddings. Their experiments considered the training of models only via classification objective, with different sampling and classifier configurations. Setting our approach apart is that we go beyond to capture detailed knowledge from diverse domains via distillation, besides proposing a more suitable training dynamic that can accommodate data from diverse domains. Concurrently, UNIC [38] proposes a universal classification model using multi-teacher distillation. While our approach trains a student embedding from multiple teachers specialized in fine-grained visual domains, UNIC distills foundational models trained for diverse tasks, such as semantic segmentation and classification, with both supervised and self-supervised objectives.

This approach is costly with an increasing number of domains in hand, as one model for each domain needs to be trained, which inspires us to discover more efficient sampling strategies. [23] proposes Dynamic Stop-and-Go sampling, which updates the sampling weight of each domain based on the validation set accuracy. Differently from them, we propose to calculate the sampling weights only based on training loss, which doesn\u2019t require the expensive feature extraction of the validation set but can happen on the fly.

The proposed training approach is shown to deliver high efficacy distillation, in which the universal student performs even better than distilling from separate fixed teachers.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
