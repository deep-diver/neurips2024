{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on **bandit algorithms with delayed feedback**, a common challenge in various real-world applications. It offers a novel solution to improve the robustness and efficiency of these algorithms, thus opening new avenues for practical applications and further research in online learning. The **best-of-both-worlds** approach is particularly relevant, offering improved performance across stochastic and adversarial settings. It addresses critical limitations in existing research, focusing on dealing with **outliers and excessive delays**. The findings of this study are important for advancing our understanding and solutions for the class of online learning problems.", "summary": "New best-of-both-worlds bandit algorithm tolerates arbitrary excessive delays, overcoming limitations of prior work that required prior knowledge of maximal delay and suffered linear regret dependence on it.", "takeaways": ["A novel best-of-both-worlds algorithm for bandits with variably delayed feedback that is robust to delay outliers.", "An efficient technique to control distribution drift under highly varying delays.", "An implicit exploration scheme that works in best-of-both-worlds setting."], "tldr": "Many real-world applications involve online decision-making where feedback is delayed and occasionally very late.  Existing bandit algorithms often struggle in these scenarios, especially when dealing with unpredictable delays and outliers.  Moreover, these algorithms frequently require prior knowledge of the maximal delay, making them less practical.  This creates a need for algorithms that work well across a broad range of delay patterns and are robust to outliers. \nThis paper introduces a new algorithm that addresses these issues. It is designed to work well regardless of whether the underlying loss generating process is stochastic or adversarial\u2014what's called a \"best-of-both-worlds\" approach.  This is achieved through three key innovations:  a novel implicit exploration scheme, a method for controlling distribution drift without assuming bounded delays, and a procedure that links the standard regret to the regret calculated with the delayed and potentially skipped observations. The resulting algorithm offers significant improvements in terms of robustness and performance compared to previous methods.", "affiliation": "Churney ApS", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LDzrQB4X5w/podcast.wav"}
