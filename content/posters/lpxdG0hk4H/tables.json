The comparison uses several metrics to evaluate the performance, including SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) and PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for image quality, FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance) for video quality and temporal consistency, and three separate metrics (Lbody, Lface, Lhand) for the accuracy of body, face and hand motion respectively.

The metrics used are FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance), Lface (mean Euclidean distance between face keypoints), and Lhand (mean Euclidean distance between hand keypoints). Removing the Key Point-based Fine-grained Hand Modeling module (HM) increases the FVD and Lhand.  Removing the Face Recapture module (FR) increases Lface.  Omitting the two-stage training significantly increases the FVD. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in improving the overall performance of the model.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "lpxdG0hk4H/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results of our approach compared with SOTAs.
