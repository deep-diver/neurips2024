We leverage dual-stream diffusion models as the backbone of our framework and carefully design two novel components for crucial local regions (i.e., hands and face) that can be easily integrated into our backbone.

Though most of them focus on the head region, few studies [15, 17, 32, 21, 33, 49, 35, 40, 23] attempt to generate full-body videos by animating a reference image with a sequence of driving motion signals via a warping paradigm, but their results fall short in terms of both generation quality and temporal consistency. However, the demand for creating high-fidelity 2D avatars under more challenging conversational scenarios (e.g., TV shows and stand-up comedy) is increasing rapidly, which cannot be fulfilled with such a fidelity state. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Recently, efforts have been made to investigate architectures built upon pre-trained diffusion models for controllable human body animation [1, 12, 42]. These methods adopt a dual-stream design to separately model the textural information from the reference image and the motion information from dynamic 2D skeletons [45] or 3D reconstructions [26, 50]. Effective interaction is also achieved between the two streams via widely used cross-attention [37]. Despite their captivating performance in full-body animation, we identify three major challenges that require rethinking. a) Creating a human-like conversational avatar requires a holistic synthesis of the human body. Though concurrent studies [16, 51] leverage 3D body reconstruction, which contains rich depth and shape information in face and hand regions, it suffers from occasional incorrect pose estimation for hands or temporal jittering problems. In addition, tedious pre-processing and time-consuming per-frame optimization [46] are required, which cannot be applied in a user-friendly system. We find using 2D representations more stable and efficient. b) It is quite intricate to generate human hands with sparse representations. Human hand regions occupy only a limited number of pixels in the original video frame. This easily leads to unstable hand synthesis with blurry texture or incorrect shape. Naive designs in [1, 12] cannot achieve detailed texture synthesis and delicate control in such local regions (e.g., faces and hands). c) Facial identity preservation is another problem that has not been well investigated. It becomes particularly challenging for these previous works [1, 12] due to the strong entanglement between identity information and 2D driving signals, which inevitably leads to identity degradation during cross-identity animation. The recent study [16] attempts to involve more controllable signals (i.e., 3D morphing parameters) for face enhancement, but the identity preservation performance is still not satisfying enough.

We first introduce a novel Key Point-based Fine-grained Hand Modeling module to reliably recover hand regions in detail from sparse driving guidance. Our key insight is to leverage resolution-independent representations (i.e., the coordinates of the hand key points) to provide stable structure guidance. In terms of hand texture, we novelly design a key point-based hand texture codebook equipped with a set of learnable basis vectors, which has a one-to-one correspondence with the hand key point topology. Specifically, we predict a set of weights from the hand key points of each hand and produce key point-based hand textural compensation through the weighted combination, which can be directly injected into the diffusion process via cross-attention. Furthermore, to improve the facial region quality of the target subject, we propose a Face Recapture module to construct comprehensive face representations by performing structure encoding, texture encoding, and identity encoding simultaneously. This multi-level encoding strategy can significantly alleviate the identity leakage issue during cross-identity animation on 2D avatars, which is not available in other comparative methods.

The goal of talking head synthesis is to generate realistic face videos based on a driving video or audio. Depending on the driving signal, talking head synthesis can be divided into video-driven methods and audio-driven methods. Video-driven methods [11, 48, 3, 30, 4, 43] aim to establish the mapping between the reference face and the driving head motion, such as head/mouth movements, expressions, etc. For instance, DaGAN [11] learns to face depth maps and 3D facial geometry in a self-supervised manner to estimate motion fields. While MetaPortrait [48] estimates the warping flow between the driving and reference face through predefined dense facial key points. Audio-driven methods[38, 47, 13, 22, 14, 6, 41] focus on ensuring the generated mouth movements are synchronized with the given audio. For example, Wav2lip [28] edits the mouth area of the face video based on the input audio signal and employs a discriminator to ensure lip-sync. Similarly, StyleSync [6] generates lip-sync face videos by combining audio information with masked facial spatial information in style space.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in human video generation by leveraging powerful diffusion models. Some approaches [39, 18, 42]integrate the reference appearance details with driving information through cross-attention mechanisms in the Denoising U-Net, resulting in enhanced generation quality. The warp-based methods [32, 21, 33, 49, 23, 40] warp the reference image or its features to the driving pose by various estimated flows, such as 2D optical flows, and 3D flow fields. In addition to the aforementioned methods, some efforts [27, 25] employ neural representations of 3D human mesh points in a canonical pose to model human appearance details, thereby achieving multi-view and temporal consistency in human videos. However, these methods primarily focus on appearance consistency and full-body pose accuracy, overlooking the importance of facial details and hand movements for video expressiveness and specific scenario suitability.

The quantitative results of our methods compared with SOTAs are shown in Tab. 1. Our method achieves the best results on SSIM, PSNR, and FID metrics, underscoring its clear advantages on image quality. In addition, our method obtains the best FVD indicating that the temporal consistency of generated videos is superior. Moreover, our approach outperforms others on the motion accuracy metric including $(L_{b o d y})$ , face $(L_{f a c e})$ , and hand $(L_{h a n d})$ which demonstrates the precision of generated poses and gestures. Benefiting from the proposed Key Points-based Fine-grained Hand Modeling module and Face Recapture module, our framework is able to generate accurate hand gestures and high-fidelity facial details. TPS is a general object animation approach and struggles with complex human poses and hand postures, resulting in the poorest overall generation quality. Disco, AnimateAnyone, MagicAnimate and MagicPose focus on generating coarse-grained human poses without fine-grained modeling of hands and faces, leading to lower generation quality, particularly in hand gesture accuracy.

Our method is able to generate accurate gestures and high-quality hand details while other approaches fail to convey complex gestures. In addition, face identity is well-preserved in our results, while other methods lead to unnatural face shapes, textures, and identity. Note that cross-identity driven is more challenging and our method still achieves high-fidelity gesture details and satisfactory image quality as indicated in the right of Fig. 3 and 4. The hand areas of other results are blurry and unrealistic.

In this paper, we propose the framework ShowMaker, which achieves high-fidelity 2D human video synthesis with two novel designs to achieve fine-grained diffusion modeling. We first propose a Key Point-based Fine-grained Hand Modeling module for robust and fine-grained hand synthesis which takes advantage of 2D hand key points and a key point-based codebook. To further reconstruct the facial details and identity information, we introduce a Face Recapture module, which effectively equips the structure information with detailed textural information and global identity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation has indicated the superiority of our framework beyond the existing approaches. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations Despite the success of our framework, we also recognize some limitations during the exploration. Firstly, our Key Point-based Fine-grained Hand Modeling module can robustly manage hand synthesis with occasional incorrect hand gestures. However, DWPose [45] suffers from performance degradation when handling videos with severe motion blur leading to considerable perturbation in the driving signal, which inevitably results in unexpected artifacts in our results. Secondly, our framework produces less satisfactory results when handling challenging cases, such as reflection on glasses. These will be part of our future work. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Broader Impact. Our method focuses on synthesizing realistic 2D avatars with rich facial expressions and complex hand gestures, which is intended for developing digital humans under more daily scenarios like TV shows. However, it may also be misused for some malicious purposes on social media, which leads to negative impacts on the whole society. Therefore, we will make our efforts to strictly oversee the dissemination of our models as well as the resulting content and also restrict access solely to research-oriented demands. We believe that the proper use of this technique will enhance positive societal development in both machine learning research and daily life.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
