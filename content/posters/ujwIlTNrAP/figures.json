We employ backward propagation on camera-LiDAR fusion models with pre-trained backbones to observe the gradient difference (features utilization) between with camera backbone only and with both the camera and LiDAR backbone. Notably, certain pre-trained parameters in the camera backbone are redundant due to the amendment of LiDAR information. It reveals that similar feature extraction exists across modalities, which introduces additional redundancy when camera-LiDAR fusion models directly loads single-modal pre-trained backbones.", "description": "This figure illustrates the redundancy in features extracted by pre-trained single-modality backbones when used in a camera-LiDAR fusion model for 3D object detection.  By comparing the gradients during backpropagation with only the camera branch active versus both camera and LiDAR branches active, the authors show that some camera backbone parameters become redundant when LiDAR information is added. This is because both modalities extract similar features, leading to duplicated information in the fusion model.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ujwIlTNrAP/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the AlterMOMA : The framework begins with Modality Masking, where one of the backbones is initially masked. This step is followed by Redundancy Reactivation and Importance Evaluation, where the parameter importance scores are initially calculated with AlterEva. Afterward, the models undergo Reinitialization and Alternative Masking of the other backbone, leading to another round of Redundancy Reactivation and Importance Evaluation. When scores of all parameters in backbones are calculated fully with AlterEva (detailed in Section 3.3), models are pruned to remove parameters with low importance scores and then finetuned. Notably, we use black lines to represent parameters of models and red lines to represent reactivated fusion-redundant parameters. The thickness of these lines indicates the contribution of parameters.", "description": "This figure illustrates the workflow of the AlterMOMA framework. It starts by masking one of the backbones (either LiDAR or Camera) and then iteratively reactivates redundant features by training with batches. The importance scores of parameters are updated with the AlterEva function using two indicators: Deactivated Contribution Indicator (DeCI) and Reactivated Redundancy Indicator (ReRI). Finally, parameters with low importance scores are pruned, and the model is fine-tuned.", "section": "3.2 Overview of Alternative Modality Masking Pruning"}, {"figure_path": "ujwIlTNrAP/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Visualization of the reactivated redundant features: The figure illustrates the features of different modalities at each stage of the entire pruning process of AlterMOMA, including LiDAR features, camera features and fused features in the states of original (before masking), reactivated (after reactivation), and pruned (after pruning with AlterMOMA).", "description": "This figure visualizes the features from LiDAR, camera, and their fusion at different stages of the AlterMOMA pruning process.
