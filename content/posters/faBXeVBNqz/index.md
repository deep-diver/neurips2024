### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Predicting the behavior of molecules and materials requires computationally expensive simulations. Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a faster alternative by learning from high-quality data.  However, current MLIPs using spherical tensors are computationally expensive for high-rank tensors.  Existing Cartesian tensor-based methods lack flexibility and expressive power. 

This research introduces a novel approach using higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors within message-passing neural networks.  The researchers demonstrate that this method provides comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art spherical and Cartesian models, offering a more flexible and efficient way to represent atomic systems.  The method's equivariance and traceless properties are mathematically proven, enhancing its reliability.  Experiments show improved results across several benchmark datasets, indicating the method's effectiveness.

> Figure 1: Schematic illustration of (a) the construction of an irreducible Cartesian tensor for a local atomic environment and (b) the tensor product of two irreducible Cartesian tensors of rank l‚ÇÅ and l‚ÇÇ. The construction of an irreducible Cartesian tensor from a unit vector √Æ is defined in Eq. (1). In this work, we use tensors with the same rank n and weight l, i.e., n = l, avoiding the need for embedding tensors with l < n in a higher-dimensional tensor space. Therefore, we use l to identify the rank and the weight of an irreducible Cartesian tensor. The tensor product is defined in Eqs. (2) and (3), resulting in a new tensor Tl3 = (Tl‚ÇÅ Cart T12) 13 of rank l3 = {|l‚ÇÅ - l‚ÇÇ|,¬∑¬∑¬∑ ,l‚ÇÅ + l‚ÇÇ}. Transparent boxes denote the linearly dependent elements of symmetric and traceless tensors. The tensor product can be even or odd, defined by l‚ÇÅ + l‚ÇÇ - l3.

### In-depth insights


#### Equivariant MPNNs
Equivariant message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) represent a significant advancement in geometric deep learning, particularly within the context of atomistic simulations.  **Equivariance** is a crucial property, ensuring that the model's output transforms predictably under certain group actions (e.g., rotations, translations, reflections) applied to the input data. This **inductive bias** greatly improves efficiency and accuracy by reducing the amount of training data needed and enhancing generalizability.  In the field of atomistic simulations, equivariant MPNNs leverage this to encode the crucial directional information inherent in molecular structures, leading to more physically meaningful representations.  **Spherical harmonics** have been popularly used, but **Cartesian tensors** offer a compelling alternative with potentially improved computational efficiency and flexibility, especially for higher-rank tensors, as explored in the provided research. The choice between these representations involves a trade-off between computational cost and representational power, highlighting an active area of research in developing efficient and accurate equivariant MPNNs for complex systems.

#### Cartesian tensors
The concept of Cartesian tensors, as described in the paper, offers a compelling alternative to spherical tensors for representing atomic systems in machine-learned interatomic potentials.  Unlike spherical tensors, which necessitate defining a specific rotational axis and complex numerical coefficients (Wigner 3j symbols) when computing tensor products, **Cartesian tensors inherently lack this directional bias and their products simplify calculations.** The paper particularly emphasizes higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors, proving their equivariance and traceless property within message-passing neural networks. This approach enhances flexibility by overcoming limitations in current Cartesian models, where message-passing mechanisms were restricted.  **The key advantage lies in the computationally efficient construction of many-body features** due to the simpler nature of the tensor products. The integration of irreducible Cartesian tensors enables on-par or superior performance in various benchmark datasets, demonstrating the potential for more efficient and accurate atomistic simulations.

#### Tensor products
The concept of tensor products is crucial for constructing equivariant neural networks, particularly in the context of message-passing models for atomistic simulations.  The paper explores the use of **higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors**, which offer advantages over spherical tensors in terms of computational efficiency and flexibility. **Irreducible Cartesian tensors** avoid the need for defining a preferential axis, simplifying calculations.  However, the process of constructing tensor products is **computationally demanding**, even with Cartesian tensors, especially as the rank increases. The authors demonstrate how **irreducible Cartesian tensor products** can be constructed efficiently to create higher-order features for many-body interactions, proving both **equivariance** and the **traceless property** of the resulting layers.  This addresses a key limitation in existing Cartesian models by enabling the efficient construction of more expressive architectures. The computational cost-effectiveness is particularly relevant for high-rank tensors where methods using spherical tensors become significantly more expensive.  Ultimately, these advancements improve the accuracy and scalability of machine-learned interatomic potentials.

#### Computational cost
The research paper analyzes computational costs associated with different methods for constructing machine-learned interatomic potentials.  **Spherical harmonics-based models**, while often exhibiting superior performance, incur high costs due to complicated numerical coefficients and tensor products requiring Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. In contrast, **Cartesian tensor-based models** offer a promising alternative but have lacked flexibility.  The study introduces higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors which offer a potential for significant cost reduction in specific scenarios, mainly for lower tensor ranks. While the irreducible Cartesian tensor product avoids the expensive Clebsch-Gordan coefficient calculation, it's noted that for very high tensor ranks, spherical approaches may remain more computationally efficient.  **The paper highlights a trade-off** between computational cost and model expressiveness, emphasizing that choosing the optimal representation depends on the balance between accuracy requirements and computational resources.

#### Future work
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the framework to handle more complex chemical systems** such as those involving long-range interactions or diverse bonding environments is a crucial next step.  Investigating the **application of irreducible Cartesian tensors to other graph-based machine learning tasks** beyond atomistic simulations would also broaden the impact.  This could involve exploring different message-passing schemes or combining irreducible Cartesian tensors with other advanced neural network architectures to improve efficiency and accuracy.  Furthermore, a **more thorough theoretical analysis of the computational complexity** of the proposed methods, potentially identifying approximations that can reduce runtime without sacrificing accuracy, is needed.  Finally, **systematic comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods** on a wider range of benchmark datasets would strengthen the conclusions and demonstrate the robustness of the approach.

It demonstrates the scaling behavior of both models with increasing tensor rank and correlation order, highlighting the computational advantages of ICTP, particularly for higher-order correlations.

We used eight feature channels to allow experiments with larger v values. MACE models use intermediate tensors with l > lmax for their product basis, which we fixed to l = lmax. Otherwise, pre-computing generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for v > 4 would require more than 2 TB of RAM. For ICTP, we used the full product basis to compute the same number of v-fold tensor products as in MACE.
