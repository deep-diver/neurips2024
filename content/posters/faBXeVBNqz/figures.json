[{"figure_path": "faBXeVBNqz/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Schematic illustration of (a) the construction of an irreducible Cartesian tensor for a local atomic environment and (b) the tensor product of two irreducible Cartesian tensors of rank l\u2081 and l\u2082. The construction of an irreducible Cartesian tensor from a unit vector \u00ee is defined in Eq. (1). In this work, we use tensors with the same rank n and weight l, i.e., n = l, avoiding the need for embedding tensors with l < n in a higher-dimensional tensor space. Therefore, we use l to identify the rank and the weight of an irreducible Cartesian tensor. The tensor product is defined in Eqs. (2) and (3), resulting in a new tensor Tl3 = (Tl\u2081 Cart T12) 13 of rank l3 = {|l\u2081 - l\u2082|,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,l\u2081 + l\u2082}. Transparent boxes denote the linearly dependent elements of symmetric and traceless tensors. The tensor product can be even or odd, defined by l\u2081 + l\u2082 - l3.", "description": "This figure schematically illustrates the construction of irreducible Cartesian tensors and their products. (a) shows how to build a rank-l irreducible Cartesian tensor from a unit vector. (b) demonstrates the tensor product of two irreducible Cartesian tensors, resulting in a new tensor of rank l3 which can be even or odd depending on l\u2081 + l\u2082 - l3.

All results are obtained for the 3BPA data set and lmax = L. We used eight feature channels to allow experiments with larger v values. MACE models use intermediate tensors with l > lmax for their product basis, which we fixed to l = lmax. Otherwise, pre-computing generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for v > 4 would require more than 2 TB of RAM. For ICTP, we used the full product basis to compute the same number of v-fold tensor products as in MACE.", "description": "This figure compares the inference time and GPU memory consumption of Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Potentials (ICTP) and MACE models as a function of tensor rank (L) and correlation order (v) for the 3BPA dataset.  It demonstrates the scaling behavior of both models with increasing tensor rank and correlation order, highlighting the computational advantages of ICTP, particularly for higher-order correlations. The figure also emphasizes the memory limitations of the MACE approach when working with higher-order tensors due to the computationally expensive Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.", "section": "Experiments and results"}, {"figure_path": "faBXeVBNqz/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Potential energy profiles for three cuts through the 3BPA molecule's potential energy surface.
