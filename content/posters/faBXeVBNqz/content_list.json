Conventionally, computational chemistry and materials science rely on ab initio or first-principles approaches\u2014e.g., coupled cluster [9\u201311] or density functional theory (DFT) [12, 13], respectively\u2014that are accurate but computationally demanding, thus limiting the accessible simulation time and system sizes. However, the ability to generate high-quality, first-principles-based data sets has prompted the development of machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). These potentials enable atomistic simulations with accuracy that is on par with the reference first-principles method but at a fraction of the computational cost. Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) [14\u201321] have been employed in chemical and materials sciences, including the development of MLIPs, due to their efficient processing of the graph representation of the atomic system [22\u201326]. Achieving the desired MLIPs\u2019 performance, however, requires the inclusion of inductive biases, like the invariance of total energy to translations, reflections, and rotations in the three-dimensional space, and an effective encoding of the atomic system into a learnable representation [27]. Designing equivariant MPNNs [25, 26, 28\u201336], which preserve the directional information of the local atomic environment, has been one of the most active research directions of the last years. Previous work often achieves equivariance by representing an atomic system as a graph, with node features expressed in spherical harmonics basis or using lower-rank Cartesian tensors and designing ad-hoc message-passing layers [25, 28\u201337].

Spherical tensors, however, require the definition of a particular rotational axis, often chosen as the $z$ -axis, resulting in inherent bias [38]. Furthermore, coupling spherical tensors via tensor products, involved in designing equivariant convolutions and constructing many-body features [33, 39, 40], requires the definition of complicated numerical coefficients, e.g., Wigner 3- $\\cdot\\,j$ symbols defined in terms of the Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients [41], and can be computationally demanding. In contrast, irreducible Cartesian tensors have no preferential directions; their tensor products are simpler and have a better computational complexity\u2014up to a certain tensor rank\u2014than the tensor products of spherical tensors [38, 42\u201345]. Recent work improved results of Cartesian MPNNs by using rank-two tensors and decomposing them into irreducible representations of the three-dimensional rotation group [30], i.e., into representations of dimension 1 (trace), 3 (anti-symmetric part), and 5 (traceless symmetric part) [46].
