Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a faster alternative by learning from high-quality data.  However, current MLIPs using spherical tensors are computationally expensive for high-rank tensors.  Existing Cartesian tensor-based methods lack flexibility and expressive power. \nThis research introduces a novel approach using higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors within message-passing neural networks.  The researchers demonstrate that this method provides comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art spherical and Cartesian models, offering a more flexible and efficient way to represent atomic systems.  The method's equivariance and traceless properties are mathematically proven, enhancing its reliability.  Experiments show improved results across several benchmark datasets, indicating the method's effectiveness.", "affiliation": "NEC Laboratories Europe", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "faBXeVBNqz/podcast.wav"}
