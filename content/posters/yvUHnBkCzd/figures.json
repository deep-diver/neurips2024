The cumulative regret is a measure of how much worse the algorithm's predictions are compared to the best possible model in hindsight. Lower cumulative regret indicates better performance.  The plot visually compares the performance of Fed-POE against baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing regret.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "yvUHnBkCzd/figures/figures_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Cumulative regret over time on CIFAR-10 and WEC datasets.", "description": "This figure shows the average cumulative regret over time for different federated learning algorithms on CIFAR-10 and WEC datasets.  The x-axis represents the time steps, and the y-axis represents the average cumulative regret.  The algorithms compared include Local (local model training), Ditto, Fed-Rep, Fed-OMD, Fed-ALA, Fed-DS, eM-KOFL, POF-MKL and the proposed Fed-POE algorithm. The plots illustrate the performance of each algorithm in terms of minimizing the cumulative prediction loss compared to the best model in hindsight.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
