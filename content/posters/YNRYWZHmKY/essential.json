This is because of the **causal manner of text encoding**, where the meaning of a word is influenced by previously processed words in the sentence, which leads to uneven representation of objects in the prompt. The generated image might favor the first-mentioned object, leaving others incomplete or missing entirely.\nThis paper delves into this problem by analyzing the causal effects of text encoding on image generation.  The authors propose **a new training-free optimization technique** called Text Embedding Balance Optimization (TEBOpt). TEBOpt modifies text embeddings to reduce bias and promote more balanced representation. They also present **a novel evaluation metric** to better measure the presence and accuracy of generated objects. The results of using TEBOpt in various models demonstrate significant improvements in resolving the issue of incomplete or mixed objects, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing the quality of generated images.", "affiliation": "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "YNRYWZHmKY/podcast.wav"}
