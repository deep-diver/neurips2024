Existing pre-training approaches are limited by small-scale data and lack of domain-specific knowledge.  This paper addresses these issues by introducing PowerPM, a foundation model for power systems. \nPowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pre-training framework to capture temporal dependencies and hierarchical relationships within ETS data.  The model consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder, handling exogenous variables and diverse consumption behaviors.  Evaluated on five real-world datasets (private and public), PowerPM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, showing excellent generalization ability.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Smart Cities"}, "podcast_path": "JInTfcxH3Q/podcast.wav"}
