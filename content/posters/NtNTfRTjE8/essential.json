Existing detectors, however, often fail to generalize across diverse image scenes, a problem attributed to 'semantic artifacts' present in both real and synthetic images, causing overfitting in the detection models. These artifacts are image features that the models learn to associate with either real or fake images, but these vary across different datasets and scenes. This limits the generalizability of the models to new scenes and unseen data.\nTo tackle this, the paper introduces a novel approach that addresses this challenge by shuffling image patches before training a patch-based classifier. This method aims to disrupt the global semantic information that contributes to overfitting, allowing the model to learn more localized features and improve its ability to generalize across different scenes. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that this new method significantly outperforms previous approaches in both cross-scene and open-world generalization, highlighting its potential for enhancing AI-generated image detection.", "affiliation": "School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "NtNTfRTjE8/podcast.wav"}
