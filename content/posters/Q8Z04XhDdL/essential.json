Existing MoE architectures are also not optimized for incorporating pre-trained models, limiting their effectiveness. This research addresses these issues by introducing MoE Jetpack.\n\nMoE Jetpack introduces two key innovations: 1) checkpoint recycling, which utilizes pre-trained dense models to initialize MoE models and accelerate convergence; and 2) a novel hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which optimizes the MoE architecture for efficient fine-tuning.  Experiments show that MoE Jetpack significantly speeds up convergence (up to 8x faster) and improves accuracy (up to 30% gains) compared to training MoE models from scratch, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. **The open-sourced code further contributes to the broader accessibility and adoption of MoE models.**", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "Q8Z04XhDdL/podcast.wav"}
