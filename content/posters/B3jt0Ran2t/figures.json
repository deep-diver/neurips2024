Each dataset was perturbed using the Mallows distributions with varying dispersion parameters. The x-axis represents the dispersion parameter (phi), ranging from 0 to 1. The y-axis represents the number of successful experiments out of 100 trials. Each bar represents a different dataset. The figure shows that ESDA successfully computes stable matchings in more than 80% of the cases when the dispersion parameter is at most 0.8. When the dispersion parameter is large, ESDA may only find a stable matching in less than 50% of the cases.", "section": "7 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "B3jt0Ran2t/figures/figures_26_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Results of experiments on real-world data perturbed by the Mallows distributions.", "description": "This figure presents the results of experiments conducted on six real-world datasets, where daycare priorities were perturbed using the Mallows distribution with varying dispersion parameters.  The x-axis represents the dispersion parameter (phi), ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The y-axis shows the number of successful stable matching computations out of 100 trials for each dataset.  The figure aims to demonstrate the effect of the similarity in daycare priorities (represented by the dispersion parameter) on the likelihood of finding a stable matching using the ESDA algorithm.  The data is grouped to show the results for six different real-world daycare scenarios.", "section": "7 Experiments"}]
