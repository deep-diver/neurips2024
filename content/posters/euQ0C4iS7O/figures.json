The images show that the Drifted VESDE sampler produces samples that more closely resemble the original data distribution, especially in terms of capturing the curvature and density of the manifold.", "section": "7 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "euQ0C4iS7O/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Results of 2-D Gaussian", "description": "This figure shows the KL divergence results on a 2D Gaussian distribution for different VESDE forward processes and discretization schemes.  The processes compared include: aggressive drifted VESDE (\u03b2t = t\u00b2, \u03c4 = T\u00b2), conservative drifted VESDE (\u03b2t = t, \u03c4 = T\u00b2), and pure VESDE (\u03c3t\u00b2 = t\u00b2).  Discretization schemes used are Euler-Maruyama (EM) and exponential integrator (EI). The x-axis represents the stepsize, and the y-axis shows the KL divergence.  The results demonstrate that the aggressive drifted VESDE achieves the best performance, followed by the conservative drifted VESDE, indicating a superior balance of errors compared to pure VESDE.", "section": "7.1 The Aggressive Drifted VESDE Balances Errors"}, {"figure_path": "euQ0C4iS7O/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Experiment results of CelebA dataset", "description": "This figure shows the qualitative results of CelebA dataset using pure VESDE and drifted VESDE.
