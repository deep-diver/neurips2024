The settings include two different forward processes (pure VESDE and drift VESDE), two different diffusion times (T = 100 and T = 625), two different reverse processes (reverse SDE and reverse PFODE), and two different synthetic datasets (1-D GMM and Swiss roll). The results show that the drift VESDE generally achieves lower KL divergence compared to the pure VESDE, indicating its effectiveness in improving the generated sample quality.", "section": "G Additional Synthetic Experiments"}]
