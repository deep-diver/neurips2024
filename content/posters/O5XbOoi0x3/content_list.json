To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined timestep segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps.

We quantitatively compare our method with both the baseline and diffusion-based distillation approaches in terms of objective metrics. The evaluation is performed on COCO-5k [15] dataset with both SD15 $(512\\mathrm{px})$ and SDXL $(1024\\mathrm{px})$ architectures. As shown in Tab. 2, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art across all metrics on both resolutions. In particular, compared to the two baseline models, we achieve better aesthetics (including AesScore, ImageReward and PickScore) with only LoRA and fewer steps.

We present comprehensive visual comparison with recent approaches, including LCM [19], TCD [46], PeRFLow [38], Turbo [29] and Lightning [14]. Our observations can be summarized as follows. (1) Thanks to the fact that SDXL has almost 2.6B parameters, the model is able to synthesis decent images in 4 steps after different distillation algorithms. Our method further utilizes its huge model capacity to compress the number of steps required for high-quality outcomes to 1 step only, and far outperforms other methods in terms of style (a), aesthetics (b-c) and image-text matching (d) as indicated in Fig. 4. (2) On the contrary, limited by the capacity of SD15 model, the images generated by other approaches tend to exhibit severe quality degradation. While our Hyper-SD consistently yields better results across different types of user prompts, including photographic (a), realistic (b-c) and artstyles (d) as depicted in Appendix C.1. (3) To further release the potential of our methodology, we also conduct experiments on the fully fine-tuning of SDXL model following previous works [14, 29]. As shown in Appendix C.2, our 1-Step UNet again demonstrates superior generation quality that far exceeds the rest of the opponents. Both in terms of colorization (a-b) and details (c-d), our images are more presentable and attractive when it comes to the real-world application scenarios.

As presented in Fig. 5, our method (red in left) obtains significantly more user preferences than others (blue in right). Specifically, our Hyper-SD15 has achieved more than a two-thirds advantage against the same architectures. The only exception is that SD21-Turbo [22] was able to get significantly closer to our generation quality in one-step inference by means of a larger training dataset of SD21 model as well as fully fine-tuning. Notably, we found that we obtained a higher preference with less inference steps compared to both the baseline SD15 and SDXL models, which once again confirms the validity of our human feedback learning. Moreover, our 1-Step UNet shows a higher preference than LoRA against the same UNet-based approaches (i.e. SDXL-Turbo [29] and SDXL-Lightning [14]), which is also consistent with the analyses of previous quantitative and qualitative comparisons. This demonstrates the excellent scalability of our method when more parameters are fine-tuned.

For completeness, Tab. 4 also presents the quantitative results of different steps when applying the 1-Step unified LoRA. We can observe that there is no difference in image-text matching between different steps as the CLIPScore evaluates, which means that user prompts are well adhered to. And as the other metrics show, the aesthetics rise slightly as the step increases, which is as expected after all the user can choose based on the needs for efficiency.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
