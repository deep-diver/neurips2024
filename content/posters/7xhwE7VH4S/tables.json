The results show a significant improvement in PSNR when appearance attributes are also updated, demonstrating their importance in reconstruction quality.  The table highlights the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and storage size. While updating both attribute types leads to higher PSNR and quality, the added storage cost is also increased.
