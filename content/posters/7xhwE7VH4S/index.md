### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Streaming free-viewpoint videos (FVV) is challenging due to high data requirements and real-time constraints.  Existing methods struggle to balance quality, speed, and efficiency for online transmission. They often impose structural constraints or rely on offline training, limiting their effectiveness for dynamic scenes. 

The proposed QUEEN framework tackles these issues. It uses 3D Gaussian splatting to represent dynamic scenes and learns Gaussian attribute residuals between frames.  A novel quantization-sparsity method efficiently compresses these residuals, significantly reducing storage and bandwidth needs.  The use of viewspace gradient differences speeds up training and improves sparsity learning.  Extensive experimental results demonstrate QUEEN's superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art on various metrics, especially for dynamic scenes.

### In-depth insights


#### Online FVV Encoding
Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) encoding presents a unique set of challenges.  **Real-time constraints** necessitate efficient encoding and decoding methods, demanding fast training and rendering.  Unlike offline methods, online encoding must handle incremental updates to the volumetric representation of the scene as new frames arrive.  This requires **efficient memory management** to avoid excessive resource consumption. A key aspect is the ability to **effectively compress** the video data while maintaining high reconstruction quality.  **Sparsity and quantization** techniques are often employed to achieve compression, potentially involving intelligent identification and coding of dynamic and static regions within the scene. The effectiveness of an online FVV encoding approach is measured by its ability to maintain **high quality** at low latency, with compact representation sizes suitable for transmission across bandwidth-constrained networks.

#### 3D Gaussian Splatting
3D Gaussian splatting is a novel neural rendering technique that leverages the power of Gaussian functions to represent 3D scenes. Unlike traditional voxel-based methods or neural radiance fields, which can be computationally expensive, 3D Gaussian splatting offers a more efficient and scalable approach.  **Key advantages** include its ability to handle complex scenes efficiently and its speed in both training and rendering. By representing the scene as a collection of 3D Gaussian functions, it achieves a compact and high-fidelity representation that can be rendered quickly. This makes it particularly well-suited for applications such as free-viewpoint video streaming, where real-time performance is crucial. The method also demonstrates impressive generalizability, providing high-quality reconstructions for diverse scenes with high dynamic range and detailed geometries.  Furthermore, **the learned nature of 3D Gaussian splatting** allows it to adapt to new scenes or data efficiently, which is particularly useful for online or dynamic scenarios. However, a potential **limitation** could be its sensitivity to quantization, which may require careful strategies to avoid quality degradation, particularly for highly dynamic scenes.

#### Quantization-Sparsity
The concept of "Quantization-Sparsity" in the context of efficient neural representation for streaming free-viewpoint videos is a powerful technique to address the challenges of memory consumption and computational cost.  **Quantization** reduces the precision of numerical values, thus lowering storage requirements.  **Sparsity**, on the other hand, aims to eliminate or reduce the number of non-zero elements.  Combining these two techniques, as proposed, offers a synergistic approach.  By intelligently identifying and quantizing less-significant attributes and sparsifying the most influential ones, the method aims for high compression rates without sacrificing reconstruction quality.  The effectiveness of this approach hinges on accurately identifying the less-important elements, possibly through a learned gating module, and employing efficient compression algorithms. The success of this method is demonstrated by improvements in storage and training/rendering speeds compared to prior methods which highlights its potential for real-time free-viewpoint video streaming applications.

#### Adaptive Training
Adaptive training, in the context of online free-viewpoint video (FVV) encoding, is a crucial technique for efficiently handling dynamic scenes.  It involves **adapting the training process** to focus on the most significant changes in the scene at each time step, rather than processing the entire scene uniformly. This approach is vital because dynamic scenes contain substantial temporal redundancy, with only small portions of the scene changing significantly between consecutive frames. The core idea is to identify and prioritize those changes, thereby reducing computational cost and accelerating convergence. This often involves techniques that **selectively update or compress only the dynamic components**, which enhances efficiency without compromising the quality of the reconstruction.  A key aspect is the utilization of metrics or signals (e.g., viewspace gradient difference) to **distinguish static and dynamic content**. These signals guide the process by determining which elements need to be updated or processed with high precision and which ones can be handled more coarsely. By focusing computational effort on dynamic areas, training time is reduced. The resulting representation is smaller and more memory-efficient for transmission, while preserving high rendering speeds.

#### Future of QUEEN
The future of QUEEN hinges on addressing its current limitations, primarily its reliance on inter-frame residuals for efficiency.  **Extending its capability to handle longer sequences and drastic scene changes** is crucial, potentially through incorporating keyframing techniques to identify and manage significant scene updates.  Moreover, reducing the reliance on multi-view inputs for scene reconstruction is vital, perhaps by leveraging generative video priors or exploring methods for single-view or sparse-view reconstruction.  **Addressing the challenges of topological changes and highly variable appearance is essential**, potentially involving techniques that robustly handle object appearances and disappearances.  Finally, exploring broader applications of the model beyond free-viewpoint video streaming, such as novel view synthesis, and addressing potential societal impacts and safety concerns should be considered in the future development of QUEEN.

It shows how the difference in viewspace gradients between consecutive frames (t and t-1) is used to identify dynamic regions in the scene. A gradient vector is calculated representing the change. A threshold (td) is applied; differences above this threshold are considered dynamic and are used to selectively render only dynamic parts of the scene, improving training efficiency and focusing on the parts of the scene which have changed, ignoring static parts.

'Update All Attributes' shows the results when QUEEN updates all Gaussian attributes (position, scale, rotation, opacity, color) at each frame. This leads to the highest quality reconstruction (PSNR: 33.95 dB).  'Fixed Opacity' shows the results when only position, scale, rotation, and color are updated, while opacity remains fixed across the video.  The reconstruction quality is slightly lower (PSNR: 33.77 dB). 'Fixed Opacity + Color' shows the results when only position and scale and rotation are updated while both opacity and color are fixed. This shows a further drop in reconstruction quality (PSNR: 33.34 dB). The red box highlights a region where the visual differences are most noticeable. The results demonstrate that updating all Gaussian attributes improves visual quality.
