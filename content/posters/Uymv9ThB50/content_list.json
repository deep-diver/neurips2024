By better understanding models\u2019 safety mechanisms and perturbing relevant dimensions in the embeddings, these methods achieve significantly higher ASR on white-box LLMs. However, they cannot be applied to black-box APIs. Moreover, existing methods perturb LLM embeddings based on potentially misleading heuristics (Section 2.3.1).

", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "First, there may be a close relation between linear separability and the safety mechanisms of LLMs. Our previous experiments have shown that 1) aligned LLMs can linearly separate embeddings from malicious and safe instructions at later layers (Figure 1), and that 2) attacks guided by the linear classifier are of high success ratio, indicating that the safety mechanisms of LLMs may be well modeled by linear separability. To better understand their relation, we further attack LLaMA-2-7BChat on the 0th, 10th, 20th, and 30th layers. As shown in Figure 4a, attacks on a linearly separable layer (10, 20, 30) consistently lead to an increase in ASR-keyword, while attacks on the other layer (0) do not improve ASR-keyword. Based on the results, we speculate that for every single layer, linear separability may not only indicate that LLMs understand the safety concept, but may also mean that the LLMs will use this safety concept in subsequent layers for generating responses. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Second, different layers may have modeled the safety mechanisms from related but different perspectives. Figure 4b shows the value of $P_{\\mathrm{m}}$ when attacking different layers of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat. We have two observations. First, while attacking a single layer (Layer 10) results in a low $P_{\\mathrm{m}}$ at the current layer, $P_{\\mathrm{m}}$ subsequently increases on the following layers. This means that later layers somehow gradually correct the attack by leveraging existing information of the embedding, potentially because it models the safety mechanisms from a different perspective. Second, we observe that when more layers are perturbed (e.g., layers 10-13), $P_{\\mathrm{m}}$ at later layers can no longer be corrected by the LLM. This indicates that a limited number of layers may jointly determine the overall safety mechanisms from different perspectives.

Figure 4c showcases ASR-keyword when applying embedding-level attacks from one white-box model to another. We can see that the ASR-keyword is sometimes quite large.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
