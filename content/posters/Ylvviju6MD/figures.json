The x-axis represents the number of neural network calls, and the y-axis shows the FID or Clip-FID score. Each line corresponds to a specific DDPM variant, demonstrating the variability in performance depending on the chosen coefficients and the dataset. The figure highlights the impact of different DDPM implementations on the quality of generated images.  The results suggest that optimal variants differ depending on the dataset and the desired number of steps.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Ylvviju6MD/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of different variants of DDPM", "description": "The figure compares the performance of three different variants of the DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) scheduler across different numbers of neural network calls. Each variant uses different coefficient choices (at, bt, \u03c3t) within the DDPM framework. The x-axis represents the number of neural network calls, while the y-axis represents the CLIP-FID (CLIP-based Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) score, a metric used to evaluate the quality of generated images. Lower CLIP-FID scores indicate higher quality.  The plots show how the quality of generated images changes for each DDPM variant as the computational cost (number of neural network calls) varies. This comparison helps understand the impact of coefficient choices on the efficiency and image quality of DDPM.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Ylvviju6MD/figures/figures_15_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of different variants of DDPM", "description": "This figure compares the performance of three different DDPM variants across various datasets (CelebAHQ 256, LSUN Churches, FFHQ 256) by plotting the FID score against the number of neural network calls.
