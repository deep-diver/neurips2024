However, this approach suffers from slow convergence, especially for diffusion models where high-quality samples demand many small steps, making it computationally expensive.  The quality degrades rapidly with fewer larger steps. Existing methods like the Randomized Midpoint Method improve this, but only for strongly log-concave distributions, limiting applicability.\n\nThis paper introduces the Poisson Midpoint Method, a variant of the Randomized Midpoint Method.  This new approach achieves a **quadratic speed-up** of the Langevin Monte Carlo under very weak assumptions.  The method is applied successfully to image generation via diffusion models, outperforming existing ODE-based methods in sample quality at similar compute and demonstrating **a significant reduction in computational cost** (50-80 neural network calls instead of 1000) while maintaining the same image quality.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Ylvviju6MD/podcast.wav"}
