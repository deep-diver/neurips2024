However, existing ASQ methods are computationally expensive and thus impractical for large-scale applications. This has limited its use despite its superior accuracy over traditional quantization methods.\n\nThis paper introduces QUIVER, a novel algorithm that solves the ASQ problem optimally and efficiently. By leveraging a novel acceleration technique and the inherent properties of the problem, QUIVER reduces the time and space complexities significantly. This allows for optimal quantization of high-dimensional data that was previously impossible. The paper further introduces an accelerated version of QUIVER and an approximate variant for memory-constrained scenarios.  Experiments demonstrate that these algorithms significantly outperform previous ASQ techniques, enabling the potential for more extensive use of ASQ in various ML applications.", "affiliation": "UCL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "8ZLL6mu2qC/podcast.wav"}
