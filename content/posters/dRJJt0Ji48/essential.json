This paper introduces a novel solution: the Retrieval-Augmented Time series Diffusion model (RATD).  **RATD tackles these issues by incorporating a two-part framework:** an embedding-based retrieval process that identifies relevant historical data and a reference-guided diffusion model that uses these references to improve prediction accuracy.  The retrieval process effectively maximizes the use of available data, while the reference-guided diffusion model overcomes the guidance deficiency. \nThe proposed RATD method demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and stability, particularly in complex scenarios.  **The model's effectiveness is demonstrated across multiple datasets**, showcasing its ability to handle challenging prediction tasks. This contribution offers a new paradigm in time series forecasting, addressing critical limitations and paving the way for more robust and accurate predictions.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dRJJt0Ji48/podcast.wav"}
