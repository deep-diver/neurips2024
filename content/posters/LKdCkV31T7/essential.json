However, current methods struggle with complex spatiotemporal dynamics and point sparsity, often failing to accurately reconstruct intermediate frames.  This is especially true when dealing with non-rigid deformations and unordered point cloud data, prevalent in applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality. \nNeuroGauss4D-PCI addresses these challenges by employing a multi-stage method involving iterative Gaussian soft clustering to achieve structured point cloud representations, temporal radial basis function Gaussian residuals to capture temporal dynamics, and a 4D Gaussian deformation field to model continuous spatiotemporal deformations.  The method fuses geometric features from the Gaussian deformation fields and latent features from a 4D neural field, achieving significantly improved interpolation accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches.  The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated across different datasets, including both object-level and large-scale autonomous driving scenarios, showcasing its robustness and generalizability.", "affiliation": "PhiGent Robotics", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "LKdCkV31T7/podcast.wav"}
