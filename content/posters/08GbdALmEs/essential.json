A common challenge is how to balance learning skills of varying complexity.  Existing methods often rely on random masking schemes, which might hinder learning long-term dependencies. \nCurrMask addresses this by employing a curriculum-based masking approach. It uses block-wise masking schemes of different complexities, arranged in a carefully selected order.  This curriculum dynamically adjusts during pretraining to maximize learning efficiency and skill acquisition, leading to substantial improvements in zero-shot and fine-tuning performance on various downstream tasks. The results showcase CurrMask's effectiveness compared to existing methods and provide valuable insights into designing efficient training strategies for offline RL.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "08GbdALmEs/podcast.wav"}
