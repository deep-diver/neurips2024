Moreover, achieving *conditional validity*, where uncertainty quantification is accurate across different data subpopulations, remains a challenge. This paper tackles these issues.\nThe proposed method, called Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL), offers a novel framework addressing both conditional validity and length efficiency simultaneously.  **CPL constructs prediction sets with near-optimal length**, while ensuring conditional validity under various covariate shifts including marginal and group-conditional coverage.  The framework leverages strong duality results to prove optimality and provides practical algorithms for finite-sample scenarios.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "E4ILjwzdEA/podcast.wav"}
