As shown in Fig. 1, our framework applies post selection of the score, and hence can use any of the conformity scores designed in the literature (see Section 5 for experiments with different scores). ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Level set estimation. As we will see, a key ingredient to our framework is to study the problem of CP through the lens of level set estimation. Level set estimation has been extensively studied in the literature of statistics [46, 61\u201363], and it was introduced to CP community by [64] and further studied by [23]. Our framework expands and builds upon the connection of level set estimation and CP. In particular, comparing to [23, 64], we take three significant steps. (i) We propose to utilize the covariate, $X$ , to directly optimize length via an adaptive threshold. This results in major improvements in length efficiency in practice. (ii) We go beyond marginal coverage to different levels of conditional validity. (iii) Finally, unlike [64], we do not need to directly estimate any marginal\\conditional density function. Level sets and their approximations appear naturally in our optimization framework. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Conformal training: Several works have focused on directly optimizing the score function to enhance the length efficiency of conformal prediction pipelines [24, 34, 65]. In particular, [65] introduced conformal training, where a (marginal) calibration procedure is fixed, and derivatives of the prediction set size with respect to the model parameters are taken. This enables the model to be optimized not for predictive accuracy, as is typical, but for producing smaller prediction sets. However, a key distinction separates our approach from the broader idea of conformal training. To illustrate this difference, consider the simpler case where we aim only to improve length efficiency under marginal coverage. Let $S_{\\theta}(x,y):\\mathcal{X}\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\times}\\mathcal{Y}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ be a parameterized conformity score (e.g., where $\\theta$ represents the parameters of a neural network). Conformal training optimizes $\\theta$ to improve the length efficiency of prediction sets of the form $S_{\\theta}(x,y)\\le q$ , where $q$ is a fixed threshold. In contrast, we keep $\\theta$ fixed and optimize an adaptive threshold $h(x):\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ to improve the length efficiency of prediction sets of the form $S_{\\theta}(x,y)\\stackrel{}{=}h(x)$ . That is to say, our method can also be applied on top of a score trained by conformal training. In appendix I, we show that it is possible to optimize length even further by applying our method on top of the conformal training introduced by [65]. It\u2019s important to note that our use of covariate-adaptive thresholds is specifically for length optimization, distinct from the use in addressing conditional coverage in prior literature. Beyond the theoretical framework, our perspective allows for length optimization in various real-world applications. In practice, access to a model\u2019s internal parameters may be restricted due to privacy, security, or policy concerns. In section 5.1, we demonstrate how to construct efficient prediction sets for large language models (LLMs) without optimizing their internal parameters. Additionally, in uncertainty quantification, conformal prediction sets often serve to assess the behavior of a given black-box model. In these cases, the statistician\u2019s role is to analyze the model\u2019s behavior rather than further optimizing it, which could degrade performance on nominal or out-of-distribution tasks. Additionally, in a concurrent work to ours, [34] extended conformal training idea to a more general case, allowing the score function to be optimized while targeting conditional coverage in the calibration procedure. They develop a novel technique to differentiate through the conditional conformal algorithm introduced by [8]. However, while both approaches utilize similar relaxations for targeting conditional coverage, our work diverges in the underlying objective. Whereas [34] focuses on optimizing the score function, we emphasize optimizing the threshold leaving the scores untouched. This leads to two distinct theoretical and algorithmic developments.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
