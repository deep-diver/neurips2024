This figure shows that the authors' framework operates at the third stage, aiming to design prediction sets that are both conditionally valid and length-efficient (i.e., as small as possible while maintaining validity), given a predictive model and a conformity score.  Previous work focused on improving the first two stages, leaving length optimization at the final stage largely unaddressed.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "E4ILjwzdEA/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) Distribution of the labels conditioned on the covariate x (b) The conditional PDFs.

The red dots correspond to three different marginally-valid prediction sets.", "description": "This figure illustrates three key aspects of the toy example used to explain the principles and challenges of length optimization in conformal prediction. (a) Shows the distribution of labels Y conditioned on the covariate X, highlighting the different variances for x < 0 and x \u2265 0. (b) Displays the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) of the conformity score S given X, demonstrating how the distributions differ based on the value of X. Finally, (c) plots the average length of prediction sets against the parameter q+, demonstrating the existence of an optimal length solution that is distinct from those constructed by split-conformal methods.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "E4ILjwzdEA/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Left-hand-side plot shows coverage and right-hand-side shows mean prediction set size.", "description": "This figure presents the results of applying CPL and Split Conformal to multiple-choice question answering datasets.  The left plot shows the coverage achieved by each method on each dataset (BigBench, MMLU, OpenBookQA, PIQA, TruthfulQA), with a horizontal dashed line indicating the target coverage of 90%. The right plot displays the mean prediction set sizes for each method and dataset.  The error bars represent the standard deviation across multiple trials.
