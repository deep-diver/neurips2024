Such a graph is interpreted as a latent structure, which varies depending on past data. In contrast, our approach learns an explicit structure that governs the dynamics over time. Nevertheless, our mathematical framework can be straightforwardly adapted to learning a time-varying latent graph, if desired. To achieve so, we reuse the loss calculation in (12), remove the constraint, and parameterize A as a function of $\\mathbf X(t)$ . This way, we sacrifice the DAG interpretation of the interactions but gain a time-dependent graph. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "A limitation of the proposed model is that the number of parameters on the A part grows quadratically with the number of time series (nodes).

Such a scalability challenge is a common problem for DAG structure learning. While past research showcased the feasibility of learning a graph with a few hundred nodes [47], going beyond is generally believed to require either a new computational technique or a new modeling approach. One potential direction is to introduce structures into A (such as low-rankness [15]), which admit faster matrix evaluation.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
