Modeling these systems accurately is challenging, especially when data is irregularly sampled and interactions are complex.  Existing methods often struggle with these challenges, limiting their ability to provide accurate predictions and insights into the underlying causal mechanisms. \n\nThis paper introduces GNeuralFlow, a novel model that effectively addresses these challenges.  GNeuralFlow leverages a directed acyclic graph to represent the relationships between system components and uses a continuous-time modeling technique to capture the dynamics of the system.  By jointly learning the graph structure and the system dynamics, GNeuralFlow significantly improves the accuracy of time series classification and forecasting, outperforming existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  The method is also computationally efficient, which makes it suitable for large-scale applications. **This contribution offers a significant advance in modeling complex systems from irregularly sampled data.**", "affiliation": "University of Manchester", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "tFB5SsabVb/podcast.wav"}
