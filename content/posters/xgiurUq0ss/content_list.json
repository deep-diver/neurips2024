Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective strategy to improve the performance of a smaller LLM (i.e., the student model) by transferring knowledge from a high-performing LLM (i.e., the teacher model). Prevailing techniques in LLM distillation typically use a black-box model API to generate high-quality pretrained and aligned datasets, or utilize white-box distillation by altering the loss function to better transfer knowledge from the teacher LLM. However, these methods ignore the knowledge differences between the student and teacher LLMs across domains. This results in excessive focus on domains with minimal performance gaps and insufficient attention to domains with large gaps, reducing overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM distillation framework called DDK, which dynamically adjusts the composition of the distillation dataset in a smooth manner according to the domain performance differences between the teacher and student models, making the distillation process more stable and effective. Extensive evaluations show that DDK significantly improves the performance of student models, outperforming both continuously pretrained baselines and existing knowledge distillation methods by a large margin.

Consequently, the development of lightweight yet efficacious LLMs suitable for real-world applications has become an area of increasing research interest. Several small-scale LLMs, e.g., Phi [39] and MiniCPM [32], have been designed to facilitate rapid inference on devices with limited resources. These models are generally trained from scratch using a large volume of selectively curated high-quality datasets, which could be prohibitive for the broader research community. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in the exploration of model compression techniques [40] to reduce the resource footprint of LLMs. Apart from these techniques, knowledge distillation (KD) emerges as a prominent method for creating effective neural networks, which transfer knowledge from a high-performing teacher model to a compact student model.

Knowledge distillation is a pivotal technique in model compression and acceleration [61, 42, 26, 70, 25], primarily employed to transfer knowledge from a robust, well-trained teacher model to a compact student model [29, 1, 37]. Recently, several approaches to knowledge distillation tailored for LLMs have been proposed. These approaches can be broadly classified into two categories: White-box KD leverages either the internal parameters or the logits of the teacher LLM during the distillation process [22, 46, 56, 71]. For example, Gu et al. [23] propose that traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective is inappropriate for open text generation tasks and propose MiniLLM to minimize reverse KLD through policy gradient techniques [54]. Conversely, black-box KD relies solely on the outputs from the teacher model [12, 30, 34, 48, 60]. For example, \u201cDistilling Step-by-Step\u201d strategy [31] employs Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting to provide sophisticated guidance during distillation. These two types of KD approaches mainly focus on aligning the generative behaviors of the teacher and student models.

Specifically, in Fig. 5, we compute the $(\\ell_{\\mathrm{S}}[i]/\\ell_{\\mathrm{T}}[i])$ as the ratio to represent the domain discrepancy for $i$ -th domain, where a large ratio means a large discrepancy. As shown in Fig. 5, we observe that the ratio updates smoothly in DDK.

Furthermore, we put forward a factor smooth update strategy aimed at enhancing both the stability and the efficacy of the distillation process.

First, we have to tune several hyperparameters to achieve better performance in our DDK. Second, due to the GPU resource limitations, we only distill the 1.1B, 1.8B and 4B sizes under the guidance of teachers with 7B and $^{10\\mathrm{B+}}$ sizes. In the future, we will investigate the performance of knowledge distillation using larger student and larger teacher models.

Second, for the technical details, the sheared LLaMA needs to first fti a scaling function using three open-sourced LLaMA models (i.e., LLAMA2-7B/13B/70B) when pruning the LLaMA model series, where the ftiting data points are very limited. In Sheared LLaMA, the authors also claim the estimated reference losses for different domains are also biased as the limited data points for estimating the scaling law parameters. Besides, in many real-world pruning scenarios, we cannot usually obtain a series of models under the same training setting. Thus, we cannot predict the losses across different domains of the small-size model when a series of models are not provided. In contrast, in DDK, we directly use the domain loss predicted by the teacher model as the reference loss without fitting the scaling function, where the teacher-predicted losses are used as the accurate guidance to improve the student model. Besides, the Sheared LLaMA is proposed to enhance the training efficiency of the continued pre-training setting of the pruned model, the guidance of the teacher model is not included. In addition, our DDK also introduces the factor smooth updating strategy, which is not used in Sheared LLaMA and can make the change of the domain mixture more stable. Moreover, in the following table, we also provide the results of replacing our proposed factor smooth updating strategy with the strategy of Sheared LLaMA, and observe that DDK is better a lot, which further shows the effectiveness of our factor smooth updating strategy.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
