The compression ratio indicates the efficiency of data reduction, with higher values representing more compact representations. Throughput measures the speed of compression and decompression processes, which is crucial for handling large scientific datasets. The comparison is done on two datasets: CESM-ATM and Hurricane.", "section": "5.3 Performance Evaluation"}]
