The role of randomness is neglected due to simplicity of presentation.", "description": "This figure illustrates the process of applying the d-dimensional generalized Neyman-Pearson (d-GNP) lemma to solve multi-objective learn-to-defer (L2D) problems.  The training phase involves a learning algorithm to estimate the probability of deferral for each input data point, based on multiple constraints (e.g. accuracy, fairness, cost). The validation phase takes the trained model and uses it to make predictions for new data points. Depending on the trained model and whether the constraints are satisfied, the prediction is made either by the machine learning algorithm or deferred to a human expert.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "Mtsi1eDdbH/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance of d-GNP on COMPAS dataset (left), and ACSIncome (center and right)", "description": "This figure presents the performance of the proposed d-GNP algorithm compared to two baselines (Madras et al. 2018 and Mozannar et al. 2020) on the COMPAS and ACSIncome datasets. The left panel shows the demographic parity and test accuracy on the COMPAS dataset, illustrating how d-GNP achieves better fairness while maintaining comparable accuracy. The center and right panels display the test accuracy and constraint violation, respectively, on the ACSIncome dataset. These panels demonstrate d-GNP's ability to control constraint violations effectively and improve accuracy when tolerance for violations increases. The shaded areas in the center panel represent confidence intervals around the test accuracy.", "section": "5 Empirical d-GNP and its Statistical Generalization"}, {"figure_path": "Mtsi1eDdbH/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Prediction of d-GNP on Hatespeech dataset [22] and for tweets with predicted African-American (left), and Non-African-American (center) dialect and the disparity between groups (right).", "description": "This figure shows the performance comparison of the proposed d-GNP method against other baselines on the Hatespeech dataset.  The leftmost panel displays the classification performance for tweets predicted to contain African-American dialect, showing the ground truth, human predictions, classifier predictions, HAI predictions (Human-AI integration), and predictions from d-GNP with different demographic parity constraints (DP-O and DP-HS).

It shows two convex sets, M and N, in a multi-dimensional space.  The set M represents the space of achievable objective and constraint values for a multi-objective optimization problem. The set N is a subset of M representing the space of solutions that satisfy the constraints exactly (tightly). The figure demonstrates that if a point (v) in N has a corresponding point in M, then all points in the interior of N have corresponding points in M. This property is crucial to proving the sufficiency of the proposed d-GNP solution for solving the multi-objective learn-to-defer problem.", "section": "Proof of Theorem 4.1"}]
