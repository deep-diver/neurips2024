This list is a version of the results in Appendix D when we assume that the input\nfeature contains demographic group identifier A.

Each row represents a specific constraint (e.g., accuracy, expert intervention budget, demographic parity) and provides the corresponding embedding function, which maps input features to a vector used in the optimization process.  The embedding functions are derived from conditional probability distributions and incorporate features relevant to each constraint, such as demographic information where applicable.", "section": "3 Problem Setting"}]
