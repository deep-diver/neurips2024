### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Learn-to-defer (L2D) systems aim to improve human-AI teamwork by letting AI defer some tasks to human experts.  However, existing L2D methods are limited to single objectives, neglecting crucial constraints like fairness and expert time. This research identifies a significant gap in developing L2D systems under multiple constraints and explores the limitations of existing methods.

This paper introduces a novel post-processing framework using a generalized Neyman-Pearson lemma (d-GNP) that achieves a Bayes-optimal solution for multi-objective L2D problems under constraints. The method involves creating embedding functions to represent constraints and then using d-GNP to estimate the optimal classifier and rejection function. Experiments demonstrate improvements in constraint violation compared to baselines across various datasets.  This work shows significant promise for handling complex decision-making problems by allowing for the optimization of multiple objectives while considering various real-world constraints.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of applying the d-dimensional generalized Neyman-Pearson (d-GNP) lemma to solve multi-objective learn-to-defer (L2D) problems.  The training phase involves a learning algorithm to estimate the probability of deferral for each input data point, based on multiple constraints (e.g. accuracy, fairness, cost). The validation phase takes the trained model and uses it to make predictions for new data points. Depending on the trained model and whether the constraints are satisfied, the prediction is made either by the machine learning algorithm or deferred to a human expert.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-objective L2D
The concept of "Multi-objective L2D" integrates the Learn-to-Defer (L2D) paradigm with the complexities of multi-objective optimization.  **Traditional L2D focuses on improving overall system accuracy by strategically deferring certain tasks to human experts**.  However, real-world applications often involve multiple, potentially conflicting, objectives.  For instance, a medical diagnosis system might aim to maximize accuracy while simultaneously minimizing bias, cost, or the need for human intervention.  **Multi-objective L2D addresses this challenge by formulating the problem as a constrained optimization**, where the primary goal (e.g., accuracy) is optimized subject to constraints representing the secondary objectives. This framework offers a more nuanced and practical approach to AI systems collaboration with human experts, enabling systems to consider various practical and ethical implications of automated decision-making.

#### d-GNP solution
The core of the proposed methodology hinges on a **d-dimensional generalization of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma (d-GNP)**.  This novel approach elegantly solves multi-objective learn-to-defer problems by framing them as a functional linear program.  The d-GNP solution provides a **closed-form solution** that determines the optimal deterministic classifier and rejection function under various constraints.  **Randomness is incorporated** to address computational challenges posed by NP-hard deterministic solutions. The framework's strength lies in its ability to manage multiple constraints simultaneously, providing control over issues like algorithmic fairness, expert intervention budget, and anomaly deferral.  **Post-processing is employed**, thus avoiding potential complications of in-processing methods. The resulting algorithm efficiently estimates the d-GNP solution, showcasing improved constraint violation control compared to existing baselines across diverse datasets.  The **generalizability** of the d-GNP framework extends beyond learn-to-defer applications, offering a powerful tool for various decision-making scenarios involving controlled expected performance measures.

#### Post-processing
Post-processing in this context refers to a two-stage machine learning approach.  The first stage involves training a model to estimate probability scores for inputs.  The second stage uses these scores, applying a carefully designed algorithm, to make the final prediction or decision. This **post-processing step allows for the incorporation of constraints and multiple objectives** that might not be easily handled during the initial model training. For instance, the framework optimizes accuracy while simultaneously addressing fairness concerns or managing the budget for human intervention. The method's strength lies in its flexibility and ability to control multiple constraint violations, demonstrated through its application to real-world datasets. **A key component is a generalization of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma**, which provides the theoretical foundation for optimal decision-making under constraints.  The effectiveness of post-processing is highlighted through experiments showing improvements over existing single-objective approaches.

#### Generalization
The concept of generalization is central to the success of any machine learning model, and this research is no exception.  The authors explicitly address generalization in the context of their multi-objective learn-to-defer framework.  **A key challenge is ensuring that the algorithm's performance on unseen data reflects its performance on training data.** This is particularly important for fairness constraints. They introduce a post-processing algorithm and use the d-GNP lemma to estimate the optimal solution under various constraints.  This approach tackles the complex NP-Hard nature of the problem through the introduction of randomness. The statistical analysis provides generalization error bounds, demonstrating that the algorithm's performance on unseen data is close to its optimal performance on training data. **This rigorous analysis is crucial for demonstrating the practical applicability of the developed framework.** The empirical results on multiple datasets further support the claim of effective generalization and the ability to control constraint violations. The authors emphasize that in-processing methods might not generalize well, unlike their post-processing approach. Therefore, **the post-processing method coupled with the theoretical generalization bounds is a significant contribution to robust multi-objective learn-to-defer systems.**

#### Fairness tradeoffs
In many real-world applications of machine learning, particularly those involving sensitive attributes like race or gender, achieving fairness is crucial.  However, striving for fairness often necessitates trade-offs.  **Simply maximizing accuracy can lead to unfair outcomes**, where certain groups are disproportionately disadvantaged.  Therefore, a balance must be struck.  **Different fairness metrics present their own trade-offs**. For example, demographic parity might improve one type of fairness but worsen another.  **Algorithmic approaches for achieving fairness, such as pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing, each offer unique tradeoffs**. Pre-processing techniques, while potentially beneficial, can also lead to information loss and reduced model accuracy.  In-processing methods are more complex and require substantial modifications to learning algorithms, and might not be feasible in all settings. Finally, post-processing approaches can maintain accuracy but may be limited in their ability to correct severe biases present in the data.  It's **critical to carefully consider these inherent trade-offs** when designing and implementing fair machine learning systems and to choose the approach best suited for the specific context and objectives. The best strategy for fairness will depend on the specific problem and available data.  Ultimately, the goal is not necessarily to achieve perfect fairness across all metrics, but rather to understand and mitigate the negative consequences of unfair bias in a principled manner.

The set M represents the space of achievable objective and constraint values for a multi-objective optimization problem. The set N is a subset of M representing the space of solutions that satisfy the constraints exactly (tightly). The figure demonstrates that if a point (v) in N has a corresponding point in M, then all points in the interior of N have corresponding points in M. This property is crucial to proving the sufficiency of the proposed d-GNP solution for solving the multi-objective learn-to-defer problem.
