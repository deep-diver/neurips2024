E2V reconstruction falls into two categories: modelbased and learning-based methods. Model-based approaches [2, 44, 6, 53] exploit the correlation between events and intensity frames through hand-crafted regularization techniques. However, its reconstruction result is comparatively inferior to the more recent learning-based methods [50, 49, 54, 34, 13]. For example, E2VID [50, 49] used an Unet-like network with skip connections and ConvLSTM units to reconstruct videos from long event streams. Following E2VID, SPADEE2VID [7] extended E2VID to enhance temporal coherence by feeding previously reconstructed frames into a SPADE block. HyperE2VID [13] introduced hypernetworks to generate per-pixel adaptive fliters guided by a context fusion module. GANs, such as conditional GAN [61] and cycleconsistency GAN [69], are used to address this issue, but often exhibit blurry images with artifacts in non-activated areas. In summary, previous learning-based methods can only achieve plausible reconstructed results for this ill-posed problem because event data solely captures motion information without semantic context information.

Despite the promising performance of our method, LaSe-E2V has several limitations.

Consequently, our method may reconstruct scenes with artifacts differing from the training data. Second, given that LaSe-E2V relies on the diffusion model, multiple denoising steps are required for high-quality videos, slowing the process. Future work can focus on accelerating the inference efficiency based on the recent progress of diffusion models [37, 9, 38, 39]. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Broader Impacts.

Our framework primarily aims to establish a pipeline for reconstructing videos from events using a language-guided approach.

This form of text guidance resembles text-guided denoising [11, 47] and super-resolution [16] methods, which also use natural language as a user-friendly interface to control the image restoration process. In this work, we do not emphasize the specific sources of text prompts, as these can vary depending on the application scenario. For instance, when using a DAVIS346 camera, text can conveniently be obtained from APS frames. If a Prophesee camera is used and only event data is available, tagging-based text prompts derived from event-based multi-modality models can be employed. Additionally, in complex scenes with limited event data, human intervention can be incorporated interactively to enable user control.

Additionally, our approach exhibits superior reconstruction performance even in scenes with insufficient event data (Tab. 7).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
