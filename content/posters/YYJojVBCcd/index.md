### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning models exhibit bias towards protected groups, often at the cost of accuracy.  Existing fairness-focused active learning methods typically require annotating sensitive attributes, raising privacy concerns.  This creates a fairness-accuracy trade-off that is difficult to overcome. 

This paper introduces Fair Influential Sampling (FIS), a novel active learning approach that addresses these issues. FIS scores data points based on their influence on fairness and accuracy using a small validation set without sensitive attributes.  It then selects the most influential samples for training, improving model fairness without compromising accuracy.  The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and real-world experiments, providing upper bounds for generalization error and risk disparity.

> This figure compares Pareto frontiers for models trained on datasets with different sizes (scarce vs. rich data).  The x-axis represents the model error rate, and the y-axis represents fairness violation. The plot shows that a model trained on a larger dataset (rich data) achieves a better Pareto frontier, allowing for lower error rates and lower fairness violations simultaneously than a model trained on a smaller dataset (scarce data).  Acquiring more data shifts the Pareto frontier, leading to a superior trade-off point.

> This table presents the results of experiments on the CelebA dataset, focusing on two binary classification tasks: predicting whether a person is young or has a big nose.  The results compare the performance of several methods (Base(ERM), Random, BALD, ISAL, JTT-20, and FIS) across different fairness metrics (DP, EOp, EOd) and error tolerances (Œµ=0.05). Each method is evaluated based on its test accuracy and fairness violation. The table helps understand the effectiveness of different fairness-aware learning methods in improving model accuracy and fairness simultaneously, particularly when sensitive attributes like gender are involved.





### In-depth insights


#### Fairness Tradeoffs
The concept of fairness tradeoffs in machine learning is crucial because striving for fairness often necessitates compromises in other critical aspects, such as accuracy.  **A common tradeoff is observed between model accuracy and fairness metrics**, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity.  Improving fairness might involve techniques like data preprocessing or algorithmic adjustments, but these can negatively impact model performance.  **This tradeoff is fundamentally linked to the inherent biases present within the training data**, which may reflect existing societal inequities.  Therefore, simply optimizing for fairness without considering accuracy can lead to models that are fair but lack practical utility.  **Researchers must carefully navigate this challenge by exploring the Pareto frontier**, where any improvement in fairness requires a reduction in accuracy and vice versa.   Ideally, methods should strive to achieve a balance, pushing the Pareto frontier towards a region where both high accuracy and substantial fairness improvements coexist.  This often involves innovative data sampling or model training strategies that aim to minimize bias without sacrificing performance significantly. **The difficulty in resolving these tradeoffs underscores the complexity of defining and achieving fairness in AI.**  Furthermore, different fairness definitions can produce drastically different trade-offs, highlighting the critical need for careful consideration of which fairness metric is most relevant to the application.

#### Active Sampling
Active sampling, in the context of machine learning, is a crucial technique for efficiently training models with limited labeled data.  It strategically selects the most informative instances from a larger pool of unlabeled data for manual annotation, thus maximizing the model's performance with minimal labeling effort.  **The core idea revolves around intelligently ranking unlabeled data points based on their expected contribution to the model's improvement.** This contribution is usually measured via different criteria such as uncertainty, representativeness, and expected error reduction.  **Fairness considerations become critical when sensitive attributes are involved,** as traditional active learning approaches could exacerbate existing biases by disproportionately selecting data points from certain demographic groups.  Consequently, fair active learning methods are developed to ensure the selected data points reflect the desired fairness properties.  This approach, however, typically requires annotations of sensitive attributes, which raises privacy and safety concerns. **The novelty of the paper lies in its proposal for a tractable active sampling algorithm that circumvents this sensitive attribute requirement.** This algorithm leverages the examples' influence on both fairness and accuracy evaluated on a small validation set, thus enabling fairness improvements without compromising accuracy.

#### Influence Scores
Influence scores, in the context of active learning and fairness-aware machine learning, represent a **quantifiable metric** that assesses the potential impact of including a specific data point in the training dataset.  They aim to identify examples that will most effectively improve model fairness and accuracy simultaneously.  This is a crucial aspect for methods that aim for fairness without sacrificing accuracy, as it helps to guide the selection process.  The computation of influence scores needs to be efficient and avoid reliance on sensitive attributes, while still accurately reflecting the impact. The algorithm needs to be designed to balance between fairness and accuracy, ensuring that adding an example won't lead to a degradation in accuracy, and that it moves toward a fairer model.  **Theoretical analysis** is required to justify the effectiveness of the approach and provide generalization guarantees.  It's important to note that the actual calculation and interpretation of the influence scores can vary depending on the specific algorithm and fairness metric used. However, the general principle is to use influence scores as a strategic guide in the process of data selection to help achieve model fairness and accuracy.

#### FIS Algorithm
The core of the proposed approach lies in its novel active sampling algorithm, termed FIS (Fair Influential Sampling).  **FIS cleverly circumvents the need for sensitive attribute annotations during training** by leveraging a small, pre-annotated validation set.  This is a crucial innovation as it directly addresses privacy concerns associated with collecting and using sensitive data. The algorithm operates by scoring each potential data point based on its estimated influence on both model accuracy and fairness, as evaluated on the validation set.  **This dual-scoring mechanism ensures a balanced selection of examples, prioritizing those that promise improvements in fairness without sacrificing accuracy.** A theoretical analysis of FIS supports the intuition behind its design, demonstrating how acquiring more data, selected judiciously, improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.  **The algorithm's practical effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showcasing its superiority over existing baselines.**  Overall, FIS presents a significant advancement in fair machine learning, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for building fairer and more accurate models.

#### Future Work
Future work in this area could explore several promising directions. **Firstly**, the influence-guided active sampling approach could be extended to other fairness metrics beyond demographic parity and equalized odds.  **Secondly**, investigating the impact of different proxy label generation methods on the overall performance and fairness of the system is crucial.  **Thirdly**, a more robust theoretical analysis that considers the impact of noisy labels and distribution shift would strengthen the foundation of the approach.  **Finally**, practical applications of the approach in high-stakes domains, coupled with thorough empirical evaluations of its effectiveness, are essential to demonstrate its real-world applicability and to address any potential ethical considerations. This would further solidify its position as a valuable tool for building fairer machine learning models.
