In this work, we aim to train models that mitigate group fairness disparity without causing harm to model accuracy. Intuitively, acquiring more data is a natural and promising approach to achieve this goal by reaching a better Pareto frontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff.

However, the pursuit of fairness unavoidably results in a compromise scenario where reducing the fairness violations usually leads to a degradation in accuracy, which has been observed and verified by numerous literature [52, 25, 81, 69, 83]. Theoretically, the phenomenon can be understood through a Pareto frontier on the tradeoff between group fairness and accuracy [72, 51, 10, 74].

However, existing approaches that seek more data, such as fair active learning [4], typically require annotating sensitive attributes for training data. In practice, these sensitive attribute information such as race and gender, should be protected due to privacy regulations [35, 5, 66].

Moreover, a fairnessaccuracy tradeoff has been shown, meaning that enforcing fair constraints heavily degrades the model performance [52, 25, 81]. Notably, Chen et al. [20] characterized the change of the fairness violation when the data distribution is shifted. Except for training sensitive attributes, this paper does not work in the classical regime of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. By properly collecting new data, we can improve both accuracy and fairness, which cannot be achieved by working on a static training dataset that naturally incurs such a tradeoff. Besides, compared to prior works [52, 56], our method does not require additional assumptions about the classifier and the characteristics of the training/testing datasets (e.g., distribution shifts). Relevant work [42] utilizes the influence function to reweight the data examples but requires re-training.

[16] utilizes the soft labels from an overfitting teacher model to train a student model to avoid using demographics. A line of research establishes theoretical connections between features and attributes to avoid using demographic information, employing methods like causal graphs [63], correlation shifts [58], and demographic shifts [30].

More relevant to this work is the importance reweighting, which assigns weights to training examples [37, 36, 23, 21, 57, 44]. Our algorithm bears similarity to a specific case of importance reweighting, particularly the 0-1 reweighting applied to newly added data. Other parallel studies utilize importance weighting to learn a complex generative model in a weakly supervised setting [23, 21], or to mitigate representation bias in training datasets [44]. Post-processing methods typically enforce fairness on a learned model through calibration [26, 27, 32], but these work might not achieve the best fairness-accuracy tradeoff [75, 55].

Intuitively, one can always recruit human annotators to get the ground-truth labels for those unlabeled examples. However, it is impractical due to the limited labeling budgets. To tackle this problem, another common approach is utilizing a model that has been effectively trained on dataset $P$ to produce proxy labels, which approximate the calculation of influences for examples from a substantial unlabeled dataset $U$ . It\u2019s important to note that these proxy labels are exclusively used during the sampling phase. To maintain good model performance, we still need to inquire about the true labels of the selected data examples for subsequent training. Here, we propose to annotate the proxy labels with the model trained on the labeled set $P$ . In particular, we introduce a strategy that employs lowest-influence labels for annotating label $\\hat{y}^{\\prime}$ given $x^{\\prime}$ : ", "page_idx": 5}, {"type": "equation", "text": "$$\n\\hat{y}^{\\prime}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{k\\in\\{1,\\cdots,K\\}}\\ |\\mathsf{I n f l}_{\\mathsf{a c c}}(x^{\\prime},k)|,\n$$", "text_format": "latex", "page_idx": 5}, {"type": "text", "text": "Here, we denote $\\hat{z}^{\\prime}:=(x^{\\prime},\\hat{y}^{\\prime})$ for the proxy labels.

Note that the tolerance $\\epsilon$ is applied to monitor the performance drop in validation accuracy. In Line 2, we initiate the process by training a classifier $f$ solely on dataset $P$ , that is, performing a warm start. Subsequently, $T$ -round sampling iterations are applied to acquire more examples to dataset $P$ . Following the iterative fashion, FIS guesses labels using Eq. (5) in Line 4. Then, we calculate the scores for proxy examples based on the accuracy and fairness influence using Eq. (2) and Eq. (4) respectively. In Lines 6-12, we would opt for $r$ samples based on the influence scores, and inquire about the true labels of these examples. However, due to the gap between proxy labels $\\hat{y}^{\\prime}$ and true label $y$ , the accuracy and fairness influences of the top- ${\\bf\\nabla}r$ samples based on inquired true labels $z^{\\prime}$ may not necessarily satisfy the same conditions $(\\mathsf{I n f l}_{\\mathsf{a c c}}(\\hat{z}^{\\prime})\\leq0$ , $|\\mathsf{n f l}_{\\mathsf{f a i r}}(\\hat{z}^{\\prime})\\leq0)$ . Therefore, we use a while loop to iteratively select the top- $\\left(r-|S_{t}|\\right)$ examples for labeling until we obtain $r$ samples whose fairness influences based on true labels meet the conditions. Subsequently, in Line 11, we update sets $U$ and $S_{\\mathrm{original}}$ to prevent duplicate sampling.

Each of these measures has its criterion to determine the importance of instances for enhancing classifier performance. For example, uncertainty considers the most important unlabeled instance to be the nearest one to the current classification boundary. A related line of work [48, 71, 31, 76] concentrates on ranking unlabeled instances based on the influence function. Compared to these studies with a focus on prediction accuracy, our work poses a distinct challenge taking into account fairness violations. We note that adopting a particular sampling strategy can lead to distribution shifts between the training and testing data. What\u2019s worse, even though fairness is satisfied within the training dataset, the model may still exhibit unfair treatments on the test dataset due to the distribution shift. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the sampling approach to also account for its potential impacts on fairness. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Pareto optimality In the field of fairness in machine learning, Pareto optimality indicates the theoretical frontier of fairness accuracy tradeoff, meaning that fairness can not be improved without worsening model accuracy. Existing methods primarily focus on seeking the Pareto frontier of fairness accuracy tradeoff for the neural network classifier, instead of reaching a better one. For example, [10] first analyzes the Pareto optimality for classifiers within the context of fairness constraints. [72] explores the multi-dimensional Pareto frontiers of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff in the multi-task setting. [51, 50] target to obtain a Pareto efficient classifier to reduce worst-case group risks by formulating group fairness as a multiple-objective optimization problem, where each group risk is an objective function. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fair classification The fairness-aware learning algorithms, in general, can be categorized into preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing methods. Pre-processing methods typically reweigh or distort the data examples to mitigate the identified biases [7, 9, 65, 60, 15, 17, 80, 18]. More relevant to us is the importance reweighting, which assigns different weights to different training examples to ensure fairness across groups [37, 36, 23, 21, 57, 44]. Our proposed algorithm bears similarity to a specific case of importance reweighting, particularly the 0-1 reweighting applied to newly added data. The main advantage of our work, however, lies in its ability to operate without needing access to the sensitive attributes of either the new or training data. Other parallel studies utilize importance weighting to learn a complex fair generative model in a weakly supervised setting [23, 21], or to mitigate representation bias in training datasets [44]. Post-processing methods typically enforce fairness on a learned model through calibration [26, 27, 32]. Although this approach is likely to decrease the disparity of the classifier, by decoupling the training from the fairness enforcement, this procedure may not lead to the best trade-off between fairness and accuracy [75, 55]. In contrast, our work can achieve a better trade-off between fairness and accuracy, because we reduce the fairness disparity by mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts on generalization error. Additionally, these post-processing techniques necessitate access to the sensitive attribute during the inference phase, which is often not available in many real-world scenarios.
