This approach is unsuitable for real-time applications. Existing online methods, often adapted from action detection, struggle with the challenges of procedural videos and tend to over-segment actions.  Furthermore, capturing and using context information effectively in an online setting remains an open problem. \nOnlineTAS tackles these limitations by introducing a novel online framework. A core component is an adaptive memory that dynamically tracks both short-term and long-term context information.  This information is then integrated into frame representations using a context-aware feature augmentation module. A post-processing step refines the results, mitigating the issue of over-segmentation.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of OnlineTAS**, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for online temporal action segmentation.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "bkLetzd97M/podcast.wav"}
