These approaches fail to capture the intricate interplay between different biological sequences, hindering accurate predictions, especially regarding the complex process of RNA alternative splicing and isoform generation. This complexity leads to difficulties in predicting the expression levels of different RNA isoforms that arise from a single gene, across diverse human tissues. This is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and gene regulation.\nTo address these limitations, this paper introduces IsoFormer, a novel multi-modal model designed to integrate DNA, RNA, and protein sequence data to predict RNA transcript isoform expression levels. IsoFormer's innovative architecture leverages pre-trained modality-specific encoders to effectively transfer knowledge across different biological sequences. This methodology proved highly successful, outperforming existing single-modality approaches.  The study demonstrates efficient transfer learning within and between modalities, highlighting the significant benefit of this integrative approach for solving complex biological problems.  The researchers also open-sourced their model, IsoFormer, to facilitate further research and development in the field.", "affiliation": "InstaDeep", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "xImeJtdUiw/podcast.wav"}
