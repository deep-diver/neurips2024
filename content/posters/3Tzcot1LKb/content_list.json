RLHF is a technique that aligns large language models with human preferences and values [18, 97, 58, 7]. The classical RLHF pipeline typically comprises three phases: supervised fine-tuning [96, 71, 32, 21, 44, 25, 77, 15, 81], reward model training [31, 56, 16, 52, 35, 46], and policy optimization [65, 4]. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [65] is a widely used algorithm in the third stage of RLHF. The RLHF framework is also widely applied to various applications, such as mitigating toxicity [3, 45, 92], ensuring safety [24], enhancing helpfulness [73, 78], searching and navigating the web [57], and improving model reasoning abilities [34]. Recently, [13] has highlighted challenges across the whole RLHF pipeline from preference data collection to model training. Further research has also demonstrated that RLHF can lead to biased outcomes, such as verbose outputs from the model [28, 66, 80]. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Offline vs. iterative preference optimization. Given that online preference optimization algorithms are complex and difficult to optimize [95, 64], researchers have been exploring more efficient and simpler alternative offline algorithms. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [61] is a notable example. However, the absence of an explicit reward model in DPO limits its ability to sample preference pairs from the optimal policy. To address this, researchers have explored augmenting preference data using a trained SFT policy [91] or a refined SFT policy with rejection sampling [55], enabling the policy to learn from data generated by the optimal policy. Further studies have extended this approach to an iterative training setup, by continuously updating the reference model with the most recent policy model or generating new preference pairs at each iteration [27, 42, 62, 82, 87]. In this work, we focus exclusively on offline settings, avoiding any iterative training processes. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Preference optimization objectives. A variety of preference optimization objectives have been proposed besides DPO. Ranking objectives allow for comparisons among more than two instances [26, 54, 67, 86]. Another line of work explores simpler preference optimization objectives that do not rely on a reference model [38, 84], similar to SimPO. [8] proposes a method to jointly optimize instructions and responses, finding it effectively improves DPO. [93] focuses on post-training extrapolation between the SFT and the aligned model to further enhance model performance. In this work, we compare SimPO to a series of offilne algorithms, including RRHF [86], SLiC-HF [91], DPO [61], IPO [6], CPO [83], KTO [29], ORPO [38], and R-DPO [60], and find that SimPO can outperform them in both efficiency and performance.
