For a given problem, a subject must first recall the meaning of the information they're being presented with (e.g., a formal specification), and understand it in the given context (grid world). Applying these concepts in ManeuverGame enables the subject to analyze different trajectories, both valid and invalid, under a trial-and-error process. Evaluating the trajectories, a subject is able to hone in on specifications that are both valid and meet the specification, allowing them to create multiple such specifications. This process repeats itself for new problems.", "description": "This figure illustrates how Bloom's taxonomy of learning is applied to the ManeuverGame experiment. It shows how the process of understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating specifications within the game's context involves different cognitive levels and leads to refining understanding of policies by iterating through the process multiple times.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "LXz1xIEBkF/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: STEM experience vs. validation score by experiment condition.
