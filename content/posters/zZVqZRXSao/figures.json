In the second stage of Cross-Domain Semantic-Matched Learning, Semantic-Preserving Domain Alignment aligns domains while preserving the built prototypical structure, and Switchable Nearest Neighboring Match achieves more accurate cross-domain categorical pairing.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two-stage Unified, Enhanced, and Matched (UEM) semantic feature learning framework for Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval (U2CDR). The first stage, Intra-Domain Semantic-Enhanced Learning, builds a unified prototypical structure across domains using an instance-prototype-mixed contrastive loss and a semantic-enhanced loss.  The second stage, Cross-Domain Semantic-Matched Learning, aligns the domains while preserving this structure, using Semantic-Preserving Domain Alignment and Switchable Nearest Neighboring Match to improve cross-domain categorical pairing.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "zZVqZRXSao/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of nearest neighbor searching before or after domain alignment.", "description": "This figure compares the results of nearest neighbor (NN) search before and after domain alignment using two different methods: standard adversarial learning and semantic-preserving domain alignment. Before alignment, the domain gap leads to incorrect NN pairings (as shown in the left panel). Standard adversarial learning (middle panel) tries to align domains, but may change the semantic structure causing inaccurate NN results. In contrast, the semantic-preserving domain alignment (right panel) effectively aligns the domains while maintaining the semantic structure, resulting in accurate NN pairings after alignment. This highlights the importance of semantic preservation in cross-domain retrieval.", "section": "3.3 Cross-Domain Semantic-Matched Learning"}, {"figure_path": "zZVqZRXSao/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Retrieval results of UEM and DGDIR on Office-31 (A\u2192D), Office-Home (A\u2192C), and DomainNet (Cl\u2192Pa) in Close-set Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval.
