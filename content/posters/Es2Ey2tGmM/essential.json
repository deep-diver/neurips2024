This limitation restricts their use in various applications requiring controlled data generation, such as those with fairness or pre-trained model distribution requirements.  This necessitates the development of constrained diffusion models that can effectively address the distribution bias. \nThis research introduces a novel framework for training constrained diffusion models. The training process is presented as a constrained distribution optimization problem. This problem aims to minimize the difference between the original and generated data distributions while adhering to the specified constraints on the generated data distribution. A dual training algorithm is proposed for model training and the optimality of this algorithm is also analyzed.  Experiments demonstrate successful application in fair sampling and model adaptation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Es2Ey2tGmM/podcast.wav"}
