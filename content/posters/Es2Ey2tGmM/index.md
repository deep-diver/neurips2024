### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current diffusion models often suffer from generating data that reflects biases present in the training dataset. This limitation restricts their use in various applications requiring controlled data generation, such as those with fairness or pre-trained model distribution requirements.  This necessitates the development of constrained diffusion models that can effectively address the distribution bias. 

This research introduces a novel framework for training constrained diffusion models. The training process is presented as a constrained distribution optimization problem. This problem aims to minimize the difference between the original and generated data distributions while adhering to the specified constraints on the generated data distribution. A dual training algorithm is proposed for model training and the optimality of this algorithm is also analyzed.  Experiments demonstrate successful application in fair sampling and model adaptation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.

### In-depth insights


#### Dual Training
The concept of 'Dual Training' in the context of constrained diffusion models is a novel approach to address the challenge of generating data while adhering to specific requirements.  It leverages the power of **constrained optimization** by framing the problem as a balance between optimizing a primary objective (e.g., minimizing reconstruction error) and satisfying constraints (e.g., ensuring fair representation of underrepresented classes). The proposed 'dual training' method involves a **Lagrangian-based formulation** that elegantly combines these objectives, where the Lagrangian multipliers act as weights to balance the importance of the objective and constraints.  The core insight lies in leveraging **strong duality**, enabling a transformation of the constrained optimization problem into an equivalent unconstrained one in the dual space.  This significantly simplifies the training process by making it less computationally expensive than directly dealing with the original constrained problem. Moreover, the authors demonstrate **convergence and optimality** results that offer theoretical guarantees on the generated data's alignment with both the primary objective and the constraints. Finally, empirical evaluations showcase the effectiveness of this framework in two key areas: ensuring fairness in data generation and adapting pre-trained models to new datasets. The emphasis on **dual space optimization** and the resultant theoretical underpinnings constitute a significant contribution to constrained generative modeling.

#### KL Divergence
The concept of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is central to the paper, forming the foundation for the proposed constrained diffusion models.  **KL divergence quantifies the difference between two probability distributions**, acting as a measure of how much one distribution deviates from another. In this context, it's used to formalize a constrained optimization problem during model training. The authors leverage KL divergence to **minimize the difference between the original data distribution and the distribution generated by the diffusion model**, while simultaneously ensuring that the generated data adheres to specific constraints expressed via additional desired distributions.  The constraints are formulated as bounds on KL divergences between the model and these target distributions. This elegant framing allows the model to balance the objective of accurately representing the original data with the requirement of satisfying pre-defined constraints, leading to a more controlled and potentially fairer or more specific data generation process. The use of KL divergence in the infinite-dimensional distribution space and its analysis via strong duality are key theoretical contributions of this work.

#### Fair Sampling
The concept of "Fair Sampling" in the context of generative models, particularly diffusion models, addresses the issue of **bias amplification**.  Standard training procedures can lead to models that disproportionately generate samples from over-represented classes in the training data, thus perpetuating or even exacerbating existing societal biases.  Fair sampling techniques aim to **mitigate this bias** by ensuring a more equitable representation of all classes in the generated data. This might involve modifying the training process, such as re-weighting samples or applying constraints during optimization, to encourage the model to learn a fairer underlying distribution.  **Achieving fair sampling is not merely about equal representation**, however; it's about addressing underlying biases that might lead to unfair outcomes even with seemingly balanced outputs.  The success of such methods depends on the specific constraints chosen and how effectively they're incorporated into the model's learning process. The evaluation of fair sampling often involves measuring the distribution of generated samples across different classes and comparing it to a fair baseline, thereby quantifying the model's fairness.

#### Model Adaptation
Model adaptation in the context of diffusion models focuses on efficiently transferring a pre-trained model's knowledge to a new dataset.  This is crucial because training diffusion models from scratch is computationally expensive.  **Effective adaptation strategies must balance leveraging the pre-trained model's strengths with avoiding catastrophic forgetting or overfitting to the new data.**  Several approaches exist, including fine-tuning, where model parameters are adjusted based on the new data's characteristics; and other methods that impose constraints, ensuring the adapted model remains close to the original distribution while adequately representing the new dataset.  **Constrained optimization frameworks are particularly promising**, offering a principled way to manage the trade-off between fidelity to the original model and performance on the new data.  The choice of constraints is critical and will depend on the specific requirements of the adaptation task; for example, in fair data generation, constraints might ensure equitable representation of underrepresented groups.  **Careful consideration of the optimization process, including the selection of hyperparameters and evaluation metrics, is crucial to ensure successful and robust model adaptation.**  Success in model adaptation ultimately depends on achieving a balance between retaining the desirable properties of the pre-trained model and accurately capturing the characteristics of the target distribution.

#### Future Works
The paper's 'Future Works' section could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the framework to handle more diverse constraints** beyond KL-divergence, such as those involving specific image features or semantic properties, would significantly broaden its applicability.  **Investigating alternative training methodologies** that might improve convergence speed or efficiency, potentially incorporating techniques like meta-learning or reinforcement learning, is also crucial.  A **more in-depth analysis of the impact of different hyperparameter settings**, particularly the effects of relaxation cost and dual variable update schemes, could provide greater insight into optimal model training strategies.  Furthermore, **applying the constrained diffusion model to a wider range of datasets and generation tasks**, including video, audio, or 3D models, is important for demonstrating its generalizability and practical value.  Finally, developing robust methods for **quantifying the trade-off between objective function performance and constraint satisfaction** would be beneficial for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the model.
