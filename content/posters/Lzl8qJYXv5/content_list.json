In ICL, a conditional generative model (CGM) is prompted with a dataset and a prediction question and asked to generate a response. One interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes the posterior predictive of an unknown Bayesian model, which implicitly defines a joint distribution over observable datasets and latent mechanisms. This joint distribution factorizes into two components: the model prior over mechanisms and the model likelihood of datasets given a mechanism. With this perspective, we define a hallucination as a generated response to the prediction question with low model likelihood given the mechanism. We develop a new method that takes an ICL problem and estimates the probability that a CGM will generate a hallucination. Our method only requires generating prediction questions and responses from the CGM and evaluating its response log probability.

Hallucination prediction and mitigation is an active area of research [9\u201330]. This work is most closely related to a subset of methods based on uncertainty quantification [31\u201338]\u2014 particularly, those methods that aim to predict hallucinations based on uncertainty about the meaning of generated responses [33, 34, 36]. Unlike those methods, the PHR does not require external information from auxiliary classifiers and is applicable beyond language tasks. Our approach is enabled by sampling ICL dataset completions from the predictive distribution, which was first explored in the context of sequential models by Fong et al. [39]. Extensions to various CGMs are an active area of research [40, 41]. Notably, Falck et al. [41] explores the hypothesis that in-context learning (ICL) performs Bayesian inference. They propose a similar method to ours for testing this hypothesis and present several ICL scenarios where it does not hold.

Evidence in actual pre-trained LLMs shows that ICL can be approximated as a kernel regression [60], and parametric approximations to ICL can be derived from the hidden state of the last input demonstration [61, 62]. Practical shortcomings of ICL include dependence on example order [63\u201366] and the impact of prediction preferences acquired during pre-training [65\u201369]. While future models might improve ICL performance [70], current limitations are clear and are thoroughly investigated in recent work by Falck et al. [41].

Although not all these papers explicitly focus on LLM uncertainties, they rely on it implicitly by sampling multiple model completions for a query and quantifying the differences in meaning. Specifically, Kuhn et al. [33] highlight the challenge of isolating uncertainty over semantic meaning from uncertainty over syntax or lexis in free-form generation tasks. While these approaches do not disambiguate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, Ahdritz et al. [73], Johnson et al. [74] recently proposed methods to do so in CGMs. However, Ahdritz et al. [73] require access to two LLMs of different parameter counts, and Johnson et al. [74] do not apply their method to LLMs. Additionally, Hu et al.

Through repeated resampling and estimation of the predictive, a \u201cposterior\u201d over the estimate is obtained. In particular, their predictive resampling algorithm can be seen as a generalization of Algorithm 1, although the motivation and use is different. Falck et al. [41] work towards formalizing this methodology for LLMs. They propose a set of statistical tests to estimate whether an LLM satisfies the Martingale property; these tests depend on being able to sample from the true Bayesian model that defines the posterior predictive distribution estimated by the LLM predictive distribution. In their evaluations using synthetic data and pre-trained LLMs, they find that violations of the Martingale property can occur. Moreover, they find that the fidelity of the LLM predictive distribution to the true Bayesian posterior predictive decreases as the length of dataset completions $(N-n)$ increases.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
