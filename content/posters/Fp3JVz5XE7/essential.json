{"importance": "This paper is important because it proposes **BlackFed**, a novel federated learning framework for semantic segmentation that significantly improves privacy compared to existing methods by **avoiding the transfer of model weights or gradients.** This addresses a critical challenge in federated learning and opens new avenues for privacy-preserving collaborative model training in computer vision and medical imaging.  The black-box approach makes it robust to existing data reconstruction attacks and offers strong privacy preservation.", "summary": "BlackFed:  Privacy-preserving federated semantic segmentation using zero/first-order optimization, avoiding gradient/weight sharing!", "takeaways": ["BlackFed achieves federated semantic segmentation without transferring model information or gradients.", "BlackFed employs a novel black-box adaptation using zero-order and first-order optimization to effectively update client and server models.", "BlackFed shows improvements in out-of-distribution performance, demonstrating its effectiveness as a distributed learning method for semantic segmentation."], "tldr": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, existing FL methods for semantic segmentation often involve sharing model weights or gradients, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks. This paper introduces BlackFed, a novel black-box FL framework that overcomes this limitation.  BlackFed achieves this by formulating the FL problem using split neural networks and employing zero-order optimization for clients and first-order optimization for the server, thus enabling better privacy preservation without gradient or model information exchange.\nBlackFed effectively addresses the issues of privacy vulnerabilities in traditional federated learning for semantic segmentation. By employing a black-box approach and avoiding gradient or model information sharing, it enhances privacy protection. The use of zero-order and first-order optimization for updating client and server models, respectively, allows efficient model training without compromising privacy. The evaluation across computer vision and medical imaging datasets demonstrate BlackFed's effectiveness and robustness.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "Fp3JVz5XE7/podcast.wav"}
