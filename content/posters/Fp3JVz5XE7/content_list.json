This allows the model to utilize the information from every institute while preserving data privacy. However, recent studies show that the promise of protecting the privacy of data is not upheld by existing methods and that it is possible to recreate the training data from the different institutions. This is done by utilizing gradients transferred between the clients and the global server during training or by knowing the model architecture at the client end. In this paper, we propose a federated learning framework for semantic segmentation without knowing the model architecture nor transferring gradients between the client and the server, thus enabling better privacy preservation. We propose BlackFed - a black-box adaptation of neural networks that utilizes zero order optimization (ZOO) to update the client model weights and first order optimization (FOO) to update the server weights. We evaluate our approach on several computer vision and medical imaging datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

This has, in turn, led to the development of AI models that require substantial amounts of data to train. Federated Learning (FL) [34] was developed as a viable approach towards training such models by effectively harnessing the data collected at different centers across the world. Through FL, it becomes possible for multiple institutions to collaborate and build a joint model that learns from all of them, while reducing the burden of collecting more data individually. However, collaborations between different institutions present a non-trivial challenge due to disparity in data distributions as well as the imperative of safeguarding data privacy. Consequently, FL aims to jointly learn a shared model that performs well on data from all participating institutions without exchanging raw data. Various FL approaches have been proposed in the literature [1, 10, 12, 16, 25, 22, 35, 37, 41, 44, 55, 56, 30, 34, 29, 31]. Among these, FedAvg [34] was one of the pioneering FL methods, which proposes training local models at every center using local data and periodically averaging the local model weights to craft a global server model. Various subsequent works improve FedAvg by improving the local model updates [30, 31] or global updates [24, 29].

Generating annotations in segmentation entails creating pixel-level annotations per image, that are more tedious to label than classification tasks. Consequently, it is not always possible for a single institution to collect a large amount of data, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts. A few approaches have been proposed in the literature for FL-based segmentation [36, 5, 18, 43, 53, 14]. However, all these methods for segmentation and classification, while not involving raw data transfer, employ techniques like model information transfer [34, 30, 36] or gradient transfer [24, 20], as shown in Figure 1. However, recent research has revealed that these techniques are vulnerable to attacks that can recreate training data from the participating centers, thus undermining the privacy preserving characteristic of FL [11, 54, 17, 57, 27, 26, 58, 15, 23]. These attacks employ methods like gradient inversion [54, 17, 57] or adapting model architecture and weights [11]. In this work, we propose a new approach, named BlackFed, for segmentation using FL that does not involve gradient transfer between the server and the client and at the same time, passes no knowledge about the client model architecture to the server, thereby avoiding the necessary conditions for these attacks, as shown in Figure 1.

For instance, [32] attempts to learn a model for brain tumor segmentation by utilizing data from multiple institutions. FedSM [38] attempts to mitigate the effect of non-iid nature of the data from different centers on the global server model. However, most of the approaches for medical segmentation focus on the problem of segmenting out the foreground from the background (one class problem). There are relatively fewer works in the literature for multi-class segmentation [14, 36, 5, 18, 43, 53]. FedSeg [36] deals with the class label inconsistency problem that may be present at the local clients. In other words, it builds a robust system that works well even when the clients have annotations for only a subset of the classes. FedDrive [14], on the other hand, sets up various benchmarks for FL algorithms on multi-class datasets like Cityscapes [9]. However, all the existing algorithms require the global server to know the model architecture used in the clients and thus, these methods are vulnerable to recent attacks [11].

During training, the clients perform a forward pass using their data and send the encoded features to the server, which further passes the features to the subsequent layers in the network. The server and client models are trained using backpropagation, where the gradients from the first layer of the server model are sent back to each of the clients. Split networks have mainly been used in the literature for the task of classification, mostly in the medical domain [20, 40, 47]. Our work marks one of the initial explorations of split learning in the context of semantic segmentation. Furthermore, split networks are shown to be more robust to reconstruction attacks which arise from sharing model information [48].

This effect is observed in BlackFed v1 especially when the number of clients increases or if there is a significant change in the data distribution among clients.

This order is important since it allows us to store the correct server weights in the hashmap. If the server is trained before the client, we found that SPSA-GC often gives unstable results and reduces the metric on the validation set after an epoch. This is corrected only when its the turn of the same client again. Conversely, in the case where the client is updated first, the server adapts in a stable manner to the client weights since backpropagation is allowed in the server. Consequently, in the same epoch, we get a higher and more stable performance for each client, which can be saved in the hashmap for usage during inference.

This is also the case in existing FL approaches like FedAvg. In the proposed approach, as can be seen from Row 3 in the table, the client has a significantly reduced load, with the majority of computation being offloaded to the server.

This characteristic distinguishes our approach as a black-box model compared to existing FL methods, which can be considered as white-box approaches. Recent research on attacking FL methods require the knowledge of either the gradients or the model information, thus rendering BlackFed more resistant to such attacks since gradients or weights are not shared. BlackFed consists of a global server and multiple clients, each possessing their own data. The server is optimized using first order optimization while the client weights are updated using zero order optimization in a round-robin fashion. This introduces the effect of catastrophic forgetting in the network, for which we propose a simple hashmap-based approach. During training, we store the client weights per server so that they can be utilized during inference. With these modifications, our approach demonstrates superior results compared to non-collaborative training and matches the performance of white-box methods, despite being a black-box method itself. Extensive experimentation on the natural and medical domain datasets highlights the effectiveness of BlackFed. Through this endeavor, we aim to propel research towards the development of better privacy preserving federated learning systems. Potential directions for future research can include analysis of other policies for selecting client order during training, and its relation with the disparity in data distribution. One more interesting direction for future research would be the effect of adversarial attacks using generative models on this method. Since masks are shared between the client and server, it would be interesting to check if existing methods are able to recreate client data using them.
