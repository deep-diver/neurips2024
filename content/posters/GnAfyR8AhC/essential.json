The **theoretical findings** offer a new perspective for future work on improving the robustness of foundation models and **practical implementations** offer valuable insights for other multimodal models.", "summary": "Calibrated robust fine-tuning boosts vision-language model accuracy and confidence in out-of-distribution scenarios by using a constrained multimodal contrastive loss and self-distillation.", "takeaways": ["A novel framework improves both out-of-distribution accuracy and confidence calibration in vision-language models.", "Theoretical analysis reveals a shared upper bound for OOD classification and calibration errors, highlighting the importance of ID calibration error and the smallest singular value of the ID input covariance matrix.", "The proposed CaRot method, combining constrained multimodal contrastive learning and EMA self-distillation, effectively reduces these errors, demonstrating superior performance on ImageNet distribution shift benchmarks."], "tldr": "Current robust fine-tuning methods for vision-language models often neglect confidence calibration, leading to unreliable model outputs in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a novel approach called CaRot.  Existing methods improve OOD accuracy but often miscalibrate confidence, making it hard to trust model predictions.\nCaRot simultaneously improves both OOD accuracy and confidence calibration by leveraging a theoretical insight that connects OOD classification and calibration errors to ID data characteristics. The proposed method combines a constrained multimodal contrastive loss and self-distillation to enhance the model's robustness and calibration performance.  Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing approaches on various ImageNet distribution shift benchmarks.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "GnAfyR8AhC/podcast.wav"}
