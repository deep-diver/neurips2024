We use the notation \u00d5(f(n)) to hide polylogarithmic factors in n.", "description": "This table summarizes the upper and lower bounds for the sample complexity of entropy identity testing and Bayesian network identity testing. For entropy identity testing, it provides the upper and lower bounds in terms of the domain size k and the parameter epsilon. For Bayesian network identity testing, it shows the upper bound in terms of the number of nodes n, the in-degree d, and epsilon, comparing it to the previous best-known bound. The table highlights the near-optimal sample complexity achieved for entropy identity testing and the improved sample complexity obtained for Bayesian network identity testing.", "section": "2 Near-optimal entropy testing"}]
