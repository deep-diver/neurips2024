The top part shows how Ms-PoE is implemented within different attention heads of a Transformer model. Each attention head uses a different scaling ratio (ri) for positional encoding. The bottom part visually represents the positional encoding matrices for different scaling ratios. When r_i = 1, it represents the original ROPE positional encoding.  As r_i increases, the positional indices are compressed into a smaller range. This compression helps alleviate the long-term decay effect of RoPE and improves the model's ability to handle information in the middle of long sequences.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "fPmScVB1Td/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Results of the relationship between positional re-scaling and context utilization.
