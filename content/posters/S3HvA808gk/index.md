### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The machine learning community widely believes that AUPRC is superior to AUROC for tasks with imbalanced classes. This paper challenges that notion.  It argues that AUROC and AUPRC differ only in their weighting of false positives and that AUPRC can unduly favor improvements in certain subpopulations, raising fairness concerns.

The paper presents both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence using synthetic and real-world datasets. It establishes that AUROC and AUPRC's differing behaviors are related to how they prioritize improvements over different ranges of model output scores, not class imbalance.  This highlights AUPRC's potential to exacerbate existing biases, particularly in scenarios involving multiple subpopulations, thereby advocating for careful metric selection in order to avoid potentially harmful algorithmic disparities.

### In-depth insights


#### AUROC vs AUPRC
The debate around AUROC vs. AUPRC centers on their relative effectiveness in evaluating classifiers, especially under class imbalance.  **AUROC**, or Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, considers the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across all classification thresholds. **AUPRC**, or Area Under the Precision-Recall curve, focuses on the trade-off between precision and recall. While AUPRC is often favored for imbalanced datasets due to its purported robustness, this paper challenges that notion.  It theoretically demonstrates that AUPRC's apparent superiority stems from its weighting of false positives inversely to the model's prediction confidence.  This inherent weighting can create a bias, particularly in multi-population datasets, where AUPRC might unfairly favor improvements in higher-prevalence subpopulations at the expense of less-represented groups.  **The authors advocate for AUROC in context-independent model evaluation** due to its unbiased weighting of errors, reserving AUPRC for specific deployment scenarios where false negatives or other subpopulation-specific performance characteristics are considerably more consequential than others.

#### Theoretical Analysis
A theoretical analysis section in a research paper typically delves into the mathematical and logical underpinnings of the study's claims.  It often involves developing formal models, deriving theorems, or proving propositions to establish a solid foundation for the empirical findings. **A strong theoretical analysis section enhances the credibility and generalizability of the research**.  It can illuminate the underlying mechanisms and relationships between variables. For example, in a machine learning study, theoretical analysis might involve deriving bounds on the generalization error of a model or analyzing the sensitivity of model performance to various hyperparameters.  **Such rigorous analysis distinguishes a high-quality research paper and builds trust in the conclusions drawn**. The level of mathematical sophistication will vary widely based on the field and complexity of the research topic, but a well-structured theoretical section should clearly outline all assumptions made, provide comprehensive proofs, and carefully define all notation used.  **Clear explanations linking the theoretical results to the empirical observations are also vital**. This bridges the gap between abstract concepts and practical applications.  The absence of a theoretical foundation might make the research appear less robust and its findings limited in scope.

#### Synthetic Experiments
In a research paper, a section on "Synthetic Experiments" would likely detail the use of artificially generated datasets to validate or explore the theoretical claims made earlier.  These experiments would be crucial for several reasons. First, **they offer a controlled environment**, allowing researchers to isolate specific variables and precisely measure their effects on AUROC and AUPRC,  avoiding the confounding factors present in real-world data. Second, **synthetic data can be tailored to test specific hypotheses** related to class imbalance and model behavior under various conditions, such as extreme imbalance ratios or specific types of model errors.  The use of synthetic data allows for systematic investigation of how different levels of class imbalance influence performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC,  potentially uncovering unexpected relationships or confirming theoretical predictions.  **Results from synthetic experiments would then serve as a foundation** for the subsequent real-world experiments, providing a baseline to assess the generalizability of the findings and providing strong support for claims made based on theoretical analyses alone. Therefore, the "Synthetic Experiments" section would provide an essential bridge between theory and practice, strengthening the validity and insights of the entire research paper.

#### Real-World Datasets
A robust evaluation of machine learning (ML) models necessitates the use of real-world datasets.  These datasets, unlike synthetic ones, capture the complexity and nuances of real-world phenomena, including noise, missing data, and class imbalances.  Using real-world datasets enables a more realistic assessment of model performance in actual applications, leading to a more trustworthy assessment of a model's generalizability.  **The choice of real-world datasets is crucial, as they must be representative of the target domain and the problem being addressed**.  Furthermore,  **careful consideration must be given to potential biases present within the datasets** which could skew the results and undermine the validity of the evaluation.  **Ethical considerations are paramount**, especially when dealing with sensitive data. Transparency in data selection and preprocessing is vital for ensuring the reproducibility and trustworthiness of results, promoting the integrity of the entire ML research process. Therefore, it's essential to choose and employ real-world datasets judiciously for a rigorous and responsible evaluation process.

#### Limitations & Future
The 'Limitations & Future Work' section of a research paper is crucial for assessing the study's scope and potential for future development.  A strong limitations section acknowledges inherent constraints, such as **dataset biases**, **model assumptions**, or **methodological choices**, fostering transparency and credibility. It demonstrates a realistic understanding of the research's boundaries, improving the paper's overall impact.  Future work outlines potential extensions and improvements, showcasing the long-term vision and suggesting areas ripe for further investigation.  This might involve addressing limitations, exploring different approaches, tackling more complex problems, or expanding the dataset.  A thoughtful discussion of limitations and future work not only enhances the research paper's rigor but also strengthens its impact and helps establish directions for future research. **Clearly articulating potential shortcomings** and indicating avenues for subsequent research is essential.  A balanced presentation of both limitations and future opportunities ensures a complete and informative contribution.
