Existing deep learning methods often lack sensitivity towards code with multiple functional modules or diverse vulnerability types, hindering their effectiveness in practical applications.  This paper proposes a novel approach called KF-GVD, which tackles these issues by integrating specific vulnerability knowledge into the feature learning process of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\n\nKF-GVD's key innovation lies in its ability to accurately detect vulnerabilities across various functional modules and subtypes **without compromising general performance**. Experimental results showed that KF-GVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different detection tasks and discovers 9 undisclosed vulnerabilities. This work provides an improved model, offering a more efficient and accurate approach to vulnerability detection, enhancing system security and reliability.", "affiliation": "Institute of Systems Engineering, Academy of Military Sciences, PLA", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "OP2D9sIdo4/podcast.wav"}
