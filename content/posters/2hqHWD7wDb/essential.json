Existing approaches often involve computationally expensive operations like parallel transport or require strong assumptions about the function's properties.  This lack of efficient and theoretically sound methods hinders progress in areas such as machine learning with orthonormal constraints or eigenvalue computation. \nThis research introduces and analyzes two new algorithms for Lie group optimization: Lie Heavy-Ball and Lie NAG-SC.  The study rigorously quantifies their convergence rates under standard assumptions.  **Lie NAG-SC is shown to provide acceleration**,  outperforming the momentum-less case and existing manifold optimizers in computational cost and ease of implementation by leveraging the group structure. The findings demonstrate that choosing the right discretization is crucial for efficient Lie group optimization.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "2hqHWD7wDb/podcast.wav"}
