A task-specific prefix is added before processing, allowing the FM server to perform the same processing regardless of the task.

Several recent approaches have emerged to support parameter-efficient fine-tuning. These methods typically involve incorporating trainable adapter layers or modules into the transformer network [11, 10, 17]. Training such layers has been demonstrated to be computationally more economical than full fine-tuning while maintaining performance. Notably, LoRA [12] has gained prominence for its low-rank approximation of model updates, effectively capturing taskspecific knowledge. Beyond LoRA, Compacter [14] introduces adapters parameterised by low-rank hyper-complex multiplication (PHM) layers [39] to achieve a more optimal balance between task performance and the number of trainable parameters.

Another line of work advocates for strategically inserting soft prompts into hidden states of the transformer instead of using trainable adapter modules. For example, prefix-tuning [16] and P-tuning-v2 [20] prepend trainable prefix vectors to keys and values matrices at all transformer layers. Prompt tuning, P-tuning, and DePT [15, 21, 30] are special cases that operate by prepending prompt embeddings to the input at the first layer, with [30] being a hybrid-approach that further uses LoRA to learn updates for the input\u2019s embedding matrix. While these approaches are instanceagnostic and optimise a task-specific prompt, there are also methods to optimise an instance-aware soft prompt. For instance, IDPG [38] generates a soft prompt for each sample, prepended either at the initial word-embedding layer (version-S) or all layers (version-M). LPT [19] inserts a prompt into some intermediate layer (i) to eliminate gradient calculation below it for faster training and (ii) to retain more task-related information (which could be lost if it had to be propagated through lower layers).

Furthermore, we demonstrate that LoPA achieves a more balanced trade-off between specificity and generalization compared to existing approaches for enhancing learned models, such as prompt tuning [15], which solely focuses on a general task-specific soft prompt, and IDPG [38], which emphasizes an instance-specific prompt.

The main limitation of LoPA is that its effectiveness as an alternative to LoRA was demonstrated on a set of benchmark tasks, but this may not hold for obscure real-life user tasks where LoRA or even full fine-tuning might be necessary. Further investigation into its performance on real-world tasks is part of our future work. In this work, we assumed the learned soft prompt to be prepended as a prefix to the input. Future research could explore the effects of positioning it as a suffix or randomly within the input. Finally, the foundation model combined with LoPA can be viewed as a Conditional Auto-Encoder, where soft prompt vectors exist in a latent subspace rather than an offset subspace. This viewpoint raises intriguing questions, such as whether the observed performance improvements result from inferring and compressing task-specific knowledge and providing it as additional information. Investigating this alternate perspective could lead to further performance enhancements by developing more sophisticated auto-encoding systems.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
