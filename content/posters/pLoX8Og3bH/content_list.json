Unfortunately, there are currently very few datasets available, including for example MVSeg dataset that focuses purely toward eye-level view; and it features the sparse annotation nature due to the intensive demands of labeling process. To address these key challenges of the MVSS task, this paper presents two major contributions: the introduction of MVUAV, a new MVSS benchmark dataset, and the development of a dedicated semi-supervised MVSS baseline - SemiMV. Our MVUAV dataset is captured via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which offers a unique oblique bird\u2019s-eye view complementary to the existing MVSS datasets; it also encompasses a broad range of day/night lighting conditions and over 30 semantic categories. In the meantime, to better leverage the sparse annotations and extra unlabeled RGB-Thermal videos, a semi-supervised learning baseline, SemiMV, is proposed to enforce consistency regularization through a dedicated Cross-collaborative Consistency Learning (C3L) module and a denoised temporal aggregation strategy.

With the increasing accessibility of thermal sensors in capturing thermal radiation of objects with temperature above absolute zero, multispectral semantic segmentation (MSS) [12, 13, 14, 15], where both RGB and infrared thermal cameras are engaged, starts to gain notable traction. An exemplar illustration is shown in Fig. 1. This multispectral imaging setup excels specifically in scenes with unfavorable visual conditions, such as low-light or overexposure. On the other hand, the dynamic and ever-changing nature of real-world scenarios has propelled interests in video semantic segmentation (VSS) [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] with impressive segmentation performance.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, our strategy utilizes a small number of sparsely labeled RGB-Thermal videos, alongside massive amount of unlabeled videos. In the closely-related domain of semi-supervised RGB-based semantic image segmentation, the idea of consistency regularization has played important role in the eventual performance. Its efficacy stems from perturbation-invariant training, by enforcing consistent predictions despite of varied perturbations presented in unlabeled RGB images at different processing levels: input [22], feature [23, 24], or network [25]. There motivates us to explore consistency regularization in RGB-Thermal videos. In fact, MVSS seems to be an ideal setting, since RGB and thermal images essentially capture the same scenes from different sensory perspectives, that offers innate input perturbations. Further, processing the multimodal data through two parallel networks with distinct parameters also leads to valuable feature-level and network-level perturbations. Building on these insights, we introduce SemiMV, a novel semi-supervised MVSS framework. At its core is a Cross-collaborative Consistency Learning (C3L) module, where the RGB and thermal streams mutually offer pseudo-supervisions to each other.

FCN [33], as a milestone work, uses a fully convolutional network for per-pixel prediction. Subsequent innovations, such as dilation convolution [34], pyramid pooling [35], and attention mechanisms [36, 37, 38], have enriched segmentation by integrating contextual information and capturing global contexts. Recently, transformer-based methods [39, 40, 41, 42] have gained prominence with the advent of Visual Transformer [43]. For a detailed overview, readers are advised to refer to comprehensive survey papers [44]. Multispectral semantic segmentation (MSS) is an emergent field that aims to enhance model robustness in adverse lighting conditions by integrating RGB and thermal imagery [45]. The primary challenge in MSS lies in effectively merging RGB and thermal data. Various strategies have been developed, such as concatenation [46, 47], element-wise summation [48, 49], bridgingthen-fusing [14], attention-weighted fusion [50], explicit extract and fusion [13], and cross-modal fusion [15]. Additionally, there is a related area of research focused on multimodal RGBD-based segmentation [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], which addresses some limitations of purely RGB-based segmentation. On the other hand, video semantic segmentation (VSS) is gaining traction with the growing importance of dynamic video processing. VSS models [18, 67, 16, 68, 69, 70] have focused on leveraging temporal contexts of video frames. Notably, some studies [71, 72, 73] utilize optical flow [74] to warp features from neighbouring frames for feature alignment and aggregation. Recently, attention-based methods [17, 75, 76, 77] have been proposed to selectively retrieve information from past frames for improving current frame segmentation, yielding promising results. Multispectral video semantic segmentation (MVSS) is a nascent area that combines the strengths of multispectral and temporal contexts.

Second, it is crucial to maintain annotation consistency across video frames, otherwise objects might be misidentified in different frames. Third, the UAV-view presents a more complex and crowded visual field compared to the eye-level view in MVSeg, making object identification and silhouette distinction more challenging. To overcome these challenges, we first overlay thermal heatmaps onto corresponding RGB images to visually aid annotators in identifying objects in complex scenes. Meanwhile, video frames from the same video are annotated by the same person to ensure temporal consistency. Three inspectors review and correct the annotations to make sure temporal consistency, with the assistance of video-level annotation visualization.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
