This limitation motivates the exploration of learning-augmented data structures.  The paper investigates the challenges of integrating predictions into priority queues to improve worst-case performance. \nThe researchers propose and analyze three different prediction models applied to a skip-list based priority queue. They demonstrate that leveraging predictions significantly enhances performance for various priority queue operations, including insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum element.  They also provide lower bounds that prove the optimality of their proposed algorithm in two of the three prediction models.  The use of skip lists allows for efficient implementation and optimality in the worst-case scenarios.", "affiliation": "ENSAE, Ecole Polytechnique", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "1ATLLgvURu/podcast.wav"}
