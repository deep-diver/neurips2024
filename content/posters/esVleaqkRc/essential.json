Existing methods struggle with scalability and generalizability. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing NEUR2BILO, a data-driven framework that leverages the power of neural networks.  BiLO is challenging because of its nested structure, where a leader makes decisions that account for the follower's response.  Finding the optimal solution in such scenarios is complex and computationally expensive.\nNEUR2BILO tackles this by embedding neural network approximations of either the leader or follower's value function within an easy-to-solve mixed-integer program.  These neural networks are trained via supervised learning on a dataset of previously solved instances.  The framework then uses this approximation to quickly solve the problem. The results show NEUR2BILO delivers high-quality solutions significantly faster than existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple applications, including network design and interdiction problems.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "esVleaqkRc/podcast.wav"}
