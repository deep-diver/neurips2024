The x-axis represents the number of nodes in the network, and the y-axis represents the relative error.  It highlights that NEUR2BILO methods, particularly the lower-level approximation, offer substantially faster and more accurate solutions than the standard B&C approach, especially as the problem size (number of nodes) increases.
