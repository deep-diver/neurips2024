We employ automatic metrics (i.e., CLIP [37] score, PSNR) and human evaluation to evaluate the performance.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed ReVideo model with three other existing video editing methods: InsV2V, AnyV2V, and Pika.  The comparison uses both automatic metrics (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), CLIP text alignment score, and consistency score) and human evaluation (overall quality and editing target accuracy).  The time taken for each method to perform the editing task is also included.  The results show ReVideo's superior performance across most metrics, indicating improved accuracy and efficiency in video editing.", "section": "4 Comparison"}]
