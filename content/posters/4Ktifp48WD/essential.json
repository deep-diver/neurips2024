Existing DP optimization methods struggle with the computational cost and accuracy limitations in such scenarios, hindering the development of privacy-preserving AI systems. This paper addresses these issues by focusing on the sparsity of individual gradients.\nThe researchers developed new DP algorithms that leverage the gradient sparsity. They achieved almost optimal accuracy rates for convex optimization and near-optimal dimension-independent rates for near-stationary points in nonconvex settings. This breakthrough was made possible through a novel analysis of bias reduction and randomly-stopped biased SGD algorithms. This work provides more efficient and scalable methods for training large-scale private AI models, advancing the field of privacy-preserving machine learning.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "4Ktifp48WD/podcast.wav"}
