This technique yields nearly-tight bounds in the convex case (similar to first row of Table 2), and for the nonconvex case the stationarity rates are nearly dimension independent (last row of Table 2). The main challenge here is the bias in mean estimation, which dramatically deteriorates the rates of SGD. Hence we propose a bias reduction method inspired by the simulation literature [14]. This technique uses a random batch size in an exponentially increasing schedule and a telescopic estimator of the gradient which\u2014used in conjunction with our DP mean estimation methods\u2014provides a stochastic first-order oracle that attains bias similar to the one of a full-batch algorithm, with moderately bounded variance. Note that using the full-batch in this case would lead to polynomially weaker rates; in turn, our method leverages the batch randomization to conduct a more careful privacy accounting based on subsampling and the fully-adaptive properties of DP [15]. The introduction of random batch sizes and the random evolution of the privacy budget leads to various challenges in analyzing the performance of SGD. First, we analyze a randomly stopped method, where the stopping time dictated by the privacy budget. Noting that the standard SGD analysis bounds the cumulative regret, which is a submartingale, we carry out this analysis by integrating ideas from submartingales and stopping times [16].

This algorithm is nearly-optimal for approximate-DP. For pure-DP, the previous algorithm requires an additional smoothness assumption, hence we propose a second algorithm based on the exponential mechanism [18] run over a net of suitably sparse vectors.

From a practical perspective, the main open question is whether our rates are attainable without prior knowledge of $s$ ; note that all our mean estimation algorithms (which carries over to our optimization results) depend crucially on knowledge of this parameter.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
