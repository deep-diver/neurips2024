### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing dataset condensation techniques primarily focus on classification tasks and struggle when applied to time series forecasting due to differences in evaluation metrics.  Time series forecasting requires similar predictions across all data points, unlike classification which only needs identical labels. This poses a significant challenge in adapting classification-oriented condensation methods. 

This paper addresses this gap by introducing CondTSF, a novel one-line plugin specifically designed for dataset condensation in time series forecasting.  CondTSF improves performance by theoretically analyzing the optimization objective and reformulating it to reduce the prediction distance between models trained on the condensed and full datasets.  Extensive experiments on eight time series datasets consistently demonstrate CondTSF's effectiveness, particularly at low compression ratios, showing significant improvements across various datasets and condensation methods.

> This figure demonstrates the difference in evaluation metrics between dataset condensation for classification and time series forecasting.  The left panel illustrates that for classification, successful condensation is determined by whether the model trained on the condensed dataset produces the same class labels as the model trained on the full dataset, regardless of the similarity in the output logits distribution.  Conversely, for time series forecasting, successful condensation requires that the predictions from the condensed dataset model closely match the predictions from the full dataset model across all data points.  The right panel shows that the proposed CondTSF method improves the performance of several existing dataset condensation methods, across various datasets, especially at lower condensation ratios.

### In-depth insights


#### Condensation Methods
Dataset condensation techniques aim to create smaller, representative subsets of large datasets for training machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks.  **Existing methods primarily focus on classification tasks**, where success is measured by whether the condensed dataset yields identical classification labels to the original.  However, **applying these methods directly to time series forecasting presents challenges** due to the differences in performance evaluation.  In time series forecasting, the focus shifts to minimizing the distance between predictions made by models trained on the original and condensed datasets.  Therefore, new methods are needed that **specifically address the optimization objective of time series forecasting**, accounting for the different notions of similarity between predictions and the unique characteristics of time series data.  Condensation methods for time series data must carefully consider preserving temporal dependencies and crucial patterns within the data, a crucial aspect not always addressed adequately in existing classification-centric approaches.  **Future research should explore novel loss functions**, tailored to time series forecasting metrics, and **methods for generating synthetic time series data that preserves temporal structure** and distributional properties of the original data.

#### CondTSF Plugin
The CondTSF plugin, as presented, addresses a critical limitation in applying dataset condensation techniques to time series forecasting.  Existing methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, often fail to adequately handle the nuances of time series prediction. **CondTSF directly tackles this by focusing on the optimization objective specific to time series forecasting**, minimizing the distance between predictions from models trained on the full and condensed datasets.  This is a significant improvement because it moves beyond simply matching labels (as in classification) to focus on the actual values predicted, making it far more suitable for forecasting accuracy.  **The one-line plugin nature of CondTSF makes it highly versatile and easily integrated** into existing dataset condensation workflows.  This approach is supported by both theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results showing consistent performance gains across numerous datasets, particularly at lower condensation ratios, demonstrating its practical utility and efficiency in managing the computational costs associated with training large models on extensive time series data.

#### TSF Optimization
Optimizing time series forecasting (TSF) models involves improving their accuracy and efficiency.  **A key challenge lies in the high dimensionality and complexity of time series data**, often requiring sophisticated algorithms.  **Effective optimization strategies leverage advanced techniques** like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and Adam, each with strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific dataset and model architecture. **Regularization techniques** help prevent overfitting, ensuring generalizability to unseen data.  **Hyperparameter tuning** is critical, and often involves techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.  **Feature engineering** also plays a significant role, involving transformations, selection, and potentially deep learning for automatic feature extraction.  **The choice of evaluation metrics** (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE) is vital for comparing models effectively.  Ultimately, TSF optimization is an iterative process combining careful model selection, algorithmic choices, data preprocessing, and rigorous evaluation.

#### Experiment Results
The heading 'Experiment Results' in a research paper warrants a thorough examination.  It should present a clear and concise summary of the findings, avoiding excessive detail.  **Emphasis should be placed on the most significant results** that directly support the paper's central claims.  These results need to be presented in a way that is both easy to understand and visually appealing, often through tables and graphs.  **Statistical significance must be clearly indicated**, using appropriate metrics and error bars to showcase the reliability of the findings. The section must also clearly highlight whether the results met the study's objectives and discuss any unexpected or noteworthy observations. A strong 'Experiment Results' section will **demonstrate a clear understanding of experimental design** and data analysis.  Any limitations or sources of error in the experimentation process must be honestly and transparently acknowledged. Overall, the effectiveness of this section rests on its ability to convincingly communicate the core results to a reader, establishing the paper's validity and reliability.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore CondTSF's efficacy with more complex models beyond DLinear, investigating its adaptability and performance gains.  **Extending CondTSF to handle diverse time series characteristics (e.g., varying frequencies, seasonality, noise levels) is crucial** for broader applicability.  Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of CondTSF further, particularly regarding its interaction with different model architectures, optimization objectives, and data distributions would be valuable.  **A deeper analysis of the trade-offs between condensation ratio and model performance, and potentially a more adaptive approach to ratio selection, is another important avenue.**  Finally, **comparing CondTSF with other condensation techniques on a larger scale with more datasets and diverse evaluation metrics would provide robust validation.** and broaden our understanding of its effectiveness and limitations.

> The figure illustrates the overall process of dataset condensation using CondTSF.  It starts with a full training dataset 'f', from which an initial synthetic dataset 's' is randomly sampled.  This 's' is then optimized in two stages. The first stage involves Parameter Matching, which focuses on minimizing the distance between the full dataset's model parameters (Œ∏f) and the synthetic dataset's model parameters (Œ∏s) ‚Äì this is Gradient Term Optimization. The second stage involves CondTSF, which minimizes the label error (Llabel) by optimizing the Value Term. This two-stage process results in a distilled synthetic dataset 's*', which is expected to be a more effective and efficient representation of the original dataset 'f' for training.
