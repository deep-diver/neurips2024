Time series forecasting requires similar predictions across all data points, unlike classification which only needs identical labels. This poses a significant challenge in adapting classification-oriented condensation methods. \nThis paper addresses this gap by introducing CondTSF, a novel one-line plugin specifically designed for dataset condensation in time series forecasting.  CondTSF improves performance by theoretically analyzing the optimization objective and reformulating it to reduce the prediction distance between models trained on the condensed and full datasets.  Extensive experiments on eight time series datasets consistently demonstrate CondTSF's effectiveness, particularly at low compression ratios, showing significant improvements across various datasets and condensation methods.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "L1jajNWON5/podcast.wav"}
