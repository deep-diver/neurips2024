However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas.

These models typically build channel-level tokens by segmenting non-overlapping patches with large receptive fields (e.g., 1 second) from single channels. However, this approach makes it challenging to capture the rapid process of brain dynamics. Moreover, while these models further utilize Transformer to capture the spatial relationships among these tokens, they do not encourage region-level embeddings, either through their architecture [52] or their pre-training objective [10]. Therefore, the effectiveness of building brain foundation models based on these spatial-temporal backbones is still under exploration, especially for cognitive tasks (e.g., speech decoding), which are of great value in the field of neuroscience. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Besides, unlike LaBraM [28], Brant doesn\u2019t introduce spatial embeddings to identify the spatial location of each channel. Since the electrodes are sparsely distributed in the brain and the raw sEEG signals on the same electrode are highly correlated, it\u2019s fairly easy to identify their spatial relationships through their values. As demonstrated in iTransformer [34], this modeling approach is well suited for detecting time-delay events, e.g., seizure detection. For speech decoding tasks, sEEG often requires bi-polar re-reference (or Laplacian re-reference) to remove the high correlations among channels, thus avoiding model overfitting [49]. Once the correlations among channels have been removed, Brant will lose the ability to model spatial relationships among channels.

TS-TCC [20] tokenizes raw sEEG signals into region-level tokens with a stack of 1D depthwise convolution blocks, but it lacks a temporal Transformer for further integration over time. CNN-BiGRU [37] introduces a stack of GRU layers on top of these tokens to perform temporal integration. EEG-Conformer [44] introduces a temporal Transformer to better integrate global temporal information, which makes it outperform CNNBiGRU. However, EEG-Conformer tokenizes raw sEEG signals with the temporal-spatial convolution, applying the same convolutional kernel across different channels, which overlooks the specificity of brain computation [8]. This also raises a challenge for the effectiveness of current sEEG foundation models, which rely on shared convolution blocks across individual channels. Neuro-BERT [50] further introduces mask modeling to learn contextual embeddings, which makes it outperform EEGConformer.

This model learns robust temporal and discriminative representations from time series by designing a tough cross-view prediction task and a contextual contrasting module. Since sEEG is a unique type of time series, this model is suitable to serve as a baseline for comparison.   \n\u2022 CNN-BiGRU[37]: A supervised model that consists of both CNN module and Bi-GRU module, to capture contextual features from EEG signals. This model is mainly designed for ECoG-based vocal production tasks, similar to ours. Since ECoG and sEEG are both intracranial neural signals of the brain, this model is suitable to serve as a baseline for comparison.   \n\u2022 EEG-Conformer[44]: A supervised model that consists of both CNN module and Transformer module, to encapsulate local and global features in a unified EEG classification framework. EEG-Conformer is mainly designed for EEG-based motor imagination tasks. Since the data modes of EEG and sEEG are similar, and the signals primarily pertain to vocal production, this model is suitable to serve as a baseline for comparison.   \n\u2022 Neuro-BERT[50]: A self-supervised model that consists of both CNN module and Transformer module, to encapsulate local and global features. This model learns robust contextual representations from EEG by introducing mask modeling. Since the data modes of EEG and sEEG are similar, this model is suitable to serve as a baseline for comparison.   \n\u2022 DeWave[19]: A supervised model that consists of both Conformer module [24] and Transformer module, to encapsulate local and global features for language decoding. We adopt its encoder, which consists of a 6-layer Conformer and a 6-layer Transformer. Then, we add a classification head, which is also used in our model, for downstream word classification. Since DeWave is also designed for language decoding, this model is suitable to serve as a baseline for comparison.   \n\u2022 BrainBERT[49]: A self-supervised model for sEEG recordings that bridges modern representation learning approaches to neuroscience. BrainBERT builds universal representation based on the superlet spectrograms of one single sEEG channel without modeling the spatial relationships among channels.

Brant is mainly designed for medicine, serving as a sEEG foundation model. Although Brant mainly evaluates its performance on the low-level modeling tasks [51] (e.g., neural signal forecasting, imputation, etc.), Brant achieves SOTA performance on some high-level modeling tasks (e.g., seizure detection).

LaBraM serves as an EEG foundation model, achieving SOTA performance on various downstream EEG tasks.
