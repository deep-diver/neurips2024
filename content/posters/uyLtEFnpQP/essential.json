Existing methods either pre-train models on whole brain-level tokens, ignoring regional differences, or use channel-level tokens without testing on complex tasks like speech decoding. This paper addresses these issues by developing a new model named Du-IN. \n\nDu-IN employs discrete codex-guided mask modeling to extract contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens from language-related brain networks. This approach proves superior, achieving state-of-the-art results on a 61-word classification task using a newly collected Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset.  The model's success highlights the importance of region-specific processing in decoding speech and showcases the potential of neuro-inspired AI in brain-computer interfaces.  **The paper's findings have significant implications for less invasive BCI development.**", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "uyLtEFnpQP/podcast.wav"}
