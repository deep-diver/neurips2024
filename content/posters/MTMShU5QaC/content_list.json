Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in generating text that caters to a wide range of human needs, primarily through a two-stage process: first, pretraining on noisy web-scale datasets, then fine-tuning on a smaller, preference-specific dataset. This fine-tuning process aims to align the generative model\u2019s outputs with human preferences, without significantly diminishing the capabilities gained from pretraining. Extending this fine-tuning approach to text-to-image models offers the prospect of tailoring image generation to user preferences, a goal that has remained relatively under-explored compared to its counterpart in the language domain.

Per-sample feedback is a promising alternative to pairwise preference data, as the former is abundantly available on the Internet. Per-sample feedback provides valuable preference signals for aligning models, as it captures information about the users\u2019 subjective distribution of desired and undesired generations. For instance, as seen in Fig. 2, given an image and its caption, a user can easily say if they like or dislike the image based on criteria such as attention to detail and fidelity to the prompt. While paired preference data provides more information about relative preferences, gathering such data is an expensive and time-consuming process in which annotators must rank images according to their preferences. In contrast, learning from per-sample feedback can utilize the vast amounts of per-sample preference data collected on the web and increases the applicability of aligning models with user preferences at scale. Inspired by these large-scale use cases, we explore how to directly fine-tune T2I models on per-image binary preference data.

Specifically, KTO bypasses the need to maximize the likelihood from paired preferences and, instead, directly optimizes an LLM using a utility function that encapsulates the characteristics of human decisionmaking. While KTO is easy to apply to large language models, we cannot immediately apply it to diffusion models as it would require sampling across all possible trajectories in the denoising process. Although existing works approximate this likelihood by sampling once through the reverse diffusion process, back-propagating over all sampling steps is extremely computationally expensive. To overcome this, we present a utility maximization objective that applies to each individual sampling step, circumventing the need for sampling through the entire reverse diffusion process.

In this work, we focus on diffusion models [43, 44, 24] due to their popularity and open-source availability. While these models are capable of synthesizing complex, high quality images after pretraining, they are generally not well-aligned with the preferences of human users. Thus, they can often generate images with noticeable issues, such as poorly rendered hands and faces. We seek to address these issues by introducing a fine-tuning objective that allows text-to-image diffusion models to learn directly from human preference data. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Improving Language Models using Human Feedback. Following web-scale pretraining, large language models are further improved by fine-tuning on a curated set of data (supervised fine-tuning) and then using reinforcement learning to learn from human feedback. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [2, 12, 13], in particular, has been shown to be an effective means of aligning these models with user preferences [59, 5, 31, 30, 29, 45, 10, 3, 6, 22]. While this approach has been successful [1, 46], the difficulties in fine-tuning an LLM using RLHF [36, 58, 49, 17, 21, 42, 4] has led to the development of alternative fine-tuning objectives [35, 18, 56, 57]. Along these lines, KTO [18] introduces a fine-tuning objective that trains an LLM to maximize the utility of its output according to the Kahneman & Tversky model of human utility [47]. This utility maximization framework does not require pairwise preference data and only needs per-sample binary feedback. In this work, we explore aligning diffusion models given binary feedback data. As a first step in this direction, we generalize the utility maximization framework to the setting of diffusion models. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Improving Diffusion Models using Human Feedback. Before the recent developments in aligning T2I models using pairwise preferences, supervised fine-tuning was the popular approach for improving these models. Existing supervised fine-tuning approaches curate a dataset using preference models [39, 32], pre-trained image models [41, 8, 16, 51, 50], and/or human experts [15], and fine-tune the model on this dataset. Similarly, many works have explored using reward models to fine-tune diffusion models via policy gradient techniques [19, 23, 9, 52, 14, 33, 28, 20] to improve aspects such as image-text fidelity. Similar to our work, ReFL [52], DRaFT [14], and AlignProp [33] align T2I diffusion models with human preferences. However, these methods require back-propagating the reward through the reverse diffusion sampling process, which is extremely expensive in memory. As a result, these works depend on techniques such as low-rank weight updates [25] and sampling from only a subset of steps in the reverse process, thus limiting their ability to fine-tune the model. In contrast, the Diffusion-KTO objective extends to each step in the denoising process, thereby avoiding such memory issues. More broadly, the main drawbacks of these reinforcement learning based approaches are: limited generalization, e.g. closed vocabulary [28, 20], reward hacking [14, 33, 9], and they rely on a potentially biased reward model. Since Diffusion-KTO trains directly on open-vocabulary preference data, we find that it can generalize to an open-vocabulary and avoids issues such as reward hacking. Recently, works such as Diffusion-DPO[48] and D3PO [53] present extensions of the DPO objective [35] to the setting of diffusion models. Diffusion-KTO shares similarities with Diffusion-DPO and D3PO, as we build upon these works to introduce a reward model-free alignment objective. However, unlike these works, Diffusion-KTO does not rely on pairwise preference data and, instead, uses only per-image binary feedback.

Our SFT baseline fine-tunes SD v1-5 on the subset of images that are labelled as preferred using the standard denoising objective. Our CSFT baseline, similar to the approach introduced into HPS v1 [51], appends a prefix to each prompt (\u201cgood image\", \u201cbad image\u201d) and finetunes SD v1-5 using the standard diffusion objective while training with preferred and non-preferred samples independently.

For the third prompt, which is a detailed description of a woman, the output from our Diffusion-KTO model provides the best anatomical features, symmetry, and pose compared to the other approaches. Notably, for this third prompt, the generation of the Diffusion-KTO model also generated a background is more aesthetically pleasing. The final row uses a difficult prompt that requires a lot of different objects in a niche art style. While all models were able to depict the right style, i.e. geometric art, only the Diffusion-KTO generation includes key components such as the \"moon,\" \"flying fish,\" and \"fisherman\" objects.

As a result, the preference distribution in this data may be skewed toward inappropriate or otherwise unwanted imagery. Furthermore, in this work, we examined three main models of human utility, from which we have concluded the Kahneman-Tversky model to perform best based on empirical results. However, we believe that the choice of utility function, as well as the underlying assumptions behind such functions, remains an open question. Additionally, since Diffusion-KTO fine-tunes a pretrained T2I model, it inherits the weaknesses of this model, including generating images that reflect and propagate negative stereotypes.

We extend the utility maximization approach, recently introduced to align LLMs, to the setting of diffusion models and explore various utility functions. Diffusion-KTO aligned diffusion models lead to demonstrable improvements in image preference and image-text alignment when evaluated by human judges and automated metrics. While our work has empirically found the Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility to work best, we believe that the choice of utility functions remains an open question and promising direction for future work.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
