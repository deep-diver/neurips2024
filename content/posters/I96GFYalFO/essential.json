Existing methods struggle to share knowledge effectively or tailor solutions to local data distributions.  This leads to suboptimal global collaboration and unsuitable personalized models.\n\nThe proposed FedSSP framework innovatively uses spectral knowledge to address the knowledge conflict resulting from domain shifts and provides personalized preference modules to accommodate heterogeneous graph structures across clients. By sharing generic spectral knowledge, FedSSP enables effective global collaboration while also utilizing PGPA to ensure suitable local applications.  Experimental results on various cross-dataset and cross-domain tasks demonstrate that FedSSP significantly outperforms existing FGL approaches, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "I96GFYalFO/podcast.wav"}
