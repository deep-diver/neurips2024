### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current neural network (NN)-based soft sensors prioritize offline accuracy over online stability and interpretability. This limitation hinders real-time applications where reliable and stable performance is critical. Existing training techniques, such as early stopping and adaptive learning rates, are unsuitable for online deployment, often leading to considerable performance drops.  The paper addresses this gap by introducing a new framework.

The paper introduces the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU), a novel NN architecture designed for stable training. AOPU minimizes variance estimation (MVE) by truncating the gradient backpropagation at dual parameters, optimizing updates, and enhancing robustness.  AOPU also approximates natural gradient descent (NGD), a computationally expensive method, making it feasible for NN optimization.  Empirical results demonstrate superior stability and performance compared to existing methods.  The Rank Ratio metric quantifies the heterogeneity of training data and is used to better understand model performance.

> This figure compares two neural network structures: a conventional deep neural network (DNN) and a broad learning system (BLS).  The key difference highlighted is the distinction between 'trackable' and 'untrackable' parameters.  Trackable parameters are those directly involved in the linear transformation of inputs to outputs, represented by solid green lines.  Untrackable parameters, shown by orange curves, represent non-linear operations like activation functions that are not directly part of the linear transformation process. The figure illustrates how the BLS structure modifies the DNN by introducing an augmentation block that generates additional features, leading to a more robust feature extraction and potentially better approximation of the Minimum Variance Estimator (MVE).

### In-depth insights


#### AOPU: MVE Approx
The heading 'AOPU: MVE Approx' suggests a discussion of how the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) approximates Minimum Variance Estimation (MVE).  This likely involves explaining the mathematical underpinnings of AOPU, demonstrating how it leverages properties of orthogonal projections and truncated gradients to achieve an efficient, stable approximation of MVE, especially in scenarios involving high-dimensional data or complex models where exact MVE calculation is computationally prohibitive. **A key aspect would be to show how the approximation impacts the training stability and the model's overall performance**, perhaps by comparing it to standard gradient descent methods and other related techniques.  **The analysis would likely highlight the tradeoffs between computational efficiency and accuracy of the MVE approximation**, possibly providing empirical evidence that the approximation is sufficiently accurate for practical applications, especially in the context of industrial soft sensors where stable online operation is paramount. Finally, **the discussion might delve into the interpretation of the AOPU's output as an approximation of the MVE estimator**, linking it to broader statistical concepts and its implications for model interpretability and reliability.

#### Stable NN Training
Stable training of neural networks (NNs) is crucial for reliable performance, especially in applications demanding real-time predictions and robustness to noisy data or fluctuating conditions.  This paper delves into techniques for achieving stable NN training, focusing on the impact of minimizing variance in parameter estimation.  **Approximated Orthogonal Projection Units (AOPUs)** are introduced as a novel NN architecture designed to stabilize the training process. AOPUs cleverly truncate the gradient backpropagation, which helps achieve stability.  The core idea centers around approximating the minimum variance estimator (MVE) within the NN framework.  **The concept of trackable versus untrackable parameters** within the NN is introduced, forming the theoretical foundation of the proposed method. By strategically focusing on the optimization of trackable parameters, AOPUs mitigate the impact of untrackable parameters' variability on the training process, making it more stable.  **Rank Ratio (RR)**, an interpretability index, is also introduced to quantify the linear independence of samples and predict training performance. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements for AOPUs compared to other state-of-the-art NNs in achieving stable convergence.  **The key is to balance model capacity with the need for robust training**; over-parameterization can increase instability despite higher accuracy.

#### Dual Parameter Update
The concept of "Dual Parameter Update" in the context of the provided research paper, likely refers to a training methodology that employs two sets of parameters: **trackable** and **untrackable**.  The trackable parameters are directly optimized during the training process, while the untrackable parameters, influenced by activation functions, are indirectly updated. This dual approach likely aims to **approximate the Natural Gradient Descent (NGD)** method while mitigating its computational cost. By truncating backpropagation at the dual parameters and optimizing the trackable parameters based on truncated gradients, the model effectively **approximates Minimum Variance Estimation (MVE)**. The dual parameter update method enhances training stability and robustness by focusing on stable convergence rather than solely prioritizing accuracy. The use of a rank ratio (RR) metric further provides an **interpretability index** to gauge the quality of the approximation and to predict training performance.  The effectiveness hinges on the assumption that the features are well-extracted, making it essential to utilize robust feature extraction methods and data augmentation techniques.

#### Rank Ratio (RR)
The Rank Ratio (RR) serves as a crucial **interpretability index** within the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) framework.  It quantifies the ratio of linearly independent samples within each mini-batch, effectively measuring the **data heterogeneity and diversity**.  A high RR (close to 1) indicates that the model's output closely approximates the Minimum Variance Estimation (MVE), aligning optimization more closely with the Natural Gradient Descent (NGD). This suggests superior performance and stability. Conversely, a low RR (close to 0) implies compromised computational precision and suboptimal performance. **RR's value dynamically influences AOPU's convergence**, with high RR values leading to stable convergence and low RR values resulting in unstable or non-convergent behavior. Therefore, monitoring RR during training provides valuable insights into the model's dynamics and can help predict performance and identify potential issues early on.  **RR acts as a critical indicator of AOPU's approximation fidelity to MVE and NGD**, which are key theoretical underpinnings of AOPU's superior performance.

#### AOPU Limitations
The Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) model, while demonstrating strong performance and stability in regression tasks, is not without limitations.  **A core limitation is its dependence on the Rank Ratio (RR) to ensure numerical stability and convergence.** A low RR, which can occur with larger batch sizes or shorter sequence lengths, can lead to computational issues and model instability. This highlights a **trade-off between batch size, sequence length, and AOPU's effective approximation of the Natural Gradient**.  Furthermore, the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of the data augmentation module and activation functions, underscoring the need for careful hyperparameter tuning. While AOPU exhibits superior stability compared to other methods, **it is not a purely plug-and-play model** and requires careful consideration of data characteristics and hyperparameter settings for optimal deployment.  Finally, **AOPU's theoretical foundation relies on assumptions** that may not always hold in real-world data, particularly concerning the linear independence of data samples and normality of noise.

> The figure shows the data flow of the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) model.  Input data is first processed, likely through a feature extraction module (not explicitly shown). The core of the AOPU involves 'trackable' and 'dual' parameters. The gradient is calculated based on the objective function and backpropagated, but this propagation stops at the dual parameter.  The gradient information at the dual parameter is then used to update the trackable parameters. This process is shown to approximate the natural gradient. The updated trackable parameters then lead to a final prediction which is compared to the actual output data, influencing the next iteration.
