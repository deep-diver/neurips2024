This limitation hinders real-time applications where reliable and stable performance is critical. Existing training techniques, such as early stopping and adaptive learning rates, are unsuitable for online deployment, often leading to considerable performance drops.  The paper addresses this gap by introducing a new framework.\nThe paper introduces the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU), a novel NN architecture designed for stable training. AOPU minimizes variance estimation (MVE) by truncating the gradient backpropagation at dual parameters, optimizing updates, and enhancing robustness.  AOPU also approximates natural gradient descent (NGD), a computationally expensive method, making it feasible for NN optimization.  Empirical results demonstrate superior stability and performance compared to existing methods.  The Rank Ratio metric quantifies the heterogeneity of training data and is used to better understand model performance.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Manufacturing"}, "podcast_path": "xqrlhsbcwN/podcast.wav"}
