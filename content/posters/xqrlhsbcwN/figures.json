The key difference highlighted is the distinction between \"trackable\" and \"untrackable\" parameters.  Trackable parameters are those directly involved in the linear transformation of inputs to outputs, represented by solid green lines.  Untrackable parameters, shown by orange curves, represent non-linear operations like activation functions that are not directly part of the linear transformation process. The figure illustrates how the BLS structure modifies the DNN by introducing an augmentation block that generates additional features, leading to a more robust feature extraction and potentially better approximation of the Minimum Variance Estimator (MVE).", "section": "2 AOPU:Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "xqrlhsbcwN/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: AOPU's data flow schematic.

Input data is first processed, likely through a feature extraction module (not explicitly shown). The core of the AOPU involves \"trackable\" and \"dual\" parameters. The gradient is calculated based on the objective function and backpropagated, but this propagation stops at the dual parameter.  The gradient information at the dual parameter is then used to update the trackable parameters. This process is shown to approximate the natural gradient. The updated trackable parameters then lead to a final prediction which is compared to the actual output data, influencing the next iteration.", "section": "2 AOPU:Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "xqrlhsbcwN/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Histogram of the frequency distribution of RR on SRU dataset under varying batch sizes and sequence length settings.", "description": "This figure shows the distribution of the Rank Ratio (RR) for different batch sizes and sequence lengths on the SRU dataset.
