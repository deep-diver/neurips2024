Existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are tailored for this pairwise data, and utilizing reward datasets often involves suboptimal pruning techniques, which leads to information loss and reduced performance.  This creates a need for more versatile alignment techniques capable of effectively utilizing both data types.\nThis paper proposes InfoNCA and NCA, two novel algorithms that bridge this gap using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE). These algorithms directly optimize language models using explicitly annotated reward data and are also adaptable for pairwise preference data.  **InfoNCA is shown to be a generalization of the DPO loss**, thus integrating and extending current alignment theories.  **NCA addresses the decreasing likelihood issue** commonly seen in DPO/InfoNCA by optimizing absolute likelihoods rather than relative ones.  Experiments with large language models demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in complex tasks like math and coding, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed methods.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "KwRLDkyVOl/podcast.wav"}
