It performs contrastive learning on a specific End of Text ([EOT]) embedding without word-level supervision, while prior studies [15, 16, 17] suggest each word has a semantic effect on the generated image. In this case, we categorize two types of embedding as word and [EOT] for fine-grained analysis. Consider a prompt encoded to text embeddings $c=\\{c_{S O T},c_{p1},...,c_{p N},c_{E O T}\\}$ consisting $N$ word embeddings. Different from the [EOT] embedding $c_{E O T}$ , word embeddings $c_{p_{1}},...,c_{p_{N}}$ are unsupervised during training. We skip the embedding of Start of Text ([SOT]) cSOT for simplicity. To study how the two types of embedding understand attributes, we select 60 familiar objects and 7 common colors to obtain text embeddings $c=\\{c_{o b j e c t},c_{E O T}\\}$ and $c^{\\prime}=\\{c_{c o l o r}^{\\prime},c_{o b j e c t}^{\\prime},c_{E O T}^{\\prime}\\}$ , i.e., without and with the color context, respectively.

As to the word embedding, the similarity curve of \"chair $^{\\prime\\prime}$ is relatively smooth, but that of $\"s h e e p\"$ has a large gap between \"black\" and $\"w h i t e\"$ . Similarly, \"blue apple\" diverges from others. The above phenomenon, which we call attribute bias, describes the tendency of an object to favor certain attributes over others. We compare the attribute bias per object for two embedding types in Fig. 1 (b). If the object has a natural composition in human knowledge, it presents a serious attribute bias (e.g., \"yellow banana\" v.s. \"blue banana\"). Meanwhile, the word embedding is more volatile than the [EOT] embedding, which shows less dramatic change. Our hypothesis is the absence of word-level supervision during CLIP training, as well as the bags-of-words behavior of VLMs [11, 12]: the [EOT] embedding is trying to remember all important words in the given prompt, including adjectives and nouns. However, it leads to an inaccurate textual representation of the [EOT] embedding, affecting the interaction between the image latent and semantic word embeddings.

To study the attribute binding during generation, we modify the above two text embeddings $c$ and $c^{\\prime}$ with $L-N-2$ padding token embeddings, then design 4 fine-grained cases: (1) standard generation conditioned on $c^{\\prime}$ where all text embeddings contain the color context; (2) only replace $c_{o b j e c t}^{\\prime}$ with $c_{o b j e c t}$ to eliminate the context on the word embedding; (3) only replace $c_{E O T}^{\\prime}$ with $c_{E O T}$ , as well as padding embeddings $c_{p a d_{l}}^{\\prime}$ with $c_{p a d_{l}}$ ; (4) eliminate the color context on word, [EOT], and padding embeddings. Fig. 2 (a) presents 3 examples, including a natural concept \"red chair\", unnatural concepts \"black sheep\" and \"blue apple\". Cases 1-2 can be observed in all examples with less realistic and painting-like images. Note that the used SD is trained to generate photo-realistic images. These results indicate a deviation from the learned distribution. Conversely, cases 3-4 produce realistic images, but neglect the target color when the concept is unnatural. This suggests that the context in [EOT] and padding embeddings do have a significant impact on attribute generation.

Cross-attention shows that \"apple\" overlaps with padding embeddings (e.g., $p a d_{73}\\mathrm{,}$ ) rather than the [EOT] embedding. It is like these padding embeddings have forgotten part of the context remembered in the first [EOT].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
