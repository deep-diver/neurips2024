Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., $\\mathrm{RefCOCO}/+/\\mathrm{g}$ , ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG.

"], "img_footnote": [], "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Existing visual grounding models can be roughly divided into three categories: two-stage, one-stage, and transformer-based. Among them, as shown in Fig. 1(a), two-stage methods [19, 83, 79, 44, 38] require a pre-trained detector to generate proposals and perform localization through region-text retrieval. These methods rely on a complex module with manually designed mechanisms to achieve query reasoning and multi-modal fusion. One-stage methods [75, 36, 46, 73], on the other hand, employ an end-to-end architecture, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Most of them primarily perform dense prediction on multimodal fusion features defined in the form of anchors. Some recent algorithms [8, 25, 87, 57], depicted in Fig. 1(c), adopt an encoder-decoder architecture to perform multimodal fusion in the encoder and then decode the response target position using an object query similar to DETR[2]. The existing methods share a commonality: they adopt architectures that independently encode each modality before merging them, with multimodal fusion intricately linked to each visual grounding task. The feature extraction part of these methods generally employs specific classification [7, 55] or autoregressive [9, 30] tasks in each modality for pre-training. However, the alignment and mutual understanding between modalities only utilize a limited amount of downstream data, which undoubtedly underestimates the difficulty of achieving mutual understanding between modalities. Another observed trend, as noted in [25, 87], is the notable enhancement in the performance of visual grounding with a significant augmentation of pretraining data on large corpora. This implicitly suggests that leveraging a small amount of downstream data does not fully capitalize on the potential for mutual understanding between images and text. Nevertheless, this type of pretraining increases the burden of training resources.

"], "img_footnote": [], "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To be specific, we delve into existing multimodal understanding methods in the form of multimodal pre-training. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into three categories. Dual-stream structures [51, 23, 33] encode image-text modalities independently and supervise them with contrastive learning. One-stream models [6, 27, 30, 22] concatenate multimodal features for feature extraction. Other works [31, 1, 58, 64] use a dual-stream design with a fusion encoder to balance complexity and computational cost, fusing multimodal features in intermediate layers. Some methods also have applied multimodal pre-training to VG tasks, such as Dynamic MDETR [57], which uses an image-text encoder pretrained on CLIP [51] to enhance the performance. Recently, works like CPT [76], ReCLIP [59], and FGVP [71] have improved the performance of zero-shot visual grounding using dual-stream pre-trained models that employ a two-stage-like architecture and prompt engineering techniques. However, these approaches focus on multimodal alignment rather than mutual understanding. Thus, the dual-stream with fusion encoder architecture [31, 1, 58, 64] has been thrown into our sight. Specifically, based on BEiT-3 [64], we propose a simple framework called $\\mathrm{SimVG}$ that decouples multimodal fusion from downstream tasks and simultaneously encodes image, text, and object tokens, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (d). The decoder structure used for query reasoning, similar to DETR [2], is effective but inevitably increases the model\u2019s complexity and computational overhead. We aim to develop a more efficient and simpler architecture for visual grounding. To achieve this, in addition to the decoder branch, we introduce a lightweight token branch. This branch leverages object tokens that are deeply integrated with image-text features to enhance grounding performance. To ensure that the token branch maintains high performance while enabling efficient inference, we adhere to the principles of the existing knowledge distillation methods [21, 5, 3] and introduce an innovative dynamic weight-balance distillation (DWBD). This approach enhances the token branch\u2019s capability by dynamically assigning weights to the decoder\u2019s predictions and ground truth at various learning stages, facilitating more effective learning in the token branch. Furthermore, we introduce a text-guided query generation (TQG) module to integrate textual information into queries, enabling the adaptive incorporation of textual prior knowledge into object queries. Notably, the design of the TQG module allows for the expansion of object tokens, increasing the number of objects it can handle and thereby adapting effectively to the GREC [17] task. The experiments demonstrate that, by decoupling multimodal fusion from downstream tasks, SimVG achieves rapid convergence and superior performance even with a limited amount of data.

In contrast, dual-stream models [51, 23, 33] employ separate encoders for each modality. These models do not concatenate modalities at the input level. Instead, the interaction between pooled image and text vectors occurs at a shallow layer. Dual-stream models with fusion encoder [31, 1, 58, 64] combine aspects of both one-stream and dual-stream models.

Compared to MDETR, SimVG demonstrates an average improvement of 5 points, and compared to the recent SOTA model GroundingDINO [43], it achieves an average improvement of 2 points. Moreover, increasing the volume of pre-training data further enhances performance. Additionally, SimVG applies a lighter transformer structure in the head. Specifically, SimVG-TB only uses 1.58 million parameters, which is smaller than some lightweight models [87, 32]. Lastly, we observe that scaling the multimodal encoder from ViT-B to ViT-L results in the performance of the lightweight token branch surpassing that of its teacher model. We hypothesize that as the model size increases, the reliability of the decoder branch\u2019s performance improves, helping to mitigate the impact of mislabeled ground truth data. This, in turn, enhances the generalization ability of the token branch, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the DWBD method.

The description in Sec. 4.2 applies to all SimVG-base models; however, we make some adjustments for the large models. Due to the higher memory usage of the large models, all large models are trained with a batch size of 4. For the large model, the decoder\u2019s projection input dimension is increased from 768 to 1024, while all other settings remain consistent with the base model. Additionally, in the pre-training experiments presented in Table 3, the number of training epochs for the large models is reduced from 30 to 20 due to the increased training cost and the number of token branch distillation epochs is reduced from 20 to 10. In the experiments, all results for SimVG-TB are obtained using DWBD in a two-stage distillation process. For SimVG-DB, the results are obtained by supervising the decoder branch with ground truth. In the GREC experiment as shown in Table 2, we set the number of object queries to 10.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
