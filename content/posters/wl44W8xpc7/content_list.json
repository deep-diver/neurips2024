When data clearly reveals underlying symmetry, leveraging this symmetry can naturally inform the design of model architectures or learning strategies. Yet, in numerous real-world scenarios, identifying the specific symmetry within a given data distribution often proves ambiguous. To tackle this, some existing works learn symmetry in a data-driven manner, parameterizing and learning expected symmetry through data. However, these methods often rely on explicit knowledge, such as pre-defined Lie groups, which are typically restricted to linear or affine transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry learning algorithm based on transformations defined with one-parameter groups, continuously parameterized transformations flowing along the directions of vector fields called infinitesimal generators. Our method is built upon minimal inductive biases, encompassing not only commonly utilized symmetries rooted in Lie groups but also extending to symmetries derived from nonlinear generators. To learn these symmetries, we introduce a notion of a validity score that examine whether the transformed data is still valid for the given task. The validity score is designed to be fully differentiable and easily computable, enabling effective searches for transformations that achieve symmetries innate to the data. We apply our method mainly in two domains: image data and partial differential equations, and demonstrate its advantages.

In the affine transformations of images in $\\left(x_{1},x_{2}\\right)$ -coordinates, there are six generators, each corresponding to translation, scaling, and shearing operations with respect to the $x_{1}$ -axis and $x_{2}$ -axis. Although there exist some methods that directly learn the generators, they are either bound to the general linear group $G L(n)$ , which cannot account for non-affine or non-linear transformations [24], or are not guaranteed to find the correct symmetry in real-world image datasets [9, 13].

By modeling one-parameter groups using Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) [6], we establish a learnable infinitesimal generator capable of producing a sequence of transformed data through ODE integration. We design an appropriate validity score function that measures how much the transformation violates the invariance to certain criteria defined depending on the target task, and learn the generators by optimizing towards the validity score of the data transformed through ODE integration. For example, in an image classification dataset, we use a pre-trained feature extractor and define the validity score to be the cosine similarity between the features extracted from the original image and the transformed image. For PDEs, the validity score is defined by the numerical errors of the original equations after the transform. The validity scores are chosen based on the characteristics of the target tasks, and designed to be fully differentiable, so that the symmetry can be learned via gradient descent in an end-to-end fashion. We also incorporate two regularizations, orthonormality and Lipschitz loss, which prevent the learned generators from converging to a trivial solution.

Moreover, our method excels in identifying non-affine symmetries and approximate symmetries in PDE tasks. We further demonstrate that the learned generators can be leveraged to develop automatic augmentation generators, which can be used to produce augmented training data for both image classification tasks and neural operator learning tasks of PDEs [21]. We provide empirical evidence that the models trained with data augmented by our learned generators perform competitively with those trained with traditional closed-form transforms such as Lie point symmetry (LPS) [4].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
