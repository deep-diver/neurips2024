However, identifying these symmetries often proves challenging, especially when they are not easily expressible using pre-defined mathematical groups.  Existing methods often rely on explicit knowledge or are limited to simpler transformations.\nThis paper introduces a novel algorithm that learns continuous symmetries from data without making strong assumptions about the form of the symmetry.  **It uses Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to model one-parameter groups and a novel validity score to guide the learning process**.  The validity score assesses how well a transformation preserves data properties relevant to a specific task.  The approach demonstrates effectiveness in discovering both affine and non-affine symmetries, showcasing its advantage over existing methods on image data and partial differential equations (PDEs).", "affiliation": "Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wl44W8xpc7/podcast.wav"}
