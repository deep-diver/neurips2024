It **introduces a novel collaborative lifelong adaptation paradigm (CoLA)** that significantly improves efficiency and performance, addressing limitations of existing single-device methods.  The optimization-free strategy for resource-constrained devices is particularly impactful, opening avenues for broader real-world deployment of AI models.", "summary": "CoLA: Collaborative Lifelong Adaptation boosts test-time adaptation efficiency by sharing domain knowledge across multiple devices, achieving significant accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead.", "takeaways": ["CoLA enhances test-time adaptation efficiency by using a multi-device collaborative approach.", "CoLA proposes two collaboration strategies: knowledge reprogramming for resource-rich devices and similarity-based aggregation for resource-constrained devices.", "CoLA demonstrates significant performance improvements across various scenarios, including lifelong and single-domain test-time adaptation."], "tldr": "Traditional deep learning deploys models with fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation when encountering unseen data during deployment. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this by updating models using test data, but existing TTA methods usually operate on single devices, neglecting valuable knowledge learned by other devices. This often leads to suboptimal adaptation performance, especially for resource-limited devices.\n\nThis paper introduces CoLA (Collaborative Lifelong Adaptation), a novel framework that leverages shared knowledge among multiple devices to enhance TTA. CoLA features two key strategies: knowledge reprogramming for powerful devices and similarity-based knowledge aggregation for resource-limited devices. The results show that CoLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods in collaborative, lifelong, and single-domain scenarios, proving its effectiveness and efficiency.  **CoLA\u2019s optimization-free approach for resource-constrained devices is a significant advancement**, enabling wider AI model deployments.", "affiliation": "South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "YyMiO0DWmI/podcast.wav"}
