As suggested in [9] that LLMs are superior to classical methods such as part-of-speech tagging in retrieving verb phrases, we use a Llama-2 [34] to obtain $N_{v}$ verb phrases from an input narration. Given that a verb phrase describes an activity involving several scene entities, we introduce weighted many-to-one alignment strategy to prioritize the most relevant entity-verb alignments. Firstly, let $\\mathbf{a}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{D}}$ be one of the embedded verb phrases, we obtain a Softmax-normalized similarity scores between ai and every entity ej: s(ai, ej) = aEi\u00b7aeij\u00b7eT . Then, we re-weight entities by the computed weight and obtain a weighted average of entities representation: $\\begin{array}{r}{{\\bf e}^{a v g}=\\sum_{j}^{E}s({\\bf a}_{i},{\\bf e}_{j})\\bar{\\bf e}_{j}}\\end{array}$ .
