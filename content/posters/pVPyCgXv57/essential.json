Recent token reduction methods address this by merging similar tokens, but these methods often depend on intermediate ViT features, limiting their flexibility and requiring extensive end-to-end training.  This dependence restricts the ability to optimize token merging independently and fully leverage pre-trained models.\nThis paper introduces Decoupled Token Embedding for Merging (DTEM), which enhances token merging through a decoupled embedding module trained via a continuously relaxed merging process.  This decoupling allows for the extraction of dedicated features for merging, independent of the ViT forward pass. The continuous relaxation facilitates differentiable training, enabling modular optimization with pre-trained models and enhanced generalization across different reduction rates.  Experiments across various ViT models and tasks (classification, captioning, segmentation) demonstrate consistent improvement in token merging with significant FLOP reduction while maintaining high accuracy.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "pVPyCgXv57/podcast.wav"}
