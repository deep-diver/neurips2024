### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Probability forecasting is essential in many fields, requiring well-calibrated prediction models.  Calibration measures assess the quality of forecasts by evaluating how closely predicted probabilities match observed outcomes. However, a critical aspect of these measures is truthfulness ‚Äì forecasters shouldn't be incentivized to exploit the system by making strategically biased predictions to achieve a lower penalty.  Existing measures often lack this crucial property.

This research introduces a novel calibration measure, the Subsampled Smooth Calibration Error (SSCE). SSCE addresses the shortcomings of existing methods by incorporating subsampling to mitigate strategic manipulation. The researchers demonstrate that SSCE is both truthful and useful, achieving optimal prediction under truthful forecasting and maintaining a sublinear penalty even in adversarial scenarios. This makes SSCE a significant improvement over existing methods, improving forecast quality and promoting responsible predictive modeling.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial for researchers in probability forecasting and machine learning.  It **highlights the critical issue of truthfulness** in calibration measures, a previously under-researched area. By introducing SSCE and demonstrating its advantages, this work **opens new avenues for designing better, more robust calibration measures**, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of probabilistic predictions.

> This table presents a comparison of several existing calibration measures and the proposed Subsampled Smooth Calibration Error (SSCE). It evaluates each method based on three criteria: completeness (whether accurate predictions have a small penalty), soundness (whether inaccurate predictions have a large penalty), and truthfulness (whether the forecaster is incentivized to predict truthfully). The table shows that most existing measures have a significant truthfulness gap, meaning that a forecaster can achieve a much lower penalty than the truthful forecaster. The SSCE is shown to have the desired properties of being complete, sound, and approximately truthful.  Appendix A provides additional details on the calculations.
