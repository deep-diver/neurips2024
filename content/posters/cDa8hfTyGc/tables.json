It evaluates each method based on three criteria: completeness (whether accurate predictions have a small penalty), soundness (whether inaccurate predictions have a large penalty), and truthfulness (whether the forecaster is incentivized to predict truthfully). The table shows that most existing measures have a significant truthfulness gap, meaning that a forecaster can achieve a much lower penalty than the truthful forecaster. The SSCE is shown to have the desired properties of being complete, sound, and approximately truthful.  Appendix A provides additional details on the calculations.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "cDa8hfTyGc/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Evaluation of existing calibration measures along with SSCE, in terms of completeness, soundness and truthfulness (Definitions 2.2 and 2.5).

The table evaluates each measure's completeness (whether accurate predictions receive little or no penalty), soundness (whether inaccurate predictions receive significant penalty), and truthfulness (whether predicting the true conditional expectation of the next outcome minimizes the penalty).  A truthfulness gap indicates that a non-truthful strategy can achieve a significantly lower penalty compared to truthful prediction. The table highlights that most existing measures suffer from significant truthfulness gaps, making them unsuitable for evaluating forecasting performance accurately and fairly.  The SSCE is the only measure which simultaneously achieves satisfactory performance in all three criteria.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
