First, Company A prices and releases its model without knowing Company B's actions.  Then, after observing Company A's model and price, Company B prices and deploys its model. Finally, users choose which model to use for each task based on price and performance.  This depicts the competitive pricing dynamic in the generative AI market.", "section": "Pricing generative AI models"}, {"figure_path": "8LbJfEjIrT/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (Left) Three tasks with three different exponential demand functions D\u2081(p) = 100e-0.5p, D2(p) = 200e-0.5p, D3(p) = 400e-0.5p.

The graph is divided into three regions based on the optimal pricing strategies for firm A and firm B. In the blue region, firm B will always set a price that is competitive for both tasks, resulting in zero revenue for firm A. In the orange region, the maximum price firm A can set is limited by the model's performance and demand ratio.
