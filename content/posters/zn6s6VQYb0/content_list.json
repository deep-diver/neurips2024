Our theoretical analysis indicates that selfcorrelation generally falls short in accurately representing specific graph features such as islands, symmetrical structures, and directional edges, particularly in smaller or multiple graph contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce a cross-correlation mechanism that significantly enhances the GAE representational capabilities.

We compare our model against prevalent self-correlation kernels in GAEs and a cross-correlation method designed for directed graphs. Comparing the basic inner-product methods, GAE and VGAE [19], the variational extension in VGAE does not obviously improve the performance over GAE in graph tasks. However, by enhancing the GAE architecture itself, i.e., using our GraphCroc architecture, the reconstruction efficacy is significantly increased; GraphCroc under self-correlation can achieve 3/5 second bests among all GAE models. This underscores the graph representation capability of the U-Net structure [9]. Additionally, the L2-norm decoding method generally outperforms the inner-product approach (GAE and VGAE), although it struggles with large graphs such as PPI, which requires too much GPU memory to be trained during our reproduction. On the other hand, the cross-correlation method (DiGAE) provides a consistent albeit modest representation across different graph sizes. This demonstrates the cross-correlation ability to represent multiple graphs in various scenarios. However, the GNN architecture limits its capability to capture enough structural information. By integrating the strengths of cross-correlation with the U-Net architecture, our GraphCroc GAE model consistently excels over other methods, offering significant advantages in all the graph tasks tested. Even on large graphs, such as PPI with over 2,000 nodes, GraphCroc can still achieve an AUC score over 0.98. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the cross-correlation mechanism, we evaluate GAE models with alternative architectures under cross-correlation, in Appendix G.1.

Figure 4 presents normalized WL-test results, i.e., the pass rates across all test graphs, in the IMDB-B task. Our GraphCroc model significantly outperforms other GAE methods, while the self-correlation variant also delivers superior performance. Interestingly, while the L2-norm achieves a high AUC score, it is feeble to well reconstruct the entire graphs; this indicates there are some connection patterns in graph inherently hard to be captured by L2-norm representation.

Although contrastive learning incorporates negative sampling, its effectiveness is limited in multigraph tasks. This finding corroborates the observations in Tab.4 of [44], which indicate that while negative sampling substantially boosts performance in single-graph tasks (e.g., node classification), it has little impact on graph classification tasks. In contrast, GAE models deliver robust graph representations, particularly for small-to-moderate-sized graphs, enhancing their utility in graph classification. Furthermore, our GraphCroc model significantly outperforms self-correlation methods (GraphMAE and S2GAE) in representing graph structures, demonstrated in Table 1, enabling the encoder to effectively capture the structural information of input graphs.

Similarly, diffusion-based graph models [21] construct graph structures through multiple steps, such as degree matrix reconstruction [5]. These methods primarily focus on graph generation, creating rational graph structures from random noisy node islands.

The very beginning graph structure representation is proposed in [19] with self-correlation (applied with Eq. 1 and 2) and further expresses the node embedding with a variational approach. Later, GAE has been widely explored with sequential and global generating methods. For the sequential GAE models, GraphRNN [47] proposes an autoregressive model, which generates graphs by summarizing a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation into a sequence of node and edge formations. Similarly, [22] targets molecule generation and proposes to regard the graph structure as a parse tree from a context-free grammar, so that the VGAE can apply encoding and decoding to these parse trees. However, the sequential graph strategies usually are time-consuming or requiring expensive processing.

GraphVAE [33] follows the VGAE idea and proposes an autoencoder model that can generate the graph structure, node features, and edge attributes all at once. EGNN [30, 26] decodes the node embedding to graph structures by applying the L2-norm between embeddings. GraphMAE [15] applies the masking strategy and targets to reconstruct the node features of various scales of graphs, where its GAE architecture also follows the classical GAE model. DiGAE [20] lies in the structural reconstruction on directed graphs, and firstly proposes to use the cross-correlation to express the node connection from two embedding spaces. Although these methods are effective recover node connections on a single graph, and even some of them tried the reconstruction of whole graph on graph tasks, there is no explicit evaluation to demonstrate how the global GAE model perform when it generate graph structure once and on moderate to large graph tasks. Besides, previous work follows the self-correlation strategy, which has been proven less effective than cross-correlation on graph tasks, in our work.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
