### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Scaling up the number of experts in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models is crucial for achieving fine-grained specialization, but it comes with a high computational cost. Existing sparse MoEs also suffer from training instability and expert underutilization issues.  This research proposes a new layer called the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (ŒºMoE) layer to address these challenges.

The ŒºMoE layer uses tensor factorization to perform implicit computations on large weight tensors, resulting in significant improvements in both parameter and computational efficiency.  The researchers demonstrate that ŒºMoEs achieve increased expert specialization and enable manual bias correction in vision tasks.  They also show that ŒºMoEs can be used for pre-training large-scale vision and language models, maintaining comparable accuracy to those using traditional MLPs, all while offering enhanced interpretability.

> This figure illustrates the forward pass of a Multilinear Mixture of Experts (¬µMoE) layer.  The input vector is first multiplied with each expert's weight matrix. The resulting vectors are then weighted by the expert coefficients (which are calculated using a gating mechanism) and summed to produce the final output vector. This visualization helps to understand how ¬µMoEs combine multiple expert's computations to produce a single output.

> This table summarizes the advantages of the proposed Multilinear Mixture of Experts (ŒºMoE) model over existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) models.  It highlights that ŒºMoEs are differentiable, parameter-efficient, and FLOPs-efficient, unlike dense MoEs which are not parameter or FLOPs efficient, and sparse MoEs which are not differentiable and only parameter efficient.





### In-depth insights


#### ŒºMoE: Factorised MoE
The concept of "ŒºMoE: Factorised MoE" presents a novel approach to Mixture of Experts (MoE) models by employing **factorization techniques** to handle the prohibitively large weight tensors that typically hinder the scalability of MoEs.  This factorization allows for implicit computations, thus avoiding the high inference-time costs associated with dense MoEs while simultaneously mitigating the training issues stemming from the discrete expert routing in sparse MoEs.  The approach leverages the **inherent tendency of experts to specialize** in subtasks, offering potential improvements in model interpretability, debuggability, and editability.  This is achieved by scaling the number of experts without incurring excessive computational costs during both training and inference. The **differentiable nature** of the proposed ŒºMoE layer is a significant advantage, ensuring smooth and stable training, in contrast to the non-differentiable nature of the popular sparse MoEs. The use of different tensor factorization methods (like CP and Tensor Ring decomposition) provides flexibility to balance between parameter efficiency and the ability to capture complex interactions in the model.

#### Expert Specialisation
The research explores expert specialization within the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (¬µMoE) model architecture.  **Increasing the number of experts leads to more specialized, monosemantic experts**, each focusing on a narrower range of input features, as evidenced through qualitative visualizations and quantitative analyses of expert activations and counterfactual interventions.  This specialization is **beneficial for interpretability, debugging, and editing**, allowing for targeted bias mitigation by manually adjusting the contributions of specific experts. The results demonstrate that this improved specialization is not at the expense of model accuracy.  Furthermore, ¬µMoEs **scale more efficiently** than traditional dense or sparse MoEs, avoiding the non-differentiable routing issues associated with sparse models.  The ability to achieve high degrees of expert specialization while retaining accuracy and efficiency highlights the potential of ¬µMoEs for creating more explainable and controllable large-scale models.

#### Bias Mitigation
The research paper explores **bias mitigation** within the context of large-scale models, particularly focusing on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture.  It highlights how the inherent modularity of MoEs, where individual experts specialize in distinct subtasks, offers a unique opportunity to address bias.  The authors demonstrate that **scaling the number of experts leads to increased specialization**, which in turn facilitates the identification and correction of biased subcomputations.  A key contribution is the introduction of a novel method that enables **manual bias correction** by strategically modifying the weights associated with specific experts. This approach allows for targeted interventions, correcting biased outputs for demographic subpopulations without the need for extensive retraining.  The effectiveness of this method is validated through experiments on real-world datasets, showcasing its potential for creating fairer and more equitable AI systems.  **However**, the paper also acknowledges limitations, including the absence of fine-grained labels that would enable a more rigorous evaluation of bias. Furthermore, the paper only evaluates the effectiveness of the bias mitigation techniques at the class level.

#### Pre-training ŒºMoEs
Pre-training ŒºMoEs presents a compelling strategy for cultivating specialized experts within large-scale language and vision models.  By initializing model layers with ŒºMoE blocks during pre-training, rather than standard MLPs, the network learns a more modular representation. **This approach allows individual experts to focus on specific semantic subtasks**, leading to improved interpretability and potentially enhanced robustness.  **The key advantage lies in ŒºMoE's efficiency in handling vast numbers of experts without incurring prohibitive computational costs**, a significant limitation of traditional MoE architectures.  Furthermore, the differentiable nature of ŒºMoEs avoids the training instability often associated with sparse MoEs.  Pre-training with ŒºMoEs thus offers a pathway to building models with **fine-grained, specialized expert knowledge** before any downstream fine-tuning, potentially accelerating the adaptation of the models to various downstream tasks. The results demonstrate comparable accuracy with significantly better interpretability, suggesting that pre-training ŒºMoEs is a promising direction for enhancing the scalability and explainability of large language models and vision transformers.

#### ŒºMoE Limitations
The core limitation of the proposed multilinear mixture of experts (ŒºMoE) model centers on the **qualitative assessment of expert specialism**. While quantitative metrics demonstrate improved performance and efficiency,  a lack of granular ground truth labels hinders definitive proof of fine-grained expert specialization.  The reliance on visualization and counterfactual intervention for evaluating expert behavior means the **subjective nature of interpretation remains a significant factor**. Furthermore, the current empirical evaluation primarily focuses on model performance using established benchmark datasets. **Extending the evaluation to out-of-distribution data and more complex real-world tasks is essential for a comprehensive assessment of ŒºMoE‚Äôs capabilities and limitations.** Another factor to consider is scalability. While ŒºMoE addresses some scaling issues of existing MoEs, further investigation is required to assess its performance and efficiency when applied to extremely large models with trillions of parameters. Finally, the **interpretability benefits**, though promising, are largely qualitative.  More robust quantitative methods for assessing the level of human-understandable task decomposition are needed to fully confirm the ŒºMoE's contribution to explainability and transparency.

The plot shows that for larger numbers of experts, the entmax activation function leads to more specialized experts (lower polysemanticity) compared to softmax. Separate lines are shown for models using DINO and CLIP backbones. The results suggest that entmax is a better choice for achieving increased expert specialisation when using a larger number of experts.
