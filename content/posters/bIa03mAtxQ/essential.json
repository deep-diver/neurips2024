Existing sparse MoEs also suffer from training instability and expert underutilization issues.  This research proposes a new layer called the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (\u03bcMoE) layer to address these challenges.\nThe \u03bcMoE layer uses tensor factorization to perform implicit computations on large weight tensors, resulting in significant improvements in both parameter and computational efficiency.  The researchers demonstrate that \u03bcMoEs achieve increased expert specialization and enable manual bias correction in vision tasks.  They also show that \u03bcMoEs can be used for pre-training large-scale vision and language models, maintaining comparable accuracy to those using traditional MLPs, all while offering enhanced interpretability.", "affiliation": "Queen Mary University of London", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "bIa03mAtxQ/podcast.wav"}
