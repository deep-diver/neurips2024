This work opens new avenues for research in efficient transformer architectures and compiler optimizations for mobile AI.", "summary": "ECP-ViT: Real-time Vision Transformer on Mobile Devices via Core-Periphery Attention and Smart Data Layout.", "takeaways": ["ECP-ViT achieves significant speedups (4.6x to 26.9x) on mobile GPUs across various datasets.", "The core-periphery guided self-attention mechanism reduces computational demands while maintaining high accuracy.", "Compiler-based optimizations eliminate data transformation overheads, leading to faster inference."], "tldr": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer high accuracy in image recognition but are computationally expensive, hindering real-time performance on mobile devices. Existing optimization methods mainly focus on theoretical complexity reduction but often introduce additional overheads due to data transformations on mobile hardware. This paper introduces ECP-ViT, a novel framework that tackles this issue by employing a core-periphery principle inspired by brain networks.  This principle guides self-attention in ViTs, focusing computation on crucial parts of the image and reducing data transformations. \nECP-ViT further incorporates hardware-friendly system optimizations, primarily focusing on eliminating costly data transformations (reshape and transpose operations). These algorithm-system co-optimizations are implemented through a compiler framework, leading to impressive speedups (4.6x to 26.9x) on mobile GPUs across different datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet). The results showcase a significant improvement in real-time performance without compromising accuracy, making ViTs more practical for mobile AI applications.", "affiliation": "University of Georgia", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "lD7ziaMHbf/podcast.wav"}
