The greedy nature of WTA limits exploration of the hypothesis space and can result in hypothesis collapse and convergence to poor local minima. These limitations affect the ability of MCL to accurately capture the ambiguity of the tasks.\nThe paper introduces Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL), which integrates simulated annealing with MCL. Annealing enhances exploration by accepting temporary performance degradations for better exploration.  aMCL uses a temperature schedule to control the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Through theoretical analysis based on statistical physics and information theory, the authors provide insights into the algorithm's training dynamics.  Extensive experiments show that aMCL outperforms standard MCL and other baselines on various datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy.", "affiliation": "Telecom Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Speaker Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "WEs4WMzndY/podcast.wav"}
