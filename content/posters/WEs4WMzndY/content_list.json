Predicting $y$ directly from $x$ can be challenging due to the partial predictability of $y$ from the information contained in $x$ . Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) [25, 41] addresses these challenges by providing a small set of plausible hypotheses, each representing a different possible outcome given the input. MCL learns these hypotheses using a competitive training scheme that promotes the specialization of the hypotheses in distinct regions of the output space $\\boldsymbol{\\wp}$ . The framework iteratively partitions $\\boldsymbol{\\wp}$ into a Voronoi tesselation and guides each hypothesis toward the barycenter of its respective Voronoi cell [63]. This mechanism makes MCL akin to a gradient-descent-based and conditional variant of the popular K-means algorithm [45]. Like K-means, MCL is sensitive to initialization, subject to hypothesis collapse [49], and more generally may converge toward arbitrarily suboptimal hypothesis configurations [63]. While there is a substantial body of literature addressing the limitations of K-means [3, 20, 58], relatively little has been done to address these challenges in the context of MCL [63, 49, 54]. The core issue of MCL lies with its greedy gradient-based update of the hypotheses. This greediness precludes the exploration of the hypothesis space, preventing MCL from optimally capturing the ambiguity of $y$ . We propose to incorporate annealing into this gradient descent update in order to improve the robustness of MCL. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Simulated annealing, inspired by the gradual cooling of metals, was originally introduced for statistical mechanics applications [28, 52] and was later applied to combinatorial problems [35]. It is a random exploration process concurrent to the popular stochastic gradient descent, with a significant difference: gradient descent always tries to improve performance while annealing also accepts to temporarily degrade it for the sake of exploration. The range of this exploration is controlled by a temperature parameter: with a high temperature, annealing explores wide regions of the search space; when the temperature decreases, the exploration becomes narrow, and the system is able to refine its performance. This strategy has been shown to converge to an optimal state, provided that the cooling is sufficiently slow [26].

In this article, we show that it can be further adapted to the conditional and gradient-based setting of MCL.

In fact, MCL has a higher inter-seed variance than aMCL and PIT in all settings. Indeed this method is known to be sensitive to initialization [49, 63]. In contrast, we see that aMCL is more robust to initialization, having a lower inter-seed variance and higher average score. This phenomenon was highlighted in Section A, which provided a theoretical analysis of the Euclidean case.

Indeed, we can improve MCL SI-SDR score beyond what is achievable by PIT training, by increasing the number of predictions $n$ .
