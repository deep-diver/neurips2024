The independence score is a measure of how well the estimated mixing matrix (B') approximates the true matrix B. The Amari distance is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of ICA algorithms. The plot demonstrates a strong positive correlation between the two metrics, indicating that a lower independence score corresponds to a smaller Amari distance (better performance). The error bars represent the standard deviation of the independence score across 10 random runs.
