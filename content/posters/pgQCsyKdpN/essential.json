Existing methods for optimizing ISPs primarily focus on maximizing image quality, neglecting the impact on high-level vision tasks.  This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic scenes with varying lighting and conditions. \nAdaptiveISP tackles this by employing deep reinforcement learning.  It automatically generates an optimal ISP pipeline and parameters for each image to maximize object detection accuracy.  This task-driven and scene-adaptive approach dynamically balances detection performance and computational cost, significantly outperforming existing methods.
