Designing ISP pipeline and tuning ISP parameters are two key steps for building an imaging and vision system. To find optimal ISP configurations, recent works use deep neural networks as a proxy to search for ISP parameters or ISP pipelines. However, these methods are primarily designed to maximize the image quality, which are sub-optimal in the performance of high-level computer vision tasks such as detection, recognition, and tracking. Moreover, after training, the learned ISP pipelines are mostly fixed at the inference time, whose performance degrades in dynamic scenes. To jointly optimize ISP structures and parameters, we propose AdaptiveISP, a task-driven and scene-adaptive ISP. One key observation is that for the majority of input images, only a few processing modules are needed to improve the performance of downstream recognition tasks, and only a few inputs require more processing. Based on this, AdaptiveISP utilizes deep reinforcement learning to automatically generate an optimal ISP pipeline and the associated ISP parameters to maximize the detection performance. Experimental results show that AdaptiveISP not only surpasses the prior state-of-the-art methods for object detection but also dynamically manages the trade-off between detection performance and computational cost, especially suitable for scenes with large dynamic range variations.

Originally, ISPs aimed at enhancing the perceptual quality, focusing on photography-related applications. Recently, machine vision cameras also optimized the ISP pipeline for downstream recognition tasks [34, 38, 33, 35]. For recognition tasks, studies have shown a specially designed ISP can significantly enhance their performance. However, most machine vision cameras [13] still prefer a static hand-designed ISP and manually-tuned parameters, making it sub-optimal for downstream recognition tasks and also inflexible for dynamic scenes. Another solution is to directly train detection networks that take raw flies as input, skipping the entire ISP processing. However, this may require re-training the detection network for each camera sensor, as the raw format varies between cameras, and studies [22] also show that the raw detection network still performs worse than the detection network runs on ISP-processed images. Therefore, a well-tuned ISP is important for downstream recognition tasks.

This problem faces two challenges: complexity and efficiency. First, it is a complicated optimization problem to jointly re-organize the ISP modules, update their parameters, and also improve the performance of the downstream recognition module. Because of this complexity, previous works only update the parameters [34, 24, 29, 30, 37, 16, 25]. Some recent works jointly optimize the ISP pipeline and parameters [10, 27], but they are not designed for downstream recognition tasks. Second, ISP optimization must be efficient enough to adapt to dynamically changing scenes, which is particularly important in real-time applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. The majority of ISP pipeline optimization methods use searching strategies, such as the neural architecture search (NAS) method [38] and the multi-object optimization search method [33], which often takes several hours, making them infeasible for real-time applications across dynamically changing scenes.

Only challenging examples require more complicated pipelines. Therefore, we can model the ISP configuration process as a Markov Decision Process [28], and our AdaptiveISP only selects one ISP module at each stage, as shown in Figure 1 on the left.

At each iteration, a lightweight RL agent takes the processing output from the previous stage as input and finds the optimal module for the next iteration.

Second, while color processing is important in both types of ISPs for both detection and viewing, their behaviors are different. For instance, ISPs for detection often completely desaturate color in low-light scenarios to boost the detection rate, as shown in the second-row of Figure 1, which rarely happens for traditional ISPs.

Recent studies have explored various methods for optimizing Image Signal Processing (ISP) hyper-parameters, particularly those based on handcrafted designs and tailored to meet the demands of downstream evaluation metrics. One category of methods focuses on derivative-free optimization techniques. Nishimura et al. [25] introduced an automatic image quality tuning method that employs nonlinear optimization and automatic reference generation algorithms. Another category utilizes gradient-based optimization techniques. Tseng et al. [34] introduced a gradient optimization method that relies on differentiable approximations, allowing for efficient hyper-parameter tuning but the ISP parameters are fixed during the inference stage. Immediately afterward, some researchers realized that one set of parameters was not necessarily suitable for different scenarios. Qin et al. [29] proposed an attention-based CNN method, but it does not consider sequence-specific prior knowledge. Then, Qin et al. [30] proposed a sequential ISP hyper-parameter prediction framework, which optimizes the ISP parameters by leveraging sequential relationships and parameter similarities. Additionally, Yoshimura et al. [37] proposed DynamicISP, which can causally and smoothly control the parameters of the current frame according to the recognition result of the previous frame. Departing from approximation methods, Mosleh et al. [24] introduced a hardwarein-the-loop approach. This approach directly optimizes hardware-based image processing pipelines to meet specific end-to-end objectives by using a novel 0th-order stochastic solver. Furthermore, an image enhancement method based on reinforcement learning, proposed by Kosugi et al.

The conventional ISP pipelines are crafted to adhere to human visual perception, and this alignment might not always be conducive to fulfilling the demands of downstream highlevel tasks.

ReconfigISP [38] proposed a novel Reconfigurable ISP whose architecture and parameters can be automatically tailored to specific data and tasks by using neural architecture search (Darts) [20].

Additionally, recent studies have explored replacing traditional ISP pipelines or modules with deep learning models to enhance image quality. PyNET [11] proposed a unified model that directly learns the RAWto-RGB mapping to improve mobile photography, while CycleISP [39] introduced a noise-aware denoising approach. ParamISP [14] developed forward and inverse ISP models conditioned on camera parameters, enabling a more accurate emulation of real-world ISP behavior to enhance image processing performance.

Secondly, to account for computational costs associated with different ISP modules, we introduce a penalty of computational time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveISP surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and dynamically manages the trade-off between performance and computational cost. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of individual modules within ISP configurations, offering valuable insights for future ISP designs tailored to specific downstream tasks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
