Existing methods struggle with test-time distribution shifts and aligning user preferences. This paper introduces FedDPA, a novel framework that addresses these issues. \nFedDPA employs a dual-adapter approach. A global adapter learns general features through federated training, while a local adapter personalizes the model for each client.  An instance-wise weighting mechanism dynamically combines these adapters during inference, optimizing for both personalization and robustness to unseen data distributions.  Experiments on benchmark NLP tasks show FedDPA outperforms existing methods in test-time personalization, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Australian AI Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "nkwPiBSw1f/podcast.wav"}
