Before thresholding, there is a small disparity between the hiring rates of males and females.  After applying the threshold (0.5 in this case), the disparity becomes much larger, with almost no females being hired compared to nearly all males. This demonstrates how a thresholding operation, which is common in binary classification, can significantly amplify the initial disparity.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "aXYL24yhjN/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Standard Fairness Model.", "description": "This figure shows a causal diagram representing the standard fairness model (SFM).
