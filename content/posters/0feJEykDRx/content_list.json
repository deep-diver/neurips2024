Drawing inspiration from the exceptional semantic understanding and contextual information processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, we present Mobility-LLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze check-in sequences for multiple tasks. Since LLMs cannot directly interpret check-ins, we reprogram these sequences to help LLMs comprehensively understand the semantics of human visiting intentions and travel preferences. Specifically, we introduce a visiting intention memory network (VIMN) to capture the visiting intentions at each record, along with a shared pool of human travel preference prompts (HTPP) to guide the LLM in understanding users\u2019 travel preferences. These components enhance the model\u2019s ability to extract and leverage semantic information from human mobility data effectively.

This paragraph introduces a method for extracting users\u2019 travel preferences to help the LLM enable a comprehensive understanding of human travel preferences and match appropriate prompts from multiple domains.

Previous works primarily focus on utilizing a fixed prompt to boost the pre-trained models\u2019 performance through fine-tuning [30] or learnable prompts lacking reality semantic meaning [41, 3].

Adopting a prompt-based approach with meaningless learnable prompt vectors can only handle sequences with simple semantics, such as time series [41, 3].

Even the Pythia-70M (A.5 in Tab. 5) backbone model, which has fewer parameters, can demonstrate advantages in certain datasets and tasks.

In Fig. 3a, we visualize the significance of different prompt words in three domain pools within the HTPP model. Orange indicates high significance, and Purple indicates low significance. It can be observed that as training progresses, the prompt words for this sample in each domain concentrate on a few words. This also indicates that user behavior is diverse and personalized. To more intuitively see the effect of HTPP, we select 10 different users, each with several samples. We visualize the output of LLM with t-SNE [43] corresponding to the samples generated by these 10 users in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c. It can be seen that with the addition of HTPP, the model can more comprehensively capture user behavior patterns and better recognize the behavioral characteristics of each user. Similarly, to better visualize the effect of VIMN, we select a continuous sequence of five user behavior points. Fig. 3d-f show the Pearson correlation coefficients between the five outputs $^h$ without using the VIMN, without considering Delta Time as input, and when using VIMN, respectively. Fig. 3g shows the time intervals among these five points. It can be observed that with the use of the VIMN, the closer the time, the greater the influence on the current state, which aligns with human behavior patterns. Since plans cannot keep up with changes, people\u2019s decisions are mostly influenced by recent behaviors.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
