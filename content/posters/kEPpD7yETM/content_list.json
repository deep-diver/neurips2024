The number of Larvae determines how quickly a Zerg player can build units. Managing Larvae effectively is crucial to Zerg gameplay.   \n\u2022 Biological Units: The Zerg rely heavily on biological units and are known for their ability to quickly swarm opponents with large numbers of units. Their units often have regenerative abilities and can be upgraded to various forms.

Shields regenerate over time, making hit-and-run tactics effective when used wisely.   \n\u2022 Psionic Abilities: Protoss units often have psionic abilities that can be used for offense or defense. Examples include Force Fields, which can block enemy units, and Psionic Storm, which deals area damage.   \n\u2022 Warpgate Research: Protoss players can research the \"Warpgate\" technology, allowing them to transform their Gateways into Warp Gates, significantly increasing their flexibility in producing units.
