### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current benchmarks inadequately assess LLMs' real-time strategic decision-making skills.  StarCraft II, with its complex dynamics, presents an ideal evaluation setting.  However, a lack of language support in existing SC2 environments hinders LLM agent evaluation. 

To address these issues, the paper introduces TextStarCraft II, a specialized environment translating SC2 gameplay into an interactive text-based format, and the Chain of Summarization (CoS) method, improving LLMs' ability to process complex information quickly.  Experiments reveal that several LLMs effectively played the game, defeating the built-in AI and performing on par with human players.  The results demonstrate LLMs' capabilities in strategy and decision-making, **opening up new possibilities for research on AI in real-time strategy games**.

> This figure illustrates the interaction process between the LLM and the TextStarCraft II environment using the Chain of Summarization (CoS) method. The process starts with initialization, where initial game data is converted to text for processing. Next, Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Summarization modules refine and summarize observations into actionable insights using advanced LLM reasoning. Then, in Directive Formulation and Action Scheduling, these insights are segmented into specific actions and queued for execution. Finally, Action Retrieval and Execution implement the actions in the game. This cycle continually converts new data into text, enhancing LLM performance in the TextStarCraft II environment.  The figure highlights the key components including the Observation-to-Text Adapter, the Text-to-Action Adapter, the Single-Frame Summarization, the Multi-Frame Summarization, the Action Queue, the Chain of Summarization, and the LLM agent.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM-RTS Benchmark
An LLM-RTS benchmark is a crucial tool for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real-time strategy (RTS) game environments.  It would rigorously assess LLMs' **strategic thinking, decision-making, and adaptability** in dynamic and complex scenarios.  Key aspects would include **resource management, base building, unit production and control, and counter-strategy implementation**, all within the time constraints of a real-time setting. The benchmark must be carefully designed to account for the **unique challenges of RTS**, such as imperfect information, unpredictable opponent actions, and the need for rapid, tactical responses.   A robust benchmark would also consider various factors like **LLM architecture, prompt engineering, and model size**, and should incorporate multiple evaluation metrics to capture a holistic assessment.  Furthermore, it is essential to establish **clearly defined success criteria** against established benchmarks, either from human players or existing AI systems.  Finally, the benchmark's design should focus on both quantitative (win rate, resource efficiency, etc.) and qualitative (strategic clarity, decision rationale, etc.) measurements to provide a comprehensive and nuanced evaluation of LLM performance in RTS games.

#### Chain of Summary
The proposed "Chain of Summarization" (CoS) method offers a novel approach to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance in real-time strategy games.  **Unlike traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) methods, CoS leverages summarization techniques to compress complex game information into concise, actionable insights.** This compression facilitates faster processing by the LLM, enabling more effective and rapid decision-making within the time constraints of real-time gameplay. The method incorporates both single-frame and multi-frame summarization, providing the LLM with a more comprehensive understanding of the current game state and its evolution. By combining summarization with advanced reasoning, CoS significantly accelerates the inference process and improves the LLM's ability to make sophisticated strategic decisions. **The incorporation of CoS improves the LLM's performance in both single-frame and multi-frame decision making**, leading to better gameplay outcomes.

#### Human-AI Matches
The section on Human-AI Matches presents a crucial evaluation of the Large Language Model (LLM) agents' capabilities.  By pitting fine-tuned LLMs against human players in real-time StarCraft II matches, the researchers directly assess the **strategic decision-making ability** of the AI.  This constitutes a significant departure from traditional AI benchmarks focusing on single-player modes or simpler tasks, and provides more realistic and robust evaluation of actual LLM capabilities.  The results showing fine-tuned LLMs performing comparably to Gold-level human players is a remarkable achievement and highlight the potential for LLMs to exhibit strategic thinking and competitive performance.   **Real-time human-computer interaction** was essential to this experiment, and is a strength of this approach because the results can more directly measure the LLM agent's responsiveness and adaptability to dynamic, unpredictable situations. The success of the fine-tuned models against human players strengthens the overall claim that the proposed Chain of Summarization (CoS) method effectively enhances LLMs' decision-making efficiency. Finally, this testing process likely provided valuable insights into the limitations and strengths of current LLMs, in particular their capacity for complex strategic thinking and long term planning in real time.

#### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in effectively utilizing large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks, such as strategic decision-making in real-time strategy (RTS) games.  **Careful crafting of prompts is essential** to guide the LLM's reasoning process, ensuring that it generates relevant and actionable insights.  The paper highlights the use of **two distinct prompt types**: a basic prompt, which elicits simple actions, and a complex prompt, which guides the LLM through a more structured reasoning process. The results show that **more complex prompts significantly improve the LLM's performance**, showcasing the importance of carefully designed prompts to achieve expert-level capabilities. This **demonstrates the crucial interplay between prompt design and LLM effectiveness** in achieving desired outcomes, particularly in domains demanding nuanced decision-making.

#### Future of LLMs
The future of LLMs in strategic gaming, as exemplified by StarCraft II, is bright.  **Real-time strategy necessitates adaptability and rapid decision-making**, skills where LLMs show promise, particularly with advancements like the Chain of Summarization method.  However, **current limitations remain, including reliance on textual data and scripted micro-actions**, which restricts the full potential of LLM integration into complex, visually rich environments. Overcoming these will involve further research into multimodal LLMs, allowing for visual processing and more nuanced decision-making.  **Developing more comprehensive benchmarks** beyond simple win rates is crucial for accurate evaluation. Additionally, **investigating the interpretability of LLM decision-making processes** will be key to improving the trustworthiness and utility of LLMs for high-stakes applications, moving towards a more collaborative and human-like interaction in complex domains.

> This table presents the performance of various LLMs (Large Language Models) in the TextStarCraft II environment, which is a game environment based on StarCraft II. The LLMs are tested against the built-in AI at level 5, and their performance is measured using several metrics, such as win rate, PBR (Population Block Ratio), RUR (Resource Utilization Ratio), APU (Average Population Utilization), and TR (Technology Rate). The table compares the performance of LLMs using the full Chain of Summarization (CoS) method and CoS without Chain of Thought (CoT).

> This table presents the performance comparison of various LLMs tested against the level 5 built-in AI in the TextStarCraft II environment.  The LLMs were evaluated using two different methods: the full Chain of Summarization (CoS) method and the CoS method without Chain of Thought (CoT). The table shows the win rate, Population Block Ratio (PBR), Resource Utilization Ratio (RUR), Average Population Utilization (APU), and Technology Rate (TR) for each LLM and method.  Appendix A.2 provides detailed explanations of these metrics.
