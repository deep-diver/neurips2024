For instance, [28, 48, 32] have designed jailbreak methods that circumvent the safeguards of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to generate harmful and illegal responses. These security risks are a major concern for model developers, researchers, users, and regulatory bodies. Thus, enhancing the safety of content generated by these models is of paramount importance.

This involves supervising the training data collection and checking the training process during model development. Once the training is complete, another critical step is to analyze the model\u2019s safety through advanced attacking methods, a process known as red-teaming [19, 42]. Previous red-teaming methods designed for LLMs to bypass safeguards and produce harmful responses utilize jailbreak attacks [28, 32] and various adversarial attacks [40, 20]. However, text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion Models, have received less attention in red-teaming research. Besides, previous works on red-teaming for text-to-image models generally examine the model\u2019s safety under a hypothetical scenario where a malicious user aims to intentionally craft adversarial prompts, revealing that carefully designed unsafe prompts lead to unsafe generations. However, in a scenario where benign users are normally using the model, it is still possible to unintentionally generate some unsafe content, meaning that even safe prompts1 can lead to unsafe generations. The safety in this context is evidently more important. Firstly, compared to adversarial prompts, these safe prompts are harmless, making them more difficult to fliter by safeguards. Moreover, since the vast majority of the model\u2019s users are benign, any user may unintentionally receive an unsafe generation. As shown in Figure 1, the safe prompts, collected from Lexica [3], can result in unsafe images. Some of them include violent elements and bloody content, and others contain naked bodies, which reveals the undiscovered safety risks in the previous methods.

First, unlike text-to-text models, red-teaming for text-to-image models must consider two modalities. An intuitive approach is to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) to understand the images and generate new prompts. However, if we adopt a single VLM to generate prompts, it requires the model to be able to craft safe prompts on the basis of understanding the content of different categories as well as the connections between prompts and images. Such complex tasks usually require high-quality training data and more model parameters, making the training process and the inference process less efficient. Secondly, defining the safety of prompts and the harmfulness of images is tricky. Unlike Adversarial Nibbler [36] employing human experts and public participants to manually determine the safety of prompts and images, an automatic red-teaming method requires a new form of safety checking for them.

Since the Naive method and Curiosity do not support generating images based on a given toxic category, we randomly select 255 captions as prompts from the MSCOCO dataset for the Naive method and randomly generate 255 prompts from the language model in Curiosity.

On the other hand, although Groot can generate prompts for different categories, the ratio of safe prompts in all generated prompts is lower. We also find that for the \"sexual\" category, the generated prompts from Groot are easy to contain explicit sexual elements, such as naked bodies and breasts. However, ART prefers to use names of characters in Greek mythology, such as Aphrodite and names from the Bible to create prompts, without explicit harmful words, making the ratio of safe prompts higher.

We calculate the success ratio based on the number of successes and the number of safe and all prompts, respectively. In Table 4, we present the results for Stable Diffusion 1.5. First, we find that a small part of prompts from MSCOCO can generate unsafe content. It is mainly because these advanced detectors are more sensitive to negative information in the images. Second, although the success ratio for Groot is high when we only consider safe prompts, we find the success ratio is very low when we count all generated prompts. This heavily reduces the efficiency of the red-teaming process. The results indicate that ART can achieve the highest success rate on average.

The Writer Model can generate safe prompts with a very high probability under different settings. However, the impact on the success ratio of generating unsafe images is very random. We guess this impact mainly depends on the distribution of the training data of the text-to-image model. The guidance scales will make the model lean to follow the prompts or not, which increases the randomness in the generation results. Images under some resolutions could be less toxic. Similarly, we guess the reason is that in the model\u2019s training data, the resolutions of unsafe images are different, making the model have different probability to generate unsafe images under different resolution.

The first one is that the Guide Model can only accept one image at one time. However, text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion models, can generate many images for one prompt once. Moreover, even for the same prompt, the model can generate very different content under different random seeds. Therefore, the current behavior of the Guide Model will not only limit the evaluation speed but also scarify some information for the generated prompt. The solution used in our experiments is to run an additional generation process for all generated prompts with different random seeds and obtain the final results. In the future, we plan to propose some new datasets and training strategies to help VLMs work harmoniously with multiple images.

Determining whether an image is harmful or not is challenging because it is heavily related to people\u2019s cultural backgrounds and preferences, and the laws of different countries. For example, the training data of the Q16 detector [39] are labeled by people from North America in most cases. The training data of the multi-head detector [35] and the fine-tuned Q16 detector [35] are labeled by three authors from Asia. There are some agreements and disagreements among them. In ART, we attempt to reduce biases and omissions during the detection process by using multiple detectors. However, it is inevitable that some safe images determined by these detectors could hurt others, due to their personal experiences. This asks the model developers to design flexible safety restrictions to meet different personalization requests. In the future, we will explore how to design more fine-grained red-teaming methods.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
