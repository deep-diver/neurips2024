This paper addresses this by proposing an alternative: **rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting**, which is much faster. However, simply using Gaussians in a GAN framework leads to instability and artifacts. \nTo overcome these issues, the authors introduce GSGAN. GSGAN employs a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation, which effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians, resulting in improved stability and reduced artifacts.  The hierarchical structure allows for the generation of both coarse and fine details. The experimental results show that GSGAN achieves a **significant speedup (x100)** in rendering compared to the state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs, with **comparable 3D generation quality**.", "affiliation": "Sungkyunkwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "sFaFDcVNbW/podcast.wav"}
