The table specifies the mathematical expressions and requirements for each hypothesis, which concern the decay rate of eigenvalues and the supremum norm of eigenfunctions, and how these relate to certain quantities \u0394\u1d62 and \u0393\u1d62 that are defined in the paper.  These hypotheses are key to understanding the entrywise error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices.", "section": "3 Entrywise error bounds"}]
