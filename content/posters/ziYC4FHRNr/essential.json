Existing error bounds focus on spectral or Frobenius norms, which don't fully capture the impact of individual entry errors in critical applications. This lack of understanding poses limitations on the algorithm analysis and real-world applications where individual errors can be costly, such as in healthcare and system control. \nThis research paper addresses this gap by deriving novel entrywise error bounds for low-rank kernel matrix approximations.  The key innovation is a delocalisation result for the eigenvectors, drawing inspiration from random matrix theory.  This result, combined with a new concentration inequality, allows the researchers to establish rigorous entrywise error bounds. Their empirical study confirms the theoretical findings across synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical value of their work and also giving insights into appropriate ranks needed for different eigenvalue decay types.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ziYC4FHRNr/podcast.wav"}
