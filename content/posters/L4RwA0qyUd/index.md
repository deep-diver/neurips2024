### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many causal inference studies struggle with unobserved confounding variables, especially when dealing with textual data.  Existing methods often require labeled data for confounders, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain. This limits the applicability of these methods to real-world scenarios where such data may not be available due to privacy constraints or the difficulty of obtaining high-quality labels. 

This research introduces a novel causal inference method that utilizes two instances of pre-treatment text data and infers proxies for unobserved confounders using zero-shot models. This approach makes it possible to use the proximal g-formula without relying on labeled confounder data. **The authors also include an odds ratio falsification heuristic that assesses proxy validity, enhancing the reliability of effect estimations.** The method is evaluated in both synthetic and semi-synthetic settings, showing promising results in situations where structured data is scarce or difficult to collect.

> This figure illustrates the pipeline for proximal causal inference with text data. It starts by filtering pre-treatment text data and selecting two distinct instances for each individual.  Zero-shot models (LLM-1 and LLM-2) then infer proxies (Z and W) from these text instances. An odds ratio heuristic checks the validity of the proxies. If valid, the proximal g-formula is used to estimate the causal effect; otherwise, the analysis stops.  The bottom row provides a specific example using MIMIC-III clinical notes.

> This table presents the results of fully synthetic experiments designed to test the proposed causal inference method.  The true average causal effect (ACE) is set to 1.3. The table compares different scenarios, including using one or two zero-shot models (P1M, P2M) and whether the same or different text instances were used to generate proxies (indicated by 'same'). The 'passed' column indicates whether the odds ratio heuristic successfully detected when the identification conditions for proximal causal inference were satisfied.  The results demonstrate the importance of using different text instances and the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic in identifying when the method will produce biased results. 





### In-depth insights


#### Proximal Causal Text
The concept of "Proximal Causal Text" merges **causal inference** with **unstructured text data**.  It addresses a critical limitation in causal analysis where crucial confounding variables are unobserved.  The approach leverages **zero-shot learning** models to infer proxies for these unmeasured confounders directly from text, circumventing the need for costly and time-consuming manual labeling.  This is particularly valuable when dealing with sensitive data or when structured data is scarce.  **The core idea is to use multiple instances of pre-treatment text to generate two proxies**, ensuring that these proxies satisfy certain independence conditions required for proximal causal inference.  A key innovation lies in the development of an **odds ratio heuristic** to assess the validity of inferred proxies before proceeding with causal effect estimation, addressing the challenges of untestable assumptions inherent in proximal causal inference.  This methodological advance holds the potential to broaden causal inference's reach, particularly in domains rich with textual data, offering **a novel and efficient means of incorporating unlabeled text data** into causal effect estimation.

#### Zero-Shot Proxies
The concept of "Zero-Shot Proxies" in causal inference with text data represents a significant advancement.  It cleverly addresses the challenge of unobserved confounders, a common obstacle in observational studies, by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). **Instead of relying on traditional supervised methods that need labeled data for training**, zero-shot learning allows the models to directly predict proxy variables from raw text without prior training on the confounders themselves. This is crucial when labeled data is scarce, expensive, or impossible to obtain due to privacy or annotation costs. The effectiveness hinges on the ability of LLMs to capture relevant information within text that is highly correlated with the unobserved confounder.  **The use of two distinct instances of pre-treatment text and two separate LLMs to generate the proxies ensures that the identification conditions for proximal causal inference are met**. This dual approach also provides a degree of robustness against potential biases that might arise from reliance on a single proxy or model. Overall, zero-shot proxies represent a promising approach to broaden the applicability of proximal causal inference by utilizing the rich information hidden in unstructured textual data.

#### Odds Ratio Heuristic
The Odds Ratio Heuristic section presents a **crucial diagnostic tool** for assessing the validity of the proposed text-based causal inference method.  It leverages the fact that under the identification assumptions of proximal causal inference, the conditional odds ratio of the two inferred proxies given observed covariates should be close to one.  The heuristic proposes to **calculate a confidence interval** for this odds ratio from the data. If the interval contains one, it indicates that the inferred proxies likely satisfy the identification assumptions.  However, a value significantly different from one suggests potential violations. Importantly, the heuristic tackles the **problem of untestable assumptions**, a major limitation of proximal causal inference, offering a practical method for evaluating the plausibility of the analysis. This approach provides a **safety net** against proceeding with downstream effect estimation based on potentially flawed proxies, ultimately enhancing the reliability and validity of the text-based causal inference framework.

#### MIMIC-III & Results
The section 'MIMIC-III & Results' would likely detail the application of the proposed method to the MIMIC-III dataset, a rich resource of clinical notes.  The results would demonstrate the method's performance in a real-world setting, evaluating its ability to accurately estimate causal effects despite the presence of unobserved confounders. **Key metrics** such as bias, confidence intervals, and the odds ratio heuristic's success rate would be reported, providing crucial evidence for the method's validity.  The discussion should analyze the impact of various factors (e.g., choice of zero-shot models, text pre-processing) on the results. Comparing the findings against those from synthetic data would highlight the strengths and limitations of the approach when applied to complex, real-world data.  **Specific attention** should be paid to situations where the heuristic correctly identifies biased estimates, offering valuable insights into its effectiveness as a diagnostic tool for proximal causal inference. The overall analysis should aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method's practical utility for causal inference using text data.

#### Future Work
The paper's "Future Work" section suggests several promising avenues.  **Improving the zero-shot classifiers** is paramount; better predictive accuracy directly enhances the reliability of the causal estimates.  The authors also aim to **expand the proxy inference method to incorporate more models**, potentially creating more robust estimates by combining multiple perspectives.  Addressing the **limitations of the odds ratio heuristic** through more sophisticated statistical modeling is crucial to make it more universally applicable. Finally, the authors plan to **explore scenarios with categorical confounders** and investigate methods that incorporate more diverse data modalities beyond text. The focus on improving proxy prediction, refining the heuristic and expanding the model's applicability to different data types demonstrates a thoughtful approach to future research.

> Figure 2 shows two causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  Graph (a) depicts a scenario with an unmeasured confounder, U, affecting both the treatment (A) and the outcome (Y). This illustrates a common challenge in causal inference where bias can arise from unobserved variables. Graph (b) represents a DAG compatible with the assumptions of proximal causal inference. This approach uses two proxies, Z and W, for the unmeasured confounder to mitigate the bias caused by U. The relationships between the variables in (b) ensure that the causal effect of A on Y can be identified despite the presence of the unobserved confounder.

> This figure showcases four causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), each representing a different approach to inferring text-based proxies for an unobserved confounder (U) in a causal inference setting.  The graphs illustrate various methods of using pre-treatment text data (Tpre) and zero-shot models to generate proxy variables (Z and W) for the unobserved confounder.  The differences lie in how many text instances are used, whether the same or different zero-shot models are used for each proxy, and how the proxies are incorporated into the causal inference framework. The figure highlights the shortcomings of simpler approaches (a, b, c) while illustrating the preferred method (d), which uses two distinct instances of pre-treatment text (Tpre1, Tpre2) with two separate zero-shot models to generate the proxies Z and W, thus fulfilling the conditions required for proximal causal inference.

> This figure shows the results of applying the proposed method and two other methods to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) in semi-synthetic settings.  The x-axis represents the different methods used, including a backdoor adjustment with a single proxy, and the proposed methods P1M and P2M. The y-axis shows the estimated ACE.  Points represent point estimates and bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The green dashed line indicates the true ACE. The ‚àö symbol indicates settings that passed a proposed odds ratio heuristic designed to help assess the validity of the model's assumptions. The figure visually demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method (P2M) compared to the simpler methods, especially when the odds ratio heuristic passes.  The results highlight that using the inferred proxies directly in backdoor adjustment produces biased estimates.

> This figure shows a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) illustrating a scenario where valid proxies can be inferred using both pre-treatment and post-treatment text data.  The graph depicts the relationships between pre-treatment text (Tpre), post-treatment text (Tpost), observed confounders (C), unobserved confounder (U), treatment (A), outcome (Y), and the two inferred proxies (W and Z). The dashed green arrows represent the conditional independence assumptions required for proximal causal inference, specifically that the proxies do not depend on the outcome (P3) and that one proxy (W) does not depend on the treatment (P2). The figure demonstrates that even with post-treatment text, the identification conditions for proximal causal inference can still be met if the pre- and post-treatment text are used to generate two separate proxies that satisfy the conditional independence constraints.

It shows that even if one proxy is influenced by the treatment (Tact), the independence conditions for proximal causal inference can still be met if the other proxy is based solely on pre-treatment data (Tpre). The figure expands on previous 'gotchas' of using text data in proximal causal inference, demonstrating a valid design.

Each diagram shows different relationships between pre-treatment text (Tpre), the unmeasured confounder (U), treatment (A), outcome (Y), and two proxies (W and Z). The diagrams highlight the potential pitfalls of using a single text instance or a single model to create proxies, underscoring the importance of employing two distinct text instances and two zero-shot models to infer the proxies, ensuring the independence of the proxies conditional on observed covariates and the unmeasured confounder. The final diagram (d) depicts the authors' recommended method, which successfully satisfies these crucial conditions and leads to unbiased causal effect estimates.
