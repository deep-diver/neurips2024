{"importance": "This paper is important because it **demonstrates the crucial role of strategic communication in game playing** and introduces a novel framework combining reinforcement learning and LLMs. It offers new avenues for research in AI agents and communication strategies, pushing the boundaries of LLM applications in complex interactive environments. This work **bridges the gap between theoretical game analysis and practical AI agent design**, and is highly relevant to current research trends in multi-agent systems, game AI, and human-computer interaction.", "summary": "RL-instructed language models excel at strategic communication in One Night Ultimate Werewolf, demonstrating the importance of discussion tactics in complex games.", "takeaways": ["Strategic communication significantly impacts game outcomes.", "An RL-instructed LLM framework effectively improves AI agent discussion skills.", "The proposed framework is effective and generalizable across different game settings."], "tldr": "Many communication games, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW), require players to employ strategic discussion tactics to succeed.  Existing LLM-based agents often lack the control over discussion tactics, hindering their performance. This paper explores the strategic aspect of discussion by analyzing Perfect Bayesian Equilibria in ONUW and shows that discussion changes players\u2019 utilities by affecting their beliefs. \nTo address this, the authors propose an RL-instructed language agent framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train a discussion policy. This policy helps determine optimal discussion tactics based on current observations. Experiments across different ONUW game settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the framework, highlighting that integrating RL-trained discussion policies improves the performance of LLM-based agents compared to agents that simply use LLMs directly. This **demonstrates the significance of incorporating strategic communication policies** in AI agents designed for complex communication scenarios.", "affiliation": "Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "1f82rnwCbl/podcast.wav"}
