Different rows highlight evaluations on different data generating mechanisms: the first row tests estimation with a partial instrumental set, the second row tests estimation with a partial adjustment set, the third row tests estimation with a high-dimensional partial adjustment set (W\u2208R100), and the fourth row tests estimation with a combination of partial adjustment and instrumental sets.", "description": "This figure shows box plots of the absolute average error (AAE) for three different estimators (PW, REG, DML) across four different settings. Each setting represents a different data generating mechanism or a different level of misspecification in estimating nuisance parameters. The x-axis represents the sample size (n), and the y-axis represents the AAE.  The different rows correspond to different causal graph structures, highlighting the performance of the estimators under various conditions, including the presence of partial instrumental sets, partial adjustment sets, high-dimensional adjustment sets, and combinations thereof.  The results show how the DML estimator is robust to misspecification and converges quickly, improving accuracy with larger sample sizes.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "u5enPCwaLt/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Width of bounds.", "description": "This figure shows the width of bounds obtained from different methods described in the paper, including natural policy bounds, bounds using instrumental variables only, bounds using adjustment sets only, and bounds using the proposed algorithm (Alg. 1).  It demonstrates how tighter bounds can be achieved by leveraging the graphical criteria proposed in Section 3. The results are shown across different sample sizes. The width of the bounds is evaluated by calculating the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the expected outcome Y under a policy \u03c0, which represent the uncertainty in the estimated policy effect.", "section": "5.1.1 Width of Bounds According to Different Graphical Criteria"}, {"figure_path": "u5enPCwaLt/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 6: Health campaign evaluations.", "description": "This figure shows the causal graph used to model the relationships between variables related to obesity and lifestyle in individuals from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.  The graph (a) represents the assumed causal structure, showing relationships between variables such as smoking status (S), family history of obesity (F), frequency of exercise (E), consumption of high-calorie foods (H), monitoring of calorie intake (M), age (A), time spent using technology devices (T), and obesity levels (Y). The graph (b) shows the results of evaluating the effects of a health campaign designed to influence the frequency of exercise and consumption of high calorie foods, expressed as box plots.  The width of the box plot indicates the uncertainty in the estimated impact (the actual width of the interval is ultimately determined by the values of P and \u03c0 that may be large or small depending on the value probabilities involved).
