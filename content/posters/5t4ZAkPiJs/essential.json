Adaptive KV cache compression aims to reduce memory footprint by discerning the importance of tokens, preserving crucial information while aggressively compressing less significant ones. However, existing methods often suffer from significant performance degradation at high compression ratios due to inaccurate saliency identification and excessive overhead. \nZipCache tackles these challenges with a novel approach. It leverages a channel-separable tokenwise quantization for efficient compression and a normalized attention score as a precise metric for identifying salient tokens.  **This method decouples the saliency calculation from full attention scores, allowing compatibility with fast attention implementations.**  Experiments demonstrate ZipCache's superior compression ratios, faster generation speed, and minimal performance losses, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the memory bottleneck of LLMs.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "5t4ZAkPiJs/podcast.wav"}
