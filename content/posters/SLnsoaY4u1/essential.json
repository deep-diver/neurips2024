Score-based diffusion models have shown promise as expressive image priors but incorporating them efficiently and robustly into diverse reconstruction tasks remains challenging. Existing methods often lack either efficiency, consistency, or robustness, particularly for nonlinear problems.\nThis paper introduces a novel algorithm, DPnP, that leverages the power of score-based diffusion models.  DPnP cleverly integrates two samplers: a proximal consistency sampler focusing on measurement fidelity, and a denoising diffusion sampler utilizing the score functions of the image prior for regularization. The authors establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic guarantees for DPnP, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in various tasks.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "SLnsoaY4u1/podcast.wav"}
