Current approaches often rely on heuristics like the straight-through estimator (STE), which lack theoretical justification.  This leads to accuracy loss compared to their high-precision counterparts, hindering their widespread deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n\nThis research introduces VISPA, a novel training framework that uses Gaussian variational inference to address these issues.  VISPA tackles BNN training by solving low-rank semidefinite programs (SDPs), which explicitly model correlations between weights, unlike previous methods.  This leads to improved accuracy across different datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods.  The approach also provides theoretical support for the use of latent weights and STE, improving upon the heuristic nature of previous approaches.
