The data points are generated from a symmetric Bernoulli distribution. Two subfigures are presented, each showing different levels of noise added during the training process. The trajectories illustrate the path taken by each algorithm towards convergence (or lack thereof). Red triangles mark the optimal solution, while blue triangles represent saddle points.  The figure visually demonstrates how DP-GLMtron outperforms DP-SGD, particularly in higher noise scenarios, by avoiding saddle points and reaching the optimum.", "section": "Proposed DP-GLMtron Algorithm"}, {"figure_path": "3uUIwMxYbR/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparative Performance of Various Differential Privacy Algorithms Across Different Data Spectrum and Privacy Budgets.
