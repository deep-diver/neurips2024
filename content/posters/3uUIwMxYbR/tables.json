Here, N represents the sample size, d refers to the dimension and Deff, Dpri are the (private) effective dimensions. It is noticed that Deff and Dpri are defined in a way that does not directly rely on the dimension d. Instead, they segment the feature space into an effective subspace.For further discussion, please see Remark 4.", "description": "This table compares the upper and lower bounds of the excess population risk for three different differentially private (DP) ReLU regression algorithms: DP-PGD, DP-GLMtron, and DP-TAGLMtron.  It shows the privacy constraints and data assumptions for each method.  The effective dimensions (Deff and Dpri) are highlighted as they are defined differently than in the traditional approach, offering a more nuanced comparison across different algorithms and data characteristics. Note that the effective dimensions do not rely directly on the dimension *d*.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
