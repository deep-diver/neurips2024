Existing augmentation methods using state perturbations are limited.  This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel approach: **Euclidean data augmentation** for state-based continuous control. \n\nThe key innovation is using **limb-based kinematic features** instead of traditional joint configurations. This offers rich data that benefits from Euclidean transformations (rotations, translations). Experiments show this strategy, combined with DDPG, significantly improves both data efficiency and asymptotic performance across various benchmark continuous control tasks, particularly those with high degrees of freedom.  This new approach is a valuable contribution for researchers focused on improving RL efficiency.", "affiliation": "University of South Carolina", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "NwiFLtWGEg/podcast.wav"}
