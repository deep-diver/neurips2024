However, existing algorithms for computing NE in ATMGs either assume full knowledge of game parameters or lack sample complexity guarantees. This creates a critical need for efficient learning algorithms that can approximate NE in ATMGs using only limited feedback from the game, without requiring complete game knowledge.\nThis research introduces a novel learning algorithm, ISPNG, that addresses this need by exploiting the hidden structure of ATMGs and reformulating the problem as a nonconvex-concave min-max optimization problem.  The algorithm cleverly combines policy gradient methods with iterative updates, obtaining polynomial sample and iteration complexity guarantees.  Crucially, ISPNG only needs access to individual rewards and state observations, making it feasible for realistic MARL settings where information is often limited.", "affiliation": "UC Irvine", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "BrvLTxEx08/podcast.wav"}
