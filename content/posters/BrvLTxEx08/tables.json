It is divided into three parts: parameters of the model, estimators, and parameters.  The parameters of the model section includes symbols representing the state space, players, reward functions, action spaces, policy spaces, transition probabilities, discount factors, and visitation measures. Estimators are represented by symbols for a single estimate of the state-action visitation measure, the estimate itself, and gradient estimators. Finally, parameters refer to Lipschitz constants, smoothness constants, and the distribution mismatch coefficient.", "section": "2 Preliminaries"}]
