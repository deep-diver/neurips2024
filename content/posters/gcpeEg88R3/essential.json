Existing methods, like those based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or normalizing flows, often struggle with computational cost and data requirements, particularly when dealing with high dimensionality.  Additionally, many existing methods make restrictive assumptions on data structure which limits their applicability.\nThe paper introduces a new method called Quasi-Bayesian Vine (QB-Vine).  This innovative approach cleverly decomposes the high-dimensional density into one-dimensional marginal densities and a copula, which models the dependencies between the dimensions. Using highly expressive vine copulas combined with efficient Quasi-Bayesian recursive construction for marginal densities, it creates a fully non-parametric density estimator that is flexible, data-efficient and computationally faster than existing methods. Experiments on several high dimensional datasets show it significantly outperforms existing analytical methods.", "affiliation": "University of Warwick", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gcpeEg88R3/podcast.wav"}
