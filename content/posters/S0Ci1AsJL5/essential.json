{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in stochastic approximation and reinforcement learning.  It provides **non-asymptotic guarantees for the accuracy of confidence intervals**, a significant improvement over existing asymptotic results. This opens avenues for more reliable statistical inference in online learning algorithms and enables better analysis of  temporal difference learning.", "summary": "This paper delivers non-asymptotic accuracy bounds for confidence intervals in linear stochastic approximation, leveraging a novel multiplier bootstrap method.", "takeaways": ["Established a Berry-Esseen bound for the accuracy of normal approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged linear stochastic approximation (LSA) iterates.", "Provided non-asymptotic confidence bounds for LSA using a multiplier bootstrap procedure, showing approximation accuracy of order n\u207b\u00b9/\u2074.", "Applied the findings to temporal difference learning, showing the improved efficiency of the method and providing numerical results."], "tldr": "Linear stochastic approximation (LSA) is a cornerstone of many machine learning algorithms, yet constructing reliable confidence intervals for its estimates has been challenging. Existing methods primarily rely on asymptotic normality, which doesn't offer finite-sample guarantees.  This limits their practical use, especially in online learning scenarios where only a limited number of samples are available.  Furthermore, the rate of convergence to normality wasn't well understood for LSA. \nThis research tackles these issues head-on. The authors introduce a novel multiplier bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals for Polyak-Ruppert averaged LSA iterates.  They prove the non-asymptotic validity of this approach, demonstrating approximation accuracy of order n\u207b\u00b9/\u2074 (where n is the number of samples).  Their analysis provides a Berry-Esseen bound, quantifying the rate of convergence to normality, and addresses the crucial issue of finite-sample confidence intervals. The method is applied to the well-known temporal-difference learning algorithm, showing considerable improvement in the accuracy of statistical inference.", "affiliation": "HSE University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "S0Ci1AsJL5/podcast.wav"}
