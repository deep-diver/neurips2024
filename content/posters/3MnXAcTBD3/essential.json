Existing methods struggle to balance these factors, especially when dealing with diverse datasets distributed across multiple nodes.  Many decentralized algorithms converge slowly because information mixing is inefficient, creating a trade-off between communication cost and speed. \nThis paper proposes the B-ary Tree Push-Pull (BTPP) algorithm. BTPP employs two B-ary spanning trees to distribute information efficiently. This approach minimizes communication since each agent only communicates with a small number of neighbors.  Importantly, BTPP is theoretically proven to achieve linear speedup, converging much faster than existing decentralized methods. This improvement is particularly significant for smooth nonconvex and strongly convex objective functions, showing superior performance even on heterogeneous datasets.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3MnXAcTBD3/podcast.wav"}
