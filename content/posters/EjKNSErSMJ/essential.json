Existing methods often rely on strong assumptions or achieve slow convergence rates, hindering their application in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by focusing on a generalized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm.\nThe paper introduces a generalized FW algorithm and demonstrates that it achieves fast last-iterate convergence for both deterministic and stochastic constrained MVIs.  For deterministic MVIs, the algorithm reaches O(T\u207b\u00b9/\u00b2) convergence rate, and a slower O(T\u207b\u00b9/\u2076) is obtained in the stochastic setting.  The analysis connects the FW algorithm to smoothed fictitious play from game theory, leading to new convergence results. This offers a novel and effective approach to solving MVIs, especially in scenarios where strong curvature assumptions or noiseless data may not be realistic.", "affiliation": "Purdue IE", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "EjKNSErSMJ/podcast.wav"}
