### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current research focuses on discrete input manipulations to assess the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this approach is insufficient for open-source models which offer complete access to their internal mechanisms. This paper introduces a new threat model: embedding space attacks which directly manipulate the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than other existing methods. This approach raises serious concerns regarding the security and privacy of open-source LLMs. 

The study demonstrates that embedding space attacks are highly effective in removing safety alignment in various open-source LLMs. Furthermore, it reveals the ability of embedding space attacks to extract seemingly deleted information during unlearning, demonstrating the limitations of current unlearning techniques. This threat model extends to data extraction, as the study shows that these attacks can recover pretraining data. **The findings highlight the vulnerability of open-source LLMs and emphasize the need for improved safety measures**.

> This table presents the cumulative attack success rate (C-ASR) achieved by different embedding space attack methods on the LlamaHP model for the Harry Potter Q&A task.  It compares the performance of attacks using varying numbers of suffix tokens (1, 5, or 20) with two baseline methods, Head Projection Attack (HPA) and Probability Delta Attack (PDA).  The C-ASR metric indicates the percentage of queries for which the correct answer appears at least once across multiple attack attempts.  Higher C-ASR values indicate more successful attacks.





### In-depth insights


#### Embedding Attacks
Embedding attacks represent a novel approach to compromising Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly open-source ones. Unlike traditional methods focusing on manipulating discrete input tokens, **embedding attacks directly target the continuous vector representations of tokens within the model's embedding space**. This offers several advantages:  **higher efficiency**, bypassing established safety mechanisms more effectively and with less computational cost than discrete attacks or fine-tuning; **circumvention of model alignments**, triggering harmful behaviors despite safety measures; and **creation of discrete jailbreaks**, enabling exploitation via standard natural language prompts.  Furthermore, the study highlights the alarming potential of embedding attacks in revealing supposedly deleted information from unlearned models and even extracting portions of pretraining data.  **This raises significant security concerns**, underscoring the vulnerability of open-source LLMs and the need for novel defense mechanisms tailored to this specific threat model.

#### Safety Alignment
The concept of safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, focusing on ensuring that these models behave as intended and avoid generating harmful or unintended outputs.  **The research highlights how open-source LLMs, while offering advantages in accessibility and transparency, present a unique challenge in safety alignment.**  Unlike closed-source models where attacks are often limited to input manipulation, open-source models offer full model access, enabling more sophisticated attacks. The embedding space attack is presented as a particularly effective method, showcasing its capability to bypass existing safety mechanisms more efficiently than traditional discrete attacks or model fine-tuning.  **This method directly targets the continuous embedding representation of input tokens, making it difficult to mitigate through standard defense techniques.**  Moreover, the research demonstrates the vulnerability of unlearning mechanisms, with embedding space attacks showing capacity to extract seemingly deleted information, even potentially recovering portions of pretraining data. This emphasizes **the need for robust security measures beyond traditional safety alignment strategies** when dealing with open-source LLMs.  The ability of embedding space attacks to circumvent safety mechanisms and extract hidden information highlights the urgency of exploring novel safety alignment techniques suited to the unique vulnerabilities of open-source models.

#### Unlearning Threats
Unlearning, the process of removing data from a model, presents significant security challenges.  **A primary threat is the incomplete removal of sensitive information**, leaving residual data vulnerable to extraction through adversarial attacks.  This is especially concerning with open-source LLMs, where model architecture and weights are accessible, enabling the crafting of highly effective attacks directly targeting the embedding space.  **These embedding space attacks bypass traditional safety mechanisms** and can efficiently extract sensitive data that was supposedly removed.  The paper highlights the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating that even with unlearning techniques applied, substantial amounts of data, such as training data or other sensitive user information, remain recoverable.  **The vulnerability is further amplified by the computational efficiency of these attacks**, making them easily deployable by malicious actors. Addressing these threats requires developing more robust unlearning techniques and novel methods for safeguarding the integrity of models against embedding space attacks and data extraction. This necessitates a multi-faceted approach, including improved privacy-preserving training methods and enhanced detection mechanisms for continuous data extraction attacks.

#### Open-Source Risks
Open-source large language models (LLMs) present a unique set of risks due to their accessibility and transparency.  **The ease of access allows malicious actors to leverage the full model architecture for nefarious purposes**, such as generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or creating sophisticated phishing attacks.  Unlike closed-source models, open-source LLMs offer full model visibility, enabling attacks that directly manipulate the continuous embedding space representation of input tokens, circumventing traditional safety mechanisms more efficiently.  This poses a serious challenge to existing safety alignment methods and underscores the need for novel defense strategies.  **Furthermore, the ability to directly access model weights and activations facilitates data extraction attacks**, potentially revealing sensitive information from supposedly unlearned or deleted data, or even exposing components of the original pre-training data.  This emphasizes the crucial need for robust unlearning techniques and further research into the security vulnerabilities of open-source LLMs.  **The ongoing evolution of open-source models, constantly improving in capability, exacerbates these risks**, highlighting the urgent need for proactive and adaptive security measures.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize expanding the scope of embedding space attacks to encompass a wider variety of LLMs and investigate their effectiveness against different safety mechanisms.  **Developing more robust defenses** against these attacks is crucial, perhaps by exploring techniques to enhance model robustness in the continuous embedding space.  **Further research into the transferability** of embedding space attacks from open-source models to closed-source models is needed to fully understand their potential impact.  Investigating the broader implications of these attacks on data privacy and security is essential, particularly regarding the extraction of sensitive information from supposedly unlearned models.  Finally, it is vital to **develop novel methods for evaluating the effectiveness** of both attack and defense techniques in the continuous embedding space, going beyond simple metrics like attack success rates to consider the impact on model utility and safety.

> This figure illustrates the multi-layer attack, a variation of the embedding space attack.  Instead of directly attacking the input embeddings, this method decodes intermediate hidden state representations from various layers within the neural network (represented by h1, h2,...hL). By doing so, the attack aims to extract information that may have been propagated through the model's layers, possibly revealing information that would not be accessible through standard attacks targeting only the final output layer.  The decoded sequences from each layer (T1k+1, T2k+1,... TLk+1) provide alternative interpretations of the input sequence.
