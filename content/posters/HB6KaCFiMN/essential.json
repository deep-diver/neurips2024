{"importance": "This paper is important because it presents **Animate3D**, a novel framework for animating any static 3D model, addressing the limitations of existing 4D generation methods.  It introduces a new multi-view video diffusion model and a two-stage animation pipeline, significantly improving spatiotemporal consistency. This work also contributes a large-scale multi-view video dataset, advancing 4D generation research and opening avenues for improvements in AR/VR, gaming, and film industries.", "summary": "Animate3D animates any 3D model using multi-view video diffusion, achieving superior spatiotemporal consistency and straightforward mesh animation.", "takeaways": ["Animate3D animates any 3D model using a novel framework combining reconstruction and 4D Score Distillation Sampling.", "A new multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) is proposed, enhancing spatiotemporal consistency by integrating 3D and video diffusion models.", "A large-scale multi-view video dataset (MV-Video) is presented, advancing research in 4D generation and facilitating the development of more advanced models and applications in AR/VR, gaming, and film industries. "], "tldr": "Current 4D generation methods struggle with spatiotemporal consistency and lack the ability to effectively leverage existing 3D assets. They often rely on text or single-view image conditioning, leading to limitations in generating realistic and detailed 4D content, particularly when animating complex objects.\n\nAnimate3D overcomes these limitations by introducing a novel multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) trained on a new large-scale dataset (MV-Video). This model generates temporally consistent multi-view videos of static 3D objects, which are then used in a two-stage animation pipeline.  The pipeline leverages reconstruction and 4D score distillation sampling to accurately reconstruct and refine both appearance and motion, enabling straightforward mesh animation without skeleton rigging.", "affiliation": "DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "HB6KaCFiMN/podcast.wav"}
