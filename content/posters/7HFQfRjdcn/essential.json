This instability stems from issues in how these parameterizations handle the characteristic activation boundaries of ReLU neurons. These boundaries define the regions where neurons switch between active and inactive states.  The paper identifies how stochastic optimization methods disrupt the boundaries, impacting training performance. \nTo overcome this, the authors propose Geometric Parameterization (GmP). GmP uses a hyperspherical coordinate system to parameterize neural network weights, effectively separating radial and angular components. This disentanglement stabilizes the characteristic activation boundaries during training. Experiments show that GmP significantly improves optimization stability, accelerates convergence, and enhances the generalization ability of various neural network models, demonstrating its effectiveness on multiple benchmarks.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7HFQfRjdcn/podcast.wav"}
