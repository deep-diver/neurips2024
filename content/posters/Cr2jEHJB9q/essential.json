While larger datasets generally improve performance, larger models and longer input horizons don't always lead to better results, challenging the widely observed scaling laws in other deep learning fields. This inconsistency is a significant hurdle for researchers seeking to develop robust and efficient forecasting models.\nThis paper introduces a new theoretical framework explaining these anomalies by incorporating the impact of the 'look-back horizon' \u2013 the length of past data considered. Through empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models, the researchers validated their theory, revealing an optimal look-back horizon that increases with dataset size.  Their findings provide valuable insights for building more effective models, particularly for datasets of limited size, while also advocating for the development of larger foundational datasets and models.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Cr2jEHJB9q/podcast.wav"}
