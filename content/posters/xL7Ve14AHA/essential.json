Existing methods struggle to guarantee both convergence and the desired structure simultaneously.  Adaptive methods, while empirically successful, lack theoretical guarantees on structure.   \n\nThis paper introduces RAMDA, a Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging algorithm that overcomes these limitations. **RAMDA incorporates a novel inexactness condition and an efficient subproblem solver**, ensuring convergence while attaining the ideal structure induced by the regularizer. Experiments show **RAMDA's superiority over existing adaptive methods in computer vision, language modeling, and speech recognition tasks**, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale modern applications.
