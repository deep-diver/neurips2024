For each node, it lists its neighbors in increasing order of distance. This ordering is used to demonstrate the navigability property of the graph in Figure 1. If a graph is navigable, there will be an edge from each node in the list to a prior node that is closer to the target node (the query).", "section": "3 Upper Bound"}]
