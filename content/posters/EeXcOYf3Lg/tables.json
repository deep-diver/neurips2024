Lower FID scores indicate better image realism, while higher CLS and Key-sim scores suggest better makeup fidelity and content preservation respectively.  The results demonstrate the performance of various GAN-based methods and the proposed SHMT method under different conditions.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "EeXcOYf3Lg/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results of FID, CLS and Key-sim on the MT, Wild-MT and LADN datasets.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed SHMT model against other state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods across three different datasets: MT, Wild-MT, and LADN.  The comparison is based on three evaluation metrics: Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the realism of the generated images;  CLS (class token), which measures makeup fidelity; and Key-sim (key similarity), which measures content preservation of the source image. Lower FID values indicate higher realism, while higher CLS and Key-sim values represent better fidelity and content preservation, respectively.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "EeXcOYf3Lg/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: The quantitative results of our models equipped with different texture details on the LADN dataset.", "description": "This table presents the quantitative results obtained from evaluating several versions of the SHMT model on the LADN dataset. Each model version uses a different level of hierarchical texture detail (from ho to h4), representing varying degrees of high-frequency information.  The results are shown for three metrics: FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), CLS (cosine similarity of CLS token), and Key-sim (cosine similarity of Key-sim).  The table demonstrates a trade-off between preserving source image content (Key-sim) and achieving high makeup fidelity (CLS, FID), with finer details (ho) leading to better content preservation and coarser details (h4) resulting in superior makeup quality.", "section": "A The Effectiveness of Hierarchical Texture Details"}]
