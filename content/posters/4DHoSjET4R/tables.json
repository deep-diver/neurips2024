We note that for the second-price auction, bidders are assumed to not adopt dominated strategies; otherwise the PoA can be 0.", "description": "This table summarizes the Price of Anarchy (PoA) for both second-price and first-price auctions under three different bidding scenarios: full autobidding (only value maximizers), mixed autobidding (both value and utility maximizers), and no autobidding (only utility maximizers).  The PoA measures the inefficiency of the auction outcome compared to the socially optimal outcome. The table shows that the PoA is significantly lower for first-price auctions in the autobidding world compared to the second-price auction, especially when both types of bidders are present.", "section": "1.1 Our Results"}]
