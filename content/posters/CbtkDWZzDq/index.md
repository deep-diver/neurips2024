### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Ensembling deep neural networks enhances model generalization, but scaling ensemble methods for large models is computationally expensive.  Existing methods, such as those based on Bayesian approaches or sampling techniques, often require significant computational resources.  Low precision in representing model parameters is common for resource efficiency, but is often seen as a limitation, rather than an opportunity. 

This paper introduces a novel method called Low Precision Ensembling (LPE) that addresses these limitations. LPE uses a training-free ensemble construction method leveraging low-precision number systems with Bernoulli Stochastic Rounding. The core idea is that the quantization errors inherent in low-precision systems can be viewed as a source of diversity among ensemble members. Experiments demonstrate that LPE is effective, competitive with Bayesian approaches, memory-efficient, and scalable for large models, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and value of this approach.

### In-depth insights


#### Low Precision Ensembling
Low precision ensembling is a novel technique that leverages the quantization errors inherent in low-precision number systems to enhance the diversity of ensemble members.  Instead of viewing these errors as flaws, **the method uses them to generate multiple, distinct models from a single pre-trained model**, improving overall performance without additional training. This approach proves particularly beneficial for large models where traditional ensembling methods are limited by their computational cost and memory requirements.  **Empirical results show that low precision ensembling successfully creates diverse ensemble members that improve downstream performance, surpassing traditional techniques in both accuracy and efficiency.** The training-free nature of the method is a significant advantage, making it easily adaptable to real-world applications with limited computational resources. While initial experiments focused on simpler, symmetric quantization, further exploration of more sophisticated rounding schemes could unlock even greater potential.  **This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for building diverse ensembles of large models in the era of large-scale deep learning.**

#### LPE-BSR Method
The Low Precision Ensembling with Bernoulli Stochastic Rounding (LPE-BSR) method offers a novel approach to ensemble creation by leveraging the inherent quantization errors introduced when using low-precision number systems.  Instead of treating these errors as flaws, **LPE-BSR uses them to generate ensemble diversity**.  The method is particularly advantageous for large models, where the memory cost of traditional ensemble methods can be prohibitive.  **LPE-BSR is training-free**, requiring only a single, pre-trained model as input.  Its simplicity and efficiency make it a promising solution for improving the generalization performance of large models in resource-constrained environments.  By randomly rounding weights to the nearest representable value in a low-precision system, LPE-BSR effectively explores the neighborhood of the original high-precision weights, sampling multiple high-performing models from a single basin. **The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to generate diverse ensemble members**, without the need for extensive computational resources associated with techniques like Bayesian model averaging.

#### Bayesian Ensemble
Bayesian ensembles offer a powerful approach to improve model robustness and predictive performance by combining multiple models.  The core idea is to treat model parameters as random variables and to approximate the posterior distribution over these parameters. This contrasts with traditional ensembling methods that merely aggregate predictions.  **Bayesian approaches provide a principled way to quantify uncertainty and model diversity**, leveraging techniques like stochastic weight averaging (SWAG) or improved variational online Newton (IVON) to estimate the posterior.  The resulting ensemble benefits from the diverse perspectives of individual members, improving generalization, particularly in challenging scenarios with high uncertainty. **A critical aspect of Bayesian ensembling is the efficiency of posterior approximation**: computationally expensive methods may limit scalability for very large models.  **Low precision techniques offer a promising direction towards addressing computational limitations**, enabling construction of diverse ensembles while reducing memory footprints. The trade-off between diversity, accuracy, and computational efficiency remains a key challenge in the development and application of efficient Bayesian ensemble methods.

#### Diversity and Accuracy
The interplay between diversity and accuracy in ensemble methods is a crucial aspect of machine learning.  **Diversity** refers to the extent to which individual models in an ensemble make different predictions; higher diversity generally leads to better generalization.  **Accuracy**, on the other hand, represents the individual model's predictive performance.  Ideally, one seeks an ensemble with high accuracy and high diversity, as highly accurate yet similar models offer limited improvement.  The challenge lies in balancing these two factors.  Methods focusing solely on diversity may inadvertently include low-accuracy models, negatively impacting the overall ensemble performance. Conversely, overly prioritizing accuracy can lead to ensembles lacking sufficient diversity, reducing the potential benefits.  Strategies for achieving optimal diversity and accuracy involve careful model selection, training procedures (such as using different initializations or data subsets), and post-processing techniques, demonstrating that finding the right balance is essential for building robust and effective ensembles.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this low-precision ensembling work could explore more sophisticated quantization methods beyond uniform quantization, potentially leading to even greater diversity and improved performance.  **Investigating the impact of different rounding techniques** and exploring non-uniform quantization schemes is crucial.  Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation on diverse hardware platforms is needed to assess the practical latency gains achievable with low-precision ensembling.  **Extending this approach to other model architectures** beyond vision transformers and language models would demonstrate broader applicability and highlight the method's generality. Finally, exploring the interplay between low-precision ensembling and other advanced ensemble techniques, like Bayesian optimization or model distillation, offers exciting possibilities for further performance improvements and the development of novel, highly efficient and scalable ensemble methods.

> This figure shows a comparison of snapshot ensemble and low precision ensemble methods. It uses radial landscape plots to visualize a two-dimensional subspace of the model's weight space. Three points are highlighted: the first and second snapshot samples from stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SSE), and a sample from low precision ensembling with Bernoulli stochastic rounding (LPE-BSR).  The plots illustrate the negative log-likelihood (loss), and differences between the samples to show their diversity and location on the loss landscape.  LPE-BSR produces a sample distinct from the SSE snapshots, suggesting that LPE-BSR can contribute diverse models to an ensemble even when starting from the same model.
