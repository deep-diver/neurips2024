Diffusion models, while effective in 2D inpainting, often exacerbate these issues when applied to multi-view 3D data.  This limitation stems from the variability in the initial sampled and intermediate latents predicted during the denoising process. \nThe proposed \"In-N-Out\" approach directly addresses this by aligning both the initial and intermediate latents.  It uses a pre-trained NeRF to align initial latents, establishing a consistent foundational structure. A cross-view attention mechanism aligns intermediate latents during the denoising process, improving consistency across views.  A patch-based hybrid loss further enhances the rendering results by optimizing the NeRF.  The results demonstrate that \"In-N-Out\" significantly improves the quality of inpainted 3D representations.", "affiliation": "University of Melbourne", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "gffaYDu9mM/podcast.wav"}
