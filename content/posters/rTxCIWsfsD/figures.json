The solid lines connect observed data points present in the offline dataset (states, actions, rewards, next states). The dashed lines represent the unobserved Q-values (action-values), which are the target variables offline RL algorithms aim to estimate. The figure highlights that while the offline dataset provides some data, the Q-values are inferred based on the observed data and their correlations.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "rTxCIWsfsD/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: In the left, we report the means and standard deviations on CARLA under random simultaneous corruptions.
