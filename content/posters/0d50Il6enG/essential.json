Existing techniques often suffer from slow convergence rates or fail to effectively capture the underlying data geometry, particularly when data lies on low-dimensional manifolds. This is a significant challenge because many real-world datasets exhibit such characteristics.\nThis paper presents two novel non-parametric classification algorithms based on the expand-and-sparsify (EaS) representation, which maps data points to a high-dimensional sparse representation. The first algorithm utilizes a winners-take-all sparsification step and achieves minimax-optimal convergence for data in general high-dimensional spaces.  The second algorithm employs empirical k-thresholding and achieves minimax-optimal convergence rate, dependent only on the intrinsic dimension, for data residing on a low-dimensional manifold. Both algorithms are shown to be consistent and exhibit promising performance in empirical evaluations across multiple datasets.", "affiliation": "Wichita State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "0d50Il6enG/podcast.wav"}
