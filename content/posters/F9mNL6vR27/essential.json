Traditional numerical methods often struggle with nonlinear solvers, especially when multiple solutions exist.  These methods can be computationally expensive and may fail near bifurcation points. This necessitates the development of new methods that can efficiently and reliably find all solutions. \nThis research proposes a novel approach: the Newton Informed Neural Operator. This method leverages the power of neural networks to learn the Newton solver for nonlinear PDEs. By integrating traditional numerical techniques with a neural network, this approach efficiently learns the nonlinear mapping at each iteration of the Newton's method. The result is a single learning process that yields multiple solutions while using far less data than other neural network methods. This significantly reduces computational cost and makes the method applicable to problems with limited data.", "affiliation": "Pennsylvania State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "F9mNL6vR27/podcast.wav"}
