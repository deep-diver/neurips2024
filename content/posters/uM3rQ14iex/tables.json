Different graph densities (p) and latent confounder probabilities (pL) are considered.  The plots show that Algorithm 4 generally requires fewer samples, especially when the probability of latent confounders is low, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed two-stage approach.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "uM3rQ14iex/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Simulations to demonstrate the advantage of Algorithm 4 over full graph discovery (Learning all possible latents)", "description": "This figure compares the number of interventional samples required by Algorithm 4 (which learns a subgraph and a subset of confounders) against two other methods: learning the full induced graph on ancestors of the reward node with all latent confounders and learning only the observable induced graph on ancestors of the reward node.  The results are shown for different graph densities (p) and probabilities of confounders (pL). Algorithm 4 consistently uses fewer samples than the other methods.  The advantage decreases as pL increases.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
