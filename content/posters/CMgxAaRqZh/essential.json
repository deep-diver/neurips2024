Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is an effective method to assess LLM safety by generating adversarial prompts, but its computational cost is high, limiting comprehensive studies. Existing methods like speculative sampling are unsuitable for optimizing discrete tokens in GCG.\n\nThis paper introduces Probe Sampling, a novel algorithm that addresses these issues.  By dynamically assessing the similarity between a smaller 'draft' model's and the target LLM's predictions, Probe Sampling effectively filters out many unpromising prompt candidates. This results in significant speed improvements (up to 5.6x) while maintaining or improving attack success rates.  Furthermore, the approach successfully accelerates other prompt optimization techniques, demonstrating its broad applicability and potential for future research in LLM safety and beyond.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "CMgxAaRqZh/podcast.wav"}
