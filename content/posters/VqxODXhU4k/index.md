### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Nonparametric instrumental variable (NPIV) regression is crucial for identifying causal effects amidst unobservable confounders, but existing methods often rely on restrictive assumptions or face instability issues.  These limitations hinder accurate causal analysis, particularly when dealing with non-linear relationships or binary outcomes (ill-posed inverse problem).  Current approaches use nonlinear generalizations of two-stage least squares or minimax formulations, which can be computationally expensive and sensitive to hyperparameter choices. 

This work introduces SAGD-IV, a functional stochastic gradient descent algorithm that directly minimizes the populational risk for NPIV regression.  It offers theoretical guarantees (excess risk bounds) and shows superior stability and competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods through numerical experiments.  Importantly, SAGD-IV's flexibility enables it to handle various loss functions and data types (including binary outcomes) and allows for flexible estimator choices, making it well-suited to a wider range of real-world scenarios.

### In-depth insights


#### NPIV Risk Minimization
Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression (NPIV) presents a significant challenge due to its ill-posed inverse problem nature.  **Risk minimization** offers a powerful approach to address this, formulating the problem as the search for a function minimizing the expected loss between the conditional expectation of the outcome given the instrument and a transformation of the causal function.  **This approach elegantly sidesteps the need for direct estimation of the often-unstable inverse operator**, offering enhanced stability.  The choice of loss function becomes crucial, with the paper exploring both quadratic and non-quadratic losses (like the binary cross entropy for binary outcomes), highlighting the flexibility of this framework.  **Stochastic gradient descent** in a functional space provides a practical algorithmic solution for minimizing the risk, offering theoretical guarantees in terms of excess risk bounds.  The method's flexibility extends to the choice of function approximators (neural networks, kernel methods), providing a versatile tool for a wider range of applications.

#### SAGD-IV Algorithm
The SAGD-IV algorithm, a novel approach to nonparametric instrumental variable regression, is presented.  **SAGD-IV directly minimizes the population risk**, deviating from existing methods which focus on empirical risk minimization or moment conditions. This is achieved through a **functional stochastic gradient descent method**, where the gradient is analytically computed and estimated stochastically, allowing flexible estimator choices (neural networks or kernel methods). The theoretical guarantees provided include **bounds on excess risk**, demonstrating the method's stability and competitive performance. A key advantage is its **natural extension to binary outcomes**, addressing a limitation of many current NPIV methods.

#### Binary Outcome NPIV
In the context of Nonparametric Instrumental Variable regression (NPIV), handling binary outcomes presents unique challenges.  Traditional NPIV methods often rely on assumptions like additive noise and quadratic loss functions, which are violated when dealing with binary data.  **A key difficulty is that the standard additive noise model does not directly apply**; the relationship between the dependent variable and predictors is more complex, often involving a latent continuous variable linked to the observed binary outcome through a threshold.  This necessitates modifications to the loss function, for instance, employing a binary cross-entropy loss, to better capture the probability of the binary outcome.   **Existing NPIV algorithms often struggle to adapt to these changes**. This is due to the underlying theoretical assumptions used in their design. Therefore, **a novel approach is required** that directly addresses these issues such as modifying the loss function or adopting a different approach to estimation altogether. The development of new algorithms specifically tailored for binary outcome NPIV is a significant area of research that can provide critical advancements for causal inference in a broader range of applications where binary outcomes are prevalent.

#### Estimator Comparisons
A robust comparative analysis of estimators is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of a new method.  This would involve **benchmarking** against state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, varying in size and characteristics.  Key metrics such as **MSE**, runtime, and **stability** (resistance to noise or hyperparameter sensitivity) should be carefully examined.  The analysis should explore the performance across different settings and identify specific scenarios where one estimator significantly outperforms others, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  **Theoretical comparisons**, based on convergence rates or error bounds, would add another layer of rigor, offering insights into the estimators' inherent properties and expected behavior.  Finally, discussing the **computational cost** of each estimator is important for practical implementation, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

#### Future Work & Limits
Future work could explore extending the nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV) method to handle more complex data structures, such as those with high dimensionality or non-additive noise.  **Addressing the computational cost** associated with NPIV, particularly for large datasets, is crucial.  Further theoretical analysis could focus on refining the risk bounds and investigating the algorithm's asymptotic properties under weaker assumptions.  The current limitations stem from reliance on the additive noise assumption, which may not always hold in practice. **Future research should explore robust approaches** that relax this assumption and accommodate different noise distributions or structural models.  Another significant limitation is the need for consistent estimators of the conditional expectation operator and density ratio, warranting further exploration of improved estimation techniques, including those leveraging recent advancements in machine learning. Finally, **assessing the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters** and providing guidance for optimal selection are key considerations for practical applications. Investigating the applicability of the proposed methodology to various causal inference tasks, beyond continuous and binary outcomes, is a promising area for future exploration.
