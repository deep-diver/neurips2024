The left panel shows the log mean squared error (MSE) for each method across different response functions (Step, Abs, Linear, Sin), demonstrating their performance and stability. The right panel shows the estimated structural function for one random realization of the data, where the green dots represent the observations and the black line represents the true structural function. This comparison illustrates the ability of each method to recover the true underlying function.", "section": "Numerical experiments"}, {"figure_path": "VqxODXhU4k/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (Left) Log MSE for each model under different response functions.
