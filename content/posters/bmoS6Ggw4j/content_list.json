Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design.

Within this burgeoning field, task planning in language agents emerges as a critical area of study. It involves LLMs autonomously interpreting user instructions, breaking user\u2019s instructions in natural language into concrete and solvable sub-tasks, and then fulfilling the user\u2019s request by executing each sub-task [43, 46, 45].

In task planning, solvable sub-tasks can be naturally represented as a task graph, wherein each node corresponds to a distinct sub-task, and each edge signifies the dependencies between these sub-tasks. The crux of task planning, therefore, involves selecting a connected path or subgraph to satisfy the user\u2019s request, which is a decision-making problem on graphs. Adopting this framework, we analyze the task planning capabilities of LLMs, specifically within the context of HuggingGPT [46]. Our empirical investigation uncovers that a considerable portion of planning failures can be ascribed to the LLMs\u2019 inefficacy in accurately discerning the structure of the task graph. This finding presents intriguing questions from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Theoretically, it initiates a discussion on the inherent limitations of LLMs in processing task graphs.

Contrary to this hypothesis, it is proved that by taking edge lists as the input, a constant-width Transformer can solve graph decision-making problems by simulating dynamic programming algorithms on edge lists. Nevertheless, we find that LLMs\u2019 solutions lack invariance under graph isomorphism, an important property for graph decision-making problems. In addition, the expressiveness is weakened if the attention is sparse, which is typically observed in LLMs [66]. Beyond expressiveness, we also examine the influence of auto-regressive loss, demonstrating that it introduces spurious correlations that can be harmful to graph decision-making tasks.

In this framework, LLMs generate high-quality explanatory text for each predicted node, which is then fine-tuned by an LM to produce node embeddings. Finally, a GNN performs the downstream classification. We adapt TAPE for task planning by reformulating the problem as classifying user requests into corresponding node labels within the task graph. (2) GraphToken [38] uses GNNs to tokenize graph nodes, which are then fed into LLMs to generate textual outputs.

Further analysis across a broad spectrum of GNNs (as shown in Table 11 and Table 12) reveals that powerful GNNs, such as GINs, perform similarly to networks perceived as less complex, like GCNs, and even underperform compared to GraphSAGE. This pattern indicates that the task\u2019s challenge may not lie in the expressiveness of the models but rather in their ability to generalize. Regarding baselines, TAPE is unsuitable for task planning as its classification approach simplifies task planning, overlooking task dependencies. While GraphToken demonstrates superior performance over LLMs\u2019 direct inference, we have noted instances of minor hallucination. This observation suggests that GraphToken\u2019s understanding of the task graph is not yet perfect.

Task decomposition methods, such as the chain-of-thought approach [63], employ the divide-and-conquer strategy, utilizing LLMs for both task decomposition and sub-task planning. The application of this method to task planning is detailed in Section 2.2 and is referred to as \u201cDirect\u201d in the baseline comparison. Multi-plan selection strategies, exemplified by the tree-of-thought [71] and graph-of-thought [4], leverage search-based methods to generate plans. Subsequently, LLMs evaluate these plans to select the most effective one. The \u201cGraphSearch\u201d methods used in our baselines fall into this category. External planner approaches [31] use LLMs to convert the problem into Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and then employ classic solvers to address the planning problem. PDDL requires a pre-defined goal, for example, moving the blocks from one state to another state. However, the goal of task planning investigated in language agents deals with more flexible and personal goals, spanning personal needs in video, text, and image processing. Translating these goals into formal PDDL is very difficult. We instead demonstrate that GNNs can serve as an effective external planner in this application. Reflection-based methods [48] focus on reflecting upon experiences to refine the plan, while memory-aided planning approaches [73] utilize external experiences, such as those from search engines. These approaches are deployed in interactive environments and orthogonal to this paper.

For example, on platforms like Hugging Face, users\u2019 intentions span across video, text, and image domains. On the contrary, classic planning has a fixed goal for a given domain, e.g., in the n-puzzle [55], the goal is formally as placing the tiles in numerical order.

There are no explicit task graphs in game agents [58], embodied agents [21], and code agents [48]. The core strategy in these domains is to employ verbal reinforcement learning within LLMs. The state and transitions in reinforcement learning can be modeled as nodes and edges in the graph.

In [24], the node with the highest score is selected exclusively. Conversely, [29] employs beam search to improve performance by selecting the top- $k$ nodes in a single iteration.
