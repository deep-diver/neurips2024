However, it often leads to significant accuracy loss, especially in transformer-based models. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods struggle to maintain accuracy when reducing the bit-width of these models. \nThe paper introduces 2DQuant, a dual-stage PTQ method that overcomes these challenges. The first stage, Distribution-Oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI), efficiently determines initial quantizer bounds based on data distribution. The second stage, Distillation Quantization Calibration (DQC), refines these bounds by training the quantized model to mimic its full-precision counterpart using distillation.  2DQuant significantly outperforms existing PTQ methods across various metrics and achieves impressive compression and speedup ratios.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "ADJASE9uQ2/podcast.wav"}
