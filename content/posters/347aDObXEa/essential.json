However, real-world graphs often exhibit geometrically heterogeneous characteristics, making it challenging to capture their intricate structural complexities using a single geometry.  Existing methods often compute graph hyperbolicity and determine the best fit for the whole graph, ignoring local geometric properties.\nThis paper proposes a cross-geometric knowledge distillation framework that leverages both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries in a space-mixing fashion.  It employs multiple teacher models encoding graphs in different geometric spaces, generates hint embeddings to encapsulate distinct geometric properties, uses a structured knowledge transfer module, and incorporates geometric optimization to enhance training efficacy.  The results show significantly improved performance in node classification and link prediction compared to traditional methods and establish the superiority of using multiple geometric contexts for GNN learning.", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "347aDObXEa/podcast.wav"}
