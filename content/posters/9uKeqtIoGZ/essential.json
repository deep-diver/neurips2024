This paper innovates by allowing the decision-maker to use \"best-action queries,\" which reveal the optimal action at a given time.  However, using queries has cost, hence the decision-maker only allows a limited number of queries. This setting is important because predictive features are often expensive to acquire.  Traditional online learning methods struggle with this constraint. \nThe paper addresses this challenge by establishing tight theoretical bounds on the performance of algorithms with access to a limited number of best-action queries. For full-feedback models, it shows that a sublinear number of queries substantially reduces regret. For label-efficient feedback, where feedback is only available during query times, it provides improved regret rates compared to standard label-efficient prediction. These findings highlight how limited, carefully-used queries substantially boost online learning performance, offering valuable insights for resource-constrained applications.", "affiliation": "Sapienza University of Rome", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Online Learning"}, "podcast_path": "9uKeqtIoGZ/podcast.wav"}
