The algorithm uses a learning rate (\u03b7) that depends on the number of queries and the time horizon.  It combines Hedge's weights with a uniform query selection strategy. If a query is issued at time t, the algorithm selects the best action; otherwise, it samples an action probabilistically from the updated weights. This is then used for the proof of the minimax regret bounds in the full feedback case with best-action queries.", "section": "2 Hedge with k Best-Action Queries"}]
