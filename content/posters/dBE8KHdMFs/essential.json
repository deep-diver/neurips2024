Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) offer a promising approach due to their ability to handle continuous-time dynamics. However, existing NODEs often lack scalability and may struggle with guaranteeing convergence, particularly in highly complex scenarios. This is where the limitations arise and where this paper addresses the problem.\nThis paper introduces ControlSynth Neural ODEs (CSODEs), a new type of NODE architecture designed to overcome these limitations.  CSODEs achieve guaranteed convergence through the use of tractable linear inequalities, making them more robust and reliable.  The incorporation of an additional control term allows CSODEs to effectively capture dynamics at multiple scales simultaneously, greatly enhancing their flexibility and applicability to complex systems. Extensive experiments show that CSODEs outperform existing NODE variants, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and predictive performance across diverse challenging dynamical systems.", "affiliation": "Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dBE8KHdMFs/podcast.wav"}
