### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Finetuning large language models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL) is challenging due to high memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices.  Existing methods, such as backpropagation, require excessive memory, while zero-order methods suffer from slow convergence and accuracy issues.  Forward-mode auto-differentiation (AD) shows promise in reducing memory, but its direct application to LLM finetuning leads to poor performance.

The paper introduces SPRY, a novel FL algorithm that addresses these challenges. SPRY splits the trainable weights of an LLM among participating clients, allowing each client to compute gradients using forward-mode AD on a smaller subset of weights.  This strategy reduces the memory footprint, improves accuracy, and accelerates convergence.  SPRY's effectiveness is demonstrated empirically across a wide range of language tasks, models, and FL settings, showcasing its significant memory and computational efficiency improvements over existing methods.  Theoretical analysis supports its unbiased gradient estimations under homogeneous data distributions, highlighting its practical value.

> This figure illustrates the workflow of the SPRY algorithm. It starts with a language model whose backbone is frozen, and only PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning) weights are trainable. These trainable weights are split across multiple clients. The server sends the frozen weights and a subset of trainable weights along with a seed to each client. Each client then uses forward-mode auto-differentiation to compute the Jacobian-vector product (JVP) and updates its assigned weights. Finally, the server aggregates the updated weights from all clients to update the global model.

### In-depth insights


#### Memory-Efficient FL
The concept of "Memory-Efficient FL" centers on optimizing federated learning (FL) algorithms to minimize memory consumption, particularly crucial for resource-constrained edge devices.  **This is achieved through various techniques, including the strategic use of forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD), which avoids the need to store intermediate activation values during backpropagation.**  By splitting trainable weights among clients, each device handles a smaller portion, further reducing the memory burden.  This approach, while potentially introducing bias in gradient estimates, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions, can be mitigated through careful algorithm design. The trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy is a key consideration; while memory efficiency is prioritized, it is important to ensure minimal performance degradation.  **Formal analysis, including proofs of unbiasedness for homogeneous data and convergence rate estimations, often accompanies these methods.** Empirical evaluations on varied language models and datasets are essential to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of such memory-efficient techniques, often showcasing significant memory footprint reductions while maintaining comparable accuracy to traditional approaches.

#### SPRY Algorithm
The SPRY algorithm tackles the memory-intensive challenge of finetuning large language models (LLMs) within federated learning (FL) settings.  **Its core innovation lies in splitting the LLM's trainable weights across multiple clients**, each handling a subset.  This dramatically reduces the memory demands on individual devices, making FL more practical for resource-constrained environments.  Instead of traditional backpropagation, SPRY uses **forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD)**, further minimizing memory consumption by avoiding the need to store intermediate activations. While forward-mode AD alone can be slow and inaccurate, SPRY's clever weight-splitting strategy ensures each client computes gradients based on a smaller, manageable weight subset. The resultant gradients are then aggregated by a central server.  **Theoretical analysis proves SPRY's unbiased gradient estimation for homogeneous data distributions**, highlighting that heterogeneity introduces bias.  The algorithm's convergence is also shown to be inversely proportional to the number of federated learning rounds.  **Empirical evaluations demonstrate SPRY's superiority in memory efficiency and speed compared to backpropagation and other zero-order methods**, showing significant gains in accuracy and convergence while maintaining relatively low communication overhead.

#### Theoretical Analysis
The theoretical analysis section of this research paper on memory-efficient federated fine-tuning of language models is crucial for understanding SPRY's performance and limitations.  It rigorously examines SPRY's convergence rate, demonstrating that the global gradients decrease inversely proportional to the number of federated learning rounds. This is particularly important for resource-constrained devices, showing its efficiency. The analysis also investigates the impact of data heterogeneity on the accuracy of gradient estimations, formally proving that SPRY's global gradient estimations are unbiased for homogeneous data but become increasingly biased with data heterogeneity. **This highlights the trade-off between memory efficiency and the robustness of SPRY in diverse real-world settings.**  The theoretical analysis is accompanied by a derivation of SPRY's convergence rate, providing further insights into its performance and potentially guiding hyperparameter selection for optimal results. **The combination of convergence rate analysis and an unbiasedness proof under homogeneity makes this a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed algorithm.**  The formal proofs and analysis contribute significantly to the trustworthiness of SPRY and demonstrate the researchers' rigorous approach towards validating their method.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of this research paper, ablation studies likely investigated the impact of specific design choices within the SPRY framework. This might include assessing the effects of using different parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, varying communication frequencies in the federated learning process, altering the number of trainable weights or the number of clients participating in each round, and examining the impact of the layer-splitting strategy.  The results from these experiments would help determine the relative importance of different architectural components and algorithmic choices and would be used to support the effectiveness of the overall method. **The key insight here is to gauge the influence of each component on both accuracy and efficiency to optimize the design.** Analyzing this section would provide a detailed understanding of the model's sensitivity to each variable and its contribution to the overall system‚Äôs performance.  **Understanding such sensitivity helps to isolate important features and provides insights into how to further refine the model in future iterations.** The ablation study section is crucial in supporting the robustness and validity of the results presented in the paper.  **It allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the overall methodology and strengthens the overall findings.**

#### Future of SPRY
The future of SPRY hinges on addressing its current limitations and capitalizing on its strengths.  **Improving the computational efficiency of forward-mode AD** is crucial, potentially through optimized implementations or hardware acceleration.  This would significantly enhance SPRY's speed and practicality for real-world applications.  **Reducing the memory footprint further**, perhaps by exploring more sophisticated weight-splitting techniques or advanced memory management strategies, is another key area. Addressing the limitations imposed by data heterogeneity, particularly through theoretical advancements and algorithm refinements, will be essential for broader applicability and robustness.  **Exploring SPRY's integration with other PEFT methods** beyond LORA could uncover even greater potential for accuracy and efficiency.   Finally, rigorous testing across a wider range of LLM architectures, datasets, and federated learning environments is vital to solidify SPRY's position as a leading method for memory-efficient federated finetuning.

Subfigure (a) shows how changing the number of perturbations per batch (K) affects the performance. Subfigure (b) demonstrates the effect of varying the number of participating clients (C) per round.  Subfigure (c) compares the performance of SPRY (using the proposed weight-splitting and forward-mode AD) and its alternatives: FEDAVG (standard federated averaging), FEDAVGSPLIT (federated averaging with SPRY's weight-splitting strategy applied), and FEDFGD (SPRY without the weight-splitting strategy). The results show the effectiveness of SPRY's core components for achieving high accuracy and fast convergence.

> This figure shows the architecture of SPRY, a federated learning framework for efficient finetuning of large language models. It illustrates the process of assigning trainable layers to different clients, computing gradients using forward-mode automatic differentiation, updating weights on the client side, and aggregating the updated weights on the server side to update the global model.  The figure includes a legend explaining the symbols used to represent different data types (vectors, scalars, matrices). The figure also highlights that SPRY works with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods.

> This figure shows the results of ablation studies on three different hyperparameters of SPRY: the number of perturbations per batch (K), the number of participating clients (C), and whether the layer splitting strategy was used or not. The plots show that increasing K improves performance up to a certain point, after which additional gains diminish. Increasing the number of participating clients also improves accuracy. Finally, the results demonstrate that the layer splitting strategy is necessary for SPRY to achieve good performance, as removing this strategy leads to a significant reduction in accuracy.

> This table compares the communication costs (in terms of parameter count) of SPRY and its baseline methods. The costs are broken down by the communication frequency (per-epoch or per-iteration), and the direction of communication (from client to server or vice-versa). For each method, the table shows the communication cost for a single client and the total communication cost across all clients.

> This table compares the computation costs of SPRY against other baselines (backpropagation-based and zero-order methods). It breaks down the costs into client-side (per iteration) and server-side (per round) computations. The computation cost is analyzed based on the number of layers (L), the number of participating clients (M), the cost of matrix multiplication (c), the overhead of column-by-column vector multiplication in jvp (v), the size of each layer (we), and the number of perturbations per iteration (K).
