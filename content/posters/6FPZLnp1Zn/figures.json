The x-axis represents the iteration number, and the y-axis represents the average cost.  The graph shows the convergence of both algorithms over multiple trials (indicated by shaded regions representing standard deviations), demonstrating the performance of the robust method relative to the non-robust approach.", "section": "Simulation Results"}]
