It shows the motion fidelity and image quality achieved using various methods, including the baseline (Origin), a method using content removal, one that combines content removal and motion channel filtering (CR & MCF, which is the authors' proposed approach), and the authors' proposed approach applied with synthesis guidance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors' proposed method in improving motion fidelity and image quality.", "section": "5.3 Motion Feature Design"}, {"figure_path": "ZvQ4Bn75kN/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Motion Channel Ablation.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study on the number of motion channels used in the MOFT (Motion Feature) extraction process.  The study varied the number of channels used (top 1%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 50%, 100%), and measured the impact on both Motion Fidelity and Naturalness. The results show that using the top 4% of channels yields the best performance, achieving the highest scores for both metrics.", "section": "5.3 Motion Feature Design"}]
