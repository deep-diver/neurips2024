### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally expensive to train, especially when creating multiple variants of different sizes. This paper tackles this issue by exploring an alternative to repeated, full retraining: **pruning an existing large LLM and retraining it with significantly less data.** This approach uses a combination of techniques such as depth, width, attention and MLP pruning, combined with knowledge distillation based retraining. 

The researchers developed a guide of best practices to perform model compression based on their detailed experimental analysis.  They used this guide to compress a family of LLMs, obtaining 8B and 4B models from a 15B model and comparing their performance on various tasks. The resulting smaller models (MINITRON) showed comparable or better performance to other existing models, with significant training cost reductions (up to 40 times less tokens).

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Compression
LLM compression techniques aim to reduce the size and computational cost of large language models (LLMs) while preserving their performance.  **Pruning**, a common method, involves removing less important parameters (weights and connections) from the model.  Different pruning strategies exist, such as unstructured, structured (e.g., pruning entire layers, heads, or channels), and those guided by various criteria like weight magnitude, gradient information, or activation patterns.  **Knowledge distillation** is another key technique, transferring knowledge from a larger, more complex teacher model to a smaller student model.  This typically involves training the student model to mimic the teacher model's output and/or intermediate representations.   **Quantization** reduces the precision of numerical representations (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers), lowering memory footprint and computational demands.  **Combining multiple techniques** often yields the best results, leading to substantial compression without significant performance degradation. The choice of optimal compression strategy depends on factors such as the specific LLM architecture, target size, and desired performance trade-offs.

#### Pruning Strategies
Effective pruning strategies for large language models (LLMs) are crucial for achieving optimal compression and performance.  **Structured pruning**, which removes entire blocks of weights instead of individual ones, is a popular approach.  Different axes can be targeted, including **depth (layers)**, **width (attention heads, MLP neurons, embedding channels)**, and combinations thereof.  The choice of pruning axis and the order of pruning significantly impact the resulting model's performance. For instance, width pruning may outperform depth pruning after retraining, highlighting the importance of iterative processes and knowledge distillation.  **Determining the importance of each component** is vital, employing various metrics like activation-based importance or gradient-based methods.  Combining these techniques, researchers often develop **best practices** for selecting axes, order, and retraining strategies for optimal cost and accuracy trade-offs. **Data-efficient retraining** via techniques like knowledge distillation is key to minimize retraining costs and preserve model accuracy after pruning, making this a critical aspect of effective pruning strategies. Ultimately, the selection of the best approach depends heavily on the specific LLM architecture, task, and available computational resources.

#### Distillation Methods
Distillation methods in large language model (LLM) compression are crucial for transferring knowledge from a larger, more capable teacher model to a smaller, faster student model.  **Effective distillation techniques minimize information loss during compression, resulting in improved student model performance.**  This often involves matching the teacher's output probability distributions or intermediate hidden states, leveraging various loss functions like KL divergence or MSE to guide the training process. **The choice of loss function and the specific aspects of the teacher model that are distilled (logits, hidden states, embeddings) significantly impact the final student model's accuracy and efficiency.**  Furthermore, **retraining strategies, such as iterative pruning and distillation or lightweight retraining, play a pivotal role in recovering accuracy losses associated with the compression process.**  The optimal approach depends heavily on factors such as the model's architecture, target size, available data, and desired computational cost.  Research indicates that **combining different distillation methods or employing advanced techniques such as layer normalization can enhance the effectiveness of distillation.**  Careful design and selection of distillation methods is critical to achieving a balance between model size reduction and performance preservation.  Ultimately, successful LLM compression hinges on a well-defined strategy incorporating suitable distillation methods, along with other techniques such as pruning and knowledge transfer.

#### MINITRON Results
The MINITRON results demonstrate a **successful approach to compressing large language models (LLMs)**. By combining pruning techniques with knowledge distillation, MINITRON achieves significant reductions in model size (2-4x) while maintaining or exceeding performance compared to other similarly-sized LLMs. The **reduction in training costs is substantial (up to 40x fewer training tokens)** compared to training smaller models from scratch, highlighting the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this approach.  MINITRON models exhibit competitive performance across various benchmarks, often matching or surpassing other popular models like Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B, and Llama-3 8B.  The results underscore that **pruning and knowledge distillation are effective strategies for creating efficient and high-performing LLMs**, potentially democratizing access to these powerful models.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this paper on compact language models could involve several key areas.  **Extending the pruning and distillation techniques to other LLM architectures** beyond the Nemotron family is crucial for broader applicability.  Investigating the effectiveness of **combining these methods with other compression strategies**, such as quantization or low-rank approximation, warrants exploration to achieve even greater efficiency gains.  A deeper understanding of the **trade-offs between compression rate, computational cost during retraining, and downstream task performance** is needed.  Furthermore, **developing more sophisticated importance analysis methods** that better capture the complex interactions within LLMs could refine the pruning process.  Finally, exploring the impact of **different training data distributions and their effect on the performance of pruned models** will help optimize the retraining stage.  Research into **transfer learning techniques for adapting pruned models to new downstream tasks** with minimal retraining would also broaden their utility.

> üîº This table compares the performance of the MINITRON 8B model against several baselines, including the original Nemotron-4 15B, Nemotron-3 8B, and various other community models.  Key metrics across multiple benchmarks (Knowledge, Logic, and Coding) are presented, highlighting MINITRON 8B's performance despite using significantly fewer training tokens (40x fewer than Nemotron-3 8B).  The asterisk (*) indicates results taken from other published papers.

> Table 2: Performance of our pruned MINITRON 8B model compared to multiple baselines: the original Nemotron-4 15B, the previous generation Nemotron-3 8B, and multiple community models. MINITRON 8B uses 40x fewer tokens than Nemotron-3 8B. All evaluations run by us, except for entries marked with *, which we report from the corresponding papers.
