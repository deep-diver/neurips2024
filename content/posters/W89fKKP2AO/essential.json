Existing methods for creating models that work with these features often fail to generalize to complex network architectures.  This limits the ability to develop efficient and effective learned optimizers that consider the weight space's symmetry.\nThis work introduces Universal Neural Functionals (UNFs), an algorithm that constructs permutation-equivariant models for any weight space.  The authors demonstrate improved performance when using UNFs in learned optimizers for image classifiers, language models, and recurrent networks. This is a significant advancement that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and provides a flexible framework for future research on weight-space modeling.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "W89fKKP2AO/podcast.wav"}
