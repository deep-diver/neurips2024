In addition, models trained with instruction-following data [7] have shown promising results in understanding human instruction and performing the corresponding imageprocessing tasks. Previous studies [21\u201323, 74, 73] have illustrated that with instruction-following data, we can simply fine-tune a text-to-image generation model to perform various vision tasks such as image editing [7, 21, 74], object detection [22], segmentation [23], inpainting [23, 73], and depth estimation [22, 9].

In PromptFix, we address several challenges that compromise the performance of the model. First, the use of stable-diffusion architecture [57] as a generative prior often faces the issue of spatial information loss, which is caused by VAE compression [20]. Unlike unconditional or text-to-image generation, maintaining spatial detail consistency in image processing poses significant challenges, particularly with high-frequency components like text, as shown in Figure 5. To tackle this problem, we introduce High-frequency Guidance Sampling, in which we use a low-pass fliter operator [50, 53] to calculate the fidelity constraint and integrate VAE skip-connect features during inference with a lightweight LoRA [27] fusion. Second, since the generative prior is not trained on low-level images, so relying solely on instructions may not always yield the desired outcome, especially when the image degradation is severe. To tackle this degradation adaptation problem, we introduce an auxiliary prompt module to provide models with more descriptive text prompts to enhance controllability for image generation. The auxiliary text prompt can be obtained by VLMs [43]. This approach introduces a semantic caption for a degraded image and the description of its defects, such as blurriness or insufficient lighting. The auxiliary prompt module is implemented by an additional attention layer in diffusion U-Net that adapts both instruction and auxiliary prompts as conditions and intermittently omits instructional prompts during training. We identify three key advantages of this approach: 1) enabling the model to process images with severe degradation, such as extremely low-resolution images, 2) adapting the model for blind restoration for different types of image degradation, and 3) providing additional pathways for a more precise semantic representation of the target image.

In traditional image editing, models primarily focused on singular tasks such as style transfer or domain adaptation [24, 55], leveraging various techniques to encode images into a manipulatable latent space, such as those used by StyleGAN [34]. Concurrently, the advent of text-to-image diffusion models [26, 57, 63, 65] has broadened the scope of image editing [7, 25]. Kim et al. [35] showed how to perform global changes, whereas Avrahami et al. [4] successfully performed local manipulations using user-provided masks for guidance. While most works that require only text (i.e., no masks) are limited to global editing [17, 36]. Bar-Tal et al. [6] proposed a text-based localized editing technique without using any mask, showing impressive results. For local image editing, precise manipulations are possible by inpainting designated areas using either user-provided or algorithmically predicted masks [16], all while preserving the visual integrity of the adjacent areas. In contrast, instruction-based image editing operates through direct commands like \u201cadd fireworks to the sky,\u201d avoiding the need for detailed descriptions or regional masks. Recent approaches utilize synthetic input-goal-instruction triples [7] and incorporate human feedback [76] to execute editing instructions effectively. Despite the advances in using diffusion models for various instruction-guided image editing tasks, there is still a notable gap in research specifically addressing instruction-guided image restoration with these models.

For the watermark removal task, it effectively restores the original image without introducing artifacts, outperforming MGIE [21] and other methods. In desnowing and low-light enhancement, PromptFix achieves clearer and more natural outputs, significantly reducing noise and enhancing visibility. Additionally, in super-resolution, PromptFix demonstrates remarkable clarity and accuracy, preserving fine details and surpassing all comparative methods. In dehazing, although PromptFix\u2019s performance is visually comparable to image restoration experts PromptIR [52] and AirNet [38], PromptFix outperforms the recent stable-diffusion-based method Diff-plugin [46], achieving a clean, sharp appearance, and closely matching the ground truth.

The High-frequency Guidance Sampling (HGS) method is introduced to balance fidelity and quality. To validate the effectiveness of HGS, we conduct qualitative experiments and quantitative experiments. As depicted in Figure 5, in a low-light scenario, the model aims to enhance the visibility (quality) of the input image while preserving its original textual details (fidelity). For baselines leveraging stable-diffusion as a generative prior, the strong compression capability of VAE also brings the issue of spatial information loss, as demonstrated by InstructDiff [23], MGIE [21], and Diff-Plugin [46] in Figure 5. This issue is independent of the model\u2019s ability to effectively follow instructions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
