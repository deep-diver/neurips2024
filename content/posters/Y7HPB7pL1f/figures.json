In the user interaction stage, given a pre-trained clustering model, IDC first selects high-value samples based on hardness, representativeness, and diversity. Then it inquires the user about the affiliations of the selected samples relative to their nearest cluster centers. In the model optimization stage, IDC utilizes both positive and negative user feedback to finetune the pre-trained model with positive and negative losses for cluster performance improvement. Meanwhile, IDC adopts a regularization loss on high-confident predictions to prevent overfitting inquired samples.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two-stage process of the Interactive Deep Clustering (IDC) method.  The first stage involves selecting valuable samples (based on hardness, representativeness, and diversity) and querying the user about their cluster assignments.
