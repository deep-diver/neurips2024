Existing methods that rely solely on data augmentation and pseudo-labeling often fail to effectively address these \"hard\" samples, leading to performance limitations. This is a significant problem as many real-world datasets contain such ambiguous data points.\nThis paper introduces Interactive Deep Clustering (IDC), a novel approach that directly tackles this issue by incorporating user interaction.  IDC quantitatively assesses sample value based on factors such as hardness, representativeness, and diversity, enabling the efficient selection of informative samples.  Through a user-friendly interface, users provide feedback on the cluster assignments of these samples, which is then used to fine-tune the pre-trained model. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art deep clustering methods at minimal user interaction cost.", "affiliation": "Sichuan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Y7HPB7pL1f/podcast.wav"}
