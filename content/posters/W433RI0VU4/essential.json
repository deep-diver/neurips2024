Existing data generation methods often disrupt inherent problem structures, leading to computationally trivial or infeasible instances. This paper tackles this critical issue.\n\nThe researchers introduce MILP-StuDio, a novel framework that generates high-quality MILP instances by carefully preserving their block structures.  This is achieved through block decomposition, a structure library, and three novel operators (removing, substituting, and appending block units). Experiments demonstrate MILP-StuDio's ability to generate instances with flexible sizes while maintaining feasibility and computational hardness, thus significantly improving the performance of learning-based solvers.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "W433RI0VU4/podcast.wav"}
