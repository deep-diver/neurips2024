A major challenge in adopting a more individualized approach to LLM alignment is its lack of scalability, as it involves repeatedly acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each individual\u2019s preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm where users specify what they value most within the system message, steering the LLM\u2019s generation behavior to better align with the user\u2019s intentions.

To improve this generalization, we create MULTIFACETED COLLECTION, augmenting 66k user instructions into $197\\mathbf{k}$ system messages through hierarchical user value combinations.

A majority of studies build on the RLHF pipeline, designing customized reward functions to prevent rewarding individualized outputs in a one-size-ftis-all manner. To address this issue, a recent stream of research has focused on modeling the distribution of human preferences embedded in annotated data and subsequently calibrating the reward model to align with these preferences [38, 71, 80]. These studies aim to reduce annotation disagreements by more accurately simulating the views of a target population. Another line of research highlights the insufficiency of a single reward model and focuses on learning a mixture of preference distributions [7], training individual reward models signaling a specific preference [8], or jointly training a separate user model and reward model on user information and user preference data [42]. To obtain Pareto-optimal generalization across a spectrum of preferences, several works use weight merging techniques to composite multiple policy models each trained with different reward models [25, 62]. While the aforementioned approaches predominantly involve re-training reward models and LLMs to adapt to new preferences, often proving impractical due to the multitude of potential preference variants, we propose to train an LLM that could conform when explicitly stated during test time. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Utilizing system messages for context Providing context to an LLM is as easy as giving a textual prompt as input. When a user desires to instill specific behavior when performing a task into an LLM, such as impersonating a role [57, 64] or personalization [49], a prevalent method is to simply include the context as part of the user instruction. The component of the model input specialized for such purpose, coined as system message [79], is introduced with ChatGPT2 [55]. For closed-source models accessible by API services, system messages can be set by developers in the API request (e.g., Mistral3, Claude4, Command $\\mathrm{R}^{5}$ ). This feature facilitates analysis of the behaviors of top-performing LLMs by diversifying social roles and personalities in system messages [29, 93]. Open-source models report to have trained with specific system messages in an input template include Orca [51] and LLaMA 2 [77], with the purpose of invoking step-by-step explanation or maintaining consistency of responses, respectively. While these works corroborate that diversifying system messages instead of default system messages improves performance, the content of system messages studied in previous works is limited in number and domain, making it insufficient to observe the entire space of human preferences.

Since the length distribution of responses from JANUS 7B closely matches that of the reference answers, the verbosity can be seen as the result of supervised learning.

Interestingly, a similar trend is observed across other models that are not even trained with multifaceted system messages, but with varying magnitudes of performance drops. A proprietary LLM from which the ability of JANUS was distilled, GPT-4-Turbo-0125, experiences a slight decline in performance yet still scores the highest under both conditions. Conversely, models like Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 and Mistral 7B v0.2 face substantial decreases. The results imply that JANUS can generate quality responses regardless of the presence of a system message.

Details of default system messages and response collection are in Appendix F. Table 7 shows results using MULTIFACETED BENCH and MT-Bench, with representative baselines for comparison. Training with multifaceted system messages improves both multifacetedness and helpfulness metrics, while default system messages only enhance helpfulness at the cost of reduced multifacetedness. While generating multifaceted responses without system messages shows some improvement, it underperforms compared to models with explicit system messages. This suggests that generating personalized responses without supervision of verbalized preferences is challenging.

", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Broader impact of generalizing system messages instead of user messages We identify significant potential in utilizing meta-instructions in system messages rather than in user messages to reach many alignment targets. While some meta-instructions are dependent on specific user messages, it can also be more general. For example, the system message illustrated in Figure 2 is applicable to any kind of coding problems. In practical applications, preferences can be programmatically set as meta-instructions when relevant user queries are submitted, offering two key advantages: 1) automatic reflection of common user needs across various instructions, and 2) reduced user burden of specifying a meta-instruction every time. Applications like ChatGPT already offers features like custom instructions8 and memory controls9: a user can specify their preferences in the custom instruction by oneself (e.g., When I ask you for math problems, please incorporate visual aids.) or ChatGPT will memorize the details itself from the conversations. We believe that including implicit user preferences in the system message without user specification is an important milestone for seamless chat experience, and a model trained for system message generalization will be necessary. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and future work Our work is focused on representing user values that constitute a preference in the form of meta-instructions and training models to follow meta-instructions in the form of system messages. While our approach shows promise, several limitations warrant consideration. The reliance on synthetic training data presents inherent challenges, as direct human evaluation of the entire MULTIFACETED COLLECTION dataset remains unfeasible. Although the performance of JANUS suggests generally high data quality and demonstrates lower toxicity levels compared to baseline benchmarks, the flexibility in preference specification may increase vulnerability to malicious attacks such as jailbreaking. To address these concerns, we incorporate safety considerations by including a harmlessness dimension in every system message and implement safeguards in our data generation process. However, the challenge of capturing implicit preferences from previous conversations to form system messages appropriately and managing system message controls remains application-dependent and beyond our current scope. Future work should explore these challenges through dialogue summarization techniques [91, 95], along with enhancing safety through increased safety-related training data and integration with moderation techniques such as LLaMA-Guard [24].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
