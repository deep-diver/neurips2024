However, these models suffer from quadratic complexity and limited decoder capabilities, hindering practical applications.  The high computational cost and model size of these methods limit their use in resource-constrained settings. Existing Transformer-based MPM models also struggle to reconstruct masked patches with lower information density effectively.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, this paper presents LCM, a Locally Constrained Compact point cloud Model.  LCM utilizes local aggregation layers to replace self-attention in the encoder, achieving linear complexity and significantly reducing parameters.  A locally constrained Mamba-based decoder is used to efficiently handle varying information densities in the input. Extensive experiments demonstrate LCM's superior performance and efficiency compared to Transformer-based models across various downstream tasks. This is achieved with a significant reduction in computational cost and model size.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "H1NklRKPYi/podcast.wav"}
