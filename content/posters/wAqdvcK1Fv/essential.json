Existing methods often rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which can be computationally expensive and lack theoretical guarantees.  This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel loss function called Energy Discrepancy (ED) and proposing a framework to efficiently train discrete EBMs. \nThe proposed framework uses discrete diffusion processes on structured spaces, informed by the data's underlying graph structure.  The continuous-time parameter of the diffusion process provides fine-grained control over the perturbation, improving the quality of the model's learning.  The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness on several datasets, showing improved performance over existing MCMC-based approaches in various downstream tasks, including synthetic data generation and classification.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wAqdvcK1Fv/podcast.wav"}
