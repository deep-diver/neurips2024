However, their modular fashion always needs high-quality human labels as a prerequisite for training the whole pipeline, which places the auto labeling as a chicken-or-egg problem. Due to the data sparsity and imbalance, the supervised training fashion on limited seen categories also struggles to effectively perform auto-labeling in open-set settings. In particular, the compensated points of small and distant objects (e.g., traffic cone, traffic light) over the entire sequence are still extremely sparse, so the auto-labeling models will lose effectiveness during object-centric prediction. Furthermore, these auto-labeling models might not flexibly generalize well due to unavoidable domain shifts arising from different types of 3D sensors.

Foundation models empower our ZOPP comprehensive capability of language understanding to establish various perception tasks for open-set settings in a zero-shot manner. We enhance SAM-Track to ensure semantic and instance consistency among object mask tracks across multiple views. The proposed parallax occlusion and noise filtering can produce robust 3D semantic and panoptic segmentation results after the well-aligned correspondence between point clouds and multi-view image planes. Equipped with the proposed point completion module, we can generate dense completed points and subsequently interpret precise 3D bounding boxes. These modules cooperate to make the 3D segmentation and detection more accurate and consistent, especially for dynamic foreground objects. Finally, we decode high-quality 4D occupancy by concentrating on the geometry quality and visual appearance with neural rendering reconstruction fashion. Extensive experimental results not only demonstrate that ZOPP substantially advances promising open-set perception results in offboard manner for outdoor AD scenes, but also show a profound significance in industry auto-labeling applications.

Moreover, ZOPP may raise concerns about data capturing, abuse, privacy, and legal implications in driving surroundings. Nonetheless, ZOPP still offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing for seamless integration with SOTA models to meet diverse application requirements, showcasing resilience and applicability in both industry and daily lives.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
