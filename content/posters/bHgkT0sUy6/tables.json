It includes parameters related to the number of policies (N), optimality ratio (\u03c1), diversity scaling factor (\u03b2), and learning rates for both the critic and actor networks. Other parameters include an update rate (\u03b1x), a constant for scaling intrinsic rewards (\u03ba), and various sizes of the neural network layers.", "section": "D.1 Hyper-parameters"}, {"figure_path": "bHgkT0sUy6/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Execution time of the algorithms update function.
