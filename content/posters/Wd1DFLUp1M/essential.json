Existing methods struggle with leveraging the full potential of pretrained behavior models, often requiring additional networks or retraining.  This paper addresses these issues by utilizing diffusion policies. \nThe proposed method, Efficient Diffusion Alignment (EDA), tackles these challenges by representing diffusion policies as the derivative of a scalar neural network. This allows for direct density calculations, making them compatible with existing LLM alignment techniques.  EDA then extends preference-based alignment to align diffusion behaviors with continuous Q-functions through a novel contrastive training approach.  The results show EDA's superior performance and high efficiency, outperforming baselines, especially with limited annotation data.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Wd1DFLUp1M/podcast.wav"}
