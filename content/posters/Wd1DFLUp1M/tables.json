The table shows the average normalized scores across five random seeds for each algorithm on various D4RL tasks, categorized by environment and dataset difficulty (e.g., HalfCheetah Medium-Expert, Hopper Medium-Replay).  Scores within 5% of the highest score for each task are highlighted.  The results demonstrate the superior performance of EDA compared to other approaches.", "section": "5.1 D4RL Evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "Wd1DFLUp1M/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Evaluation results of D4RL benchmarks (normalized according to [10]).
