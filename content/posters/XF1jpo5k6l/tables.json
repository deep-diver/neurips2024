For each model, it provides the number of parameters (Nparameters), the number of layers (Nlayers), and the number of neurons in each layer (Nneurons). The models are grouped by their family (GPT-2, OPT, Llama 2, Qwen, gemma, StableLM, Mistral, and Mamba).", "section": "Supplementary Tables"}, {"figure_path": "XF1jpo5k6l/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table A.2: Per ROI tests of the interaction between hemisphere and model size. The first column is the name of each ROI. The second column gives the p-value of the two sample t-test between the set of slopes of all the voxels of the left vs. the right corresponding ROI, whose means and 95% confidence intervals are depicted in Fig. 7b. The third column presents the correlation between the difference in performance of the models (the r-scores) on the left hemisphere minus the right hemisphere as a function of the logarithm of the number of parameters, as described in Fig. 7c. The last column gives the p-value of the correlation. These two measures of interaction lead to the same conclusions: the interaction is not significant for BA44 and TP (marginal in the latter case), and highly significant for all the other ROIs, namely aSTS, pSTS, AG_TPJ, BA45 and BA47.", "description": "This table presents statistical tests evaluating the interaction between hemisphere and model size in seven brain regions of interest (ROIs) known to be involved in language processing.  The first test is a two-sample t-test comparing the slopes of the linear regression lines (model size vs. brain correlation) for left and right hemispheres within each ROI. The second test calculates the correlation between the difference in brain correlation (left - right) and the logarithm of the model's number of parameters.  The results indicate whether the left-right asymmetry in brain correlation increases significantly with model size.", "section": "Supplementary Tables"}]
