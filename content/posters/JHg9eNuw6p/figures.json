It shows the process of generating a complex interactive 3D scene starting from an empty room. The process consists of four main modules: Initializing, Inpainting, Visual Perception, and Placing. The Initializing module sets up the initial scene by rendering an image of an empty room. The Inpainting module then takes the rendered image and inpaints the foreground objects according to a given text prompt. The Visual Perception module extracts semantic information and geometric cues from the inpainted image to understand object arrangement. Finally, the Placing module places the identified objects into the 3D environment according to their positions and other information.  This figure also shows that the pipeline is iterative and hierarchical, processing large furniture first before adding small objects for a more detailed and realistic scene.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "JHg9eNuw6p/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: We compare ARCHITECT with other methods in both household scenes(living room and dining room) and other non-household scenes.
