On the right: estimated value of c at the current step.", "description": "The figure shows the results of an experiment to estimate the constant input current c of a single stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model. Two levels of noise (\u03c3 = 0.25 and \u03c3 = 0.5) and four sample sizes (16, 32, 64, and 128) were tested. The left panel shows the mean absolute error (MAE) for the first three average spike times on a hold-out test set, while the right panel shows the estimated value of c at each step of the stochastic gradient descent optimization process. The results demonstrate that the model can accurately learn the input current even in the presence of noise and with relatively small sample sizes.", "section": "4.2 Input current estimation"}]
