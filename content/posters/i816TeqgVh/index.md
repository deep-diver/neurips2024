### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Unsupervised skill discovery aims to enable AI agents to learn reusable skills through autonomous interaction without explicit rewards.  Existing methods often struggle in complex environments with many state factors, resulting in simple skills not suitable for complex tasks.  These methods primarily focus on encouraging diverse state coverage, neglecting the potential value of skills that induce diverse interactions between state factors. 

SkiLD addresses this issue by leveraging state factorization as an inductive bias.  It introduces a novel skill learning objective that encourages diverse interactions between state factors, thereby facilitating the discovery of more valuable and reusable skills.  Evaluations across various challenging domains show that SkiLD outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning semantically meaningful skills with superior downstream task performance.

> This figure illustrates the core idea behind SkiLD.  It contrasts SkiLD with previous methods for unsupervised skill discovery.  Prior methods either focus on diverse, but non-interactive states (e.g., moving the robot to different locations without interacting with objects), or on manipulating individual objects in isolation (e.g., picking up a hammer or nail). SkiLD, on the other hand, explicitly learns skills that induce diverse interactions between state factors.  The example shown depicts a robot interacting with a hammer and nail‚Äînot only picking up each object independently, but also using the hammer to hit the nail.  This demonstrates how SkiLD learns more valuable and reusable skills for complex tasks.

It details settings for the skill policy, graph selection policy, learned dynamics model, and task skill selection policy.  Different algorithms (Rainbow, TD3, PPO, Adam) are used, with varying hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, network sizes, etc.) depending on the environment (Printer, Thawing, Cleaning Car, iGibson) and specific policy.





### In-depth insights


#### Factorial Skill
The concept of "Factorial Skills" in the context of reinforcement learning centers on the idea that an agent's abilities can be broken down into a set of independent, reusable skills.  These skills are not isolated actions but rather represent ways the agent interacts with and manipulates factors in the environment. **Unlike traditional approaches focusing on reaching diverse states, factorial skills explicitly consider the relationships between state factors.** This approach is particularly beneficial in complex settings with numerous interacting objects, where simply maximizing state coverage is inefficient and leads to the discovery of simple, less useful skills.  **A crucial advantage of this approach is the ability to reuse learned skills to solve downstream tasks**, requiring the agent to strategically chain together existing factorial skills.  This significantly improves sample efficiency compared to traditional methods. **By explicitly encouraging diverse interactions between factors through carefully designed reward functions and policy structures, the learning process becomes more directed and leads to the acquisition of semantically meaningful, composite skills.** This factorial skill approach represents a paradigm shift from simply emphasizing state diversity to promoting interactional diversity, leading to more robust and useful skills for complex tasks.

#### Local Dependency
The concept of "Local Dependency" in the context of unsupervised skill discovery within factored Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is a crucial innovation.  It addresses the limitations of prior methods which often focus solely on maximizing state diversity without considering the structured interactions within a state. **SkiLD leverages local dependencies to guide skill learning, providing a more effective inductive bias**.  Instead of simply encouraging diverse states, SkiLD explicitly encourages skills that induce diverse interactions between state factors. This is achieved by defining skills not just by the states they reach, but also by the changes in the relationships between state factors they cause.  **The identification of these local dependencies employs causality-inspired methods**, focusing on minimal subsets of state factors that are necessary and sufficient to explain changes in other factors. This approach efficiently addresses the challenge of high-dimensional state spaces often seen in complex environments with many factors, guiding the agent toward learning meaningful skills suitable for downstream tasks. **The method efficiently tackles the complexity of factored MDPs, leading to improved performance in downstream task learning compared to approaches relying solely on state coverage.**

#### Hierarchical RL
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) addresses the challenge of long-horizon tasks in RL by decomposing them into a hierarchy of subtasks.  **This decomposition simplifies learning**, as simpler subtasks are easier to solve individually than the complex original task.  HRL methods typically involve two or more levels of control: a high-level policy selecting and sequencing subtasks, and a low-level policy executing the selected subtasks.  **The choice of subtask decomposition strategy significantly impacts performance**, influencing both learning efficiency and the ultimate quality of the learned policy. Different approaches exist, including options frameworks, temporal abstraction, and various forms of hierarchical architectures, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.  **Key design considerations in HRL involve the balance between high-level planning and low-level execution, efficient credit assignment across levels, and effective exploration in the state space.**  Furthermore, the ability to reuse skills learned in one hierarchical task for new tasks (transfer learning) is a significant goal and a current research focus within the HRL domain.  **Combining HRL with other techniques, such as unsupervised skill discovery or causal inference, holds significant potential for improving AI's ability to learn complex behaviors.**

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of skill discovery, this would involve removing or disabling specific aspects of the proposed method (e.g., the local dependency graph, the diversity reward) to see how performance changes on downstream tasks.  **Positive results would demonstrate the importance of the removed component**, showing that it's crucial for achieving high performance. Conversely, **if performance doesn't change significantly after removing a component**, it might suggest that component is less crucial than originally thought or that other components compensate for its absence.  **Careful analysis of ablation study results can uncover unexpected interactions between model parts and refine design choices.** For example, a significant drop in performance after removing the dependency graph would highlight its vital role in guiding the agent towards more complex and useful skills, whereas a minor effect would suggest the system is robust and other mechanisms could be contributing substantially.  Such insights are invaluable for optimizing model architectures and understanding the underlying skill learning mechanisms.

#### Future Work
The paper's core contribution is a novel skill discovery method, SkiLD, that leverages state factorization and local dependencies to learn more complex and useful skills than existing methods.  **Future work should focus on expanding SkiLD's applicability to unfactored state spaces**, which is a significant limitation. This requires advancements in disentangled representation learning to extract meaningful factorized information from raw sensory data (images, videos).  **Another important area is improving the accuracy of local dependency detection**. The current reliance on approximate methods, such as pCMI, introduces noise and uncertainty. More robust causal inference techniques could enhance the precision and reliability of SkiLD. Finally, **extending SkiLD to handle continuous state and action spaces** would broaden its applicability to a wider range of robotic and AI problems. This will likely involve adapting the framework to handle continuous representations and learning effective interaction representations in continuous domains.  Further investigation into the scalability of the proposed method to high-dimensional state spaces and more complex environments, alongside rigorous empirical evaluation across various tasks and domains, is critical.  This would further validate SkiLD's generalizability and robustness.

> This figure illustrates the two-stage process of SkiLD: skill learning and task learning.  In the skill learning phase, a high-level graph selection policy chooses target local dependencies.  A low-level skill policy then learns to induce these dependencies using primitive actions. The induced dependency graph is identified by a dynamics model and used to update both policies. In the task learning phase, the skill policy is fixed, and a high-level task policy learns to select skills to maximize the task reward. This shows how SkiLD uses hierarchical reinforcement learning to efficiently discover interaction-rich skills that can be reused for downstream tasks.
