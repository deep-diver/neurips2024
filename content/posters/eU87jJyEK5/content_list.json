It endeavors to harness external categorical knowledge (e.g. semantic vectors) and comprehensive graph data (e.g. node attributes and structural information), to classify nodes belonging to unseen classes. In ZNC, prediction bias is a significant issue, where models incorrectly predict unseen class nodes as seen classes. Several studies concentrate on constructing optimized node representations and ensuring their alignment with semantic vectors in the latent space. This alignment is achieved by minimizing the distance between nodes and their corresponding class semantic vectors. DGPN [10] captures the local and global embedding of graph nodes, devising a distance loss function that bridges the gap between graph representations at varying scales and semantic vectors. MVE [11] underscores the insufficiency of modeling node features from a single view in describing the comprehensive essence of a node, thus advocating for a multi-view approach to augment node features. In addition, the utilization of inter-class relationships is also crucial in ZNC.

Zero-shot learning [14] has gained attention for its potential for a wide range of applications in fields such as image processing [15], speech recognition [16], and natural language processing [17]. In zero-shot learning models, commonly used external semantic knowledge includes attribute vectors and semantic vectors, among others. In particular, text vectors play an important role in representing textual content, and they translate words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs into vector representations through techniques such as Word2Vec [18], GloVe [19], and BERT [20]. Existing methods focus on establishing mapping relationships between samples and external knowledge for effective knowledge transfer to unseen classes. These include direct mapping methods [21, 22], which work by constructing a mapping function between samples and external knowledge and optimizing it; generation-based methods [15, 23], which train semantic-visual generators to generate samples for the unseen classes; and local embedding-based methods [24, 25], which use the attributes to guide the learning and migration of discriminative local embeddings.

Experimental results indicate that SpeAr achieves a significant enhancement in classification accuracy of unseen classes compared to DGPN and DBiGCN, and gained a better $H$ value.

Initially, we define recall as the proportion of samples correctly classified into a class relative to the total number of samples in that class.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
