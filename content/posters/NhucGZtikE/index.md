### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep learning often exhibits unpredictable behavior, hindering our understanding of its inner workings and optimal design choices.  Existing methods for analyzing neural networks, such as those based on tangent kernels, often fail to capture the dynamic complexities during training. This lack of understanding poses significant challenges for advancing deep learning research and engineering robust models. 

This paper introduces a new "telescoping model" to overcome these issues.  By incrementally approximating neural network training as a sequence of first-order updates, the model provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the entire learning process.  Using this model, the researchers gained new empirical insights into double descent, grokking, and gradient boosting, revealing unexpected connections between these phenomena and offering valuable insights for improved model design and optimization.

> üîº This figure illustrates the telescoping model of deep learning.  It shows how a neural network's prediction for a given input starts randomly and is iteratively refined through additive updates (Aft(x)). Each update is a linear approximation of the change in prediction based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.  The final prediction (f~Œ∏T(x)) is the sum of the initial prediction and all these incremental linear adjustments, offering a functional view of the training process, unlike traditional parameter-centric models. This process is visually represented by a sequence of cylinders, each representing a training step.

### In-depth insights


#### Telescoping Lens Model
The proposed "Telescoping Lens Model" offers a novel way to analyze neural network training.  Instead of focusing solely on the final network parameters, **it incrementally tracks the functional changes made at each training step**. This approach allows for a more granular understanding of the learning process, revealing insights into phenomena like double descent and grokking that are not readily apparent through traditional methods. By linearly approximating the functional updates, the model provides a simplified but informative lens to examine the behavior of complex networks.  **The use of this telescoping method makes it possible to isolate the effects of various design choices (architecture, optimization strategy)**, thereby facilitating better model understanding.  Crucially, it also allows for the creation of novel metrics to evaluate model complexity, furthering the understanding of generalization capabilities.  **The model's simplicity also makes it suitable for pedagogical applications**. Overall, the "Telescoping Lens Model" presents a powerful tool for both empirical and theoretical investigation of neural network training dynamics.

#### Empirical Analyses
An empirical analysis section in a research paper would ideally present a robust and detailed examination of experimental results.  It should go beyond simply stating findings and delve into a thorough interpretation of the data, addressing potential biases or limitations. **Statistical significance testing** would be crucial, employing appropriate metrics to determine the reliability of observations.  The analysis should demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationships between variables and provide visualizations that effectively communicate complex patterns.  **Comparison of various model architectures or hyperparameter settings** would show a comprehensive investigation. Importantly, the section should directly support the paper's main claims, providing strong evidence and linking observed phenomena to theoretical background. A thoughtful discussion of unexpected results or deviations from expectations also shows rigor and strengthens the overall contribution of the paper.

#### GBT vs Neural Nets
The comparison between Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) and neural networks reveals interesting strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  **GBTs often outperform neural networks on tabular data**, particularly when dealing with datasets containing irregularities or heterogeneous features, likely due to the different inductive biases and kernel functions employed by each.  Neural networks excel in domains with abundant, homogeneous data like images and text.  **GBTs' tree-based structure leads to more predictable generalization behavior**, especially in the presence of unusual test inputs, unlike the sometimes unpredictable nature of neural network tangent kernels which can change significantly during training. **The telescoping model provides a valuable lens for understanding these differences**, offering a clearer way to directly compare the incremental training processes and functional changes in both paradigms. By isolating components of each algorithm's learning trajectory, the analysis could unlock strategies to improve neural network performance on tabular datasets or to leverage the interpretability of GBTs for increased transparency in neural network training.

#### Weight Averaging
Weight averaging in deep learning is a surprising phenomenon where averaging the weights of two independently trained neural networks can yield a model that performs comparably to, or even better than, the individual networks. This contrasts with the typical intuition that averaging the highly nonlinear functions represented by the weights would likely degrade performance.  **The success of weight averaging is particularly noteworthy in scenarios where linear mode connectivity (LMC) exists,** meaning the solution space allows for simple linear interpolation between different solutions. The paper investigates how the model's gradient stabilization during training relates to the emergence of LMC and weight averaging success. **This is particularly important in complex optimization landscapes, where weight averaging can help overcome the challenges of reaching optimal solutions.**  While the paper suggests that consistent gradient behavior contributes to successful weight averaging, it also notes that additional factors like dataset properties and architectural design choices play a role, indicating that further research is needed for a complete understanding of this phenomenon.  **The paper uses a 'telescoping lens' approach to shed light on this behavior empirically, suggesting the framework as a promising avenue for further research into weight averaging in deep learning.**

#### Design Choice Effects
The section on 'Design Choice Effects' would explore how various design decisions made during the development of a deep learning model impact its performance and characteristics.  It would likely delve into the effects of different optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam, AdamW), analyzing how these choices influence the model's convergence speed, generalization ability, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. **Key findings might showcase how momentum or weight decay significantly alter the training dynamics**, affecting the model's generalization curve and resilience to overfitting.  Furthermore, the impact of different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) on the model's capacity to learn complex patterns and its behavior in various scenarios would be examined.   The analysis would also likely encompass the consequences of architectural choices, specifically the number of layers, the width of layers (number of neurons per layer), the choice of layers (e.g. convolutional vs. fully connected), and regularization techniques employed (e.g., dropout, batch normalization).  **The study would aim to provide a nuanced understanding of how these design parameters interact**, uncovering potential synergies or tradeoffs that can guide the design of efficient and effective deep learning models.  Crucially, the findings could offer valuable insights into overcoming common challenges like double descent or grokking, potentially proposing novel design strategies to improve model robustness and performance in such complex scenarios.

> üîº This figure compares the approximation errors of two models: the telescoping model (fo‚ÇÅ (x)) and a linear model (foin (x)). The telescoping model is an iterative approximation of a trained neural network, while the linear model is a first-order approximation around the initialization point. The plot shows that using smaller learning rates reduces the approximation errors for both models.  However, the telescoping model consistently yields a much better approximation than the linear model.  The optimizer used also affects approximation quality; AdamW (KB14, LH17), which naturally makes larger updates due to rescaling, necessitates smaller learning rates to obtain the same approximation quality as SGD.

The top panel displays the mean squared error (MSE) on the test set as a function of the number of hidden neurons in a single-hidden-layer ReLU network. The bottom panel shows the effective number of parameters (p) used by the model, calculated using a new metric introduced in the paper, as a function of the number of hidden neurons.  The plot demonstrates that test error initially decreases with increasing model size, then increases (overfitting), and finally decreases again as the model size significantly surpasses the amount of training data, exhibiting the double descent phenomenon. The effective parameters on the training set monotonically increase with model size, while test-time effective parameters show non-monotonic behavior, decreasing beyond the interpolation threshold. This divergence in effective parameters between training and test sets is linked to the non-monotonic generalization curve.
