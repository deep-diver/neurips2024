It compares their performance in terms of how many communication rounds (T) and local updates (H) are needed to achieve a mean squared error (MSE) below a certain threshold ( ). The table highlights that SCAFFLSA achieves a logarithmic communication complexity compared to the polynomial complexity of FedLSA, while maintaining linear speedup in terms of sample complexity.  The results for i.i.d.
