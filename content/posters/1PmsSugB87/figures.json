It shows two parallel NSDE (Neural Stochastic Differential Equation) modules, one for users and one for items. Each NSDE module processes the initial embedding of users/items to generate their final representations considering the drift and diffusion terms and stochastic process based on the time interval. The final user and item representations are then fed into an evidential module, which includes a rating network for generating predicted ratings and a monotonic network for quantifying the epistemic uncertainty associated with the prediction. The time interval (\u0394t) between interactions is a crucial input to the model, influencing the uncertainty estimation and providing a time-aware perspective.", "section": "4 Time-Aware Sequential Recommendations"}, {"figure_path": "1PmsSugB87/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of E-NSDE framework, which includes user and item NSDE modules to generate the final user and item representation and an EDL module to provide an uncertainty-aware prediction.", "description": "This figure shows a schematic of the proposed E-NSDE model.  The model consists of three main components: user NSDE module, item NSDE module, and evidential module. The user and item NSDE modules use Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDEs) to capture users' and items' evolving representations over time. The NSDEs incorporate both drift (continuous evolution) and diffusion (noise/uncertainty) terms. The output representations from the NSDE modules are then fed into the evidential module, which consists of a rating network and a monotonic network. The rating network predicts the rating for a user-item interaction, while the monotonic network models the relationship between the time interval between interactions and the uncertainty of the prediction. The evidential module integrates the outputs from the NSDEs and quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the rating predictions.  This comprehensive approach allows the model to effectively capture users' dynamic interests and provide uncertainty-aware recommendations.", "section": "4 Time-Aware Sequential Recommendations"}, {"figure_path": "1PmsSugB87/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: \u03b2 vs. \u0394t", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between total uncertainty (\u03b2) and the time interval (\u0394t) between user-item interactions.  The green line represents the average total uncertainty across multiple users, while the blue line shows the total uncertainty for a single, representative user.  Both lines demonstrate a clear, positive monotonic relationship.  As the time interval increases, the total uncertainty also increases. This supports the paper's argument that larger time gaps between interactions lead to greater uncertainty in user preferences, guiding the model to explore new items more extensively.", "section": "4 Time-Aware Sequential Recommendations"}, {"figure_path": "1PmsSugB87/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of E-NSDE framework, which includes user and item NSDE modules to generate the final user and item representation and an EDL module to provide an uncertainty-aware prediction.", "description": "This figure presents a schematic overview of the proposed E-NSDE (Evidential Neural Stochastic Differential Equation) framework for time-aware sequential recommendations. The framework consists of three main modules: User NSDE, Item NSDE, and Evidential. The User and Item NSDE modules utilize stochastic differential equations to capture the dynamic and stochastic nature of user and item representations over time.  These modules produce final user and item representations which are used by the Evidential module.  The Evidential module integrates evidential deep learning, using a rating network to predict user ratings and a monotonic network to estimate uncertainty based on the time interval between user interactions. The final output is a rating prediction along with the associated uncertainty.", "section": "4 Time-Aware Sequential Recommendations"}]
