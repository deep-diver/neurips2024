### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current selective classification methods suffer from an inherent limitation: they only allow a model to either predict a class or abstain completely, ignoring potentially valuable information when a sample is rejected. This can lead to suboptimal decision-making, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where partial information can still be highly useful.  For example, in medical image analysis, rejecting an image that is highly likely to be malignant might result in a delayed diagnosis with potentially dire consequences. 

This paper introduces Hierarchical Selective Classification (HSC) as a solution. HSC extends selective classification to handle hierarchical data, allowing models to provide less specific predictions when there's uncertainty. By using a hierarchical structure of classes, the model can still provide useful information even when it cannot confidently classify to the most specific level. The authors introduce new inference rules for HSC and show that this approach consistently improves both accuracy and confidence calibration.  They also demonstrate that specific training regimes significantly improve HSC's performance.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is crucial because **it addresses the limitations of existing selective classification methods by extending them to hierarchical settings.** This allows for more nuanced uncertainty handling and improved decision-making in risk-sensitive applications.  The proposed approach has significant implications for computer vision and other fields where hierarchical data structures exist, as demonstrated by extensive empirical studies on ImageNet. It also opens up new avenues for research in uncertainty quantification and improved training regimes for hierarchical classification.

> This figure illustrates how Hierarchical Selective Classification (HSC) works using the example of a Labrador Retriever image classified by a ViT-L/16-384 model.  The base classifier initially misclassifies the image as a 'Golden Retriever' with low confidence.  HSC, however, leverages a hierarchical class structure (shown as a tree) to provide a more accurate, higher-level classification ('Dog') when uncertainty exists at the leaf node level. The Climbing inference rule is used to ascend the hierarchy until a sufficient confidence threshold is reached, improving both accuracy and coverage.

> This table presents a comparison of the performance of three different hierarchical selective inference rules (Selective, Max-Coverage, and Climbing) on two image classification datasets: ImageNet-1k and iNat21.  The performance is measured using the hierarchical Area Under the Risk-Coverage curve (hAURC) and the hierarchical gain, representing the improvement in hAURC compared to the standard selective method. The results show that the Climbing inference rule significantly outperforms the other methods on both datasets.





### In-depth insights


#### Hierarchical Risk
Hierarchical risk, in the context of a hierarchical classification system, **moves beyond the simple binary right/wrong assessment of a single prediction**. It introduces a more nuanced evaluation by considering the hierarchical relationship between classes. A misclassification at a higher level of the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a Labrador for a dog, rather than a specific breed) is generally considered less severe than a misclassification at a lower level (e.g., mistaking a Labrador for a Golden Retriever).  This approach **acknowledges the inherent uncertainty** often present in real-world datasets, where perfect specificity is unlikely.  By quantifying the cost of different levels of error, hierarchical risk provides a more realistic evaluation metric for risk-sensitive applications such as medical diagnosis, where some level of uncertainty is acceptable if it leads to the correct higher-level classification. This methodology allows for more **fine-grained control and a better understanding of model performance** in hierarchical structures. Furthermore, it offers the potential to optimize models for the desired level of specificity versus the tolerance for uncertainty in higher-level classifications.

#### Inference Rules
The section on 'Inference Rules' is crucial for understanding how the hierarchical selective classification (HSC) model makes predictions.  It introduces different algorithms, or rules, governing how the model navigates the class hierarchy when uncertainty is high.  **The Climbing rule**, for instance, starts at the most likely leaf node and ascends the hierarchy until sufficient confidence is reached, offering a balance between accuracy and specificity.  **Contrastingly, the Max-Coverage rule** prioritizes maximizing the coverage of the prediction, potentially sacrificing precision.  The choice of inference rule significantly impacts the model's performance, as demonstrated by the empirical results comparing their respective hierarchical risk-coverage curves (hAURC). The authors also discuss the desirable properties of inference rules, such as **monotonicity in correctness and coverage**. These properties ensure that increasing the confidence threshold doesn't transform correct predictions into incorrect ones and never increases coverage.  The introduction of these various inference rules is a key contribution, highlighting the flexibility of HSC and its ability to adapt to different task requirements.  The optimal rule selection would depend on the trade-off between the risk and coverage desired for a particular task.

#### Optimal Threshold
The optimal threshold selection is a crucial aspect of selective classification, aiming to balance model accuracy and coverage.  **Finding this threshold is computationally challenging**, often involving iterative algorithms or complex optimization procedures. The paper explores an algorithm that, given a target accuracy and confidence level, efficiently finds an optimal threshold.  **This method leverages a calibration set** to estimate the threshold's performance and provides strong theoretical guarantees on achieving the target accuracy with high probability.  The algorithm is notable for its efficiency, as it avoids retraining and can adapt to different user-defined parameters. The **use of a calibration set separates the training and deployment phases**, ensuring that the threshold selection is not overly sensitive to the training data itself. By combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency, this optimal threshold algorithm makes selective classification more robust and user-friendly.

#### Training Regimes
The study's exploration of training regimes reveals **CLIP's exceptional performance** in improving hierarchical selective classification, significantly outperforming other methods like knowledge distillation and pretraining on larger datasets.  This suggests that CLIP's image-text alignment facilitates a deeper semantic understanding, leading to more robust and informative hierarchical predictions.  The results also highlight the **benefits of pretraining** on larger datasets like ImageNet-21k, although the improvement varies across models.  **Knowledge distillation** also shows positive impact, aligning with prior research. Interestingly, using linear probes with CLIP models offers even greater advantages than zero-shot CLIP, emphasizing the importance of careful model fine-tuning for optimal performance in hierarchical selective classification.  These findings offer valuable insights for practitioners, guiding choices in training regimes to maximize performance and potentially uncover new training approaches for future research.

#### Calibration Curve
Calibration curves are a crucial tool for evaluating the reliability of a classifier's predicted probabilities.  A well-calibrated classifier should produce probabilities that accurately reflect the true frequency of positive outcomes.  **Deviations from a perfect diagonal line (representing ideal calibration) reveal miscalibration**.  For instance, an overconfident classifier might yield high probabilities for many negative instances, resulting in a curve above the diagonal.  Conversely, an underconfident model might exhibit a curve below the diagonal.  **Analyzing calibration curves helps identify regions where the model's probability estimations are particularly unreliable**, allowing for targeted improvements through techniques such as temperature scaling or other recalibration methods.  Furthermore, **the area under the calibration curve (AUC) can be used as a quantitative metric** to compare the calibration performance of different models or calibration methods.  **Different applications may have different tolerance for miscalibration**, making this type of analysis vital for risk-sensitive applications like medical diagnosis where confidence estimations are paramount.  The shape of the curve provides insights into the nature of miscalibration, which is essential for selecting the appropriate recalibration technique.  Ultimately, calibration curves are indispensable for ensuring trustworthy and reliable predictions.
