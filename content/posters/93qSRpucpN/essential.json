Current methods, either forward or inverse mappings, struggle with generating high-performance samples beyond the dataset or suffer from robustness issues.  Existing inverse mapping methods such as GANs and proxy-free diffusion have shown promise but lack explicit guidance or robustness.\nThis paper proposes Robust Guided Diffusion (RGD) to overcome these issues. RGD integrates explicit proxy guidance into proxy-free diffusion using a novel proxy-enhanced sampling module. To enhance robustness, RGD also uses a diffusion-based proxy refinement that seamlessly integrates proxy-free diffusion into the proxy for refinement.  This novel combination allows RGD to reach state-of-the-art results on various BBO benchmark tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining explicit guidance with the robustness of proxy-free diffusion.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "93qSRpucpN/podcast.wav"}
