This creates a need for more efficient and effective fine-tuning approaches that balance performance, training speed, and deployment practicality.\n\nThis paper presents S2FT, a novel fine-tuning method that addresses these challenges. **S2FT achieves state-of-the-art results by strategically selecting and updating a small subset of parameters within LLMs' coupled structures**. This approach enables dense computation on only the selected parameters, leading to substantial improvements in training efficiency and inference speed compared to existing methods.  The theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate S2FT's strong generalization capabilities and its effectiveness in reducing memory and latency during training.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "lEUle8S4xQ/podcast.wav"}
