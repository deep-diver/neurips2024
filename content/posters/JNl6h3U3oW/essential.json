Existing optimization techniques like pruning and quantization often involve retraining or fine-tuning, which is resource-intensive.  The high cost of multiplication operations in LLMs is a major bottleneck. \nThis paper introduces ShiftAddLLM, a novel method to accelerate pretrained LLMs using post-training shift-and-add reparameterization.  This approach replaces computationally expensive multiplications with hardware-friendly shifts and additions, improving efficiency.  **A multi-objective optimization method** minimizes reparameterization errors and an automated bit allocation strategy further optimizes memory and latency.  **Experiments demonstrate significantly reduced perplexity and latency** across various LLMs and tasks, along with substantial memory and energy savings, exceeding the performance of other state-of-the-art quantized LLMs.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "JNl6h3U3oW/podcast.wav"}
