FlowDCN is a purely convolutional generative model consisting of stacked MultiScale DCN blocks and SwiGLU blocks, using RMSNorm for training stability. The MultiScale DCN block uses dynamic weights and scale/direction deformable fields predicted from input features, combined with priors to create deformable kernels.  The block shows how the deformable kernels are used to extract features, highlighting the multiscale approach of the model.  The diagram illustrates the flow of data through the model, from the input features (including noisy latent, time step t, and label y) to the final predicted flow.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "e57B7BfA2B/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Visualization Comparison with SiT. Best viewed zoomed-in. We sample both our FlowDCN-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 with Euler ODE solver under 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 steps using the same latent noise. At the fewer steps sampling scenery, our FlowDCN generates slightly clearer and higher-quality images.", "description": "This figure compares the image generation results of FlowDCN-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 models at different sampling steps (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10) using the Euler ODE solver.
