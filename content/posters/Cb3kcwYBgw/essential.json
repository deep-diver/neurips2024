MPGNNs struggle with long-range dependencies in graphs, as information propagation is limited by the number of message-passing steps and the phenomenon of over-squashing, where information is lost during propagation.  This restricts their ability to effectively model relationships between distant nodes. \nThis paper introduces Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S2GNNs) to overcome these limitations. S2GNNs cleverly combine spatial and spectral graph filters. This dual approach allows for both local and global information propagation, resolving the long-range dependency issue.  The frequency-domain representation of the spectral filter helps avoid over-squashing and enables more efficient information flow.  Experiments show that S2GNNs outperform state-of-the-art GNNs on tasks involving long-range interactions.", "affiliation": "Technical University of Munich", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Cb3kcwYBgw/podcast.wav"}
