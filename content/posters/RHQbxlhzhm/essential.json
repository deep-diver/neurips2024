However, current training algorithms based on the Newton method often struggle with convergence issues, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or highly correlated features. This limitation arises from vanishing second-order derivatives outside the local region of the minimizer.  The paper highlights the problem with existing approaches, including exact, quasi, and proximal Newton methods, that struggle with convergence and precision.\nTo address these shortcomings, FastSurvival introduces new optimization methods that leverage hidden mathematical structures of the CPH model.  By constructing and minimizing surrogate functions, these new methods guarantee monotonic loss decrease and global convergence. Importantly, they achieve linear-time complexity (O(n)) for computing first and second-order derivatives. Empirical results demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency compared to existing methods, enabling the construction of sparse, high-quality models for cardinality-constrained CPH problems.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Manufacturing"}, "podcast_path": "RHQbxlhzhm/podcast.wav"}
