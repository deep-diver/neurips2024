[{"heading_title": "CPH Optimization", "details": {"summary": "This research paper focuses on improving the training process of Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) models, a crucial tool in survival analysis.  The core issue addressed is the **inefficiency and convergence problems** associated with current optimization algorithms for CPH models, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets and correlated features.
