Existing methods often lack theoretical guarantees or suffer from limitations in scalability.  This is a significant hurdle for researchers needing to work with large-scale count data. \nThis research introduces novel data subsampling techniques for Poisson regression using the pth-root link function.  The key is a novel complexity parameter and a domain-shifting approach.  The authors prove the existence of sublinear coresets with strong approximation guarantees when the complexity parameter is small, significantly improving data reduction for Poisson regression.  Tight bounds on the size of the required coreset are established, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method.", "affiliation": "University Potsdam", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ES0Gj1KVUk/podcast.wav"}
