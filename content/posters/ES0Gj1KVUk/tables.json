[{"figure_path": "ES0Gj1KVUk/tables/tables_30_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experimental results for two synthetic data sets with p = 1 (left), respectively p = 2 (right). Our method is presented in red and compared against uniform sampling, which is presented in blue. Solid lines indicate the median and shaded areas indicate \u00b12 standard errors around the median taken across 201 independent repetitions for each reduced size between 50 and 600 in equal increment steps of 50. For the blue shaded area below the blue solid line, only feasible repetitions were counted, while the blue shaded area above represents the unbounded standard error without this restriction. For some lower reduced sizes, even the median was infinite, which results in an interrupted blue solid line. This indicates that more than half of the repetitions gave infeasible results when using uniform sampling with low sample sizes, while our method never produced infeasible results.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed Poisson subsampling method against uniform sampling for two synthetic datasets, one with p=1 and the other with p=2.  The median approximation ratio is plotted against the reduced dataset size, with error bars representing 2 times the standard error.  The results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms uniform sampling, particularly for smaller reduced dataset sizes where uniform sampling produces many infeasible results.", "section": "G.3 Experimental illustration"}]
