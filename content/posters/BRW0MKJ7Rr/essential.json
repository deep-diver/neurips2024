Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL), while offering a more nuanced approach to value estimation, also suffers from similar issues at high frequencies.  The challenge lies in the collapse of action-conditioned return distributions as decision frequency increases, impacting value estimation and policy optimization.\n\nThis research introduces the concept of 'superiority', a probabilistic generalization of the advantage function, to address these high-frequency challenges in DRL.  It presents theoretical analysis showcasing how superiority distributions better preserve essential information at high frequencies.  Furthermore, the paper proposes a novel superiority-based DRL algorithm, validated through simulations, that shows significant performance improvements over conventional methods. This significantly advances the field of high-frequency RL applications.", "affiliation": "McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "BRW0MKJ7Rr/podcast.wav"}
