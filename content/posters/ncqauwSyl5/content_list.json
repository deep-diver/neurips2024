One such strategy is the spatial-based method, exemplified by LSRM [13]. It utilizes specific fragmentation algorithms like BRICS [5] to fragment molecules into discrete groups in real space. The long-range interactions are thereby captured in a hierarchical manner by facilitating message passing between the fragments and atoms. Another strategy is the spectral-based method [12, 24], which treats the long-range parts in the reciprocal space following the concepts of Ewald summation [4].
