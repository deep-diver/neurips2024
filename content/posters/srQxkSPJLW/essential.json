This imbalance, observed in the early transformer decoder layers, limits overall performance.  This paper investigates this issue, revealing how initial feature tokens are crucial for both tasks. \nThe proposed solution, DI-MaskDINO, alleviates this imbalance by introducing two key modules: a De-Imbalance (DI) module to generate balance-aware queries, and a Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization (BATO) module to refine initial feature tokens.  Experimental results on COCO and BDD100K benchmarks demonstrate that DI-MaskDINO significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial improvements in both detection and segmentation accuracy. **This work offers valuable insights into handling task imbalances in multi-task learning and provides a highly effective model for joint object detection and instance segmentation.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "srQxkSPJLW/podcast.wav"}
