The test was conducted to assess how well each model handles scenarios with a significant imbalance between object detection and instance segmentation.  The \"standard\" row represents the performance under normal conditions. The \"loss weight constraint\" and \"position token constraint\" rows simulate conditions where the balance is significantly worsened by adjusting the loss weights and manipulating position tokens respectively.
