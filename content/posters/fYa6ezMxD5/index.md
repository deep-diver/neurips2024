### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large foundation models are expensive to train and deploy in various settings with different resource constraints.  Existing methods like training multiple models or post-hoc compression techniques are not ideal, as they either increase training costs or compromise accuracy.  This necessitates selecting a model that may not be perfectly suited to the deployment scenario. 



MatFormer proposes a novel nested Transformer architecture to address these challenges. By optimizing multiple nested FFN blocks during training, MatFormer allows for the extraction of numerous submodels.  A simple heuristic, Mix'n'Match, is used to efficiently select the best submodel for a given compute budget. The effectiveness of MatFormer is demonstrated across several language and vision tasks. **It offers significant improvements in inference latency and accuracy while avoiding the additional costs associated with traditional model training and optimization methods.**

> MatFormer modifies the standard Transformer architecture by incorporating a nested Feed Forward Network (FFN) block structure.  During training, it optimizes the parameters of multiple nested FFN blocks with varying sizes. This allows for the extraction of many accurate smaller models without incurring additional computational costs.  The figure illustrates this nested structure, showing how submodels of different sizes can be extracted from a single, larger model, enabling elastic inference across various deployment environments.





![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/fYa6ezMxD5/tables_2_1.jpg)

> This table compares MatFormer with other methods for obtaining multiple submodels from a single model.  It highlights MatFormer's advantages: requiring optimization of fewer models, producing an exponential number of models at inference time without post-training or Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and its nested subnetwork structure enabling adaptive retrieval and colocation. It also lists the number of models optimized and obtained, whether the subnetworks are nested, the model selection method, if post-training is needed, the architecture type (CNN or Transformer), and if the model is a decoder-only model.





### In-depth insights


#### Elastic Inference
Elastic inference, a crucial aspect of deploying large-scale models, addresses the challenge of adapting model resource usage to diverse deployment environments.  **MatFormer's approach centers on training a single, universal model** which allows extracting multiple smaller submodels, each optimized for different latency and computational constraints.  This contrasts with traditional methods which involve training separate models for varying sizes.  **The key advantage lies in eliminating the substantial cost and time associated with training multiple models**, achieving 'elasticity' at almost no additional cost. This is accomplished through a novel nested FFN block structure and a Mix'n'Match strategy for efficient submodel selection. **MatFormer's elasticity is not just about size; it ensures consistent and accurate submodels**, a critical feature for effective speculative decoding and adaptive retrieval tasks.  The effectiveness of MatFormer's approach is validated across language and vision models, demonstrating its broader applicability and potential for significant impact on large-scale model deployment.

#### Nested Transformer
The concept of a 'Nested Transformer' presents an intriguing approach to enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of Transformer models.  By embedding smaller Transformer blocks within larger ones, a **hierarchical structure** is created. This allows for the extraction of multiple sub-models of varying sizes and capabilities without the need for retraining. The resulting elasticity in model size offers several advantages. First, it enables **adaptive inference**, enabling deployment across resource-constrained environments (mobile devices) to powerful clusters.  Second, it provides **cost optimization**, as a single large model effectively replaces the need for multiple independently trained models of different sizes. Finally, this nested architecture potentially facilitates **improved consistency across submodels**, which would be beneficial for techniques that rely on multiple model sizes such as speculative decoding, as seen in the mentioned research.

#### Mix'n'Match
The proposed Mix'n'Match strategy represents a significant contribution to the MatFormer architecture, **offering a computationally inexpensive method for generating a diverse range of submodels**.  Instead of computationally expensive neural architecture search (NAS), Mix'n'Match leverages a simple heuristic that selects sub-blocks from the nested structure. By carefully choosing the granularities of the sub-blocks across different layers, Mix'n'Match efficiently creates models optimized for various compute constraints without requiring additional training. The heuristic prioritizes balanced configurations that minimize layer granularity changes, demonstrating superior performance compared to NAS, as shown in the experimental results.  This approach greatly enhances MatFormer's elasticity, providing an effective trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. **Its simplicity and effectiveness make Mix'n'Match a practical and valuable addition to the elastic inference capabilities of MatFormer**, facilitating practical deployments across a wide spectrum of hardware and latency requirements.

#### MatLM & MatViT
The research paper explores MatLM and MatViT, demonstrating **elastic inference capabilities** in both language and vision domains.  MatLM, a decoder-only language model, leverages a nested FFN structure to extract multiple submodels of varying sizes without additional training. This elasticity is particularly valuable for deploying models across diverse computational constraints.  **MatViT extends this architecture to vision transformers**, showing that smaller encoders extracted from a universal model retain metric space structure, enabling efficient adaptive large-scale retrieval.  **The key innovation lies in the nested sub-structure**, allowing for a combinatorial explosion of submodels during inference, exceeding the capabilities of comparable methods while maintaining accuracy.

#### Scaling & Consistency
The scaling and consistency analysis of the MatFormer architecture reveals crucial insights into its effectiveness.  **MatFormer demonstrates reliable scaling**, achieving comparable performance to traditional Transformer models across different sizes, which is verified through validation loss and downstream evaluation.  The consistent behavior of submodels extracted from MatFormer is a **key advantage for elastic inference**, enabling significant reductions in inference latency and facilitating adaptable deployments. This consistency is not just about accuracy, but also about preserving the underlying metric space, crucial for applications like large-scale retrieval.  The **Mix'n'Match approach further enhances the model's elasticity**, allowing extraction of numerous accurate submodels beyond explicitly trained ones, providing a cost-effective alternative to computationally expensive methods.  **These findings underscore MatFormer's potential for broader adoption in resource-constrained settings and large-scale deployments.**
