Each plot shows a probability simplex (a triangle in 3 dimensions) where the colored area represents the uncertainty set Q. The black dots are optimal dual variables q* which maximize the objective for a given primal variable w. As the penalty parameter v decreases, the optimal dual variable q* can move closer to the boundary of the uncertainty set.
