Existing methods like flooding try to improve test performance by strategically switching between gradient ascent and descent, but they have limitations in terms of tuning and other metrics like model complexity. \n\nThis paper proposes **SoftAD (Soft Ascent-Descent)**, a refined approach.  Instead of a hard switch, SoftAD smoothly transitions between ascent and descent using a pointwise mechanism.  This method demonstrably reduces the generalization gap, outperforming previous techniques, while maintaining competitive test accuracy and minimizing model complexity. SoftAD offers a smoother training process and better generalization properties without computational overhead.", "affiliation": "Osaka University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Y1ZsLONDI2/podcast.wav"}
