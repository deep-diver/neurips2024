For various robust models (WRN-28-10, WRN-70-16), the table shows the robust accuracy (lower is better), the MALT attack's robust accuracy, the AutoAttack's robust accuracy (SOTA), the difference between MALT and AutoAttack, and the speed-up achieved by MALT compared to AutoAttack.  A lower robust accuracy indicates better performance of the attack. The speed-up factor shows how much faster MALT is than AutoAttack.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "bCqIx5Q8qX/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: ImageNet - L\u221e robust accuracy (lower is better), comparing MALT and AutoAttack, which is the current state of the art.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the MALT attack against the state-of-the-art AutoAttack on the ImageNet dataset.  It shows the robust accuracy (a lower percentage is better) for several robust models. The difference column highlights the improvement achieved by MALT over AutoAttack, and the speed-up column shows how much faster MALT is than AutoAttack.  The results demonstrate that MALT achieves comparable or better robust accuracy while being significantly faster.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
