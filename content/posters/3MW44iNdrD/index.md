### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for fair text-to-image generation utilize prompt learning with reference images, but this approach suffers from suboptimal sample quality.  The paper's analysis reveals that the training objective of aligning embedding differences between learned prompts and reference images is inadequate, leading to distorted prompts and lower-quality outputs.  This issue is further analyzed using cross-attention map analysis, revealing abnormalities in early denoising steps that perpetuate improper global structure.

To address these issues, the authors propose FairQueue, a novel method incorporating prompt queuing and attention amplification.  Prompt queuing addresses early-stage denoising problems by prioritizing base prompts, ensuring proper global structure before introducing more specific prompts. Attention amplification enhances target sensitive attributes expression. Extensive experiments show that FairQueue significantly outperforms the SOTA method in terms of image generation quality while maintaining competitive fairness across multiple sensitive attributes.

> This figure shows the main idea of the paper. It starts with the observation that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) fair text-to-image (T2I) generation method, ITI-GEN, suffers from degraded image quality.  The authors analyze the cross-attention maps of the ITI-GEN model to identify the root cause, which is the sub-optimal learning objective leading to distorted prompts. Based on this analysis, the authors propose a novel solution, called FairQueue, which addresses the quality issue while achieving competitive fairness.





![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/3MW44iNdrD/tables_8_1.jpg)

> This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed FairQueue method against the state-of-the-art ITI-GEN method for fair text-to-image generation.  It evaluates performance across various sensitive attributes (tSAs), using metrics for fairness (Fairness Discrepancy - FD), quality (Text-Alignment - TA and Fr√©chet Inception Distance - FID), and semantic preservation (DreamSim - DS).  The results show FairQueue achieves a better balance of fairness and quality compared to ITI-GEN.





### In-depth insights


#### Prompt Learning Issues
Prompt learning, while effective for fair text-to-image generation, presents significant challenges.  A core issue is the **sub-optimality of training objectives** that aim to align prompt and reference image embeddings. This often leads to distorted prompts incorporating unrelated visual elements beyond the target sensitive attribute.  This distortion manifests in degraded image quality, evidenced by artifacts and a lack of proper global structure in generated images. Analysis of cross-attention maps reveals that these learned prompts introduce abnormalities, particularly in early denoising steps, hindering proper global structure formation and perpetuating these issues into the final output.  Addressing these issues requires careful consideration of **prompt engineering**, potential reliance on **alternative training objectives** that better capture semantic relationships, and exploration of techniques to **mitigate the effects of noisy reference images** that confound the learning process.  **Careful evaluation metrics** are crucial to fully capture these multifaceted problems and the effectiveness of proposed solutions.

#### ITI-GEN Analysis
The ITI-GEN analysis section likely delves into a critical evaluation of the Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation (ITI-GEN) model, a state-of-the-art approach for fair image generation. The analysis likely begins by observing the quality of images produced by ITI-GEN and notes a degradation in sample quality, despite achieving fairness. **The core issue seems to stem from the sub-optimal prompt learning approach**, which leverages reference images to learn inclusive prompts for each target sensitive attribute.  The analysis likely explores this discrepancy, perhaps through detailed examination of the ITI-GEN's training objective and its impact on prompt embeddings, revealing potential issues such as distortions in the prompts due to the inclusion of unrelated concepts from the reference images.  To pinpoint the cause of quality degradation, the authors likely investigate the image generation process itself, focusing on cross-attention maps to determine the effects of distorted prompts.  This likely involves visualizing and quantifying abnormalities in the attention mechanisms, particularly in the early stages of image generation.  **This deep dive into the denoising network provides evidence to support the claim that distorted prompts lead to degraded global structure, directly affecting the final image output.**  The section concludes by potentially highlighting the need for improved prompt learning strategies, suggesting modifications to overcome the quality issues without compromising fairness.

#### FairQueue Approach
The FairQueue approach tackles the limitations of existing prompt learning methods for fair text-to-image generation.  It addresses the problem of **degraded image quality** observed in previous approaches like ITI-GEN, which primarily focuses on aligning the embeddings of reference images and learned prompts, potentially incorporating unrelated concepts into the learned prompts. FairQueue cleverly introduces **prompt queuing**, prioritizing base prompts in early denoising stages to ensure proper global structure, then introducing ITI-GEN prompts for fine-grained details. This strategy, combined with **attention amplification**, which enhances the influence of the tSA tokens in the generation process, leads to improved image quality while maintaining competitive fairness.  The method's success is demonstrated through extensive experimental results, showcasing its superiority in balancing fairness and generation quality over existing SOTA models.  The underlying analysis, focusing on cross-attention maps, provides valuable insights into the root causes of quality degradation in existing methods, making FairQueue a significant step towards robust and fair text-to-image generation.

#### Ablation Experiments
Ablation experiments systematically remove components of a model to understand their individual contributions.  In a text-to-image generation model, this could involve removing modules responsible for handling specific aspects of the process such as prompt encoding, cross-attention mechanisms, or different stages of the diffusion process. By observing how performance metrics (like FID, precision, recall) change after removing each part, researchers gain **crucial insights into each component's impact**.  **Well-designed ablation studies are essential for isolating the sources of both success and failure**, allowing for more targeted improvements in future iterations.  The results could highlight, for example, the relative importance of prompt encoding techniques versus the denoising process and **inform the design of more efficient and robust models**.  A weakness in this methodology is that removing components might lead to unexpected interactions between remaining parts, potentially underestimating a component's actual contribution, or causing a misleading conclusion.

#### Future Directions
Future directions in this research could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending FairQueue to handle more complex scenarios**, such as those involving multiple interacting sensitive attributes or those with higher degrees of linguistic ambiguity, would significantly enhance its practical applicability.  **Investigating the generalizability of FairQueue across diverse T2I models** is also crucial to establish its robustness and widespread utility.  Furthermore, **a deeper dive into the underlying mechanisms by which prompt queuing and attention amplification improve both fairness and image quality** is needed to provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the approach.  Finally, **developing new quantitative metrics** to more comprehensively evaluate the performance of fair text-to-image models beyond fairness, quality and semantic preservation alone would improve the evaluation framework and accelerate further research in the domain.  **Incorporating user feedback** into the generation pipeline is also important to ensure the approach aligns with user expectations and real-world demands for fairness and high quality image generation.

> This table presents the Fairness Discrepancy (FD) values, a measure of fairness in image generation, for both the ITI-GEN and FairQueue methods.  The results are shown for four different sensitive attributes: Smiling, High Cheekbones, Gender, and Young. Lower FD values indicate better fairness. The table summarizes the human evaluation results from the user study comparing the fairness of images generated using both methods for each tSA.

> This table presents a comparison of the proposed FairQueue method against the state-of-the-art ITI-GEN method for fair text-to-image generation.  It evaluates performance across multiple sensitive attributes (tSAs) using four metrics: Fairness Discrepancy (FD) to measure fairness, Text-Alignment (TA) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) to assess quality, and DreamSim (DS) to evaluate semantic preservation.  The results show that FairQueue achieves a better balance between quality and fairness compared to ITI-GEN, while maintaining the semantic content of the base prompt.

> This table presents a comparison of the proposed FairQueue method against the state-of-the-art ITI-GEN method for fair text-to-image generation.  Multiple metrics are used to evaluate both the fairness and quality of the generated images, considering various sensitive attributes (tSAs). The metrics include Fairness Discrepancy (FD), measuring equal representation across tSA categories; Text-Alignment (TA), assessing semantic preservation; Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), evaluating image quality; and DreamSim (DS), measuring semantic preservation.  The results show that FairQueue achieves a better balance between fairness and image quality compared to ITI-GEN.

It uses four metrics to evaluate performance: Fairness Discrepancy (FD), Text Alignment (TA), Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), and DreamSim (DS).  Lower FD indicates better fairness, higher TA and lower FID indicate better quality, and lower DS indicates better semantic preservation. The results show that FairQueue achieves a better balance of fairness and quality than ITI-GEN, while maintaining good semantic preservation.
