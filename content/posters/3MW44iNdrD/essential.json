The paper's analysis reveals that the training objective of aligning embedding differences between learned prompts and reference images is inadequate, leading to distorted prompts and lower-quality outputs.  This issue is further analyzed using cross-attention map analysis, revealing abnormalities in early denoising steps that perpetuate improper global structure.\nTo address these issues, the authors propose FairQueue, a novel method incorporating prompt queuing and attention amplification.  Prompt queuing addresses early-stage denoising problems by prioritizing base prompts, ensuring proper global structure before introducing more specific prompts. Attention amplification enhances target sensitive attributes expression. Extensive experiments show that FairQueue significantly outperforms the SOTA method in terms of image generation quality while maintaining competitive fairness across multiple sensitive attributes.", "affiliation": "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "3MW44iNdrD/podcast.wav"}
