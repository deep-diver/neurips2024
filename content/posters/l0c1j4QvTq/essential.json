This paper addresses this issue by proposing Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER), a novel algorithm that leverages the power of diffusion models to enhance the representational capacity of the policy.  Existing methods using simple Gaussian distributions fail to capture the multimodality of optimal policies, leading to suboptimal performance.\nDACER addresses this by conceptualizing the reverse process of a diffusion model as a novel policy function. This allows the algorithm to effectively model multimodal action distributions.  Since the diffusion policy's entropy lacks an analytical expression, the paper proposes a method to estimate it using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).  This estimated entropy is then used to adaptively regulate the exploration and exploitation balance, thereby improving performance.  The algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated through experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks, showing state-of-the-art performance and superior representational capacity.
