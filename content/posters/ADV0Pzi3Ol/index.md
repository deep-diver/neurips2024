### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current AI models are primarily evaluated on prediction accuracy, overlooking the validity of their reasoning. This can lead to unsafe predictions, especially in high-stakes scenarios, where understanding the model's rationale is crucial.  This paper highlights the importance of achieving "double-correct" predictions‚Äîcorrect predictions with correct rationales.  The current lack of datasets with structured rationales and suitable optimization methods makes this a major challenge.

To address this, the researchers propose a two-phase approach. First, they create a new dataset with structured rationales for visual recognition. Second, they introduce a novel rationale-informed optimization method that guides the model to generate correct rationales and localizes relevant visual evidence. Extensive experiments show that this method significantly improves both prediction accuracy and rationale correctness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin.  This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI, offering a significant step towards developing trustworthy AI models for real-world applications.

> üîº This figure showcases two examples where large language models (LLMs) produce predictions that are either factually incorrect or based on flawed reasoning. In the first example, CLIP correctly identifies a red traffic light in an image but incorrectly attributes this identification to a cluster of red balloons in the background. The second example shows GPT-4V making an incorrect prediction (that a truck's door is closed) based on a seemingly plausible rationale derived from visual details such as the door's alignment with the truck's body and the visibility of the side mirror. These examples highlight the importance of evaluating not only the accuracy of model predictions but also the validity of their underlying rationales.

### In-depth insights


#### Rationale-Informed Optimization
The proposed rationale-informed optimization method is a **novel approach** to enhance the prediction accuracy and correctness of large foundation models. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on prediction accuracy, this approach addresses the critical aspect of rationale validity. The core idea is to guide the model's learning process by incorporating structured rationales, thereby encouraging the model to **disentangle and localize visual evidence** relevant to each rationale. This is achieved without manual annotations, making it scalable and practical for large-scale datasets. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments and ablation studies, showcasing significant improvements in both prediction accuracy and rationale correctness across various tasks.  This two-pronged approach‚Äîcurated datasets and an optimization method‚Äîpresents a **significant advancement** in building trustworthy and reliable large language models, particularly for high-stakes applications where the validity of the reasoning is crucial.

#### Double-Correct Predictions
The concept of "Double-Correct Predictions" introduces a crucial shift in evaluating AI models, moving beyond mere accuracy to encompass the **validity of the reasoning** behind predictions.  It argues that a truly reliable system must not only produce the correct output but also arrive at it through a sound and justifiable process. This necessitates the development of methods to assess and **improve the correctness of rationales**, requiring datasets with structured rationales and novel optimization techniques that encourage models to ground their decision-making in verifiable evidence. The approach's significance lies in building **trustworthy AI systems** suitable for high-stakes applications, where confidence in the "how" is as important as the "what."  Achieving this requires addressing challenges like the acquisition of reliable rationales and the development of methods to gauge their correctness effectively, which is a complex undertaking with significant implications for AI safety and reliability.

#### Structured Rationale Dataset
The creation of a **structured rationale dataset** is a crucial contribution.  It addresses the limitations of existing datasets which lack the detailed reasoning behind predictions. The **tree-structured format** of the rationales allows for a more nuanced representation of the knowledge, capturing the complex relationships between attributes, rather than just providing simple labels.  This structured approach is **tailored for visual recognition tasks**, making it highly relevant for the research on double-correct predictions. The use of **LLMs (Large Language Models)** for generating the dataset demonstrates an innovative and scalable method. However, careful **quality control measures**, including human and machine evaluations, are essential to ensure the reliability and accuracy of these automatically generated rationales and mitigate potential biases or hallucinations inherent in LLMs. The dataset's **size and coverage** of ImageNet categories make it a valuable resource for the broader research community.

#### Faithful Explanation
The concept of "Faithful Explanations" in the context of visual recognition models is crucial for building trust and ensuring safe deployment.  **Faithfulness** implies that the explanation accurately reflects the model's reasoning process, aligning with human understanding of visual evidence. The paper critiques existing methods, highlighting how they fail to fully capture the model's internal workings, sometimes relying solely on attention maps which are insufficient.  Instead, the proposed approach uses a novel methodology that decomposes the model's outputs, considering contributions from all layers and attention heads to weight the importance of visual tokens. This **weighted mean-ablation** strategy is a key innovation for building more faithful explanations and demonstrates improvements in both accuracy and faithfulness of explanations, as evidenced by weakly-supervised segmentation experiments. By incorporating this faithful explanation mechanism, the model generates more reliable and transparent predictions, moving beyond mere accuracy towards a more comprehensive understanding of AI decision-making.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  **Its primary goal is to understand the impact of each part on the overall performance**, helping to isolate crucial elements and identify potential redundancies. By carefully removing features or modules one by one, researchers can isolate specific contributions and pinpoint the most impactful components for model success.  In the context of a visual recognition model with explainability, an ablation study might involve removing or altering individual components (e.g., attention mechanisms, specific layers, or specific modules responsible for rationale generation) to determine how each element affects the model‚Äôs overall accuracy and the quality of its generated rationales. This process helps **determine which components are essential for both predictive accuracy and fidelity of explanations** and can reveal unexpected interactions between the different parts of the model. The results of ablation studies provide valuable insights into model design, leading to improved architectures and a deeper understanding of how the model makes predictions.

It shows examples of ontologies for three ImageNet categories: American Robin, Airliner, and Wombat. Each ontology is a tree-like structure where the root node is the category.  The nodes below the root represent attributes of that category, and the leaf nodes show sub-attributes.
