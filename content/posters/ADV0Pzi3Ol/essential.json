This can lead to unsafe predictions, especially in high-stakes scenarios, where understanding the model's rationale is crucial.  This paper highlights the importance of achieving \"double-correct\" predictions\u2014correct predictions with correct rationales.  The current lack of datasets with structured rationales and suitable optimization methods makes this a major challenge.\nTo address this, the researchers propose a two-phase approach. First, they create a new dataset with structured rationales for visual recognition. Second, they introduce a novel rationale-informed optimization method that guides the model to generate correct rationales and localizes relevant visual evidence. Extensive experiments show that this method significantly improves both prediction accuracy and rationale correctness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin.  This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI, offering a significant step towards developing trustworthy AI models for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer & Information Science, University of Delaware", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ADV0Pzi3Ol/podcast.wav"}
