This paper proposes a novel solution to oversmoothing by reinterpreting the self-attention mechanism of Transformers as a graph filter and designing a more effective graph filter called Graph Filter-based Self-Attention (GFSA). GFSA enriches self-attention with more diverse frequency information, improving the learning of latent representations and addressing the oversmoothing issue. \nGFSA achieves significant performance improvements across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph-level tasks, speech recognition, and code classification.  It demonstrates that GFSA can be integrated with various Transformer architectures without incurring significant computational overhead. The authors also suggest selectively applying GFSA to even-numbered layers to further mitigate the computational overhead.  This innovative approach offers a new perspective on attention mechanisms and could lead to more effective Transformer designs.", "affiliation": "Yonsei University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ffNrpcBpi6/podcast.wav"}
