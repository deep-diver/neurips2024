The dark lines represent the mean of the cumulative reward and the shaded area is the minimum and maximum values reached across 7 independent runs. The horizontal dashed lines represent the reward threshold proposed by the Gym library [25].", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the POWR algorithm to several baselines (A2C, DQN, TRPO, PPO) across three different Gym environments: FrozenLake-v1, Taxi-v3, and MountainCar-v0.  The x-axis represents the number of timesteps (interactions with the environment), while the y-axis shows the cumulative reward. Shaded regions indicate the minimum and maximum rewards across seven independent runs.  Horizontal dashed lines mark the reward thresholds defined in the Gym library.  The figure demonstrates that POWR achieves higher cumulative rewards within a similar or fewer number of timesteps compared to the baselines.", "section": "Experimental results"}, {"figure_path": "kbBjVMcJ7G/figures/figures_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The plots show the average cumulative reward in different environments with respect to the timesteps (i.e., number of interactions with MDP).
