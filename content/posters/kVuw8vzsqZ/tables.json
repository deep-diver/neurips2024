It shows separate formulas for both an external cost model (where prediction costs are independent of job processing) and a server time cost model (where prediction processing time consumes server resources). For short jobs, the equations are relatively straightforward. For long jobs, the equations are more complex, incorporating additional factors related to preemption and the distribution of predicted service times.", "section": "4 SkipPredict Theorems"}, {"figure_path": "kVuw8vzsqZ/tables/tables_4_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: SkipPredict equations", "description": "This table presents the equations for SkipPredict, a scheduling policy that incorporates the cost of predictions.  It shows separate equations for the expected mean response time of predicted short jobs and predicted long jobs under two different cost models: external cost model and server time cost model.  The equations account for various factors including the arrival rate, service time of jobs, and prediction costs. The equations help to calculate the overall cost, considering both prediction cost and response time, enabling informed decision-making about when predictions are beneficial.", "section": "4 SkipPredict Theorems"}, {"figure_path": "kVuw8vzsqZ/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: SkipPredict equations", "description": "This table presents the formulas derived for the expected mean response time for predicted short jobs and predicted long jobs in both the external cost model and the server cost model for SkipPredict.
