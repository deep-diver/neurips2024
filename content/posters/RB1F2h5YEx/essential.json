These issues stem from the difficulty of optimizing deep neural networks when encountering non-stationary environments and changing objectives.\nThis paper introduces Parseval regularization, a method that encourages orthogonality in weight matrices of neural networks within RL agents. This helps to maintain favorable optimization properties during training. The authors show that Parseval regularization leads to improved performance on various RL tasks and propose other techniques to overcome the issues of limited network capacity and Lipschitz continuity.", "affiliation": "McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "RB1F2h5YEx/podcast.wav"}
