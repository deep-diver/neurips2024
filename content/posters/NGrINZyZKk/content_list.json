Specifically, we propose a novel LLM-driven audio codec model, LLM-Codec, which transfers the audio modality into textual space by representing audio tokens with words or sub-words from the LLM vocabulary, while maintaining high audio reconstruction quality. The key idea is to reduce the modality heterogeneity between text and audio by compressing the audio modality into the well-trained textual space of LLMs. Thus, the audio representation can be viewed as a new foreign language, and LLMs can learn the new foreign language with several demonstrations. In experiments, we investigate the performance of the proposed approach across multiple audio understanding and generation tasks, e.g. speech emotion classification, audio classification, text-tospeech generation, speech enhancement, etc. Experimental results show that LLMs equipped with the LLM-Codec, named as UniAudio 1.5, prompted by only a few examples, can perform effectively in simple scenarios, validating our cross-modal in-context learning approach.

The success of LLMs inspires the development of multi-modal LLMs, naturally leading to the idea of empowering their auditory capabilities to tackle audio-related tasks. There have been notable advancements in extending the capabilities of LLMs to tackle audio understanding tasks by combining the pre-trained audio encoder (e.g. Whisper encoder [31]) and LLMs. For instance, models like WavLLM [15], SALMONN [35], and Qwen-audio [8] propose training multi-modal LLMs by integrating a pre-trained audio encoder, a trainable adaptor, and pre-trained LLMs. They try to align the audio and text modalities by updating the adaptor or fine-tuning the LLMs with LORA [14]. However, previous works have limitations: (1) they primarily focus on expanding LLMs to solve specific audio tasks without leveraging in-context learning for unseen audio tasks; (2) they do not support audio generation tasks, which limits their applicability; (3) they require large-scale audio data for aligning audio and text modalities, increasing the burden of model training and data collection.

Our motivation is to reduce modality heterogeneity between audio and text by compressing audio data into the token space of LLMs. Given that the compressed audio and text modalities share a vocabulary, the compressed audio sequence can be treated as a new foreign language, which LLMs can learn from a few demonstration samples. Moreover, since LLMs are pre-trained on large-scale data and have discovered numerous token sequence patterns, they are well-positioned to generalize to this new foreign language.

(3) Semantic richness: it should encode audio into semantically rich token sequences, making them easier for pre-trained LLMs to recognize. Thus, we propose a semantic-guided multi-scale residual vector quantization (RVQ) based codec. Specifically, the codec model consists of three residual VQ layers: the first layer encodes semantic information, the second encodes coarse-grained acoustic information, and the third encodes residual acoustic information. Unlike previous works [9, 52], which encode audio data into the same granularity in each layer, we propose a multi-scale approach that encodes audio data at different granularities across layers. We are motivated by the observation that semantic-level information can be preserved with fewer tokens, while acoustic-level information requires more tokens This multi-scale approach not only shortens the token sequence length but also offers flexibility for various tasks; for instance, audio understanding tasks may only require the semantic-level VQ layer.

Recently, advancements in neural network-based audio codecs have led to several promising developments [52, 9, 47, 25, 20]. These systems typically involve an encoder that extracts deep features from a latent space, which are then quantized and transmitted to a decoder for reconstruction. Particularly relevant to our work are the FACodec [20] and SpeechTokenizer [54] models, which explicitly model different properties of audio in different vector quantization layers.

In the audio modality, most previous works focus on solving speech understanding [15] or general audio understanding [35, 19], but these models are not applicable to audio generation tasks. SpeechGPT addresses some audio understanding and generation tasks by fine-tuning all parameters and expanding the speech token vocabulary based on LLAMA.

However, there is modal heterogeneity between the discrete audio tokens produced by the codec models and the text tokens used in LLMs. For example, the codebooks in audio codecs and the vocabularies of LLMs are typically unconnected, making it difficult to extend well-trained LLMs to audio modalities. Although previous works [53, 34] have demonstrated the effectiveness of expanding the vocabulary of LLMs to audio tokens and updating all of the parameters of LLMs, it will cost a lot of computing resources and forget the knowledge of the text.

Compared with the BLSP model, our proposed method gets better performance. Based on the experimental results from two audio understanding tasks, we can see that the semantic VQ layer is very important for understanding tasks.

In [16], authors propose an instruction-tuning strategy for multi-modal LLMs. They first construct a lot of audio tasks as training data, then validate some unseen audio tasks in a zeroshot way. To make a fair comparison, we use the same test set with them, and choose the first N samples as the demonstration to construct a N-way-1-shot evaluation. As Table 3 shows 4 selected audio understanding tasks, our proposed method obtains better or compared performance than these baselines in [16]. Especially, for the bird sound detection task, our proposed method obtained great improvement over previous methods. We also note that our method performs worse on language identification, the possible reason is that our codec model is only trained on English speech data.

Unlike the traditional TTS model, which generates any speech content, this task generates digit speech. Our current model to generate complex speech content is still challenging. We use accuracy (ACC) to assess the content of the generated sample whether following the instructions. DNSMOS is used to assess the speech quality of generated samples. We construct 20 different query questions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and reasoning (finding more details from Appendix C.2). From Table 4, we can see that our proposed model can accurately understand the query in most cases (the accuracy is $70\\;\\%$ ) and generate good-quality speech samples. Figure 3 gives a visualization of generating speech based on the query. The frozen LLAMA model learns about 4 digits (0-3), each audio digit includes 5 samples. We add the context for each audio: \"an audio of ${\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{k}}}\"$ before inputting the audio\u2019s discrete representations into LLAMA, as Figure 1 (b) shows. After that, we let the LLAMA 2 model generate corresponding speech digits based on the instruction.

Secondly, we find the multi-scale RVQ significantly reduces the length of the token sequence and brings benefits for downstream tasks (the audio classification accuracy is better than the baseline).

With the help of LLM-Codec, pre-trained LLMs can be applied to solve multiple audio understanding and generation tasks. We demonstrate that LLM-Codec has good reconstruction performance, and the compressed token sequence is suitable for LLMs to understand and generate.

Due to the LLM\u2019s context length limitation, we cannot add more demonstration samples to help improve the performance. We think it is worth exploring using more demonstrations to improve its in-context learning ability. Moreover, we only explore the use of the LLAMA 2 7B model as the backbone; more advanced opensourced LLMs are worth exploring. Considering we have open-sourced the LLM-Codec, readers can conduct experiments on their favorite LLMs. Furthermore, there are fewer theoretical connections to justify the meaning of the lexical representation of the \"trainable new (pseudo) language\" of speech, which can be improved. In future work, we will explore to train multi-modal LLMs by fine-tuning LLMs on text-audio datasets with the help of LLM-Codec, and build more theoretical analysis.

The overall architecture is similar to previous audio codec models, such as Encodec [9], DAC [25], and HiFi-Codec [47], which includes four main parts: encoder, quantizer, decoder, and discriminators. Figure 2 provides a visual depiction of the proposed method. For any input $\\textbf{\\em x}$ , the encoder first encodes it into latent presentations $\\bar{\\mathbf{E}}^{T,d}$ , where $T$ denotes the number of frames, $d$ denotes the dimension of each vector. Due to the encoder includes some down-sampling layers, resulting in $T<<t\\times s r$ . Then each frame $e\\in E$ is passed through the quantizer, which assigns it to the closest entry in a codebook, resulting in the quantized embedding $\\hat{e}$ . Finally, the quantized feature E\u02c6 inputs into the decoder to reconstruct $\\hat{\\pmb{x}}$ . The encoder and decoder architecture follows previous works Encodec [9] and DAC-Codec [25], which includes several convolution layers and transformer layers. Specifically, the encoder model comprises a 1D convolution with $C$ channels and a kernel size of 7, leading into $B$ convolution blocks. Each block contains a residual unit followed by a down-sampling layer, which employs a convolution with a kernel size $K$ that is twice the stride $S$ . The residual unit itself comprises two convolutions, each with a kernel size of 3, linked by a skip connection. The transformer block is used for sequence modeling, and concludes with a final 1D convolution layer featuring a kernel size of 7. In this study, we set $S=[3,4,5,8]$ , which results in 480 times down-sampling for audio. The decoder mirrors the encoder\u2019s architecture, substituting stride convolutions with transposed convolutions and reversing the stride order.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
