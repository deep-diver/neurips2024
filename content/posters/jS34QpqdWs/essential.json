Gaussian Cox process with GP priors offer more flexibility but suffer from computational complexity and limitations in kernel types and stationarity.  Permanental processes improve analytical tractability by using a square link function, but they inherit the cubic complexity and kernel limitations of GPs. \nThis paper proposes Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process (NSSPP) to address the above issues. NSSPP leverages sparse spectral representation of nonstationary kernels to reduce computation to a linear level.  A deep kernel variant, DNSSPP, is introduced by stacking multiple spectral mappings, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns.  Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of NSSPP and DNSSPP, especially for nonstationary data.", "affiliation": "Center for Applied Statistics and School of Statistics, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jS34QpqdWs/podcast.wav"}
