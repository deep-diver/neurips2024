The paper identifies a key tradeoff between robustness against multiple attacks and model accuracy, which makes achieving high \"union accuracy\" (robustness across all attacks) particularly difficult.  Prior methods like average-case and worst-case adversarial training have limitations regarding accuracy or computational cost. \n\nThe authors introduce RAMP, a novel training framework. RAMP uses a logit pairing loss that enforces similar predictions for different attack types. Moreover, it bridges natural training and adversarial training through gradient projection to improve both accuracy and robustness.  Experiments show RAMP achieves higher union accuracy and superior generalization against a range of adversarial attacks and natural corruptions on various datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.  RAMP shows promise in creating more robust and resilient DNNs for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "u1Z3HWz4VJ/podcast.wav"}
