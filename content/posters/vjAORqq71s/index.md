### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning tasks involve custom objectives, often non-differentiable and hard to optimize.  Current differentiable relaxations can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, hindering neural network training. This often occurs when using algorithms as parts of the loss functions. This paper addresses this by introducing a novel approach called "Newton Losses" which exploits the second-order information of these complex loss functions, typically obtained via Hessian or Fisher matrix. 

Newton Losses locally approximates the non-convex loss functions with a quadratic function, effectively creating a locally convex surrogate loss. This surrogate loss function is optimized to improve performance with gradient descent. Experiments on sorting and shortest-path benchmarks show consistent performance improvements for existing methods, especially for those that suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients.  The method's computational efficiency is a key advantage, making it practical for various applications.

> This figure illustrates the ranking supervision task using differentiable sorting algorithms.  A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes a set of four-digit MNIST images, generating a scalar value for each image. These scalars are then fed into a differentiable ranking algorithm (e.g., NeuralSort, SoftSort, or a Differentiable Sorting Network), which outputs a differentiable permutation matrix representing the predicted ranking. This predicted permutation matrix is finally compared against the ground truth permutation matrix using a cross-entropy loss function (LCE). The goal is to train the CNN such that it produces scalars that lead to a predicted ranking that closely matches the ground truth.

### In-depth insights


#### Newton Loss Method
The proposed "Newton Loss Method" offers a novel approach to enhance the training of neural networks using custom, often non-differentiable objectives.  It cleverly addresses the optimization challenges posed by such loss functions by leveraging second-order information. Instead of directly applying computationally expensive second-order optimization techniques to the entire neural network, **the method focuses on locally approximating the loss function using a quadratic Taylor expansion**. This approximation, refined through Hessian or empirical Fisher matrix calculations, generates a "Newton Loss" that's easier to optimize using standard gradient descent.  This strategy is particularly beneficial for algorithms where the loss function presents a computational bottleneck during training.  The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated by consistent performance improvements across various differentiable algorithms for sorting and shortest-path problems, showcasing its broad applicability and potential to significantly improve the training efficiency and accuracy of models utilizing complex, non-convex objectives. **The key strength lies in its computational efficiency**, as it avoids the high cost associated with second-order optimization of the entire neural network.  Furthermore, **the method's flexibility allows for the use of either Hessian or empirical Fisher matrix information**, adapting to situations where Hessian computation might be difficult or impractical.

#### Algorithmic Losses
The concept of "Algorithmic Losses" in machine learning represents a significant shift from traditional supervised learning paradigms.  Instead of relying solely on ground truth labels, these losses **integrate problem-specific algorithmic knowledge** directly into the training objective. This allows for tackling tasks previously intractable with standard loss functions like MSE or cross-entropy.  **Continuous relaxations** of inherently non-differentiable algorithms are crucial here, enabling gradient-based optimization.  However, this approach introduces challenges, including **non-convexity**, **vanishing/exploding gradients**, and the presence of **poor local minima**, hindering optimization efficiency.  The innovation lies in leveraging algorithmic knowledge to design the loss function itself, leading to a more powerful yet potentially more difficult optimization landscape.

#### Empirical Fisher
The concept of "Empirical Fisher" in the context of optimizing loss functions within neural networks is a crucial one.  It offers a **computationally efficient alternative** to using the full Hessian matrix when calculating second-order information. The Hessian, while providing superior information about the loss landscape's curvature, is often prohibitively expensive to compute for large neural networks.  The Empirical Fisher, derived from the observed gradients, **provides an approximation of curvature** that can be significantly less computationally demanding.  This approximation is particularly useful for non-convex and hard-to-optimize loss functions arising from the integration of differentiable algorithms, where the true Hessian might be unavailable or impractical.  The tradeoff, however, lies in the accuracy of the approximation; while computationally efficient, the Empirical Fisher may sacrifice some precision compared to the full Hessian.  **The use of regularization** techniques, like Tikhonov regularization, are often employed to stabilize the inverse of the approximated Fisher matrix.  This is vital in cases of ill-conditioning, which can occur if the eigenvalues are close to zero.  Overall, the method represents a balance between computational efficiency and optimization performance.  **Its effectiveness is contingent** on the characteristics of the loss function and the specific application.

#### Benchmark Results
Benchmark results are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of Newton Losses.  The paper likely presents results on established benchmarks for ranking and shortest-path problems, comparing the performance of Newton Losses against existing state-of-the-art methods. Key aspects to look for include **quantitative metrics** (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall), **statistical significance testing** to confirm improvements aren't due to chance, and **analysis of different variants** of Newton Losses (Hessian-based vs. Fisher-based) to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses across various scenarios.  **Ablation studies**, investigating the impact of hyperparameters, would also provide valuable insights.  Finally, a discussion of the computational cost of Newton Losses and how it scales with problem size is essential for practical applicability.

#### Future Extensions
Future research could explore **extensions to non-convex loss functions**, investigating alternative methods beyond quadratic approximations to better handle the complexities of algorithmic losses.  The **effectiveness of Newton Losses with different optimization algorithms** beyond gradient descent warrants further study.  Additionally, research into **more efficient Hessian or Fisher matrix estimation techniques** is crucial for scalability, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or complex algorithmic procedures.  Finally, exploring applications of Newton Losses in **other areas of weakly supervised learning** and expanding the evaluation to a wider range of algorithmic problems will solidify its practical impact and uncover its full potential.
