### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many AI systems, especially those making consequential decisions about humans, are retrained periodically using model-generated annotations. However, humans often act strategically, adapting their behavior in response to these systems. This raises critical questions around the long-term impacts of these retraining processes on both model performance and fairness.  The paper highlights risks associated with this common practice, demonstrating that the proportion of agents receiving positive labels can decrease over time, despite an increase in the overall acceptance rate.

To address these issues, the researchers propose a refined retraining process that uses probabilistic sampling for model annotations.  This approach aims to stabilize the system dynamics and prevent potentially adverse outcomes. They analyze how algorithmic fairness is affected by retraining, revealing that enforcing standard fairness constraints at each retraining step may not always benefit disadvantaged groups.  Experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets validate their theoretical findings, demonstrating the impact of strategic behavior on model retraining and highlighting the need for more sophisticated approaches to data annotation and fairness.

> This figure illustrates the iterative process of updating the training dataset used for retraining the ML model. It shows how the model's annotations, along with human annotations, are combined to create the new training dataset.  The strategic feedback from agents is incorporated into the process by showing how their behavior changes in response to the current model.  This continuous feedback and retraining loop is a central component of the paper's investigation into the long-term impacts of model retraining with strategic human feedback.

It includes the distributions of the features (PX(Xk)), the conditional probability of the label given the features (P Y|X(1|x)), and the hyperparameters used for the experiments (n, r, T, q0).  These parameters control various aspects of the experiment, such as the number of agents, the ratio of human-annotated to model-annotated samples, the number of training rounds, and the initial qualification rate.





### In-depth insights


#### Strategic Agents' Impact
The concept of "Strategic Agents' Impact" in the context of machine learning models centers on how human users, aware of the model's decision-making process, adapt their behavior to obtain favorable outcomes. This strategic interaction significantly affects model performance and fairness over time.  **Humans, acting as strategic agents, may modify their features or actions to increase their likelihood of receiving a positive prediction.** This behavior leads to a skewed data distribution that is no longer representative of the true population, ultimately reducing the model's accuracy and generalizability.  **Retraining the model with this strategically manipulated data further exacerbates the issue**, creating a feedback loop where the model becomes increasingly biased towards rewarding strategic behavior. The long-term effects can be particularly detrimental, with the possibility of decreasing the overall proportion of agents with positive labels while individual agents increasingly receive positive decisions.  Addressing this necessitates robust model retraining techniques that mitigate the impact of strategic behavior and maintain model fairness. **Strategies like incorporating probabilistic sampling during model annotation or early stopping of retraining processes can help stabilize this dynamic and mitigate the risk of biased outcomes.**  Furthermore, carefully considering algorithmic fairness constraints throughout the retraining procedure is crucial to minimize potential societal biases and ensure equitable treatment for all agents.

#### Model Retraining Risks
Model retraining, while crucial for maintaining high performance in machine learning systems, presents significant risks, especially when dealing with strategic human agents.  **Continuous retraining can lead to unintended feedback loops**, where the model's updates influence human behavior, creating a dynamic system that's difficult to predict and control.  This may result in **unexpected and potentially harmful long-term consequences**.  For example, a model designed to assess loan applications might inadvertently incentivize applicants to manipulate their profiles, leading to a skewed population and inaccurate model assessment.  Furthermore, **retraining can exacerbate existing biases** and even create new ones, particularly in scenarios where the training data is incomplete or model-annotated samples are used due to cost or time constraints.  To mitigate these risks, **a thorough understanding of the model-agent interaction dynamics is essential**.  This includes analyzing how human responses change over time, accounting for any bias in training datasets, and evaluating the impact of different retraining strategies on fairness and overall system performance.  Finally, **developing methods to stabilize these dynamics and enhance fairness** is crucial, such as employing algorithmic fairness constraints during retraining or implementing more sophisticated methods for handling model-annotated samples.

#### Fairness in Dynamics
Analyzing fairness within dynamic systems presents unique challenges.  **Traditional fairness metrics, often designed for static datasets, may be inadequate when populations and models evolve over time.**  A model deemed fair initially might become unfair as agents strategically adapt their behavior in response.  This necessitates the development of **time-sensitive fairness metrics** that account for evolving data distributions.  Furthermore, **interventions aimed at restoring fairness at each step may have unintended long-term consequences**, potentially exacerbating disparities in the long run.  Therefore, understanding how fairness interacts with these dynamic processes is vital, and research should explore both short-term corrective actions and long-term strategies to maintain fairness in the face of evolving data and strategic behavior.

#### Algorithmic Refinement
Algorithmic refinement, in the context of machine learning models interacting with strategic human agents, focuses on improving model behavior and mitigating potential negative consequences.  **Iterative retraining**, a core component, involves periodically updating the model with new data, incorporating both human and model-generated annotations.  However, naive retraining can lead to undesirable feedback loops where agents strategically adapt, creating skewed data distributions and potentially undermining model performance or fairness.  **Sophisticated refinement strategies** might involve incorporating fairness constraints during retraining, weighting samples differently, or using probabilistic model annotations to reduce bias amplification.  The choice of refinement technique is crucial, as it directly influences the long-term dynamics of agent behavior and model accuracy and impacts **societal welfare**.  A key challenge lies in balancing model accuracy with fairness and stability over time to avoid unintended consequences.  Successful refinement often necessitates a deep understanding of the interaction between strategic agents and the learning system.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on automating data annotation under strategic human agents could explore several key areas. **Improving the robustness of the proposed refined retraining process** to handle diverse scenarios and noisy data is crucial.  This involves exploring more sophisticated probabilistic models and adaptive strategies to stabilize dynamics and enhance fairness.  **Investigating the long-term effects of different fairness constraints** on both the agent population and the model itself warrants further study, especially under various group dynamics.  A deeper examination of the interaction between systematic human bias and the model's bias amplification is needed, potentially employing causal inference techniques.  **Developing methods to quantify and mitigate the amplification of systematic biases** during retraining is a crucial step toward building more equitable AI systems.  Finally, extending this framework beyond binary classification to multi-class settings and more complex strategic agent behaviors will unlock more realistic and impactful applications.
