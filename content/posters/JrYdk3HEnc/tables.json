For each environment (Hopper, Half-Cheetah, and Walker2D), several parameters are listed along with their ranges. These parameters represent physical properties of the simulated environments, such as joint damping, foot friction, height of the head, and torso size. The randomized values are uniformly sampled from the specified intervals.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
