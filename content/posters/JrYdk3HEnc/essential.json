Existing methods often struggle with these issues, leading to suboptimal control performance.  This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on continuous-time linear systems. \nThe researchers developed a two-level online control algorithm that addresses these issues.  This method uses a higher-level strategy to learn the optimal control policy and a lower-level strategy to provide real-time feedback.  By applying this algorithm, they achieved sublinear regret, meaning that the algorithm's performance comes close to the performance of an optimal controller.  Furthermore, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for training agents in domain randomization environments, significantly improving performance compared to traditional methods.
