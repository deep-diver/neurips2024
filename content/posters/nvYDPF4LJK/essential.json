The detailed methodology and comprehensive evaluation presented provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking to advance MLLM capabilities.", "summary": "VisionLLM v2 unifies visual perception, understanding, and generation, excelling in various vision tasks and achieving performance comparable to task-specific models.", "takeaways": ["VisionLLM v2 is an end-to-end generalist MLLM handling hundreds of vision-language tasks.", "The 'super link' mechanism facilitates efficient information transmission between MLLM and downstream decoders.", "VisionLLM v2 achieves performance comparable to task-specific models across various benchmarks."], "tldr": "Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are often limited in their application scope, producing only text outputs and struggling with diverse visual tasks.  The limitations arise from inefficient information transmission between the core MLLM and task-specific decoders, leading to training conflicts and suboptimal performance across multiple domains. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a new model and a novel information transmission method.\nVisionLLM v2, introduced in this paper, overcomes these limitations with its **end-to-end architecture** and a new mechanism called \"super link.\" Super link enables flexible information transmission and gradient feedback between the core MLLM and multiple downstream decoders, addressing training conflicts effectively.  The model's performance is extensively evaluated on hundreds of public vision and vision-language tasks, showing that it achieves results comparable to task-specific models. The introduction of VisionLLM v2 thus represents a significant advancement in the generalization of MLLMs.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "nvYDPF4LJK/podcast.wav"}
