Existing methods struggle with computational costs and over-smoothing when dealing with large-scale graphs.  Furthermore, selecting the most informative relationships (meta-paths) is crucial but remains a complex task.\nThe paper introduces LMSPS, a novel framework that addresses these limitations. LMSPS employs a progressive sampling algorithm to efficiently search for the most relevant meta-paths among an exponentially large search space.  A sampling evaluation strategy further refines the selection, ensuring only highly effective meta-paths are used for model training.  Experiments demonstrate LMSPS outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the importance of its approach for extracting long-range relationships in heterogeneous graph analysis.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hbOWLtJNMK/podcast.wav"}
