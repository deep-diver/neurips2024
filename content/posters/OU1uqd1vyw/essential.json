Existing methods either rely on manual filtering (which is expensive) or automated filters that are not effective in complex environments.  This limits the scalability and generalizability of collaborative LLM training.\n\nCLUES addresses this challenge by focusing on **training dynamics**. It uses a novel technique that leverages the impact of individual data points on the training process to select high-quality data. By tracing how the model parameters change due to each training example (measured as per-sample gradients), CLUES provides a data quality score and a global threshold to filter the data collaboratively. Experiments demonstrate notable performance improvements of up to 67.3% across diverse domains (medical, multilingual, and financial), showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed data quality control method for collaborative LLM fine-tuning.
