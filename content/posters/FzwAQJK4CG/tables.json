The datasets represent instances of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem, a common type of problem in cryptography. Runtimes are broken down into those for satisfiable (SAT) and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) instances, providing insight into solver performance depending on the instance's properties. Different sizes and configurations of the MQ problem are included (indicated by 'Scipher' and 'Speck' variations and their parameter values).", "section": "5. Efficiency of incomplete solvers"}]
