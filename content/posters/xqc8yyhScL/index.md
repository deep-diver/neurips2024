### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Programming by Example (PBE), generating code from input-output examples, is a significant challenge in AI.  Large Language Models (LLMs), while initially ineffective at PBE, show substantial promise.  Existing PBE methods often rely on restricted domain-specific languages, limiting their applicability and power.

This research investigates LLMs' potential for solving PBE using general-purpose languages like Python.  The authors demonstrate that **fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on PBE datasets dramatically boosts their performance**, surpassing both traditional symbolic methods and advanced closed-source models.  They explore different domains, revealing that success hinges more on the posterior description length than program size, and introduce an adaptation algorithm to bridge the gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, improving the robustness of the system.

> This figure shows three different domains used to evaluate the performance of LLMs in programming-by-example (PBE) tasks.  These domains represent varying levels of complexity and typicality in LLM training data.   * **Lists:** This domain involves manipulating lists of numbers, which is relatively common in programming datasets used for pre-training LLMs. * **Graphics:** This domain is less common in LLM training data and involves generating graphics programs. This helps evaluate the model's ability to generalize beyond typical programming tasks. * **Text Editing Macros:** This domain is somewhere in between in terms of frequency and focuses on string manipulations that is prevalent in spreadsheet software. This task evaluates inductive reasoning in transforming input strings into output strings. Each domain is visually illustrated with example inputs, outputs, and the automatically generated program (in Python) by the fine-tuned language model.

> This table compares the generalization accuracy and oracle accuracy of three different text editing program synthesis systems: FlashFill, FlashFill++, and the proposed LLM-based system. Generalization accuracy measures the percentage of problems for which the generated program produces correct outputs on unseen test cases. Oracle accuracy measures the percentage of problems for which at least one correct program was generated, even if other incorrect programs were also generated. The results show that the LLM-based system significantly outperforms FlashFill in terms of generalization accuracy and achieves comparable performance to FlashFill++ in terms of oracle accuracy.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM-PBE Synergy
The concept of 'LLM-PBE Synergy' explores the powerful combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Programming by Example (PBE).  LLMs, with their code generation capabilities, offer a new approach to PBE's challenge of automatically synthesizing programs from input-output examples. This synergy **overcomes limitations** of traditional PBE methods which often rely on restricted domain-specific languages, hindering generalization. LLMs, by contrast, can operate in Turing-complete languages like Python, dramatically increasing the scope of solvable problems. However, **pretrained LLMs are not directly effective at PBE**. Fine-tuning is crucial for high performance, although it can lead to a **deficit in out-of-distribution generalization**.  **Adaptation techniques** that leverage unlabeled data from the target domain are key to address this challenge, moving towards a more robust and versatile PBE system.  The combination thus **enhances PBE's flexibility** while also revealing the **limitations of LLMs** in pure inductive reasoning, highlighting areas for future research.

#### Fine-tuning Effects
Fine-tuning's impact on large language models (LLMs) for programming-by-example (PBE) tasks reveals a complex interplay of factors. While **pretrained LLMs show limited PBE capabilities**, fine-tuning significantly boosts performance, especially when the test problems align with the training data distribution.  This highlights the importance of **high-quality, in-distribution training data** for effective LLM fine-tuning.  However, a critical limitation is the models' struggle with **out-of-distribution generalization**, suggesting that fine-tuning alone doesn't fully solve the inductive reasoning challenges inherent in PBE.  **Adaptation techniques**, using small unlabeled datasets of problems to further adjust the LLM, show promise in mitigating this shortcoming but don't fully eliminate the issue.  Analyzing the factors driving success or failure in fine-tuned models reveals that **posterior description length**, not program size, is the strongest predictor of performance, indicating that fine-tuning helps the model leverage input/output examples effectively for program generation, rather than just relying on simple pattern matching.

#### Generalization Limits
The inherent limitations in achieving robust generalization within the context of Programming-by-Example (PBE) using Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a critical area of exploration.  **Fine-tuning LLMs on in-distribution data yields substantial improvements, but this success often fails to generalize to out-of-distribution examples.** This highlights a crucial challenge:  the model's reliance on learned patterns specific to its training data, limiting its ability to extrapolate to unseen problem structures.  **Bridging this distribution gap requires innovative techniques that enable more robust generalization**, such as those that leverage algorithm adaptation or incorporate advanced inductive biases to enhance the LLM's inherent reasoning abilities.  **Addressing these generalization limits is essential for realizing the full potential of LLMs in solving complex PBE tasks and unlocking their applicability to more diverse, real-world problems.**

#### Adaptation Methods
Adaptation methods in the context of large language models (LLMs) for programming-by-example (PBE) tasks are crucial for enhancing the models' ability to generalize to unseen problems.  **Fine-tuning**, a common approach, involves training the LLM on a dataset of program-input-output triples.  However, obtaining such datasets can be challenging, particularly for niche domains. The paper proposes an iterative adaptation strategy, starting from a small manually-constructed seed dataset and bootstrapping it by prompting the LLM to generate programs and inputs. The outputs are then obtained through program execution rather than relying solely on the LLM. This approach uses the LLM's code generation capabilities to create synthetic training data for the task. This iterative adaptation process is similar to a wake-sleep algorithm which allows the LLM to handle out-of-distribution problems more effectively.  **The key idea is to use the LLM's generation capabilities to create new training data from a seed dataset, expanding the model's knowledge base and improving its generalization ability.** This addresses the limitation of traditional PBE systems, which rely on restricted domain-specific languages, enabling the use of Turing-complete languages like Python. The success of the adaptation process depends on the selection of a suitable seed dataset that will guide the LLM‚Äôs code generation.  However,  **generalization beyond the training distribution remains a significant challenge**. The paper also discusses an algorithm to narrow the domain gap, showing that the fine-tuned model can effectively solve a wider range of problems than classical symbolic methods, but highlights the need for continued research on robust out-of-distribution generalization.

#### Future of PBE
The future of Programming-by-Example (PBE) is bright, driven by advancements in large language models (LLMs).  **LLMs show promise in solving typical PBE tasks, potentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems.**  However, **challenges remain in achieving robust out-of-distribution generalization**. Fine-tuning LLMs on diverse datasets significantly improves performance, but struggles persist when encountering problems far from the training distribution.  **Addressing this limitation is crucial for broader adoption**, potentially through techniques like iterative adaptation or incorporating stronger inductive biases within LLMs. The integration of LLMs with existing symbolic approaches also holds significant potential. This combined approach could leverage the strengths of both paradigms, combining the LLM's ability to generate diverse solutions with the accuracy and efficiency of symbolic methods. Furthermore, **research into techniques for improving the scalability and efficiency of LLM-based PBE systems is needed** to enable their deployment on resource-constrained devices and for use by end users.

> This figure visualizes the specific problems solved before and after adaptation on LOGO graphics. Before adaptation, only a few out-of-distribution problems are solvable, often requiring a significant search budget. After adaptation, the system can solve similar out-of-distribution problems more quickly. However, it cannot generalize to problems drastically different from those initially solvable by the fine-tuned model.  The results suggest that while adaptation helps, it's not a complete solution for handling all out-of-distribution problems.
