Current label smoothing methods haven't fully explored the potential of leveraging local context within the graph structure. This paper introduces PosteL, a novel approach that addresses this limitation. \n\nPosteL uses soft labels encapsulating local context through neighborhood label distributions. These soft labels are further refined using iterative pseudo-labeling to mitigate overfitting. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets showcase improved accuracy for various baseline models, demonstrating PosteL's effectiveness and simplicity. The results highlight the method's effectiveness and potential for enhancing node classification performance across various datasets and models.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "DHVqAQ9DHy/podcast.wav"}
