A larger target model then reviews this draft to align with its output, and any acceptance by the target model results in a reduction of the number of the target model runs, ultimately improving efficiency. However, the drafting process in speculative decoding includes slow autoregressive generation and allocates equal time to generating tokens, irrespective of their importance. These inefficiencies collectively contribute to the suboptimal performance of speculative decoding. To further improve LLM inference, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), a speculative execution algorithm that incorporates two types of cascades. The Vertical Cascade eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models, while the Horizontal Cascade optimizes time allocation in drafting for improved efficiency. Combining both cascades, CS Drafting achieves greater speedup compared to the baselines in our experiments, while preserving the same output distribution as the target model.1 ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "1 Introduction ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4 [17], has marked a significant milestone in the field of natural language processing (NLP).

However, these applications involve an extremely high number of users, up to hundreds of millions daily. To serve in real-time at this scale, a low-latency system is not only cost-saving but also crucial for keeping the service running. In addition, the sheer scale of the service means that even a slight improvement in the latency of LLMs can greatly contribute to both the service provider and the community. Consequently, optimizing the latency of LLMs has become a critical area of research.

An emerging solution, known as speculative decoding [14, 4, 25], shows potential to mitigate this issue. In speculative decoding, a draft model (which is smaller and faster) generates $k$ tokens in each step (with $k$ being a hyperparameter) autoregressively, and these tokens are then reviewed by a target model (which is larger and slower) in parallel. In one single run, the target model will accept any tokens aligned with its output and further generate one token. The drafting process in speculative decoding enables the target model to generate multiple tokens in a single run while maintaining its output distribution unchanged. With a properly sized draft model, speculative decoding achieves a speedup of 2 to 3 times, making it a potential method for solving high latency issues.

We use FLAN-T5-XXL as our target model, FLAN-T5-BASE and FLAN-T5-SMALL as our reviewing draft models. For decoder-only models, we select Vicuna-7B [28], a fine-tuned version of LLaMA [20] as the target model. We use a 68M model with the same tokenizer as the reviewing draft model3. We also leverage tree attention [15, 3] with CS Drafting for the experiments on Vicuna-7B. In both cases, the Max-Gram algorithm is used as the generating draft model. Since we do not observe any significant difference between sampling with temperature 1 and greedy decoding in previous speculative decoding experiments [14], and to ensure our experiments are fully reproducible, we perform sampling at temperature 0, i.e., using greedy decoding by default. To align our experiment with current common usage, we do not perform fine-tuning for CS Drafting, and the generation is conducted in a zero-shot manner.

Knowledge distillation takes the approach of transferring knowledge from a superior teacher model to a smaller student model [11, 8].
