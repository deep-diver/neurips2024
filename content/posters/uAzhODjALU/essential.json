Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as Mamba, offer faster inference but usually underperform Transformers in benchmarks when trained from scratch.  This creates a need for methods that combine the strengths of both architectures. \nThis paper addresses this challenge by **distilling large pretrained Transformers into linear RNNs**.  The researchers leverage the linear projection weights from Transformer attention layers to initialize a modified Mamba architecture. They also develop a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm to further accelerate inference. Their experiments show that the resulting hybrid model achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer, while outperforming existing linear RNN models in chat and general benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "uAzhODjALU/podcast.wav"}
