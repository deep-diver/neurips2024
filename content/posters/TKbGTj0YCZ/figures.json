It breaks down the problem of conformal prediction under joint distribution shift into several parts, showcasing the challenges of existing methods and the proposed solutions. Specifically, it shows how multiple test domains with joint shifts can lead to coverage issues; how coverage differences are decomposed into covariate shift and concept shift; why existing methods using f-divergence fail to capture the nuances of these shifts, and how the proposed Normalized Truncated Wasserstein distance (NTW) provides a more effective solution for measuring coverage differences and enabling robust conformal predictions across multiple domains; and finally illustrates the proposed mRCP algorithm for simultaneously training and optimizing for both prediction accuracy and robust coverage.", "section": "3 Conformal prediction under joint distribution shift"}, {"figure_path": "TKbGTj0YCZ/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Pareto fronts of Multi-domain Robust Conformal Prediction(mRCP), compared with DRO and V-REx: Experimental results of (a) airfoil self-noise example, (b) epidemic spread prediction, and (c) (d) traffic speed prediction. mRCP always reaches a smaller coverage difference expectation than DRO and V-REx with less increase in prediction residual.
