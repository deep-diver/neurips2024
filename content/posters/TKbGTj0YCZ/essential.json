Existing methods using importance weighting only handle covariate shift and ignore concept shift in joint distribution shifts.  Ignoring this nuance leads to inaccurate coverage guarantees, especially when dealing with multiple shifted test domains. \n\nTo address this, the paper introduces mRCP, which leverages a new metric: Normalized Truncated Wasserstein Distance (NTW).  NTW effectively measures the difference between the test and weighted calibration conformal score distributions, capturing the concept shift. mRCP incorporates NTW into an end-to-end training process, ensuring reliable (1-\u03b1) coverage across multiple shifted test domains. Experiments demonstrate mRCP's superiority over existing methods, notably reducing coverage gaps by 50% on average. **This improved robustness is crucial for deploying conformal prediction in real-world settings with varying data distributions.**", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "TKbGTj0YCZ/podcast.wav"}
