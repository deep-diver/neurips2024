The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear correlation between the metric and the coverage difference. A higher coefficient indicates that the metric is better at predicting the coverage difference. The table shows results for multiple datasets and models (MLP and PDE).", "section": "5.2 Experiments of NTW"}, {"figure_path": "TKbGTj0YCZ/tables/tables_11_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Related works and mRCP", "description": "This table compares the proposed mRCP method with existing conformal prediction methods. It contrasts the number of test domains considered, the type of domain shift (exchangeability, covariate shift, joint distribution shift), and the specific approaches used to handle these shifts.  The table provides context for the novel contributions of mRCP by highlighting the limitations of prior work in handling multiple test domains and joint distribution shifts.", "section": "A Related work"}, {"figure_path": "TKbGTj0YCZ/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: \u03b2 values for mRCP and V-REx in experiment setups", "description": "This table shows the hyperparameter \u03b2 values used for the Multi-domain Robust Conformal Prediction (mRCP) and the V-REx algorithms in different experiment setups across seven datasets.
