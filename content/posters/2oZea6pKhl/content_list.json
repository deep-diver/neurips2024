To accelerate the computation, prior arts [42,46] transfer the dense RT into a sparse format by retraining only the top-percentile elements based on power measurements. However, this approach tends to be biased towards specific ranges that exhibit exceptionally high measurements. It can be observed in Fig. 2 that after percentile-based sparsifying, a significant number of the reserved elements are concentrated within the same ranges spread across the azimuth and elevation axes. These elements manifest as artifacts of sidelobes, which can an be viewed as the diffraction pattern of the antenna [96,97].

Many sequences in K-Radar were collected under adverse weather (i.e., sleet, rain, and snow), which results in non-negligible noise to the generated occupancy labels based on LiDAR sweeps.

Our pipeline of 3D occupancy annotation is similar to those in [3,25,26, 105]. First, we split each LiDAR point cloud from a sequence into the background and foreground part with the help of 3D bounding box annotations. For the background, we superimpose all LiDAR points by transforming them into a united world coordinate using their extrinsic. For the foreground part, we track the same instances (indicated by the same tracking IDs) across the sequence and transform LiDAR points association to them into the coordinates of their bounding boxes. In this way, sparse LiDAR point clouds can be significantly densified and the occupancy labels can be more realistic. Note that K-Radar [42] only annotates the objects in the front of the car. To avoid the interference of moving objects in the back, we only use the front part of each LiDAR sweep for ground truth generation. Second, we transform the background and objects point sets into the current frame coordinate system with respect to the ego-pose of the current frame and the objects\u2019 pose. Lastly, we concatenate the background and objects points at the current frame and voxelized the merged point cloud to generate the occupancy labels.

In adverse weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain and snow), water droplets or snowflakes can scatter or absorb LiDAR beams, reducing the effective range of LiDAR and inducing noise in the data. To ensure the high fidelity of our occupancy labels, we select 24 sequences collected in decent weather conditions from K-Radar [42] for annotation and leave the rest sequences collected in poor weathers unannotated, which can only be used for qualitative analysis. We split the annotated 24 sequences into the training, validation and test sets with a ratio of 17:2:5, resulting in 11,333, 1,059 and 2,878 frames, respective.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
