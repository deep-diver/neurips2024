Instead of focusing on sound-related details, their outputs are dominated by visual descriptions, which are considered artifacts in the context of audio captioning.

Our study compares the alignment variants considered in our zero-shot audio captioning framework against the current state-of-the-art methods, which employ audio encoders trained in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner. Our results indicate that the alignment through contrastive learning without audiovisual distillation does not fully match distributions, compared to DALI.

Therefore $\\mathrm{DALI_{OT}^{A t t}}$ features can take more advantage of the combination with image tokens. We verify qualitatively this hypothesis in the Discussion paragraph below. Interestingly, both $\\mathrm{DALI}_{\\mathrm{OT}}$ and the contrastive backbone benefit from the audiovisual distillation. Given the relatively low-performance scores prior to the distillation process, it is plausible that they primarily learn from the image captioner (as the audiovisual pseudo captions tend to rely solely on visual features due to the inadequate audio representations) which is shown to be already performing well for audio captioning (first line of results). We hypothesize that the second stage is effective even for poorly aligned backbones because the distillation occurs on a subset of AudioSet where the images align well with the audio. If this distillation were applied to the entire dataset, the performance of these backbones might decline substantially. These hypotheses will require further investigation in future work.

The audio tracks in AudioCaps are sourced from AudioSet, thus the distribution of audio events resembles that of the data on which our models are trained. In contrast, Clotho\u2019s audios are sourced from FreeSound, a dataset distinct from AudioSet. Consequently, our model, having been trained solely on AudioSet\u2019s audio excerpts and images, may encounter unfamiliar concepts in Clotho, thereby testing its capacity for generalization.

The observed trends are consistent with those on AudioCaps where DALIMMD does not benefti from audiovisual distillation, while DALIAOtTt does.

We posit that the image bias inherent in DALIMMD becomes beneficial when confronted with out-of-distribution data.

Our comprehensive evaluation, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised zero-shot audio captioning. Remarkably, our approach, not using any audio recordings, not only matches but even sometimes, exceeds the performance of existing methods that rely on a backbone trained with extensive audio-text data such as CLAP.
