Existing methods either focus on domain adaptation (narrowing the gap between specific source and target domains) or domain generalization (building robust models applicable across various domains), but lack a unified solution. This paper introduces a groundbreaking universal method to address this limitation by efficiently mitigating the domain gap between 2D and 3D modalities.  This is achieved via effective usage of pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) which inherit target information and avoid unnecessary manipulation of the original visual space.\nThe proposed method, dubbed UniDSeg, introduces layer-wise learnable blocks to VFMs, alternately learning visual prompts (capturing 3D-to-2D transitional priors) and deep queries (constructing spatial tunability). This cross-modal learning framework significantly improves both domain adaptation and generalization performance across multiple datasets, showcasing superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. UniDSeg's universal approach provides a significant advancement in the field by offering a single method effective for various cross-domain 3D semantic segmentation tasks.", "affiliation": "Xiamen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "dDDc3iNZA7/podcast.wav"}
