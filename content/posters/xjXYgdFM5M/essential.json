Knowledge editing is a cost-effective way to update LLMs, but it often causes performance drops.  This happens due to two main factors: the diversity and complexity of the data being edited, and the changes in the internal structure of the model itself.  These issues are especially pronounced when multiple edits need to be made.\nTo solve this, the paper introduces Dump for Sequence (D4S), a novel method that aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sequence editing. D4S manages L1-norm growth in model layers during the editing process.  By doing so, it reduces the negative impact on the model's overall performance. The experiments showed that D4S successfully overcomes previous editing bottlenecks, allowing users to perform multiple effective edits and minimizing model damage. This work is valuable because it provides practical solutions for researchers to tackle real-world challenges in updating LLMs.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "xjXYgdFM5M/podcast.wav"}
