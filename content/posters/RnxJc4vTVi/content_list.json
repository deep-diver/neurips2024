In this paper, we investigate how to achieve stable and smooth skill chaining for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel skill chaining framework called Skill Chaining via Dual Regularization (SCaR). This framework applies dual regularization to sub-task skill pre-training and fine-tuning, which not only enhances the intra-skill dependencies within each sub-task skill but also reinforces the inter-skill dependencies between sequential sub-task skills, thus ensuring smooth skill chaining and stable long-horizon execution. We evaluate the SCaR framework on two representative long-horizon robotic manipulation simulation benchmarks: IKEA furniture assembly and kitchen organization. Additionally, we conduct a simple real-world validation in tabletop robot pick-and-place tasks.

For instance, in the robotic assembly of a stool (Fig. 1) involving two sub-tasks of leg installation, overall success is evaluated based on both the sequential installation success and factors affecting the assembly within environmental constraints. Although recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) show promise in training robots for such complex tasks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], managing long-horizon tasks with a scratch RL or IL policy remains challenging due to computational demands, extensive exploration, and intricate step dependencies [8, 9]. Skill chaining, which involves decomposing long-horizon tasks into smaller sub-tasks, pre-training skills for each, and executing them sequentially, offers a practical solution [10, 11]. However, as shown in Fig. 1(a)(b), such methods tend to fail when sub-task skills are insufficiently trained or unexpected states arise due to disturbances, especially when applied to high-degree-of-freedom robots performing contact-rich, long-horizon tasks.

We define the above two points as intra-skill dependencies between sequential actions within each sub-task skill and inter-skill dependencies between sequential sub-task skills, respectively. In this context, we propose a novel robotic skill chaining framework, Skill Chaining via Dual Regularization (SCaR). This framework enhances the aforementioned dependencies alternately through dual regularization during sub-task skill learning and chaining, aiming to provide stability for the execution of long-horizon robotic manipulation.

This process aims to reinforce the intra-skill dependencies, ensuring a coherent sequence of actions in each sub-task skill. Subsequently, bi-directional adversarial learning is introduced in the fine-tuning phase of SCaR for better chaining sequential sub-task skills. This mechanism uses bi-directional regularization to bring the terminal state of the current skill close to the initial state of its successor, and also to bring the initial state of the successor close to the terminal state of the current skill. This bi-directional alignment aims to reinforce robust inter-skill dependencies between sequential skills. Through the two innovative designs described, SCaR ensures coordination between the intra-skill and inter-skill dependencies, provides dual constraints for skill learning and skill chaining, as described in Fig. 1 (c), leading to a smooth skill chaining from the inside (within the sub-task skills) to the outside (between sub-task skills). Experimental results show that compared to scratch-training and skill chaining baselines, SCaR provides better task execution performance and stronger robustness to environmental perturbations in various long-horizon and contact-rich robotic manipulation simulation tasks.

However, these methods, while effective, often lead to a broad range of skill start and end states, a challenge in complex robotic manipulation tasks. T-STAR [15] is closely related to our work, addressing this by regularizing the learning process with a discriminator to control the expansion of the terminal state space. However, it focuses only on uni-directional dependencies between skills and ignores intra-skill dependencies within sub-task skills under longhorizon goals. Sequential Dexterity [17] centers on dexterous hand manipulation, introducing an optimization process to backpropagate long-term rewards across a policy chain. However, its scope still primarily emphasizes strengthening the dependencies between sub-task skills. GSC [37] attempts to solve skill chaining by employing diffusion models. It trains and chains primitive skills (pick, place, push, pull) through a Transformer-based skill diffusion model. However, due to the use of Transformer-based techniques, GSC requires high computational resources and cannot scale well to task environments with object-rich and contact-rich conditions. Our method instead employs simple and intuitive dual regularization constraints based on the lightweight policy network.

All methods are trained in each sub-task with 5 random seeds, 150 million environment steps, and evaluated with the average success rate over 100 testing episodes. As shown in the Fig. 5, in chair_ingolf and Extended Kitchen tasks, even with the increase of objects in the environment and the increase of unpredictable perturbations, our proposed adaptive skill learning learns good sub-task skills and consistently maintains a task success rate of more than $85\\%$ in all stages of the sub-task. In contrast, the PPO (only RL rewards), GAIL (only IL rewards), and Fixed-RL-IL (fixed RL and IL reward weights) baselines fail to maintain good sub-task success rates as the number of sub-task stages increases.

The PPO and GAIL baselines show minimal success on tasks with 4 and 5 sub-tasks, indicating the difficulty of learning complex multi-stage tasks solely from reward signals or expert demonstrations. The fixed RL-IL baseline, although improved compared to PPO and GAIL, mostly completed only one sub-task, which highlights the limitations of using fixed RL and IL reward weights in long-horizon tasks. While SkiMo achieves better success rates than model-free methods by building dynamic skill models, its performance remains inconsistent on long-horizon tasks due to its scratch learning nature. The performance of these scratch baselines demonstrates the importance of effective staged sub-task learning for long-horizon tasks. The results in Table 1 further highlight the superiority of the SCaR framework. By reinforcing intra- and inter-skill dependencies, task success rates are considerably higher than previous skill chaining approaches such as Policy Sequencing and T-STAR, which primarily address uni-directional inter-skill dependencies.

As shown in Table 1, without bi-directional regularization, SCaR w/o Bi experiences significant performance drops in tasks with more than two sub-tasks but still outperforms T-STAR. This is because SCaR w/o Bi maintains the adaptive scheduling of AES during sub-task skill learning, underscoring the importance of focusing on the intra-skill dependencies between successive actions. Similarly, the absence of AES regularization reduces SCaR w/o AES\u2019s performance, though it still maintains stable outcomes. This underscores the importance of reinforcing inter-skill dependencies on long-horizon tasks and reaffirms the contribution of bi-directional regularization. As shown in Table 2, SCaR w/o Bi, though slightly more robust than T-STAR due to the presence of AES, still faces challenges in adapting to perturbations and maintaining stable skill chaining because of its uni-directional finetuning limitations. SCaR w/o AES manages to maintain a certain level of performance stability under perturbations, thanks to bi-directional regularization, which ensures the bi-directional alignment of initial and terminal states between skills. The results show that the pre-trained skills via AES exhibit enhanced intra-skill dependencies within sub-tasks, and bi-directional regularization ensures stable long-horizon execution, even in the presence of perturbations, by reinforcing inter-skill dependencies.

As depicted in Fig. 6(a), SCaR achieves the highest success rates in all four tasks when $\\alpha\\,=\\,0.5$ , indicating a balance between RL and IL at the beginning of learning. When $\\alpha$ becomes smaller, emphasizing IL at the start, performance decreases more steeply. Conversely, as $\\alpha$ becomes larger, giving more weight to RL, performance also declines but at a slower rate. We also evaluate the impact of different sizes of expert datasets on three skill chaining methods: Policy Sequencing, T-STAR, and SCaR, specifically in the chair_ingolf task.

Another avenue worth exploring is applying our framework to real-world robotic furniture assembly tasks, rather than only staged pick-and-place tasks.
