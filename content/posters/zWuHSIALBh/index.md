### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as AI assistants, but they often generate false information, also known as hallucinations. This paper investigates why standard LLM alignment techniques fail to mitigate this issue.  The authors find that training on novel or unfamiliar knowledge, as well as reward functions that prioritize length, contributes to hallucination. 



To address this, they propose FLAME (Factual Alignment), an improved alignment method. FLAME uses factuality-aware supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. This approach focuses on ensuring factual accuracy while maintaining instruction-following ability. Their experiments show that FLAME significantly reduces hallucinations in LLMs without compromising helpfulness, suggesting a path to more reliable and trustworthy AI.

> This figure shows the trade-off between helpfulness and factuality of different large language models (LLMs).  Helpfulness is determined by the model's win rate against a baseline model (SFT + DPO) on the Alpaca Eval benchmark.  Factuality is measured using FACTSCORE on a biography generation task.  The size of each dot corresponds to the average length of the generated biographies, indicating a correlation between response length and the tendency to hallucinate.  The models shown include SFT (supervised fine-tuning), SFT + DPO (SFT with direct preference optimization), and RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback).  The figure highlights that while increasing helpfulness, standard alignment techniques can negatively affect factuality.

It compares the performance of several models: a pre-trained Llama 2 70B model (PT), a standard supervised fine-tuned model (SFT), a factuality-focused fine-tuned model (SFTfact), and a combined model (SFT).

### In-depth insights


#### Hallucination Causes
Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, generating false information.  This paper investigates the root causes of this phenomenon within the context of LLM alignment.  **The alignment process, while improving instruction-following, inadvertently exacerbates factual inaccuracies.** Two key stages are identified: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).  **SFT, by training on potentially novel information within human-generated responses, encourages hallucination.** The reward mechanisms in RL often prioritize length and detail, indirectly promoting the generation of fabricated information.  Addressing these issues requires a more factuality-aware approach, carefully curating training data and adjusting reward functions to prioritize factual accuracy.  **The study highlights the importance of recognizing that training on information unfamiliar to the LLM itself is a crucial factor contributing to hallucinations.**  This suggests that future alignment strategies should focus on enhancing the model's understanding of its existing knowledge base before introducing new, potentially unreliable information.

#### Factual Alignment
The concept of "Factual Alignment" in large language models (LLMs) tackles the critical issue of **hallucination**, where models generate factually incorrect information.  This problem is particularly challenging because conventional alignment methods, focused on instruction following and helpfulness, often inadvertently worsen factual accuracy.  **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**, a common technique, can introduce novel information that the LLM struggles to verify, leading to more hallucinations.  **Reinforcement learning (RL)**, often used after SFT, further complicates this by rewarding lengthier and more detailed responses, even when they are inaccurate.  Therefore, factual alignment requires a nuanced approach that directly addresses the root causes. This might involve carefully curating training data to avoid unfamiliar knowledge, modifying reward functions to prioritize factuality, and potentially incorporating methods to explicitly identify and correct factual inaccuracies within the model's generated outputs.  Ultimately, solving this challenge is crucial for making LLMs more reliable and trustworthy.

#### FLAME Method
The FLAME (FactuaLity-Aware AlignMEnt) method is a novel approach to improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the alignment process.  **It addresses the issue of LLMs generating false information (hallucinations)**, a common problem in current alignment techniques. FLAME's core innovation lies in its two-pronged approach: **factuality-aware supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** and **factuality-aware reinforcement learning (RL) through direct preference optimization (DPO)**. The SFT stage leverages the LLM's own pre-trained knowledge for fact-based instructions, preventing the introduction of unfamiliar information. The DPO stage utilizes separate rewards for factuality and instruction following, preventing reward hacking that often favors length over accuracy. **This dual-focus significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLMs without compromising their instruction-following capability.**  The method shows promising results in experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of a factuality-centric approach to LLM alignment.

#### Empirical Findings
The empirical findings section would likely present a detailed analysis of experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed FLAME model.  It would likely compare FLAME's performance against baseline models (standard alignment methods) across various metrics, such as factuality scores (FACTSCORE), instruction-following accuracy (Alpaca Eval), and possibly others like response length or helpfulness.  **Key findings would focus on demonstrating FLAME's effectiveness in improving factuality without significantly harming instruction-following ability.**  The analysis would likely delve into the model's performance on different types of instructions (fact-based vs. non-fact-based), revealing whether FLAME's benefits are consistent across various instruction categories.  Results from ablation studies investigating the impact of individual components of FLAME (e.g., factuality-aware SFT and DPO) would further clarify the contributions of each component to the overall performance.  The section would need to robustly address statistical significance and provide clear visualizations (charts, graphs) illustrating the experimental results to provide convincing evidence of FLAME's improvements.  **The results should showcase the superiority of FLAME over standard approaches in improving factual accuracy and maintaining instruction-following capabilities.**  Finally, the section could include qualitative analyses of generated responses, offering insightful examples that illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of FLAME.

#### Future Work
The paper's "Future Work" section would greatly benefit from exploring **multi-faceted reward models** that go beyond simple scalar rewards for instruction following and factuality.  A more nuanced approach incorporating additional dimensions like helpfulness, safety, and logical reasoning is crucial for comprehensive LLM alignment.  **Investigating the trade-offs** between these different aspects, especially given the limitations of current factuality metrics like FACTSCORE, is necessary. Further research should focus on **improving the accuracy of the fact-based instruction classifier** and creating a more robust factuality reward model.  Additionally, addressing the challenge of **hallucination in short-answer tasks**, which differs from long-form responses, requires dedicated attention.  Finally, a deeper investigation into the **alignment tax phenomenon** and how to improve both instruction-following capability and accuracy on standard knowledge benchmarks warrants further exploration.

> This figure illustrates the process of response generation using a pre-trained large language model (LLM) and the proposed factuality-aware alignment method. (a) shows the generation process with few-shot learning from the pre-trained model, where a small number of instructions and corresponding responses are used to guide the generation process. (b) illustrates the factuality-aware alignment, in which the LLM is trained to classify instructions as either fact-based or non-fact-based, with distinct training procedures for each type of instruction. For fact-based instructions, the model is trained on the responses generated by the pre-trained model to enhance factuality; whereas, for non-fact-based instructions, the model is trained on human-generated responses. This approach improves both the factuality and the instruction-following capability of the LLM.
