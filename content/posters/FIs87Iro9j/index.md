### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Face recognition struggles with low-resolution and long-range scenarios. Existing methods often require large intermediate representations or metadata, hindering compatibility with legacy systems and real-time applications.  They also struggle to generalize to large probe sets. 

ProxyFusion tackles these limitations. It uses a novel linear-time O(N) proxy-based sparse expert selection and pooling method. This is order-invariant, generalizes well, is compatible with legacy systems and has low parameter count, allowing for real-time inference. Experiments on IARPA BTS3.1 and DroneSURF datasets demonstrate ProxyFusion's superiority in unconstrained long-range face recognition.

The results are measured in terms of a certain metric (not specified in the snippet), with higher values indicating better performance.  By comparing the performance with and without the proxy loss for different values of K, we can assess the effectiveness of the proxy loss in enhancing the model's performance and identify the optimal number of selected experts.

### In-depth insights


#### Sparse Expert Fusion
Sparse expert fusion is a promising technique for aggregating facial features, particularly in challenging scenarios like low-resolution or long-range face recognition.  The core idea revolves around selecting a subset of the most relevant features (experts) rather than using all available features, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and improving efficiency.  This selection process often involves learning proxies to weigh feature importance, making the method **order-invariant** and **scalable**. The sparsity introduces efficiency benefits, enabling real-time inference suitable for resource-constrained environments.  **Improved generalization** to large probe sets and **compatibility with legacy biometric databases** that store pre-computed features represent additional advantages. However, careful consideration must be given to choosing the number of selected experts and the training process to balance performance gains against potential issues like overfitting or information loss.

#### Linear Time Complexity
Achieving linear time complexity in face feature fusion is a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large datasets.  Traditional methods often exhibit quadratic or even higher-order time complexity, limiting their scalability and real-time applicability. The ProxyFusion approach directly addresses this limitation by employing a **sparse expert selection mechanism**. Instead of processing all features, it strategically selects a subset of relevant features, resulting in a linear runtime that scales gracefully with the number of input features. This efficiency is crucial for handling the large probe sets encountered in unconstrained face recognition settings.  **Order invariance** further enhances practicality, as the algorithm's performance is not affected by the ordering of the input features, simplifying preprocessing.  The use of **learnable proxies** to implicitly capture relevant facial attributes contributes to the overall efficiency and effectiveness. This innovative strategy allows ProxyFusion to achieve both speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

#### Legacy Template Use
The concept of 'Legacy Template Use' in face recognition is crucial because it addresses the compatibility issue between modern algorithms and older, established biometric systems.  Many existing biometric databases store pre-computed features, often in formats incompatible with current deep learning approaches.  A system that can utilize these legacy templates without requiring extensive feature recalculation offers **significant advantages**: reduced processing time, lower computational costs, and ease of integration with existing infrastructure.  The challenge lies in effectively fusing these legacy features with potentially richer, more modern features while maintaining accuracy and robustness.  **Success hinges** on finding a method that can appropriately weight and combine diverse data sources, handling varying quality and informativeness of features from different origins.  This ultimately translates to a system that is more efficient, practical, and adaptable for real-world applications, and it underscores the importance of developing algorithms capable of working effectively with existing resources and databases.

#### Cross-Domain Matching
Cross-domain matching in face recognition addresses the challenge of matching faces captured under significantly different conditions, such as **low-resolution, long-range images** (probe set) with **high-resolution, close-range images** (gallery set).  This discrepancy in image quality and acquisition settings creates a substantial domain gap, hindering accurate matching.  Effective cross-domain matching techniques must learn robust feature representations that are invariant to these variations, focusing on identity-preserving features rather than those sensitive to imaging conditions.  **Addressing this gap is crucial for enhancing the reliability and scope of face recognition systems** in real-world applications.  Strategies may involve advanced deep learning architectures, domain adaptation methods, and careful selection of robust, discriminatory features.  Ultimately, robust cross-domain matching leads to systems capable of accurate and reliable face identification across a wide range of challenging scenarios.

#### ProxyFusion's Limits
ProxyFusion, while demonstrating strong performance in long-range, low-resolution face recognition, exhibits limitations.  Its reliance on **learnable proxies** for feature weighting, though efficient, might restrict its ability to capture intricate intra-set relationships that more complex attention mechanisms could handle. The model's performance depends on the quality of pre-extracted features, inheriting limitations from the face detection and recognition backbones. **Generalization to unseen domains** could be a challenge, as the learned proxies might not readily adapt to significantly different facial characteristics or imaging conditions.  Furthermore, while linear time complexity is achieved, the actual inference time still depends on the number of selected experts.  Therefore, even though ProxyFusion addresses many challenges, it would benefit from further development to expand its robustness and improve its ability to deal with highly variable and complex facial data.

The Expert Selection module uses learnable proxies to identify the most relevant expert networks for a given input feature set. These selected networks then generate set-centers, which are used to compute aggregation weights for the input features, producing a final aggregated representation.

Post feature extraction, our method is divided two end-to-end trainable stages: (i) Expert Selection and (ii) Sparse Expert Network Feature Aggregation. The Expert Selection module takes the {fi}_1 and returns the indices of expert networks based on proxy relevancy scores. Next, the selected expert networks compute set-centers conditioned on distribution and aligned proxy. These set-centers attend over the input feature set {fi}1 to compute aggregation weights.
