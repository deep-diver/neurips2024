Over the years, the IRL problem has consistently captured the attention of the research community (see, for instance, [4] and [1] for in-depth surveys). Indeed, this general scenario, where the reward function needs to be learned, emerges in numerous real-world applications. A example arises from human-in-the-loop settings [25], where the expert is a human solving a task, and an explicit specification of the human\u2019s goal in the form of a reward function is often unavailable. Notably, humans encounter difficulty in expressing their intentions in a numerical form, preferring instead to demonstrate what they perceive as the correct behavior.

In this scenario, racing car companies typically have access to a variety of drivers with diverse skills, including professionals, test drivers, and emerging talents from developmental programs. In this context, while the focus is typically on the reward function of professional drivers, we expect a proficient IRL method to effectively leverage demonstrations provided by drivers with lower expertise.

After providing the necessary background, we introduce the novel problem of Inverse Reinforcement Learning with multiple and sub-optimal experts (IRL-SE, Section 2). We then proceed by studying the theoretical properties of the class of reward functions that are compatible with a given set of experts under the assumption that an upper bound on the performance between a sub-optimal expert and the optimal expert is available to the designer of the IRL system (Section 3). Our findings indicate that having multiple sub-optimal experts can significantly shrink the set of compatible rewards, thereby mitigating the ambiguity issue that affects IRL. Leveraging our previous results, we continue by studying the statistical complexity of estimating the feasible reward set with a generative model (Section 4). To this end, after formally introducing a Probabilistic Approximately Correct [PAC, 9] framework, we derive a novel lower bound on the number of samples that are required to obtain an accurate estimate of the feasible reward set. Then, we present a uniform sampling algorithm and analyze its theoretical guarantees. Our results show that (i) the IRL problem with sub-optimal experts is statistically harder than the single expert IRL setting, and (ii) that the uniform sampling algorithm is minimax optimal whenever the sub-optimal experts\u2019 performance level is sufficiently close to the one of the optimal expert. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on existing works (Section 5) and by highlighting potential avenues for future research (Section 6).

", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Historically, solving an IRL problem [1] involves determining a reward function that is compatible with the behavior of an optimal expert. Since the seminal work of [26], the problem has been recognized as ill-posed, as multiple reward functions that satisfies this requirement exists [34]. For this reason, over the years, several algorithmic criteria have been introduced to address this ambiguity issue. These criteria includes maximum margin [30], Bayesian approaches [28], maximum entropy [37], and many others [e.g., 21, 23, 36]. More recently, a new line of works have circumvented the ambiguity issue by redefining the IRL task as the problem of estimating the entire feasible reward set [24, 19, 22]. In our work, we take this novel perspective, and, in this sense, this recent research strand is the most related to our document. Specifically, of particular interests is the work of [22]. In their work, the authors study, for the first time, lower bounds for the single-expert IRL problem in finite horizon settings. Furthermore, they show that uniform sampling algorithm is minimax optimal for this task. Nevertheless, it has to remarked that this recent strand of research focuses entirely on single expert problems. As we have shown, however, the extension to the multiple and sub-optimal experts setting requires non-trivial effort. The reason is that the feasible reward set significantly differ (see, e.g., Theorem 3.6), and the problem is harder from a statistical perspective (see, e.g., Theorem 4.1). ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Multiple and/or Sub-optimal Experts. The presence of multiple/sub-optimal experts has garnered attention in the Imitation Learning [IL, 11] community. In IL problems, contrary to IRL, the goal lies in directly leveraging demonstrations of optimal behavior to accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning algorithms. In this context, works that are close in spirit to ours are [17, 13, 6, 20]. Here, the authors extend the IL formulation to account for the fact that demonstrations are provided from multiple and/or sub-optimal experts. However, unlike our specific focus, their emphasis is on understanding how to effectively exploit imperfect demonstrations to improve training of RL agents. In our work, instead, we exploit the presence of sub-optimal experts to reduce the intrinsic ambiguity that affects the IRL formulation. In this sense, our work is complementary to several studies that analyzed how to improve the identifiability of the reward function in IRL problems by making additional structural assumptions. These include the possibility of observing an optimal expert interacting with several MDPs [e.g., 30, 3, 2] and focusing on peculiar types of MDPs that allows for strong theoretical guarantees [e.g., 8, 15, 5]. Along this line of work, the most related to ours is [32]. Here, the authors study how the presence of multiple experts impact the identifiability of the reward function. Contrary to our work, however, the authors assume each expert to follow an entropy regularized objective and, furthermore, they focus on the case in which all experts act optimally in the underlying environment. In this sense, our work encompasses a wider spectrum of applications, as we do not require optimality for each of the expert, nor an entropy regularized objective. Furthermore, it has to be remarked that the multiple expert setting and IRL have been studied in [18] with the goal of providing practical algorithms that can be used in realworld applications. Also in this scenario, each expert is assumed to act optimally in the underlying domain. Finally, our work is related to approaches that aimed at extracting a single reward function by leveraging possibly sub-optimal demonstrations [e.g., 35, 16, 12, 29].
