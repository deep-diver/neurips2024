It consists of two main modules: a rotations module and a segments module. The rotations module predicts multiple possible sequences of segment rotations (K hypotheses), each with an associated likelihood score.  The segments module estimates the lengths of the segments, which are shared across all hypotheses. The pose decoder combines these rotation sequences and segment lengths to generate K consistent 3D pose hypotheses, ensuring that all predicted poses respect human anatomy and are consistent. The output is the K hypotheses of the 3D poses and their corresponding likelihood scores.", "section": "3 ManiPose"}, {"figure_path": "xxY8d4rnSb/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Pose decoder overview.", "description": "The figure shows the process of pose decoding in ManiPose.
