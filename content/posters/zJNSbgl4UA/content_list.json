Thus, we propose a general framework, named Scala, to enable a single network to represent multiple smaller ViTs with flexible inference capability, which aligns with the inherent design of ViT to vary from widths. Concretely, Scala activates several subnets during training, introduces Isolated Activation to disentangle the smallest sub-network from other subnets, and leverages Scale Coordination to ensure each sub-network receives simplified, steady, and accurate learning objectives. Comprehensive empirical validations on different tasks demonstrate that with only one-shot training, Scala learns slimmable representation without modifying the original ViT structure and matches the performance of Separate Training.

In contrast, to tailor ViTs to run on devices with limited resources, some recent progress [36, 35] utilize knowledge distillation [13] to scale down ViT. Particularly, DeiT [29] introduces two smaller variants of DeiT-B: DeiT-Ti and DeiT-S which have been widely used in resource-limited applications. Although these small ViTs exhibit enhanced efficiency, they lack the flexibility to implement customized adjustments that accommodate dynamically changing resource constraints in real-world scenarios, e.g., the computation budget of mobile phones depends on the energy level (low-power mode) and number of running apps. Consequently, the standard Separate Training (ST) protocol trains models with different sizes separately to provide a spectrum of options with diversified performance and computation. ST requires repetitive training procedures to produce multiple model choices, and the challenge is amplified for foundation models [26, 24, 17]. From users\u2019 perspective, they are only offered limited model choices, that might not cater to all scenarios.

This suggests that a large ViT can be transformed to represent small models by uniformly slicing the weight matrix at each layer. Given a width ratio $r$ , we adjust the size of the network by this single hyperparameter, allowing a single ViT to represent multiple small variants with the weights of those sub-networks shared in a nested nature, e.g., ViT-B $(r{=}0.25)$ equals ViT-Ti and ViT-B $(r{=}0.5)$ corresponds to ViT-S. In this manner, we empower ViTs for flexible inference capability, and we aim to slice a ViT within a broad slicing bound and fine-grained slicing granularity so that the diversity and number of sub-networks can be ensured for higher flexibility. This problem is non-trivial as fully training all the sub-networks within a constrained budget is nearly infeasible. Consequently, it is quite challenging for these subnets to match the performance of separate training.

(2) slicing granularity: recent width slicing approaches [14, 18] either slice specific portions of the network or utilize a considerably large slicing granularity, leading to a limited number of models produced.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is crucial to note the fundamental differences between slicing CNN and ViT: (1) vanilla small ViTs such as ViT-Ti/S/B, are inherently designed to vary based on widths, aligning with our approach. Conversely, many CNNs are structured to vary from depths, like ResNet-18/34 [12], and slicing them by width brings unconventional architectures. (2) slimmable CNN necessitates calibration [39, 37] for each sub-network pre-inference due to Batch Normalization [15], unlike slimmable ViTs that can be directly utilized for evaluation. (3) the transformer architecture [33] has wider applications than CNN in this era, e.g., MAE [11], CLIP [26], DINOv2 [24], LLMs [31, 32, 1]. Nevertheless, ViTs have much less image-specific inductive bias than CNN and their slimmable ability remains unclear.

To resolve these issues, we propose a general framework, named Scala, to enforce ViTs to learn slimmable representation. Specifically, we propose Isolated Activation to disentangle the representation of the smallest subnetwork from other subnets while still preserving the lower bound performance.

In this way, the delivered system can make tailored adjustments that accommodate dynamically changing resource constraints in real-world scenarios, promising the application on edge devices.

The derivation of multiple smaller models from a single network has been previously explored but most works focus on the CNN structure. Slimmable Networks [39, 37] and its variants [34, 3, 10] train a shared network which adapts the width to accommodate the resource constraints during inference. Later, this idea is adapted into two-stage NAS methods [2, 38, 4] for supernet training. The supernet is scaled at multiple dimensions with a small computation change, in contrast to our work where we only scale the width dimension with a large scaling bound. SN-Net [25] is a recently proposed method that constructs a supernet with several pre-trained models and inserts linear layers to build dynamic routes for flexible inference. Recently, several of these techniques have been extended to Transformer architecture [14, 18], while they either scale part of the network or the scaling granularity is large which means they could only deliver very few models in the end. Differing from the previous works, our method is the first work to scale the ViT structure with large scaling bound and small scaling granularity which is intrinsically a more challenging problem.

Although the intermediate sub-networks are optimized less frequently compared to Separate Training (ST), US-Net manages to achieve comparable performance with ST on the CNN architecture.
