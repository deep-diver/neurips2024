### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel at scalability but lack flexibility for resource-constrained environments.  Existing methods train separate smaller ViTs, increasing costs and memory. This work demonstrates that smaller ViTs are intrinsically sub-networks of larger ones. 



The paper introduces Scala, a framework that trains a single network to represent multiple smaller ViTs.  Key techniques include 'Isolated Activation' to disentangle the smallest sub-network and 'Scale Coordination' to optimize training. Results show Scala matches performance of separately trained models, offering significant improvements in efficiency and resource usage. This **flexible inference capability** is achieved through **one-shot training**, making it a significant step towards practical ViT deployment in resource-limited settings.

> This figure illustrates three different ways to slice a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. The first method, irregular slicing, leads to non-standard architectures. In contrast, uniform slicing is aligned with the intrinsic design of ViTs. The figure highlights that smaller ViTs (ViT-Ti, ViT-S) are essentially sub-networks of a larger ViT (ViT-B).

> This table compares the performance of Scala against three different baseline methods (AutoFormer, US-Net, and Separate Training) for different width ratios (r = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00) on the ImageNet-1K dataset.  The metrics shown include accuracy (Acc1) and GFLOPs.  The table highlights Scala's superior performance compared to the baselines, particularly at smaller width ratios, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.  Separate Training serves as a strong baseline, representing a fully optimized model trained separately for each size.  Autoformer and US-Net are other state-of-the-art width-adjustable models.





### In-depth insights


#### ViT Slimmability
The concept of "ViT Slimmability" explores the ability to efficiently reduce the size of Vision Transformers (ViTs) without significant performance degradation.  **Smaller ViTs are crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices**, such as mobile phones or edge computing platforms.  However, simply shrinking a pre-trained ViT often leads to substantial performance drops. This is because **ViTs, unlike CNNs, exhibit minimal interpolation ability**, meaning that the performance of intermediate-sized ViTs cannot be reliably predicted from the performance of the largest and smallest versions. The challenges lie in the shared weight matrices across different widths. Directly reducing the width can disrupt the intricate relationships between network layers and thus affect accuracy.  **Effective approaches must address the training optimization challenges associated with managing multiple sub-networks** simultaneously, as each smaller ViT is a sub-network within a larger model. Techniques like isolated activation and scale coordination could be employed to promote efficient training and avoid negative interference between sub-networks of differing sizes.

#### Scala Framework
The Scala framework, proposed for flexible inference in Vision Transformers, addresses the challenge of training multiple smaller ViTs efficiently.  **Instead of separate training**, which is computationally expensive, Scala trains a single, larger network that encompasses smaller sub-networks.  This is achieved through **uniform width slicing**, leveraging the inherent scalability of ViTs.  **Key mechanisms** within Scala include Isolated Activation to prevent interference between sub-networks, and Scale Coordination to ensure each sub-network receives well-defined and stable learning objectives.  These components aim to improve the slimmable representation learning and allow inference with different model sizes without retraining.  **The evaluation demonstrates** that Scala matches the performance of separate training with far less computational overhead, offering a significant advancement for efficient deployment of ViTs in resource-constrained settings.

#### Isolated Activation
The concept of "Isolated Activation" presents a novel approach to training slimmable vision transformers.  The core idea revolves around **decoupling the smallest sub-network's representation from its larger counterparts** during training. This is crucial because constantly activating the smallest network in standard methods hinders the optimization of other, larger sub-networks that share weights.  By isolating the smallest network, it ensures the lower bound performance is maintained, while simultaneously allowing the other sub-networks the freedom to train more effectively. **This disentanglement is achieved through a clever weight-slicing technique** where weights are sliced differently for the smallest network compared to others.  This innovative method of training directly addresses the minimal interpolation ability commonly observed in vision transformers, preventing the optimization of intermediate subnets from falling short compared to separate training. The result is a framework where a single network can effectively represent multiple smaller variants, leading to flexible inference capabilities and significantly improved efficiency.

#### Scale Coordination
The proposed "Scale Coordination" training strategy in the paper aims to address the challenge of training multiple sub-networks within a single ViT model efficiently and effectively.  The core idea is to ensure each sub-network (representing different ViT sizes) receives simplified, steady, and accurate learning objectives, thereby improving the overall performance and reducing the need for separate training. This is achieved through three key techniques: **Progressive Knowledge Transfer**, which leverages the predictions from larger sub-networks to guide the learning of smaller ones; **Stable Sampling**, which carefully controls the width ratios during training to maintain a stable learning process; and **Noise Calibration**, which mitigates the impact of noisy signals from the teacher networks by combining KL divergence and Cross-Entropy loss.  In essence, Scale Coordination is a clever training optimization that enables the efficient and effective creation of a slimmable ViT model, allowing for flexible inference while maintaining comparable or even surpassing the performance of separately trained models.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on slicing Vision Transformers for flexible inference could focus on several key areas.  **Improving the interpolation ability of ViTs** remains crucial, as this work highlights the challenges in directly applying existing CNN-based techniques.  Investigating novel training methodologies or architectural modifications to enhance the interpolation capabilities would be highly valuable.  Another important direction involves **exploring different slicing strategies**, potentially moving beyond uniform slicing to incorporate more nuanced approaches that better accommodate the inherent structure of ViTs.  **Extending the framework to other transformer-based architectures** beyond vision transformers would also broaden the impact of this work. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the trade-offs between inference speed and accuracy, as achieved via different slicing granularity and bounding, is needed.  Finally, addressing the computational cost of training by improving the efficiency of the Scala framework, perhaps through more sophisticated sampling strategies or more effective knowledge distillation methods, warrants further research.

> This figure compares the performance of US-Net, a method for creating slimmable neural networks, on both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).  It evaluates the ability of these networks to generalize to unseen width ratios (i.e., network sizes not seen during training). The results show that CNNs exhibit good interpolation and extrapolation capabilities, meaning that their performance remains relatively consistent even when tested at network widths that differ from those used during training. In contrast, ViTs show minimal interpolation ability. This indicates that ViTs are not easily generalized to unseen width ratios, implying challenges in creating efficient and flexible ViT models.
