Researchers often use machine learning to analyze such data, hoping to estimate causal effects like treatment effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, this paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that many common choices in machine learning pipelines can lead to biased estimates of causal effects, even in simple RCT settings. This is because standard machine learning approaches focus on prediction accuracy which is not a proxy for causal inference. \nTo address these issues, the paper introduces ISTAnt, the first real-world benchmark dataset for causal inference tasks on high-dimensional observations.  It uses a study on ant behavior to showcase how various design choices significantly affect the accuracy of causal estimates.  A synthetic benchmark is also provided to confirm the results in a controlled environment. The work provides guidelines for designing future benchmarks and representation learning methods to more accurately answer causal questions in the sciences.", "affiliation": "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "Iq2IAWozNr/podcast.wav"}
