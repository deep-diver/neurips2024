However, existing methods often utilize iterative message-passing across temporal and spatial dimensions, resulting in substantial information loss and high computational cost. We provide a theoretical analysis revealing that such iterative models are susceptible to data and graph sparsity, causing unstable performances on different datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel method named One-step Propagation and Confidence-based Refinement (OPCR). In the first stage, OPCR leverages inherent spatial and temporal relationships by employing a sparse attention mechanism. These modules propagate limited observations directly to the global context through one-step imputation, which is theoretically affected only by data sparsity. Following this, we assign confidence levels to the initial imputations by correlating missing data with valid data. This confidencebased propagation refines the separate spatial and temporal imputation results through spatio-temporal dependencies. We evaluate the proposed model across various downstream tasks involving highly sparse spatio-temporal data. Empirical results indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

In real world, the acquisition of spatio-temporal data often faces practical constraints, leading to missing observations. Incomplete data undermines the reliability and effectiveness of subsequent tasks, necessitating robust imputation techniques. However, the existing spatio-temporal works effort addresses temporal missing (i.e., point-level missing), which is usually caused by inevitable device failure. Beyond that, spatial missing (i.e., node-level missing) becomes a burning issue. For example, in a traffic scenario, the management will not deploy dense traffic sensors to reduce costs. Therefore, exploring spatially sparse data not only makes the best use of available data but also lowers the barriers to implementing spatio-temporal models in real scenarios. In view of the gap, Traffic4cast 2022 (T4C22) competition [2] presented sparse traffic data collected in real urban road networks. Specifically, the competition considered three cities, where sensors are deployed sparsely, i.e. spatial and point missing co-exist.

Therefore, for highly sparse large-scale data, iterative methods suffer from information loss and error accumulation. To address these issues, we propose a sparse attention-based one-step imputation and confidence-based refinement approach. In the first stage, we propagate information from observed data to all missing data directly, leveraging inherent spatial and temporal correlations.

For graph data, a simple idea is propagating known features to missing data through the graph structure. For example Feature propagation (FP) [3] iteratively aggregates neighboring node features and PCFI [4] further considered pseudo-confidence to propagate messages more accurately. It is clear that GNN can capture spatial relations better.

Nonetheless, PriSTI employs two separate attention modules to incrementally aggregate temporal and spatial dependencies, which leads to decoupling the spatio-temporal context. Additionally, PriSTI uses linear interpolation for coarse conditional information, which is inadequate for spatially missing data.

For the tabular and graph imputation baselines, their performance remains relatively consistent across datasets with spatial and point missing. This can be easily understood, as these baselines only utilize or fail to utilize spatial structure. The time-series imputation baselines are not suitable for spatial missing, as they solely rely on temporal information.

Therefore, the error accumulation and information loss during iterative process lead to their poor performance. For the inductive baseline IGNNK, it converts the original task to smaller-scale spatio-temporal series via sampling sub-graphs. The effectiveness of IGNNK proves that there are correlations between all nodes, which is consistent with our motivation. However, this sampling strategy still ignores some of the valid information. Therefore, considering the problem of error accumulation in autoregressive methods, some diffusion-based models have been proposed, such as CSDI [9] and PriSTI [13]. It is still challenging for CSDI to model a high-dimensional time series in the large-scale dataset. However, it show performance improvement on the traffic dataset compared to other temporal baselines (i.e., BRITS and SAITS).

PoGeVon [14] is proposed to deal with specific data where attribute-missing and structure-missing co-exist. Therefore, it show worse imputation performances than other spatio-temporal baselines.

In the first stage, we rapidly propagate useful information to all missing data through a sparse attention mechanism that makes full use of limited observations. To eliminate the bias caused by independent temporal and spatial modeling, we propose assigning confidence to imputation results and achieving more accurate spatio-temporal message-passing. We evaluate the imputation and prediction performances of the proposed OPCR on a dataset of different scales. The experimental results illustrate our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. There are several interesting future directions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
