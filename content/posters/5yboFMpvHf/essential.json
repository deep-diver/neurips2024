Existing methods struggle to effectively transfer knowledge between diverse client and server models, leading to performance limitations and high resource consumption.  This often results in suboptimal model performance, especially when dealing with variations in client model structures and data distributions.\n\nThe proposed FedMRL framework overcomes these issues by introducing adaptive representation fusion and multi-granularity representation learning.  It adds a shared, homogeneous auxiliary model to each client's heterogeneous model; their features are fused and used to build Matryoshka representations which are then learned by the shared and local models respectively. This approach greatly improves knowledge transfer.  Experimental results show FedMRL achieves significantly higher accuracy than existing methods with reduced communication and computational overheads, showcasing its potential for efficient and privacy-preserving FL in diverse settings.", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, TMCC, SysNet, DISSec, GTIISC, Nankai University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "5yboFMpvHf/podcast.wav"}
