Dashed lines are underlying processes, dots are observations sampled with errors, solid red curves are imputations, and solid orange curves are learned derivatives.", "description": "This figure illustrates the SAND (Self-Attention on Derivatives) pipeline. It starts with a vanilla transformer that produces an initial imputation.  The SAND module then takes this initial imputation and calculates its derivative using the Diff operator. The resulting derivative is then integrated using the Intg operator to produce a smoother, refined imputation. The figure visually depicts how the SAND module refines the initial, often noisy imputation, resulting in a smoother curve that better fits the underlying data.", "section": "3.2 Self-attention on derivative"}]
