Existing methods struggle with imbalanced representation of different scene elements and the ambiguity of monocular images, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially for smaller objects. \nThis paper tackles these issues with a novel approach. It reformulates PASS as two sub-problems: segmentation of over-sampled (planar) and under-sampled segments. It then uses joint optimization with depth estimation to enhance the over-sampled segments and a transformer-based context module to integrate different geometric representations (including a novel 'vertical relative distance' feature) for under-sampled segments.  The resulting hybrid decoder achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "MAXST", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "diYnEYUbIU/podcast.wav"}
