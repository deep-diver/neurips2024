The synthesis component trains a ReLU Neural Control Barrier Function (NCBF) using a novel regularizer to reduce the number of activation regions at the safety boundary. The verification component efficiently verifies the safety of the synthesized NCBF by exploiting tight over-approximations of the safety conditions.  The figure shows a feedback loop between the two components: counterexamples found during verification are used to refine the training dataset, improving the quality and efficiency of the overall process.", "section": "3 Synthesis"}, {"figure_path": "nWMqQHzI3W/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the Efficient Exact Verifier for ReLU NCBFs", "description": "This figure presents a flowchart illustrating the efficient exact verification process for ReLU Neural Control Barrier Functions (NCBFs). It starts by enumerating boundary hyperplanes and hinges using a breadth-first search algorithm. Then, it proceeds hierarchically through verification stages.  First, it checks sufficient conditions; if these fail, it moves to computationally more expensive exact verification steps.  The process continues until either a safety guarantee is proven or a counterexample is found.  Each stage uses efficient algorithms to reduce computational costs.", "section": "4 Verification"}, {"figure_path": "nWMqQHzI3W/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Effects of boundary regularization (r) on activation sets along the boundary. The figures show the results from a neural network with 4 layers of 8 hidden units, applied to the Spacecraft case. The surface represents the first two dimensions with the last four dimensions fixed at 0. Increasing r results in more organized boundary activation sets.", "description": "This figure visualizes the impact of the boundary regularization hyperparameter (r) on the organization of activation sets near the decision boundary of a neural network. Two 3D plots show the activation patterns for r=0 and r=50. Increasing r leads to a more structured and less fragmented pattern, indicating improved efficiency in the verification process.", "section": "3.2 Loss Function Design and NCBF Training"}]
