Existing methods often rely on enumerating all activation regions near the safety boundary, leading to high computational costs and scalability issues. \nThe SEEV framework tackles this by introducing a novel regularizer that reduces the number of activation regions at the safety boundary during NCBF synthesis, and a verification algorithm that leverages tight over-approximations to efficiently verify each piecewise-linear segment.  This results in **significantly improved verification efficiency** while maintaining the quality of the NCBFs, demonstrated through simulations on various benchmark systems.", "affiliation": "Washington University in St. Louis", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Safety"}, "podcast_path": "nWMqQHzI3W/podcast.wav"}
