Figure 7 (b) demonstrates that the absence of stochastic-step numerical gradient estimation hinders the model\u2019s ability to form arbitrary topologies, leading to incorrect surfaces.

For methods that do use prior knowledge, we do something similar to MonoSDF. We first crop the images to $1152\\times1152$ , then downsample them to $384\\times384$ before feeding them into the Omnidata model [6] to predict geometry cues. First, we scale the pose to be centered within a bounding sphere of radius equal to 1. Subsequently, we scale the camera pose by 0.8 to ensure that all scene boundaries are contained within the bounding sphere. We apply the marching cubes algorithm to a cube with dimensions -1 to 1 at a resolution of 2048.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
