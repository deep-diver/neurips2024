The left side of the red line in each subplot shows the smoothed posterior, which represents the model's estimate of the system's state during the observation window. The right side shows predictions made by unrolling the learned dynamics from the end of the observed data.  The figure highlights that while several methods perform comparably at smoothing, XFADS significantly outperforms them in predictive accuracy, as measured by the R-squared (R2) value.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Ln8ogihZ2S/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: a) Empirical time complexity scaling.
