Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model\u2019s robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "We present the following critical contributions to establish AnyFit as a novel VTON paradigm, which adeptly addresses the challenge of any combination of attire across any conceivable scenario, in Fig. 1. AnyFit mainly consists of two isomorphic U-Nets, namely HydraNet and MainNet. The former is tasked with extracting fine-grained clothing features, while the latter is responsible for generating try-ons. (1) Scalability: A hallmark of AnyFit is its innovative introduction of the Hydra Encoding Block that only parallelizes attention matrices within a sharing HydraNet, enabling effortless expansion to any quantity of conditions with only $8\\%$ increase in parameters for each additional branch. The proposal of parallelizing these blocks is built on the insight that only the self-attention layers are crucial for implicit warping (50), while the remaining components primarily serve as generic feature extractors. We further invent Hydra Fusion Block to seamlessly integrate the features of Hydra Encoding into MainNet, with positional embeddings to distinguish encodings from different sources. It is important to note that ReferenceNet (26; 9) or GarmentNet (50) could be seen as specific instances of HydraNet when limited to a single condition. (2) Robustness: Observations indicate a noticeable reduction in the robustness and quality of images generated by existing Virtual Try-On (VTON) works, in comparison to the original stable diffusion performances. Inspired by discussions in the community (2), we present the Prior Model Evolution strategy. This innovative approach involves merging parameter variations within a model family (e.g., a collection of fine-tuned versions of SDXL (41)), enabling the independent evolution of multiple capabilities of the base model. This strategy emerges as an intuitively logical and highly effective method for amplifying the model\u2019s innate potential prior to training. This is particularly relevant when contending with the significant escalation in training costs associated with dual U-Nets\u2014an aspect that is overlooked in previous research. Furthermore, we introduce the Adaptive Mask Boost to further enhance the fti of the attire as a bonus. It requires length augmentation of parsing-free mask regions during the training phase, allowing the model to autonomously understand the overall shape of the clothing, which emancipates the model from previous reliance on hints of masks derived from garments. During inference, we adapt the shape of the mask area based on the aspect ratio of the target garment, thereby markedly encouraging the generation of well-ftited try-ons, particularly for long garments (e.g., windbreaker).

To execute this task, numerous works (17; 30; 34; 6; 14; 22) have utilized Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (19) with two-stage strategy (35; 18; 52): (1) warping the clothing to the desired shape (7; 36) and (2) fusing the deformed clothing via try-on generator based on GAN. HR-VITON (35) conducts both warping and segmentation concurrently to address issues related to body occlusion and misfti of garments. GP-VTON (49) introduces localized warping along with global parsing to independently simulate the deformation of different regions of clothing, aiming to achieve a more form-fitting result.

When dealing with multi-garment VTON, a direct method might involve replicating multiple garment encoding nets to manage different conditions. This approach, however, would lead to a significant increase in the number of parameters, rendering it computationally prohibitive. Experimentally we discover that for conditions with similar content (such as different types of clothing), the self-attention module plays a vital role in the latent warping of the garments, aligning them with the locations requiring inpainting. Conversely, other network architectures, which typically tasked with general feature extraction, can be shared across different condition encoding branches without compromising the model\u2019s performance. In view of this, we innovatively propose HydraNet for multi-condition encoding. It operates based on a shared Unet structure, while parallelizing the attention modules according to the number of input conditions, thereby constructing Hydra Encoding Blocks. Specifically, we parallelize the self-attention matrices with identical initial weights, and feed the multi-condition key and value features zihk, zihv into MainNet, which encode the fine-grained details of the clothing.

Leveraging the DressCode dataset (16), which includes upper and lower garment data as well as full-body model images, we set out to construct the DressCode-multiple dataset, consisting of triplets, as illustrated in Fig. 14. Assuming we start with the upper garment data, where we already have a flat lay upper garment image and a model image wearing the corresponding upper garment, we use human parsing techniques (28; 29) to roughly segment the lower garment portion and extract it from the model image to serve as the corresponding lower garment image. At this point, the triplet consists of (flat lay upper, cropped lower, model image). Similarly, triplets derived from the lower garment data result in a composition of (cropped upper, flat lay lower, model image). Using this approach, we construct 24,314 publicly available upper-lower triplets by cropping garments from the 15,363 upper-body pairs and 8,951 lower-body pairs for training. For testing, we take the flat-laid garments from the upper and lower garment test sets, shuffle them, and combine them randomly, pairing them with the test models from the upper garment data to create (flat lay upper, flat lay lower, model image) configurations for unpaired, real-world multi-garment virtual try-on tests.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
