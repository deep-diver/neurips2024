However, current YOLO models rely on Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), a post-processing step that hinders end-to-end deployment and impacts inference latency.  Moreover, design inefficiencies within various components of YOLO models limit their potential for performance improvement.\nThis paper introduces YOLOv10, addressing these limitations.  **YOLOv10 uses a novel training method that eliminates the need for NMS, significantly boosting speed**. It also employs a holistic design strategy that comprehensively optimizes various model components, leading to improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments showing state-of-the-art performance across various model scales, exceeding other models in speed and efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "tz83Nyb71l/podcast.wav"}
