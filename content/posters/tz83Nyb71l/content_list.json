Although achieving superior end-to-end performance under NMS-free training, we observe that there still exists the performance gap compared with the original one-to-many training using NMS, as shown in Tab. 3 and Tab. 1. Besides, we note that the gap diminishes as the model size increases. Therefore, we reasonably concludes that such a gap can be attributed to the limitations in the model capability. Notably, unlike the original one-to-many training using NMS, the NMS-free training necessitates more discriminative features for one-to-one matching. In the case of the YOLOv10-N model, its limited capacity results in extracted features that lack sufficient discriminability, leading to a more notable performance gap of $1.0\\%$ AP. In contrast, the YOLOv10-X model, which possesses stronger capability and more discriminative features, shows no performance gap between two training strategies. In Fig. 4, we visualize the average cosine similarity of each anchor point\u2019s extracted features with those of all other anchor points on the COCO val set. We observe that as the model size increases, the feature similarity between anchor points exhibits a downward trend, which benefits the one-to-one matching.

Then, we substitute the predicted category score with instance labels, resulting in Pvwa/lo c with no classification errors. Similarly, we replace the predicted locations with those of instances, yielding Pvwa/lo r with no regression errors. As shown in Tab. 6, APvwa/lo r is much higher than APvwa/lo , revealing that eliminating the regression errors achieves greater improvement. The performance bottleneck thus lies more in the regression task. Therefore, adopting the lightweight classification head can allow higher efficiency without compromising the performance. \u2022 Spatial-channel decoupled downsampling. We decouple the downsampling operations for efficiency, where the channel dimensions are first increased by pointwise convolution (PW) and the resolution is then reduced by depthwise convolution (DW) for maximal information retention.

A dual label assignments way is designed to provide rich supervision by one-to-many branch during training and high efficiency by one-to-one branch during inference.

Based on the above approaches, we introduce YOLOv10, a new real-time end-to-end object detector.

For example, in YOLOv10-N and YOLOv10-S, the performance of one-to-many training with NMS outperforms that of NMS-free training by $1.0\\%$ AP and $0.5\\%$ AP, respectively.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
