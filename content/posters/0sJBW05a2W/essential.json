Existing methods struggle with accuracy in cluttered scenes due to difficulties in establishing accurate global correspondences between the model and scene point clouds. These methods typically rely on a two-stage approach: global correspondence finding and then clustering to locate individual instances.\nThis paper introduces 3DFMNet, a novel two-stage network that addresses these issues. The first stage employs a 3D multi-object focusing module to locate object centers and generate proposals. The second stage uses a 3D dual-masking instance matching module to estimate the pose between the model and each proposal.  This approach drastically improves accuracy by simplifying the problem, and extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Scan2CAD and ROBI benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "0sJBW05a2W/podcast.wav"}
