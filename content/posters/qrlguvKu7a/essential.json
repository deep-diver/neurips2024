Existing acceleration methods often struggle with poor sampling quality or require unstable training procedures, such as adversarial training.  Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and high-quality method to speed up the process.\nPeRFlow addresses these challenges through a novel piecewise reflow operation that straightens the sampling trajectories. By dividing the sampling into smaller time windows, PeRFlow avoids lengthy computational costs associated with simulating entire trajectories. This innovative approach enables fast and high-quality image generation with high compatibility across various diffusion model pipelines. PeRFlow demonstrates superior results compared to existing methods in terms of FID scores, image quality, and generation diversity. The method's plug-and-play nature also simplifies its integration into different workflows.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "qrlguvKu7a/podcast.wav"}
