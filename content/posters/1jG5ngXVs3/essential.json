This paper tackles this issue by introducing FlowTurbo, a framework designed to accelerate the sampling process while maintaining or even improving the quality of generated images.  The core problem is that existing samplers for flow-based models rely on traditional numerical methods that are not very efficient.\nFlowTurbo's key innovation is a lightweight velocity refiner that leverages the observation that the velocity predictions in flow-based models become stable during the sampling process. This allows the model to estimate the velocity more efficiently.  Additionally, FlowTurbo introduces several other techniques such as a pseudo corrector and sample-aware compilation to further speed up the process.  The results demonstrate that FlowTurbo can significantly accelerate various tasks like image generation and editing, achieving real-time performance with state-of-the-art image quality.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "1jG5ngXVs3/podcast.wav"}
