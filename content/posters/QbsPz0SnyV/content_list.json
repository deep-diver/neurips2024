A core reason for modality imbalance is that the models of each modality converge at different rates. Many attempts naturally focus on adjusting learning procedures adaptively. Essentially, the reason why models converge at different rates is because the difficulty of ftiting category labels is inconsistent for each modality during learning. From the perspective of fitting labels, we find that appropriate positive intervention label ftiting can correct this difference in learning ability. By exploiting the ability of contrastive learning to intervene in the learning of category label ftiting, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach that dynamically integrates unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised multimodal learning to address the modality imbalance problem. We find that a simple yet heuristic integration strategy can significantly alleviate the modality imbalance phenomenon. Moreover, we design a learning-based integration strategy to integrate two losses dynamically, further improving the performance.

Concretely, there commonly exists dominant modality and non-dominant modality in heterogeneous multimodal data. Multimodal learning usually adopts a uniform objective.

We carry out a simple experiment on KineticsSounds dataset to seek answers. We adopt two types of labels to explore the influence of ftiting labels. The first type is one-hot labels which indicate the category of each sample, where the loss is denoted as $L_{S}$ . The second type is label free, i.e., uniform label $1/c$ for all samples, where $c$ denotes the number of categories. The second loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{U}}$ . Furthermore, we define a mixed loss $0.7L_{\\mathrm{S}}+0.3L_{\\mathrm{U}}$ , which is actually the label smoothing [35] strategy, by combining one-hot labels and uniform labels.

The experiment inspires us that appropriate intervention label ftiting can alleviate the difference in the learning ability of different modalities. In this way, we can reduce the modality performance gap and further mitigate the modality imbalance phenomenon as the smaller the difference in modality performance, the less severe the modality imbalance [39, 20, 52].

Contrastive learning aims to learn similar representations for data pairs of different modalities [12], thus aligning the multimodal representations for all modalities.

OGM [31] utilizes an on-the-fly gradient modulation strategy to control the modality\u2019s optimization procedure.

The results are shown in Table 3, where the \u201cCL\u201d and \u201cDI\u201d denote that whether the contrastive learning and dynamic integration are applied during training. The unimodal MAP results are based on audio and video modalities for KineticsSounds and CREMA-D datasets, and unimodal F1 results are based on image and text modalities for Sarcasm and Twitter2015 datasets. Please note that dynamic integration depends on the contrastive learning loss. Hence the method with dynamic integration but without contrastive learning cannot be performed. From Table 3, we can see that both contrastive learning and dynamic integration can boost performance in multimodal learning. Moreover, by integrating contrastive learning into multimodal learning, the performance gap between audio and video is greatly reduced.

Specifically, we analyze three categories of integration strategy, i.e., constant, stepwise and dynamic strategy.

Similarly, \u201c $\\alpha=1^{\\circ}$ denotes that we only perform unsupervised contrastive learning. For stepwise strategy, we define an indicator function $h(p)$ , where $h(p)$ denotes that $\\alpha=p$ if the current epoch is less than half of the total epochs, otherwise $\\alpha=1-p$ .

Integrating multimodal learning and contrastive learning simultaneously with a constant ratio can slightly boost performance in some cases and greatly reduce the performance gap between audio and video. (2). In general, the model with a stepwise strategy can outperform the model with a constant strategy. Furthermore, we can find that the performance of the model with two-stage training, i.e., $h(0)$ or $h(1)$ , is worse than that of the model which combines two losses with a constant value, i.e., $h(0.05)$ or $h(0.95)$ . (3). The overall performance of the model with the dynamic strategy is better than that with the other strategy. Moreover, the model with the learning-based strategy can achieve the best performance. And the performance gap of this model is nil or negligible. The experimental results prove that the smaller the performance gap of the uni-modals, the better the overall performance of the model. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Change of $\\alpha$ for Learning-based Strategy: To further observe the change of the optimal $\\alpha$ during training, we illustrate the change of $\\alpha$ on all datasets. The results are shown in Figure 3, where $\\alpha$ is calculated by learning-based strategy, and $\\omega(t)$ denotes the heuristic based strategy. As the total epochs for different datasets are different, we change the $\\mathbf{X}$ -axis as the proportion of the current epoch, i.e., #epoch/#total_epochs. From Figure 3, we can draw the following observations: (1). The general trend of the change for $\\alpha$ is roughly the same on different datasets. (2). The customized function $\\omega(t)$ is close to the actual changes to some extent, but there is still a gap between the customized function and the actual changes. In practice, it is difficult to fti the change of parameter $\\alpha$ perfectly. Hence, we can see that our method has good adaptability in different scenarios. Furthermore, by comparing the trend of $\\omega(t)$ with other curves, a natural question arises: if the curve of the heuristic algorithm aligns more closely with the trend of the change curve based on the learning-based strategy, will the effect be better? The answer is yes. This issue can be easily verified by using a third-order polynomial function to approximate the learning-based curve. Specifically, by substituting the $\\omega(t)$ as the polynomial function $\\hat{\\omega}(t)=a t^{3}+b t^{2}+c t+d$ , where $a=1.5\\times10^{-4}$ , $b=-6.5\\times\\mathrm{\\bar{1}0^{-3}}$ , $c=3.2\\times\\dot{10}^{-\\dot{2}},d=$ $d=1$ , we can achieve higher accuracy with $71.22\\%$ and MAP with $76.28\\%$ on KineticsSounds dataset compared with ours- $\\cdot\\mathrm{H}$ .
