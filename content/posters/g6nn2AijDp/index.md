### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) show promise in visual understanding and response generation but suffer from "hallucinations", producing factually incorrect responses.  Current methods often involve complex training or modifications to the model architecture. Existing approaches to reduce hallucination in LMMs often involve retraining or complex model architecture changes, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. 



The paper introduces CODE, a novel contrastive decoding method. CODE utilizes self-generated descriptions as contrasting references during decoding. This dynamically adjusts information flow and improves response alignment with actual visual content. Experiments show CODE significantly reduces hallucinations and improves consistency in various benchmarks across multiple LMMs without needing extra training.  This provides a simple and effective solution for enhancing existing LMMs.

#### Visual Insights

> This figure illustrates the CODE (COuntering DEscription Contrastive Decoding) method.  The process starts with visual content (an image of a dog catching a frisbee) which is processed by a Large Multimodal Model (LMM). The LMM generates a comprehensive description of the image. Then, during the decoding phase, the LMM generates an ongoing response to a user question. The CODE method contrasts the logit information from the visual content and the generated comprehensive description. This contrasting helps the model to generate more contextually appropriate and correct responses, reducing hallucinations by suppressing inconsistent words in the generated text (e.g., replacing 'catching' with 'hit' in this example).

> This table presents the results of hallucination evaluation on discriminative benchmarks using six different large multimodal models (LMMs) and six decoding methods.  The discriminative benchmarks, POPE and MMVP, assess hallucination by focusing on the correctness of model predictions on object-level and subtle visual detail questions respectively. The table shows precision, F1-score, and accuracy for the POPE benchmark, and accuracy for individual visual pattern categories within the MMVP benchmark.  The results are broken down by model, parameter count, and decoding method, showing how CODE compares to other state-of-the-art methods.





### In-depth insights


#### Hallucination in LMMs
Large multimodal models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive abilities in visual context understanding and response generation. However, a significant challenge arises from the phenomenon of *hallucination*, where LMMs generate responses unrelated to the visual content.  This issue stems from inconsistencies in cross-modal alignment during training, exacerbated by the limited instruction-following data used for fine-tuning.  Several approaches attempt to address this, including reactive methods that intervene during decoding.  **The core problem involves the gap between the model's visual understanding and its linguistic capabilities.**  Effective solutions require careful consideration of information flow during response generation, potentially through contrastive decoding methods that leverage self-generated descriptions to improve the consistency of outputs and reduce hallucination.   Addressing this challenge requires not only improved training paradigms but also advanced decoding strategies capable of effectively grounding responses in true visual evidence.

#### CODE: Contrastive Decoding
Contrastive decoding methods, exemplified by "CODE: Contrastive Decoding," aim to enhance the quality of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) outputs by leveraging the inherent strengths of contrastive learning.  **CODE likely uses a self-generated description of the input image as a contrastive reference.** This approach capitalizes on the model's own understanding to identify and correct inconsistencies between the generated response and the actual visual content. By contrasting the model's predictions against its own detailed description, CODE can effectively reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of generated responses.  **The method's innovation likely lies in the dynamic adjustment of information flow during the decoding process.** This adaptive mechanism allows CODE to refine its predictions, ensuring a more contextually relevant and coherent response.  While training-free, CODE's effectiveness hinges on the quality of the self-generated description, making it crucial to manage this component of the framework effectively.  Furthermore, **CODE's success depends on the ability of the self-generated descriptions to capture the salient aspects of the visual data while avoiding biases and hallucinations inherent to the model itself.**

#### Visual Counterpart Use
The effective utilization of visual counterparts is crucial for enhancing the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs).  A key challenge lies in selecting a suitable visual counterpart that effectively balances factual accuracy with the potential for hallucination. The paper explores the use of self-generated descriptions as visual counterparts. This approach offers a unique advantage: **self-generated descriptions provide a comprehensive overview of the model's interpretation of the visual input**, incorporating both accurate information and potential biases or inaccuracies. By contrasting these self-generated descriptions with the actual visual information, the model can refine its response and reduce inconsistencies. This method is particularly useful because it **leverages the model's own understanding of the visual content**, making it a training-free strategy for mitigating hallucination. The success of using self-generated descriptions as visual counterparts heavily relies on the quality and completeness of the initial description.  Further research is needed to investigate how to further optimize the generation process and address limitations, specifically for complex or ambiguous images. **The dynamic adjustment of information flow and the introduction of an adaptive constraint are key improvements**, ensuring that the model's understanding of the visual content drives response generation more effectively.

#### Adaptive Info Control
Adaptive information control in the context of large multimodal models (LMMs) aims to dynamically adjust the flow of information during the decoding process.  This is crucial because LMMs often generate hallucinatory outputs, which are factually incorrect or inconsistent with the input visual data.  **The core idea is to selectively gate or amplify information from different sources, such as the visual input and self-generated descriptions, to improve the coherence and accuracy of the generated response.**  This selective gating might involve techniques like contrasting logits derived from multiple sources, or employing a dynamic weighting scheme based on the relative confidence or relevance of information.  A key challenge lies in determining the appropriate level of control: too much restriction might suppress relevant information, while insufficient control may allow hallucinations to persist.  **Effective adaptive mechanisms must carefully balance these competing needs, ideally learning to differentiate between genuine visual evidence and spurious model-generated content.**  Successful implementation would lead to a significant reduction in hallucinations, enhanced cross-modal consistency, and more reliable LMM outputs. This would be especially valuable in real-world applications relying on reliable and truthful information from these powerful models.

#### Future Work
The authors suggest several avenues for future research.  **Improving the robustness of self-generated descriptions** is crucial, as these descriptions serve as the foundation for CODE's contrastive mechanism.  Hallucinations in these descriptions propagate errors, so enhancing their accuracy, perhaps through more sophisticated prompting techniques or model architectures, would significantly boost CODE's effectiveness.  **Integrating external knowledge sources** is another key area; CODE's reliance on the model's internal knowledge limits its ability to correct factual inaccuracies.  External resources could provide more reliable contextual information for comparison.  Finally, **developing more sophisticated bias detection mechanisms** is important. While CODE helps mitigate hallucination, biases within the model can still affect its output. More robust detection and correction of these biases could greatly enhance the overall reliability of the system.
