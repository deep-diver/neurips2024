Therefore, recent efforts have started embracing vision as a universal medium to develop an embodied agent capable of planning diverse tasks through imagination and execution [16, 15, 17]. These approaches involve a generative model for predicting future videos or goal images, followed by a goal-conditioned policy for translating the visual plan into actual actions.

With video frames as the interface describing desired states, a text-conditioned video diffusion model generates future frames as reference inputs. To further facilitate the subsequent planning accuracy, we endow the visual planner with the ability of depth map generation, and introduce optical flow regularization to prioritize motion consistency. 2) Error measurement. Given the limitations of pixelwise metrics and the inadequacy of pre-trained visual representations, we propose the establishment of a measurable embedding space to realize accurate and efficient error measurement between the observed and planned states. Our state embeddings are trained using an explicit error modeling approach, which yields a strong correlation with the process of converging towards or diverging from target states. 3) Feedback-driven controller. We present a simple yet effective control framework, comprising a controller and an error-aware adaptive control strategy. The controller is optimized via an inverse dynamics objective [24] to achieve the predefined sub-goals. To address the issue of a goal-oriented policy failing to consistently achieve the desired state, our proposed framework, CLOVER, adopts an iterative refinement strategy.

Model-predictive control (MPC) is a classic and popular approach for leveraging learned dynamics for robotic control and has gained great success in learning robust closed-loop policies [25, 26, 27]. Nonetheless, many of these prior works require knowledge about the system state in the planned future which is often infeasible. Visual foresight [20, 28] integrates an auxiliary register network to calculate pixel distances between the current and goal images, consequently providing feedback. And some methods [21, 29] utilize an additional detection model with preset rules to estimate the current state. However, the adaptability of these methods is constrained to single pick-and-pull tasks and does not cover long-horizon, multi-object manipulation tasks. HiP [30] investigates the feasibility of decomposed language sub-goals and the consistency of generated video plans through training with feedback. Like other visual planners [16, 15, 17], it lacks a quantitative assessment of trajectory achievement during test-time execution. Inner Monologue [18] leverages vision-language model to provide linguistic feedback for task success detection, but the substantial size of this model hinders the efficiency during test-test execution. In contrast, CLOVER constructs a measurable latent space from pixel observations and qualitatively measures deviations from planned goals for each action, thereby incorporating real-time feedback.

Distinguished from previous works that adopt fixed action steps mentioned in Section 4.3, our framework incorporates a predefined distance threshold $D_{S}$ (refer to Algorithm 1) to facilitate adaptive transitioning between sub-goals upon achievement. In Figure 10, we illustrate the distance variation between the current observation and selected goals during the roll-out process. In our experimental setup, CLOVER dynamically adjusts the number of steps for approaching each sub-goal, ranging from 1 to 7, and transitions to the next sub-goal once the distance falls below the threshold $D_{S}$ . Notably, the distribution of generated goals in the latent space is uneven, and the policy does not adhere to a fixed speed in reaching targets. This is evident from the varying starting distances and changing slopes of the approach process for each sub-goal in Figure 10. These observations further underscore the necessity of a feedback mechanism to enable the adaptive sub-goal transition to mitigate error accumulation.

Inspired by LIV [55], we introduce a contrastive objective for language and state embeddings to establish a dense (value) reward, where a high reward for the current state represents an approaching status of the entire task. Specifically, we use the subtraction of the randomly sampled intermediate state and initial state embeddings as the negative example, while the subtraction of final and initial embeddings as the positive example.
