### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Accurate motion forecasting is crucial for autonomous driving, but existing methods struggle with representing the dynamic evolution of agent states.  These often utilize a one-query-one-trajectory approach, which may yield suboptimal results. This paper introduces the problem of the limitation of existing approaches. 



The proposed DeMo framework addresses these challenges by decoupling multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries (capturing directional intentions) and state queries (tracking dynamic states).  It leverages combined attention and Mamba techniques for efficient information aggregation and state sequence modeling, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. This significantly improves the accuracy and detailed representation of future trajectories for autonomous driving.

> This figure illustrates the core idea of the DeMo framework.  Panel (a) shows the traditional one-query-one-trajectory approach where a single query attempts to predict all future possibilities of motion. Panel (b) introduces the concept of state queries, which track the agent's dynamic states over time separately.  Finally, panel (c) combines both mode queries (directional intentions) and state queries, providing a more detailed and accurate representation of future trajectories. This decoupling is the key innovation of the DeMo approach.

### In-depth insights


#### Motion Forecasting
Motion forecasting, crucial for autonomous driving, **predicts future movements of traffic agents**, enabling safer and more efficient navigation.  The challenges involve handling **dynamic environments**, **unpredictable agent behavior**, and the need to integrate road map information.  Early approaches often relied on simple representations and lacked detailed modeling of future trajectories, leading to suboptimal predictions.  **Advances leverage vectorized scene representations** and complex neural network architectures, such as transformers, to capture intricate relationships between agents and their surroundings. **Multi-modal forecasting**, addressing the inherent uncertainty of future trajectories, is a prominent area of research, with approaches including goal-oriented models and probabilistic methods.  The field is continuously evolving, with improvements focused on handling long-term predictions, improving accuracy, and efficiently processing large-scale datasets.  **DeMo**, presented in the paper, exemplifies recent progress by decoupling motion forecasting into directional intentions and dynamic states, allowing for more accurate and detailed predictions.

#### DeMo Framework
The DeMo framework introduces a novel approach to motion forecasting by **decoupling the prediction task into two distinct components**: directional intentions and dynamic states.  This decoupling allows for a more detailed and comprehensive representation of future trajectories, addressing limitations of previous one-query-one-trajectory methods.  **Separate modules process mode queries (directional intentions) and state queries (dynamic states)**, leveraging attention and Mamba mechanisms for efficient global information aggregation and temporal modeling. The framework then integrates these components using a hybrid coupling module to obtain a unified trajectory prediction.  This approach enables the model to effectively capture both the multi-modality of future trajectories and their dynamic evolution, leading to state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets like Argoverse 2 and nuScenes.  The **modular design** makes it flexible, and the use of Mamba provides efficiency benefits. However, further exploration is needed regarding its scalability for very long trajectories and deployment considerations.

#### Query Decoupling
The core idea of "Query Decoupling" is to **break down complex motion forecasting queries into smaller, more manageable sub-queries**.  Instead of directly predicting full trajectories, the method separates the prediction task into two distinct parts: **directional intentions** (mode queries) and **dynamic states** (state queries). This decomposition allows the model to focus on each aspect individually, capturing the agent's intended direction and its dynamic evolution over time separately. By subsequently integrating these decoupled representations, the model gains a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the overall future trajectory, leading to improved accuracy and robustness, especially in handling multi-modal scenarios.  This approach is **particularly beneficial for addressing the limitations of one-query-one-trajectory methods**, which often struggle with the detailed representation of future trajectories and capturing intricate spatiotemporal dynamics.

#### Mamba & Attention
The integration of **Mamba and Attention mechanisms** offers a powerful approach to motion forecasting.  Mamba, a state space model, excels at capturing **long-range temporal dependencies** in sequential data like agent trajectories, while Attention mechanisms excel at **contextual information aggregation**, weighing the importance of various surrounding elements (other agents, map features).  Their combination allows the model to effectively leverage both **dynamic state evolution** and **global scene context** for improved prediction accuracy.  **Mamba's efficiency** in handling long sequences complements Attention's ability to capture complex interactions, resulting in a robust and efficient forecasting framework.

#### Future Works
The paper's success in decoupling motion forecasting into directional intentions and dynamic states opens several exciting avenues for future work.  **Improving the model's efficiency** is crucial; the current architecture's complexity could hinder real-time deployment.  Exploring techniques like sparse state representations or more efficient attention mechanisms could significantly reduce computational costs.  **Addressing the limitations of the decoupled query paradigm** is important; while effective, this approach could lead to increased model size and complexity with longer prediction horizons.  Investigating alternative query designs or integrating multi-modal trajectory representations directly could mitigate this.  Finally, **extending the framework to handle more complex scenarios** such as interactions with pedestrians, cyclists, and unpredictable events would significantly broaden its applicability.  Thorough investigation into these areas will enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of the model, paving the way for safer and more reliable autonomous driving systems.

> This figure provides a detailed overview of the DeMo framework. It shows how HD maps and agents are initially processed by an encoder to extract scene context.  The decoding process is then broken down into three modules: the Mode Localization Module processes mode queries (directional intentions), the State Consistency Module processes state queries (dynamic states), and the Hybrid Coupling Module combines the outputs of the previous two modules to generate the final trajectory predictions.  The illustration uses a single-agent scenario for clarity, showing the flow of data and the feature dimensions at each step.
