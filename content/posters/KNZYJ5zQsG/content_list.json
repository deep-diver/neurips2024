However, the extensive computational demands of full conformal prediction are daunting in practice, as it necessitates a comprehensive number of trainings across the entire latent label space. Unfortunately, existing efforts to expedite conformalization often carry strong assumptions and are developed specifically for certain models, or they only offer approximate solution sets. To address this gap, we develop a method for fast exact conformalization of generalized statistical estimation. Our analysis reveals that the structure of the solution path is inherently piecewise smooth, and indicates that utilizing second-order information of difference equations suffices to approximate the entire solution spectrum arbitrarily. We provide a unified view that not only encompasses existing work but also attempts to offer geometric insights. Practically, our framework integrates seamlessly with well-studied numerical solvers.

Conformal prediction [1] serves as a powerful statistical tool that leverages the observed data to construct prediction intervals containing the outcome with a predefined probability level. It enjoys model-free coverage guarantee regardless of the underlying distribution of the data. In recent years, conformal prediction has gained increasing attention from the community of machine learning [2\u20135], data mining [6\u20138] and computer vision [9, 10]. This growing interest is attributed to the attractive properties that it operates under the assumption of exchangeability, which is a weaker condition than independence and identical distribution, allowing for a wider range of applications in real-world scenarios where data may not meet strict statistical assumptions. Meanwhile, conformal prediction can be combined with almost any existing point estimators, even when the model is potentially misspecified [5].

Kindly note that in this paper we refer to the full conformal prediction that does not discard training points as opposed to the split conformal prediction, as the latter involves only one single fitting. From a numerical perspective, when constructing a conformal prediction set, one needs to exhaustively search all points (potential candidates) in the label space, where for each point the learning model needs to be refitted and the conformity score needs to be re-calculated. In many scenarios like regression, the number of possible candidates is infinite as the latent label can take an uncountable number of possible values. Conventional conformal prediction works by a grid-search type method to loop over the label space [13, 14], which discretize the interval of interest and subsequently solve a sequence of individual optimization subproblems. To improve such brute-force approach, there have been many efforts in community that devoted to develop better algorithms for computing the prediction set. A natural idea is to generate the set of all solutions indexed by the latent label candidate using numerical continuation (a.k.a. homotopy) method, and we name this set of optimal solutions as (exact) solution path, as illustrated in Figure 1.

We can also learn from the Figure 3 that the time of Algorithm 1 still compares favorably against the grid-search type method, even when the grid is sparse. Figure 4 found that there exists tiny number of kinks in majority runnings, which offers hope for the future expansion of our algorithm, and indicates that the choice of $y_{n+1}$ can make a difference in efficiency, as it will determine the solving interval and the total query times of gradient.

Under such conditions, the homotopy solution path would extend to a solution surface, and our ODE system could be reformulated as a corresponding system of partial differential equations. Additionally, compared to some previous work, Algorithm 1 offers increased speed but at the cost of higher memory requirements. It necessitates storing all training samples throughout the process for gradient queries. We believe it would be interesting to use recent advancements like the Kroneckerfactored approximate method to potentially enhance the memory scalability.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
