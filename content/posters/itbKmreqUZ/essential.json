Existing learned compression methods are too complex for resource-constrained satellite hardware.  This creates a need for lightweight solutions that can achieve high compression ratios without sacrificing image quality.\n\nCOSMIC addresses this by using a lightweight encoder on the satellite, followed by a ground-based decoder incorporating a diffusion model for detail compensation.  This multi-modal approach utilizes sensor data to enhance reconstruction. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both compression ratios and image quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its effectiveness for practical satellite applications.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Compression"}, "podcast_path": "itbKmreqUZ/podcast.wav"}
