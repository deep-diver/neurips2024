Each cell shows the p-value for comparing the Spearman rank correlation of feature importance maps between a given regularized LDM and another, allowing a statistical determination of the significance of differences in the human-alignment of their generated feature importance maps.  The table helps to understand the relative performance of various regularization methods.", "section": "A.8 Pair-wise statistical test for importance feature maps"}]
