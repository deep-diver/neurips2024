The x-axis represents the frequency of visits to a POI, and the y-axis shows the number of POIs with that frequency. The graph clearly shows a heavy-tailed distribution; a small number of POIs are visited very frequently (Head POIs), while a large number of POIs are visited very infrequently (Long-Tail POIs).  The illustrative diagram above highlights a hypothetical scenario where a prediction model might incorrectly predict a frequent location (like McDonald's) when the user actually visits a less common place (like a ramen restaurant), demonstrating the challenge of predicting less-visited POIs.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "wT2TIfHKp8/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The performance comparison of the long-tailed and head POIs between LoTNext and Graph-Flashback on Gowalla dataset.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of LoTNext and Graph-Flashback on the Gowalla dataset, focusing on the prediction accuracy for both long-tailed and head POIs.  Subfigure (a) shows the accuracy at rank 1 (Acc@1) for both types of POIs, indicating that LoTNext outperforms Graph-Flashback in both cases. Subfigure (b) presents the mean reciprocal rank (MRR), a metric reflecting the average ranking of correct predictions, with LoTNext again showing a clear advantage.

The visualization shows how well each model can distinguish between the embeddings of these infrequently visited locations.  Graph-Flashback shows significant overlap and less distinct clusters for these low-frequency POIs, suggesting difficulty in differentiating between them. LoTNext, in contrast, shows more distinct and well-separated embeddings, indicating its superior ability to capture the unique characteristics of even rarely visited locations.
