To address this, we introduce Graphvis, which conserves the intricate graph structure through the visual modality to enhance the comprehension of KGs with the aid of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Our approach incorporates a unique curriculum fine-tuning scheme which first instructs LVLMs to recognize basic graphical features from the images, and subsequently incorporates reasoning on QA tasks with the visual graphs.

Approaches that enable input from multi-modal data can expands the information that LLMs can take in for various downstream reasoning tasks across domains. The modalities in existing LLM-based models span across images (Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b), videos (Maaz et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c), and audio (Zhang et al., 2023; Rubenstein et al., 2023). Most recently, researchers have also begun to build an unified architecture to encode diverse modalities jointly (Wu et al., 2023). Such unification holds considerable promise, and poses an interesting question on whether data from one modality could enhance the model performance in another. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Beyond the frequently explored modalities such as vision and audio, knowledge graphs (KGs) are also gaining attention. Given LLMs\u2019 limitations such as hallucinations (Li et al., 2023a), inaccuracies in recalling factual knowledge (Yang et al., 2023), and the costly updates of knowledge via training (Ding et al., 2023), researchers are exploring KGs as a robust source of structured and easy-to-update facts (Pan et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023; Agrawal et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). The use of KGs to enhance language models began with smaller models like BERT (Kenton and Toutanova, 2019; Huang et al., 2022), incorporating KGs into the pre-training objectives (Zhang et al., 2019; Rosset et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) or integrating them through architectural modifications (Yasunaga et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). However, the recent development of larger and more complex LLMs poses challenges in adapting these earlier methods. Current strategies for integrating KGs into LLMs fall into two categories: (1) verbalizing relevant KG triples and directly appending them to prompts as \u201c(node a, edge, node b)\" (Guo et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Baek et al., 2023) or (2) employing a graph neural network (GNN) to generate embeddings for relevant KG subgraphs and projecting these into the LLM's token embedding space (Chai et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2024). Nonetheless, these approaches often yield results that are either weaker than or comparable to methods that fully fine-tune smaller LMs with integrated KG information, revealing an underutilization of the graph structure and rich relational context. Thus, effectively integrating the KG modality into LLMs and enabling them to comprehend graph concepts remains an unsolved challenge.

Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) (Liu et al., 2023b), pre-trained on an extensive corpus of image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional abilities in processing image inputs. In response to this potential, we introduce a novel methodology, Graphvis, that enhances graph comprehension by visualizing subgraphs and leveraging LVLMs for KG-enhanced question answering. This approach involves translating retrieved subgraphs into images, which are then processed by an LVLM to aid in answering questions. Recognizing that LVLMs typically lack proficiency with visual graphs, we design a unique curriculum fine-tuning scheme. Initially, the model is trained to interpret simple graphical features, such as node count, edge count, and node degree, through self-supervised learning. It then progresses to handling more complex queries by integrating textual question-answer data with relevant visualized subgraphs, thereby fine-tuning the LVLM to respond accurately to KG-based questions using these images. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively improves the model's performance on downstream QA tasks, surpassing both current KG-enhanced LLMs and traditional fully fine-tuned KG language models.

This approach has been largely applied to encoder-only language models such as BERT (Kenton and Toutanova, 2019) with training objectives specifically tailored for these models such as masked word prediction (Zhang et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Rosset et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2022; Baek et al., 2023). Another line of work also relies on the encoder architecture of language models and performs full-parameter fine-tuning on a KG encoder for the fusion of knowledge (Sun et al., 2021; Yasunaga et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022; Yujie et al., 2023). However, the advent of recent decoder-only LLM pre-trained on a significantly larger scale (e.g., the GPT series (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), LLaMA series (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023)), increases the difficulty and cost of adapting these KG-based pre-training and fine-tuning methods to current LLMs. Consequently, with KGs as a distinct modality, researchers have been exploring various methods for integrating the information into LLMs. One straightforward and most commonly used approach involves verbalizing relevant knowledge graphs and appending them to the prompts (Guo et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Fatemi et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023). For a notable example, KAPING (Baek et al., 2023) retrieves the top $k$ most relevant knowledge triples to the prompt and appends it in the form of textual triples to the original prompt. Meanwhile, such an approach linearizes the originally structured information and does not maintain a natural language form. Another research direction therefore employs GNNs to generate embeddings for retrieved subgraphs, subsequently projecting these into the LLM's token embedding space as soft prompts to preserve structured graph information (Yasunaga et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Chai et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2024).

We include the full ine-tuning methods of KG-enhanced LMs as strong baselines, which include well-designed model architectures based on small-scale language models to better integrate KG information. Although the current methods proposed for KG-enhanced LLMs are not open-sourced at the time of this manuscript, we incorporate the reported values of the baselines, including KSL, KAPING, and GNP. We observe that, due to the strong performance of the base LLMs, prompting methods like KAPING can actually harm performance by causing notably longer contexts with information not in natural language form. Conversely, fine-tuning methods like KSL and GNP offer greater improvements, even though mostly under-performing or matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuned LMs that have intrinsic architectural changes to adapt the KG information. Meanwhile, the scale of LLMs is unprecedented, causing difficulty in both modifying the architecture or fully fine-tuning all parameters. While GraphVis similarly employs LoRA fine-tuning to only update a small amount of parameters similar to KSL and GNP, we observe a much more significant improvement that suggests a better incorporation of the information.

Firstly, we acknowledge the limitation induced by compute resources that our experiments are done on 7B models with LoRA fine-tuning.

Extending from our current method, interesting future work includes exploring how different visualizations may influence the effectiveness of Graphvis. Additionally, instead of following the previous retrieval methods, it would be valuable to investigate better subgraph retrieval techniques and integrate them into the learning process. Lastly, while we used ConceptNet as an example KG to enhance commonsense reasoning, there are numerous other KGs available.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u00b7 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
