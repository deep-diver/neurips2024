Although the iterative sampling process of these diffusion-based models ensures high-quality generation, it significantly slows down inference, hindering their real-time applications. On the other hand, existing opensourced T2V models including VideoCrafter [Chen et al., 2023, 2024] and ModelScopeT2V [Wang et al., 2023c] are trained on web-scale video datasets, e.g., WebVid-10M [Bain et al., 2021], with varying video qualities.

However, the quality of VCM\u2019s generations is naturally bottlenecked by the performance of the teacher model, and the reduced number of inference steps further diminishes its generation quality. On the other hand, to align generated videos with human preferences, InstructVideo [Yuan et al., 2023] draws inspiration from image generation techniques [Dong et al., 2023, Clark et al., 2023, Prabhudesai et al., 2023] and proposes backpropagating the gradients of a differentiable reward model (RM) through the iterative video sampling process. However, calculating the full reward gradient is prohibitively expensive, resulting in substantial memory costs. Consequently, InstructVideo truncates the sampling chain by limiting gradient calculation to only the final DDIM step, compromising optimization accuracy. Additionally, InstructVideo is limited by its reliance on an image-text RM, which fails to fully capture the transition dynamic of a video. Empirically, InstructVideo only conducts experiments on a limited set of user prompts, the majority of which are related to animals.

Many diffusion-based T2V models rely on large-scale image datasets for training [Ho et al., 2022a, Wang et al., 2023c, Chen et al., 2023] or inherit weights from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models [Zhang et al., 2023, Blattmann et al., 2023, Khachatryan et al., 2023]. The scale of text-image datasets [Schuhmann et al., 2022] is usually more than ten times the scale of open-sourced video-text datasets [Bain et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2023d] and with higher spatial resolution and diversity [Wang et al., 2023c]. For example, Imagen Video [Ho et al., 2022b] discovers that joint training on a mix of image and video datasets improves the overall visual quality and enables the generation of videos in novel styles. Models trained with WebVid-10M [Bain et al., 2021] like ModelScopeT2V [Wang et al., 2023c] or VideoCrafter [Chen et al., 2023] also treat images as a single-frame video, and use them to improve video qualities. LaVie [Wang et al., 2023b] initialize the training with WebVid-10M and LAION-5B and then continue the training with a curated internal dataset of 23M videos. To overcome the data scarcity of high-quality videos, VideoCrafter2 [Chen et al., 2024] proposes to disentangle motion from appearance at the data level so that it can be trained on high-quality images and low-quality videos.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
