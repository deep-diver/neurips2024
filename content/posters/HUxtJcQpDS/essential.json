This paper introduces HEALNet, a novel multimodal fusion architecture that tackles these challenges. \nHEALNet uses a hybrid early-fusion approach, preserving each modality's structural information while learning cross-modal interactions in a shared latent space.  It's designed to be robust to missing modalities during training and inference, improving the reliability of predictions and the model's adaptability to real-world scenarios.  Experiments on cancer datasets demonstrate that HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "HUxtJcQpDS/podcast.wav"}
