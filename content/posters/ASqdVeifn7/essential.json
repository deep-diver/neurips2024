Second-order optimizers offer faster convergence than their first-order counterparts but require significantly more memory due to their extensive state variables.  This necessitates efficient compression techniques.  Current approaches focus on first-order optimizers. \nThis paper introduces 4-bit Shampoo, the first 4-bit second-order optimizer, successfully addressing these issues. It achieves this by cleverly quantizing the eigenvector matrix of the preconditioner\u2014a core component of second-order optimizers\u2014rather than the preconditioner itself.  This approach proves significantly more effective, preserving performance while dramatically reducing memory consumption.  The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of linear square quantization over dynamic tree quantization for this application.  **This work opens the door to training significantly larger neural networks more efficiently**.", "affiliation": "Beijing Normal University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ASqdVeifn7/podcast.wav"}
