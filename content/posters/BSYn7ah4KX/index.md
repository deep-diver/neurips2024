### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in iterative processes, creating feedback loops that can amplify biases present in initial models. This poses a significant challenge as it can lead to undesirable outcomes.  The paper highlights the lack of systematic understanding of these processes and the need for effective methods to guide LLM evolution in desired directions.

This paper proposes leveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework, to analyze this iterative process.  It theoretically justifies approximating LLM in-context behavior with a Bayesian update, then validates this through experiments with various LLMs.  The study's key contribution is a novel framework to predict and guide LLM evolution, offering strategies for bias mitigation or amplification based on the desired outcome.

> This figure illustrates how practical LLM systems, such as multi-generation multi-agent systems and on-policy finetuning algorithms, involve knowledge transfer between different generations.  It maps these practical systems onto a Bayesian agent model, highlighting the three key phases: imitation (learning from a predecessor's demonstration), interaction (refining knowledge through interaction with an annotator or environment), and transmission (generating samples for the next generation). The figure visually represents how biases might be amplified or mitigated during this iterative process by comparing the results of interactions with an annotator.





![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/BSYn7ah4KX/tables_6_1.jpg)

> This table presents the results of experiments comparing different methods for guiding the evolution of LLMs.  Three different LLMs (Old GPT3.5-Turbo, New GPT3.5-Turbo, and Claude3-haiku) were used, each with three different interaction phase methods: imitation-only, self-refine, and hypothesis-search. The table shows the correlation between the model's predictions and the ground truth (Corr. d), the percentage of times the model predicted that the screen was off (r20=off), and the percentage of times both the correlation and screen: off condition were met (BOTH).  The results demonstrate how different interaction phases affect the LLM's ability to learn correctly and reduce bias.





### In-depth insights


#### Bias Amplification
The concept of 'Bias Amplification' in the context of language model evolution is a critical one.  The paper explores how iterative learning processes, where models learn from data generated by previous models, can lead to an **exponential magnification of subtle biases** present in initial models or training data.  This occurs because each successive model inherits and potentially exacerbates the biases of its predecessors, creating a feedback loop that reinforces and amplifies these biases over time.  The authors highlight that this amplification can be both beneficial (e.g. strengthening desirable properties) and harmful (e.g., amplifying undesirable biases or limiting creativity).  Understanding and managing this amplification process is crucial for developing effective strategies for guiding the evolution of LLMs in desired directions, such as through careful design of the training data or using mechanisms to filter or rerank data to mitigate bias during the iterative learning process.  **The Bayesian iterated learning (IL) framework provides a valuable tool for analyzing and predicting the effects of bias amplification**, offering a theoretical basis for understanding these complex dynamics and informing the design of effective bias mitigation and alignment techniques for the future evolution of LLMs.

#### Iterated Learning
Iterated learning, a concept central to the provided research, models the iterative process of knowledge transmission and refinement across multiple generations of learners.  The paper highlights its relevance to large language models (LLMs), suggesting that the **sequential training and refinement of LLMs bear a striking resemblance to iterated learning in human cultures**.  The core idea is that subtle biases present in initial data or models can become amplified across generations, leading to the evolution of cultural traits (or in the case of LLMs, model behaviors).  **This bias amplification is a double-edged sword**: while beneficial biases might be reinforced, harmful ones could be magnified, thus raising concerns about unintended consequences. The study proposes a Bayesian framework for analyzing this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of carefully designing interaction phases to mitigate or guide the direction of bias amplification in LLMs. **This framework provides a theoretical lens for understanding the long-term evolutionary trajectories of LLMs**, and offers valuable insights for ensuring the responsible and beneficial development of this transformative technology.

#### LLM Evolution
The concept of "LLM Evolution" is a fascinating one, particularly when considered through the lens of iterative learning.  **The iterative nature of LLM improvement, where models generate data used to train subsequent models, creates a feedback loop with significant implications.**  This process is not unlike biological evolution; subtle biases or preferences present in early models get amplified over time, possibly leading to unintended consequences. The paper highlights the importance of **understanding this evolutionary process to better guide LLM development towards desired outcomes**, such as reducing harmful biases or enhancing creativity. A key aspect of the research involves analyzing this evolution using Bayesian iterated learning, a framework for understanding how biases are magnified in cultural transmission.  The research suggests that incorporating an explicit "interaction phase" to filter or refine the LLM-generated data could prove vital in steering this evolution toward more beneficial paths. This involves acknowledging that **bias amplification is a double-edged sword**, capable of both exacerbating problems and enhancing desirable traits. The findings call for a more nuanced approach to LLM development, moving beyond simple performance metrics and incorporating a deeper understanding of the long-term impacts of iterative training and the complex dynamics of model evolution.

#### Bayesian Analysis
A Bayesian analysis in a research paper would likely involve applying Bayesian statistical methods to analyze data and draw inferences.  This approach contrasts with frequentist methods by explicitly incorporating prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters of interest into the analysis. **Key aspects of a Bayesian analysis** often include specifying a prior distribution, calculating the likelihood function based on the observed data, and computing the posterior distribution using Bayes' theorem. The posterior distribution represents the updated belief about the parameters after considering both the prior knowledge and the observed data. The selection of appropriate prior distributions is critical, as it influences the final results.  **Different types of prior distributions** can be used depending on the available information and assumptions. The analysis might involve using computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution when it's difficult to calculate analytically. The results of a Bayesian analysis are typically presented as credible intervals or posterior distributions, which provide a range of plausible values for the parameters of interest along with their associated probabilities. The interpretation of results must be cautious and should acknowledge both the prior assumptions and the uncertainty inherent in Bayesian methods.  **Model comparison** may also be part of the analysis if evaluating the performance of different models is relevant. Overall, a well-executed Bayesian analysis can offer a flexible and comprehensive approach to statistical inference, which goes beyond frequentist statistics by explicitly incorporating prior information and providing a complete probability distribution for the parameters.

#### Future of LLMs
The future of LLMs is intrinsically linked to their ability to learn and evolve iteratively.  **Bias amplification**, a significant concern, highlights the need for careful algorithm design and ongoing monitoring.  The paper suggests that a Bayesian framework for iterated learning can help predict and guide LLM evolution, emphasizing the importance of a well-defined interaction phase to filter or refine LLM outputs.  This framework offers a systematic approach to manage biases, potentially mitigating negative societal impacts and promoting beneficial outcomes. The long-term impact hinges on resolving challenges related to understanding and controlling the amplification of both beneficial and harmful biases. **The design of effective interaction phases is key** to steering LLMs toward desirable trajectories, preventing the uncontrolled magnification of biases, and ensuring alignment with human values.  Further research focusing on the implicit nature of LLMs' knowledge and the development of mechanisms for nuanced interaction will be crucial for realizing the full potential of LLMs while mitigating risks.

It shows how an LLM agent learns from examples, refines its knowledge through an interaction phase (involving feedback from a human or another LLM), and then generates new examples for the next generation. The figure shows the transfer of knowledge between generations and how an agent's belief of a rule (h) is updated over time.

The left panel shows the entropy of the posterior distribution decreasing over generations for various temperature settings, indicating convergence. The middle two panels illustrate the evolution of the probability of the 'screen: off' bias under different prior bias levels and likelihood conditions.  The right panel displays histograms of the posterior distribution for the first and sixth generations, visually representing the amplification of the prior bias.

> This figure shows the results of two sets of experiments. The left three panels show the results from the experiments in section 6, which studies how the ratio of easy samples, the average ranking of acronyms, and average length of acronyms change over generations in a self-data augmentation task. The right two panels shows the results from the experiments in section 7, which studies the effect of on-policy DPO on the average length of responses and win rate against SFT baseline.  Different lines represent different initial conditions (number of easy examples in d‚Å∞ and different bias settings).


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/BSYn7ah4KX/figures_15_1.jpg)

> This figure illustrates the analogy between the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the imitation-only iterated learning.  The EM algorithm is a general method for finding maximum likelihood estimations in statistical models with hidden variables, iteratively improving an estimation of the parameters by updating a distribution over the hidden variables (E-step) and then maximizing the likelihood given this distribution (M-step). The figure shows how the imitation-only iterated learning mirrors the EM algorithm.  In the imitation-only iterated learning, agents learn from data samples generated by previous agents, updating their beliefs about the underlying hypothesis (analogous to the E-step in EM). The next generation of agents then samples new data based on these updated beliefs (analogous to the M-step in EM), and the process repeats, thus iteratively refining the hypothesis.

The x-axis represents the index of the 256 possible mappings, while the y-axis represents the prior probability P<sub>o</sub>(h) of each mapping. The mappings are categorized into four groups: degenerate, holistic, others, and systematic.  The figure visually demonstrates that degenerate mappings have the highest prior probability, followed by holistic mappings, systematic mappings, and then 'others'.  This distribution reflects an inherent bias towards simpler or less complex mappings.

Each experiment tracks the proportion of three different types of mappings (degenerate, holistic, and systematic) over multiple generations. The first two experiments demonstrate the amplification of bias with an interaction phase, starting from holistic and degenerate mappings. The third experiment shows that the lack of an interaction phase leads to the dominance of degenerate mappings.  The final experiment shows how eliminating the compressibility pressure (using a uniform prior) affects the proportions of the different mapping types.

It visually demonstrates the shift in probability mass towards systematic mappings as the iterative learning progresses, highlighting the effect of both compressibility and expressivity pressures.

The left panel shows the entropy of the posterior distribution (H(Plmw(h))) decreasing over time for both strong and weak likelihood scenarios, indicating convergence. The central panels illustrate the impact of varying degrees of prior bias on the probability of 'screen:off' over different generations.

Three metrics are used to assess the trends: the ratio of easy samples, the average ranking of words in the sample, and the average length of the words in the sample.  The consistency of trends across different models supports the robustness of the findings.
