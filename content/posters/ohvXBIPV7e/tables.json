For each algorithm and dataset, it presents the data size (DS), index size (IS), and index construction time (IT).  The table allows for a comparison of the overhead introduced by CSPG in terms of index size and construction time, relative to the original graph-based algorithms.", "section": "6.1 Experimental setup"}, {"figure_path": "ohvXBIPV7e/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Candidate Set for the search in the query nearby (dashed parallelogram).", "description": "This table compares the candidate sets generated during a search in the vicinity of a query point for both a traditional proximity graph (PG) and the proposed Crossing Sparse Proximity Graph (CSPG) method.  Each row represents a step in the search. The PG column shows the candidate set considered at each step when searching the entire graph. The CSPG column shows the candidate set for the same search steps but utilizing the CSPG approach. The superscripts in the CSPG column indicate the partition number from which each candidate vector originates.  This illustrates the smaller candidate sets generated by CSPG and how vectors from different partitions can become candidates in the second stage, demonstrating the cross-partition expansion strategy.", "section": "C Proofs for Section 5"}, {"figure_path": "ohvXBIPV7e/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison for index construction cost, in which DS is the data size (MB), IS is the graph index size (MB), and IT is the index construction time (s)", "description": "This table compares the index construction cost of four different graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) algorithms: HNSW, Vamana, HCNNG, and their corresponding versions integrated with the proposed CSPG framework (CSPG-HNSW, CSPG-Vamana, CSPG-HCNNG).
