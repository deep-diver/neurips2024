Many real-world systems, however, possess hidden low-rank structures that, if exploited, can drastically improve RL efficiency. Current approaches often rely on strong assumptions like matrix incoherence and require prior knowledge of the structure. This limits their applicability and practicality.\nThis paper introduces LoRa-PI, a model-free RL algorithm that addresses these limitations. LoRa-PI employs a novel two-phase low-rank matrix estimation procedure (LME) that actively samples matrix entries based on estimated leverage scores.  Crucially, LME provides entry-wise guarantees without relying on matrix incoherence, only on its spikiness.  LoRa-PI uses LME for policy evaluation, alternating between policy improvement and evaluation steps.  The paper proves LoRa-PI learns an \u03b5-optimal policy with a sample complexity that depends only on the number of actions and is order-optimal, achieving significant statistical gains over existing methods.", "affiliation": "KTH", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HavKlV22xJ/podcast.wav"}
