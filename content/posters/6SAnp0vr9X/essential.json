Existing optimal subsampling techniques suffer from scale-dependency issues, leading to inefficient subsamples, especially when inactive features exist.  Inappropriate scaling transformations can magnify the problem, causing inaccurate variable selection and parameter estimation.  This poses significant challenges for analyzing such data.\nThis paper introduces a novel scale-invariant optimal subsampling method that directly addresses these limitations. It uses an adaptive lasso estimator for variable selection within the context of sparse models, providing theoretical guarantees. The method also minimizes prediction error by leveraging inverse probability weighting, leading to significantly improved estimation efficiency. Numerical experiments using simulated and real-world data confirm its superior performance over existing techniques.", "affiliation": "University of Connecticut", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6SAnp0vr9X/podcast.wav"}
