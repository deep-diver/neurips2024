The figure visually represents the flow of data through the different components of the model, highlighting the key steps involved in capturing human decision-making in chess across diverse skill levels.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "XWlkhRn14K/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Move prediction accuracy across diverse skill levels.
