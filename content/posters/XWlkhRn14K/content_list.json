Chess is an ideal model system for conducting research into this kind of human-AI alignment, with its rich history as a pivotal testbed for AI research, mature superhuman AI systems like AlphaZero, and precise measurements of skill via chess rating systems. Previous work in modeling human decision-making in chess uses completely independent models to capture human style at different skill levels, meaning they lack coherence in their ability to adapt to the full spectrum of human improvement and are ultimately limited in their effectiveness as AI partners and teaching tools. In this work, we propose a unified modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve. Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a skill-aware attention mechanism to dynamically integrate players\u2019 strengths with encoded chess positions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill. Our experimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly enhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of expertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making and AI-guided teaching tools.

Now, superhuman AI chess engines are ubiquitous and widely used.

Recent work has resulted in the development of Maia, a suite of models that aim to mimic human behavior in chess at various skill levels by learning to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data [1].

Viewed as a whole, they are volatile: the Maia models might predict that at one level players will approach a position correctly, then at the next level they will make a horrible mistake, then at the next level they will do fine again, and so on. In a word, they fail to cohere. People don\u2019t improve along volatile paths, they steadily get better. The unrealistically incoherent predictions made by separate models don\u2019t suggest realistic pathways that people can take in order to get better.

Since our model builds directly on original Maia, we call it Maia-2. Maia-2 consists of a standard residual network tower that processes chess positions into features, and our novel contribution of a skill-aware attention module with channel-wise patching. This innovation takes the position representation outputted by the residual network tower and simple player skill encodings and learns how player skill levels interact with chess positions to produce the moves humans make. Unlike previous models, Maia-2 only requires the current board position as input (as opposed to six), which dramatically reduces training time and increases flexibility (e.g. for applying the model in non-game contexts where there may be no 6-board history). In addition to policy and value heads like in previous work, we also add an additional auxiliary information head that helps the model learn a deeper understanding of human chess moves.

Analyzing move prediction accuracy by skill level, Maia-2 matches and surpasses all other models on all skill levels. Furthermore, Maia-2\u2019s gains in perplexity are similarly striking, reducing average perplexity from a previous record of 4.67 bits down to 4.07 bits. Maia-2 achieves these accuracy gains while being substantially more coherent than the original Maia models. For example, call a model\u2019s treatment of a position monotonic if it assigns a monotonically increasing probability to the correct move as we increase skill. While original Maia treats $1\\%$ of a random sample of positions monotonically, Maia-2 treats a remarkable $27\\%$ of the same positions monotonically. This is in keeping with our intuitive understanding of how chess players steadily and smoothly improve across the skill range. Finally, we conduct an investigation of the human chess concepts Maia-2 learns and varies with skill via linear probes, and find that skill-dependent concepts like overall board evaluation indeed vary with skill, but skill-independent concepts do not, which also accords with our understanding of how human players make decisions.

This paper draws on the long history of chess at the forefront of AI research [2, 3, 4, 5]. We engage with 3 distinct approaches to building chess AI: heuristic [6], learned [7], and textual [8]. Heuristic search: The original approach to computer chess was heuristics-based [4, 9]. This method was famously used by IBM\u2019s Deep Blue to defeat Garry Kasparov [2] and is currently used by Stockfish [6], one of the strongest chess engines in the world. Learned search: Alpha(Zero) Go [7, 10] is a set of neural networks that learn to play Go with methods that generalized to other games, including chess, with AlphaZero [10]. Chess AI with learned search is also extended to multi-agent systems [11], where diverse AI systems can outperform a single AI in challenging tasks such as chess. Chess as text: Large language models [12, 13, 14] have recently been found to perform well on tasks that the models were not explicitly trained on [15], including playing chess without fine-tuning [16, 17, 18]. This has lead to chess knowledge being one of the tested features in BIGBench [19], a popular LLM evaluation suite. Additionally, fine-tuning a language model can lead to systems that not only play chess, but can also generate comments, describe positions, and create other simple analyses of a game [20, 21, 8].

This has led to a new research agenda in extracting useful knowledge from these superhuman systems. A direct way of doing this is to probe an AI chess engine in a human representation space. Without any prior human knowledge or guidance, evidence of human chess concepts learned by AlphaZero is found and measured by linear probes [22]. Going further, AlphaZero also encodes knowledge that extends beyond existing human knowledge but is ultimately learnable by humans [23].Another direction was the creation of a \u2018behavioral stylometry model that can identify chess players from the moves they play [24]. An alternative approach to creating systems that can act as guides to humans is demonstrated by Maia [1, 25], in which a model is trained to predict the next move a human will play, instead of optimizing for winning the game. In addition to predicting human actions the models have been fine-tuned to predict a given player\u2019s actions [25].

Further, these models ignore opponent skill level, meaning that predictions cannot vary as a function of opponent strength. However, the active player\u2019s decisions may be significantly affected by the opponent\u2019s skill level in certain types of situations, or even in general. Players may adjust their strategy based on their perception of the opponent\u2019s skill, e.g. a higher-skill opponent might prompt more (or less) cautious play, while against a lower-skill opponent a player may pursue more aggressive tactics. Thus, the interaction between the skill levels of both players is an important component of matching human moves.

One important departure from previous work is that we only use the current chess position, and not the last few chess positions that occurred in the game (models have typically incorporated the six most recent positions in the game). Many games with perfect information, including chess, can be modeled as alternating Markov games [27, 7], where future states are independent of past states given the current game state. Therefore, the current chess position theoretically encapsulates all the information necessary to make future decisions. Although human decision-making in chess may sometimes subtly depend on the historical lead-up to the current position, these effects are anecdotally small. In exchange, we gain two large practical beneftis. First, modeling AI-human move matching in a Markovian way vastly improves training efficiency by reducing the computational load via significantly smaller data usage for each decision. Second, it also enhances flexibility, enabling our resulting model to make predictions even without historical data, which is particularly advantageous in situations where only the current position is available, like chess training puzzles or any position that didn\u2019t necessarily occur in a full game.

Consequently, while both Maia-1 and Maia- $2_{\\mathrm{subset}}$ draw from the same source dataset, Maia- $\\cdot2_{\\mathrm{subset}}$ can leverage a significantly larger portion of this data for its training, improving its learning and predictive capabilities. The improvement from Maia- $\\cdot2_{\\mathrm{subset}}$ to Maia-2 underscores the importance of extensive training with vast datasets. A broader range of games provides Maia-2 with access to more comprehensive and nuanced patterns in human chess moves. Using Maia- $\\cdot2_{\\mathrm{subset}}$ as a comparison, we can determine the relative contributions of model architecture and training data to Maia-2\u2019s 1.9 percentage point gap over its nearest rival (Maia 1500). This calculation suggests that $73\\%$ of the increase in performance is due to the architecture improvements and $27\\%$ is due to increased training data.

The filtration is significant for eliminating the noise introduced by rushed decisions under time constraints, which could skew the true representation of a player\u2019s skill. The choice of exclusive rapid games is also informed by the distinct rating systems across different game types, which necessitates the separation of data to maintain rating consistency.

Chess games between players of significantly different skill levels are relatively rare but help us understand how players of lower skill levels approach games against far stronger opponents and vice versa.

Since games between players of similar skill levels vastly outnumber more uneven matchups, we use a data balancing strategy to effectively train our unified model for aligning players across all skill levels, in which games between players of different skill levels are over-sampled. To be precise, we pre-process the data in chunks of $N_{\\mathrm{chunk}}$ games each. We then scan each data chunk to find games satisfying various (active player skill, opponent skill) combinations. Each skill combination can include at most $N_{\\mathrm{range}}$ games. We continue scanning the data chunk until all the skill combinations have $N_{\\mathrm{range}}$ games or the data chunk is fully consumed. Note that the higher the balancing factor NNcrahnugnek , the less likely it is that rare skill combinations will fully reach $N_{\\mathrm{range}}$ , which will lead to less balanced data overall. On the other hand, if the balancing factor is too small, fewer games will be selected from each data chunk, which is data-inefficient. We choose a fair compromise between data efficiency and balanced data so that our training data encompasses a broad spectrum of skill levels without biasing excessively towards the more frequently-occurring equal-skill matchups.

We use data from Lichess, a well-known large open-source chess platform, and its open database. In Lichess, since each game type is given a separate rating, ratings across different game types are not comparable (e.g. a rating of 1800 in \u201cRapid\u201d is significantly weaker than a rating of 1800 in \u201cBlitz\u201d on Lichess). Previous work [1, 25] mixes player ratings across these game types together for training and evaluation. Instead of mixing data across game types, we focus on Rapid games only, which are medium-length games that lie between the fast-paced decisions of \u201cBlitz\u201d games and the slower, more strategic considerations of \u201cClassical\u201d games. \u201cBlitz\u201d and \u201cBullet\u201d games, characterized by their quick pace, are composed of many decisions made under time pressure, introducing randomness that may not accurately reflect player intentions and skills.
