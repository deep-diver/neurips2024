However, **the underlying mechanisms of ICL remain unclear**, hindering the development of more effective and interpretable LLMs.  Existing research offers various perspectives, but a comprehensive understanding is still lacking. In particular, it is unclear how ICL relates to fundamental machine learning principles like gradient descent and representation learning, especially in the complex settings of Transformer models.\nThis research investigates the ICL process of Transformer models through the lens of representation learning.  The authors **connect the ICL inference process to the training process of a dual model via kernel methods**. This allows them to analyze ICL as a form of gradient descent, deriving a generalization error bound. Furthermore, inspired by contrastive learning, they propose several modifications for the attention layers to improve ICL capabilities. Experimental results on synthetic tasks support their findings.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "dB6gwSDXKL/podcast.wav"}
