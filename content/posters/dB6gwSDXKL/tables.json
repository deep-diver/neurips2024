Matthews correlation, F1 scores/accuracy, Pearson/Spearman correlation, accuracy are reported for CoLA, MRPC, STS-B, RTE respectively.", "description": "This table presents the results of experiments conducted on a subset of the GLUE benchmark using different modifications to the attention mechanism.  The table shows the performance of the original model and models with various modifications (regularized, augmented, negative samples) across four different tasks: CoLA, MRPC, STS-B, and RTE.  The \"Local Best\" row highlights the best performance achieved for each modification type, while \"Global Best\" indicates the overall best performing model across all modifications.  Different metrics are used for each task reflecting the nature of the task (e.g., Matthews correlation for CoLA, F1 score/accuracy for MRPC, Pearson/Spearman correlation for STS-B, accuracy for RTE).", "section": "Experiments"}]
