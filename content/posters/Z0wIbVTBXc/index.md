### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional diffusion models use a fixed forward process, limiting their flexibility and efficiency.  This often leads to complex marginal distributions and costly inference, hindering performance.  Furthermore, these models struggle to adapt to specific task requirements or simplify the learning process for the reverse process.

NFDM overcomes these limitations by introducing a **learnable forward process**, enabling more efficient training and inference.  The framework's novel parameterization allows for end-to-end optimization, minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood.  Experiments show that NFDM achieves **state-of-the-art likelihoods** on various image generation tasks and demonstrates its capacity to learn generative dynamics with specific characteristics.

The left side shows trajectories from the data distribution, while the right displays those from the prior distribution.  NFDM-OT, by learning the forward process, significantly reduces the curvature of the reverse process's trajectories, leading to more direct paths between the prior and data distributions. This illustrates NFDM-OT's ability to improve sampling speed and efficiency.

### In-depth insights


#### Learnable Diffusion
Learnable diffusion models represent a significant advancement in generative modeling.  By **learning the forward diffusion process**, rather than relying on fixed, pre-defined processes like the standard linear Gaussian, these models gain increased flexibility and control. This allows for the generation of more diverse and higher-quality samples, as the model can adapt to the specific characteristics of the data.  **Learnable forward processes** also offer the potential for improved efficiency in sampling, enabling faster generation of samples and potentially leading to advancements in other areas such as likelihood estimation.  However, the introduction of learnable components also brings challenges, such as the need for more sophisticated optimization techniques and increased computational cost during training.  Future research will likely focus on developing more efficient methods for learning and optimizing these models and on exploring novel applications enabled by this enhanced control over the diffusion process.

#### NFDM Framework
The NFDM framework presents a novel approach to diffusion models by introducing a **learnable forward process**. This contrasts with traditional methods that rely on fixed, pre-defined forward processes, often Gaussian.  The learnability allows NFDM to adapt to specific data characteristics and simplifies the reverse process's task, leading to **improved likelihoods and sampling efficiency**.  A key contribution is the **simulation-free optimization objective**, minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood, making training more efficient. The framework's flexibility is demonstrated by its ability to learn diverse generative dynamics, including deterministic trajectories and bridges between distributions.  However, the framework does impose a restriction on the parameterization of the forward process, limiting the range of applicable distributions.  Despite this constraint, **NFDM achieves state-of-the-art performance** across a range of image generation tasks, showcasing its potential as a versatile and powerful tool for generative modeling.

#### Bridge Model
The concept of a 'Bridge Model' in the context of diffusion models is fascinating.  It proposes a framework to **learn mappings between two distinct data distributions**. This is achieved by modifying the forward and reverse processes of a diffusion model, enabling the model to generate samples from one distribution conditioned on samples from another. The key innovation lies in making the forward process learnable and dependent on both source and target distributions, allowing it to effectively bridge the gap.  This approach demonstrates the potential for **greater flexibility and control** over generative processes, extending beyond the limitations of fixed forward processes used in traditional diffusion models. **Applications** could range from style transfer and image-to-image translation to domain adaptation tasks. The simulation-free training method also allows for efficient optimization, minimizing an upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. A successful bridge model would achieve high-fidelity generation while effectively connecting the two distributions.

#### Curvature Control
Controlling curvature in generative models, especially diffusion models, offers a powerful way to influence the generated samples' characteristics.  By directly manipulating the curvature of the trajectories in the latent space during generation, one can guide the model towards generating smoother or more complex outputs. **Lower curvature** generally results in more direct and efficient generation, potentially leading to faster sampling speeds. **Higher curvature**, conversely, allows for exploring more intricate and potentially more varied samples, potentially resulting in increased diversity but possibly at the cost of efficiency.  The method of curvature control can involve adding penalty terms to the loss function during training, which penalizes high curvature trajectories. This encourages the model to learn smoother paths, thereby influencing the characteristics of the generated output.  The precise mechanism of curvature control is tied to the forward diffusion process; influencing the forward process leads to a corresponding adjustment in the reverse process.  **Choosing an appropriate curvature control technique** requires careful consideration of the trade-off between generation efficiency and the desired level of complexity and diversity in the generated samples.  It is important to evaluate the effects of curvature control empirically, assessing its impact on both sampling speed and the quality of the generated samples across different tasks and datasets.  The impact on other metrics, like likelihood, also needs to be considered.

#### Future Works
Future work for Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM) could explore several promising directions. **Extending NFDM to handle discrete data** would significantly broaden its applicability.  This would involve developing novel parameterizations and loss functions capable of managing discrete latent variables and outputs.  Another area for development is **improving the efficiency of the training process**, particularly for high-dimensional datasets. Research into more efficient optimization strategies and neural architectures tailored for NFDM is crucial. Further investigation of the **impact of different parameterizations** of the forward process on the reverse process and overall model performance would lead to more robust and effective models.  **Exploring the effectiveness of NFDM in various applications**, including those beyond image generation (e.g., time series analysis, protein structure prediction), is essential to fully understand its potential.  Finally, a detailed **theoretical analysis of NFDM's convergence properties** and its relationship to other generative models is needed for a deeper understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations.
