To tackle this issue, we formulate offline behavior distillation (OBD), which synthesizes limited expert behavioral data from sub-optimal RL data, enabling rapid policy learning. We propose two naive OBD objectives, DBC and PBC, which measure distillation performance via the decision difference between policies trained on distilled data and either offilne data or a near-expert policy.

Inspired by dataset distillation (DD) [Wang et al., 2018, Zhao et al., 2021, Lei and Tao, 2024], which synthesizes a small number of training images while preserving model training effects, we further investigate the following question: Can we distill vast sub-optimal RL data into limited expert behavioral data? Achieving this would enable rapid offilne policy learning via behavioral cloning (BC) [Pomerleau, 1991], which can (1) reduce the training cost and enable green AI; (2) facilitate downstream tasks by using distilled data as prior knowledge (e.g. continual RL [Gai et al., 2023], multi-task RL [Yu et al., 2021], efficient policy pretraining [Goecks et al., 2019], offilne-to-online fine-tuning [Zhao et al., 2022]); and (3) protect data privacy [Qiao and Wang, 2023].

Therefore, we formalize the offilne behavior distillation (OBD): a limited set of behavioral data, comprising (state, action) pairs, is synthesized from sub-optimal RL data, so that policies trained on the compact synthetic dataset by BC can achieve small OBD objective loss, which incarnates high return when deploying policies in the environment.

Specifically, DBC reflects the policy performance by measuring the mismatch between the policy decision and vanilla offline data. Leveraging existing offline RL algorithms that can extract near-optimal policies from sub-optimal data [Levine et al., 2020], PBC improves upon DBC by correcting actions in offilne data using a near-optimal policy before measuring the decision difference.

To alleviate the online interaction, offline RL has been developed to learn the policy from a pre-collected dataset gathered by sub-optimal behavior policies [Lange et al., 2012, Fu et al., 2020]. However, the offline paradigm limits exploration and results in the distributional shift problem: (1) the state distribution discrepancy between learned policy and behavior policy at test time; and (2) only in-dataset state transitions are sampled when conducting Bellman backup [Bellman, 1966] during the training period [Levine et al., 2020]. Various offline RL algorithms have been proposed to mitigate the distributional shift problem. Fujimoto and Gu [2021], Tarasov et al. [2024] introduce policy constrain that control the discrepancy between learned policy and behavior policy. To address the problem of over-optimistic estimation on out-of-distribution actions, Kumar et al. [2020], Nakamoto et al. [2023], Kostrikov et al. [2022] propose to regularize the learned value function for conservative Q learning. Moreover, ensemble approaches have also proven effective in offline RL [An et al., 2021]. Readers can refer to [Tarasov et al., 2022] for a detailed comparison of offilne RL methods. Albeit these advancements, the offilne dataset is extremely large (million-level) and contains sensitive information (e.g. medical history) [Qiao and Wang, 2023], necessitating consideration of training efficiency, data storage, and privacy concerns.

This approach addresses key issues such as training inefficiency, data storage limitations, and data privacy concerns. There are two primary frameworks for DD: the meta-learning framework, which formulates dataset distillation as a bi-level optimization problem [Wang et al., 2018, Deng and Russakovsky, 2022], and the matching framework, which matches the synthetic and real datasets in terms of gradient [Zhao et al., 2021, Zhao and Bilen, 2021], feature [Zhao and Bilen, 2023, Wang et al., 2022], or training trajectory [Cazenavette et al., 2022, Cui et al., 2023].

As a result, backpropagating the meta-gradient of return w.r.t. synthetic data is extremely inefficient, and Lupu et al. [2024] tackle the challenge by estimating meta-gradient with the zero-order algorithm of ES; and (2) OBD objective solely relies on offilne data instead of long episode sampling, thereby making meta-gradient backpropagation relatively efficient and feasible, and the primary obstacle for OBD lies in designing an appropriate objective that accurately reflects the policy performance.

Through BC on distilled data, we can rapidly pretrain a good policy for online RL fine-tuning [Goecks et al., 2019]. On the other hand, after offline pretraining, the policy can be further enhanced by online fine-tuning, while there exists catastrophic forgetting w.r.t. offline data knowledge during fine-tuning [Luo et al., 2023]. To tackle this challenge, Zhao et al. [2022] propose to use BC loss w.r.t. offline data as a constraint during the fine-tuning phase. By replacing the massive offilne data with distilled data, we can achieve more efficient loss computation and thus better algorithm convergence. A similar approach can be achieved to circumvent catastrophic forgetting in continual offline RL [Gai et al., 2023], where the goal is to learn a sequence of offline RL tasks while retaining good performance across all tasks. Moreover, multi-task offilne RL [Yu et al., 2021], which learns multiple RL tasks jointly from a combination of specific offline datasets, also receives benefits from OBD in terms of efficiency by alternative training on the mixture of distilled data via BC [Lupu et al., 2024].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
