Existing solutions, like data reconstruction or modality augmentation, are often computationally expensive and may not fully address the underlying issue. This is because they primarily focus on reconstructing missing data and not on properly adapting the model's architecture to handle incomplete information. \nThis paper introduces a new technique called Deep Correlated Prompting (DCP) to solve this problem. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing data, DCP uses carefully designed prompts to guide the model's reasoning process, even when some modalities are missing. By incorporating correlations between prompts at different layers and between different modalities, DCP helps the model learn how to effectively use the available information to make accurate predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that DCP significantly outperforms previous methods while having a much lower computational cost.", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "zO55ovdLJw/podcast.wav"}
