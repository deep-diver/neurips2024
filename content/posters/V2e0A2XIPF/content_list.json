Previous methods have employed linear attention to mitigate the complexity of the original self-attention mechanism at the expense of effectiveness. In this paper, we propose QT-ViT models that improve the previous linear self-attention using quadratic Taylor expansion. Specifically, we substitute the softmax-based attention with second-order Taylor expansion, and then accelerate the quadratic expansion by reducing the time complexity with a fast approximation algorithm. The proposed method capitalizes on the property of quadratic expansion to achieve superior performance while employing linear approximation for fast inference.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed QT-ViTs, showcasing the state-of-the-art results.

Many papers focus on designing non-linear kernels and novel linearattention architectures for better approximation, e.g., Hydra-attention [2] uses the hydra trick to their multi-head attention by setting as many heads as features. Performer [5] uses fast attention via a positive orthogonal random features approach to approximate the softmax attention. EfficientViT [3] replaces softmax with ReLU non-linear activation and applies depthwise and group convolution to improve its performance. Flatten transformer [14] utilizes focused attention based on ReLU to force the attention operation to focus on more informative regions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
