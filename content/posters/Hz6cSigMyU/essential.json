", "summary": "POAD enhances LLM agents by decomposing language agent optimization to the token level, achieving finer-grained credit assignment and improved learning efficiency and generalization.", "takeaways": ["Decomposing language agent optimization to the token level leads to finer-grained credit assignment and more effective learning.", "Policy Optimization with Action Decomposition (POAD) significantly improves LLM agent performance and generalization.", "POAD's theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate its superiority over existing action-level optimization methods."], "tldr": "Current methods for training LLMs as agents struggle with the exponentially large action space and coarse credit assignment at the action level, leading to inefficient learning and poor generalization.  These methods often rely on manually restricting the action space, limiting their applicability.  The issue of misalignment between the agent's knowledge and the environment's dynamics further hinders performance.\nThis paper introduces Policy Optimization with Action Decomposition (POAD). **POAD tackles these issues by decomposing the optimization process from the action level to the token level.**  This allows for much finer-grained credit assignment for each token within an action, significantly reducing optimization complexity and improving learning efficiency.  The theoretical analysis and empirical results on various tasks confirm the effectiveness of POAD, showing significant improvements over existing methods. **POAD demonstrates better generalization and performance**, showcasing its potential for building more robust and versatile LLM agents.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Hz6cSigMyU/podcast.wav"}
