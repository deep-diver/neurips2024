Hierarchical DR offers a multiscale view but existing methods are either computationally expensive or lack interpretability. \nThis paper introduces PCA tree, a novel hierarchical DR model that uses a sparse oblique tree for projection and local PCAs in leaves.  **Joint optimization** of parameters ensures monotonic error decrease, enabling scalability.  Experiments show PCA trees effectively identify low-dimensional structures and clusters, showcasing superior interpretability and efficiency compared to t-SNE and UMAP.", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Merced", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Yy0KUmneV6/podcast.wav"}
