This often results in unnecessarily high computational costs and limits deployment options.  Many inference methods exist, but their efficiency varies depending on problem type and the model itself.  \nThis paper tackles this issue by exploring different inference strategies, focusing on computational cost versus accuracy gains.  They tested various methods such as Greedy Search, Majority Voting, and Best-of-N, combined with Tree Search algorithms on different sized LLMs.  The most significant contribution is REBASE, a novel tree-search algorithm that carefully balances exploration and pruning. REBASE achieves better accuracy within a given computational budget than other methods, making smaller LLMs just as effective as larger ones.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "vYmvgxpgwH/podcast.wav"}
