The results are shown for both the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets.  Each row represents a specific model and inference approach, showing the number of samples, FLOPs (floating-point operations) used, and the resulting accuracy on MATH500 and GSM8K. This allows for comparison of accuracy across different methods and models under the same computational budget.
