Existing pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity across all layers, hindering performance. This paper addresses the limitations of these methods, which fail to allocate adaptive layer-wise sparsities.  The challenge lies in finding the optimal balance between compression and preserving model accuracy. \nThe paper proposes DSA, an automated framework that discovers optimal sparsity allocation strategies.  DSA uses an evolutionary algorithm to explore various combinations of pre-processing, reduction, transform, and post-processing operations, aiming for the best balance between compression and accuracy. Experiments show DSA significantly improves performance across multiple LLMs and diverse tasks compared to existing methods, even at high sparsity levels.  **This approach provides a systematic and automated solution to a critical problem in LLM optimization**.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "rgtrYVC9n4/podcast.wav"}
