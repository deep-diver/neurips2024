Traditional methods struggle with the computational complexity, especially as the problem size grows.  Furthermore, these methods often fail to provide solutions robust enough to handle unpredictable real-world scenarios.\nThis paper introduces a novel solution using **neural networks**.  The authors develop an end-to-end neural model that leverages a dual multi-head cross-attention mechanism to effectively extract features from uncertain travel time data, ultimately generating robust routes.  The model minimizes the maximum deviation from optimal solutions in the worst-case scenario, which is effectively demonstrated using experiments with robust TSP and VRP, significantly outperforming other methods in efficiency.", "affiliation": "Sun Yat-sen University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "DoewNm2uT3/podcast.wav"}
