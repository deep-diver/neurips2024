Any input point which is not a support vector does not influence the output: even if it is removed from the input sample, the output hyperplane does not change.", "description": "The figure illustrates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as an example of a counterfactual credit attribution mechanism.  The SVM finds the maximum-margin hyperplane that separates data points. Only the support vectors (points closest to the hyperplane) determine the hyperplane's position. Removing any non-support vector does not change the hyperplane; thus, they are not credited for influencing the model's output.", "section": "Example: Support Vector Machine"}]
