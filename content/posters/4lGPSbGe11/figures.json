The bar chart displays the bias, showing how much the estimated performance deviates from the true performance.  The lines show the coverage probability, indicating how often the true performance falls within the calculated confidence intervals.  The results are based on 500 experimental replications of a random forest regressor trained on different sample sizes (n).", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "4lGPSbGe11/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Evaluation biases and coverage probabilities of interval estimates (with nominal level 90%) for the mean-squared error evaluation of a fitted random forest regressor (default setup in scikit-learn in [49] with n\u00b0.4 subsamples in each tree), across 500 experimental replications.
