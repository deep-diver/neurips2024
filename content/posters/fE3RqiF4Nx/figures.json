By designing interpolants on the data manifold, OT-MFMRBF better preserves input features.", "description": "This figure compares the results of unpaired image translation between dogs and cats using two different methods: OT-CFM and OT-MFMRBF.  OT-CFM uses straight interpolations in the latent space, while OT-MFMRBF uses interpolations that follow the data manifold. The images show that OT-MFMRBF better preserves the features of the source images (dogs) during the translation process, resulting in more realistic and coherent cat images.  This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed metric flow matching method in generating higher-quality results for image generation tasks.

Both methods are applied to translate images of dogs into images of cats in the AFHQ dataset, using the latent space of the Stable Diffusion VAE. The images in the columns represent interpolated results at different points (t=0.00, t=0.25, t=0.50, t=0.75, t=1.00) along a path between the source (dog) and target (cat) distributions.
