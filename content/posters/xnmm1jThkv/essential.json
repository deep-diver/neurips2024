Existing methods either struggle with high dimensionality or rely on strong assumptions about the data.  This makes it difficult to apply these methods to real-world problems with complex, high-dimensional data.  Furthermore, many real-world systems exhibit nonlinear relationships, posing another challenge for causal discovery methods.\nThis paper introduces a new hybrid approach to tackle these challenges. The method uses a two-stage process. First, it employs a novel topological sorting algorithm that efficiently organizes the variables in the data based on their causal relationships.  Then, it applies a constraint-based algorithm to identify and remove incorrect edges from the causal graph. This hybrid approach is effective for both linear and nonlinear data with arbitrary noise distributions, and significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of causal discovery.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "xnmm1jThkv/podcast.wav"}
