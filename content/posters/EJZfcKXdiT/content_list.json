Our baseline (i.e., PI-3DGS) performs worse because the pure integration method for estimating light intensity is sensitive to noise. Our method, with its high-pass filter-based photovoltage contrast estimation module, effectively filters out noise in real scenes and improves reconstruction quality (see Fig. 3).

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
