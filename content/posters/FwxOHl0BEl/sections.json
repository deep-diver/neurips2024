Unlike traditional CG methods that drastically reduce degrees of freedom, **this approach uses neural networks to flexibly adjust the complexity of the system**, sometimes even increasing it to simplify optimization.  This overparametrization allows the model to dynamically represent fine-grained details, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.
