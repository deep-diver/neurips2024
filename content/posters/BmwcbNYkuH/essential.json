The code is publicly available, encouraging reproducibility and further advancements in this vital field. This is highly relevant given the current focus on improving the robustness and generalizability of AI models in medical imaging.", "summary": "Focusing on nuclear morphology improves out-of-domain generalization in cancer classification from histopathology images by leveraging nuclear segmentation masks during training.", "takeaways": ["Prioritizing nuclear morphology during training improves out-of-domain generalization.", "A novel regularization technique aligns representations of masks and original images, improving model robustness.", "The method improves out-of-domain generalization across multiple datasets and shows increased robustness to image corruption and adversarial attacks."], "tldr": "Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by variations in image acquisition across hospitals.  Existing methods like stain normalization and data augmentation have limitations in addressing these domain shifts, impacting the reliability of cancer detection models. The problem is that existing methods often focus on domain-specific texture features that change significantly across datasets while ignoring domain-invariant shape features. This paper proposes a novel method to enhance domain generalization by focusing on nuclear morphology, integrating original images with nuclear segmentation masks. This approach leverages the domain-invariant nature of nuclei and their spatial organization to improve model robustness. A unique regularisation technique aligns the representations of masks and original images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that this method significantly improves out-of-domain generalization and robustness to image corruptions and adversarial attacks.", "affiliation": "University of Oslo", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "BmwcbNYkuH/podcast.wav"}
