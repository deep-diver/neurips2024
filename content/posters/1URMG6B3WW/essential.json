This leads to suboptimal AI strategies, especially in complex, large-scale games.  The extreme interpretation of this \u2013 completely forgetting past information \u2013 causes excessive abstraction problems.\n\nThis paper introduces KrwEmd, a novel algorithm designed to solve this problem.  KrwEmd uses a combination of **K-recall win rate features (historical information) and earth mover's distance** to classify hands more effectively than previous methods. Experiments in a poker game environment show that KrwEmd outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly when dealing with the same number of abstract infosets. This demonstrates the significant advantage of leveraging historical data in hand abstraction.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Gaming"}, "podcast_path": "1URMG6B3WW/podcast.wav"}
