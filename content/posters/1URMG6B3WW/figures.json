The top node represents the initial state. Each subsequent level represents a phase in the game. The branches from each node represent possible actions or outcomes.

It shows the exploitability (a measure of how well a strategy performs against optimal play) over the course of 3.7 x 10^10 training iterations. Different hyperparameter settings for KrwEmd are tested (16-4-1, 7-5-3, 1-1-1, and 3-5-7) showcasing its performance under various configurations. The plot helps evaluate KrwEmd's efficiency in comparison to existing algorithms in this specific scenario.", "section": "5 K-Recall Winrate Abstraction with Earth Mover's Distance"}, {"figure_path": "1URMG6B3WW/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Full abstraction setting experiment, trained for 5.5 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> iterations.", "description": "This figure displays the results of an experiment evaluating the performance of different hand abstraction methods in a Texas Hold'em game setting.  The x-axis represents the number of training iterations, and the y-axis shows the exploitability (in milli big blinds per game).  The experiment uses a \"full abstraction\" setting where both players use the same abstraction method. Two sets of experiments are shown: one with symmetric abstraction (where both players use the same abstraction) and one with asymmetric abstraction (where one player uses a specific abstraction while the other uses full information). The various lines represent different hand abstraction methods including lossless isomorphism (LI), potential winrate isomorphism (PWI), K-recall winrate isomorphism (KRWI), and KrwEmd with different hyperparameter sets.", "section": "7 Experiment"}]
