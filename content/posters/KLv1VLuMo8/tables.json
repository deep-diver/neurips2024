It shows the average normalized performance across different traffic control domains (Traffic Signal, Eco-driving, Advisory Autonomy) and their respective context variations (e.g., inflow, speed limit, penetration rate). The baselines include Independent training (training separate models for each task) and Multi-task learning (training a single model for all tasks).  Sequential baselines include randomly selecting tasks, selecting tasks equidistantly across context space, a greedy task selection strategy, and an oracle method (Sequential Oracle transfer, which knows the optimal task selection). The proposed method, MBTL (Model-Based Transfer Learning), is also shown. Higher scores indicate better performance.", "section": "5.2 Traffic benchmark experiments"}, {"figure_path": "KLv1VLuMo8/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparative performance of different methods on traffic CMDPs", "description": "This table compares the performance of various methods for solving contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) in traffic control domains.
