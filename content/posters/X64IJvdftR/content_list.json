Different from traditional deep neural networks (DNNs) that build standard explicit deep learning layers, implicit layers define the output as the solution to certain closed-form functions of the input. These implicit layers can represent infinitely deep neural networks using only one single layer that is defined implicitly. The unique definition endows implicit models with the capability to model continuous physical systems, a task that traditional DNNs cannot accomplish (Chen et al., 2018). Additionally, the implicit function theorem enhances memory efficiency by eliminating the need to store intermediate states during forward propagation (Chen et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019). Furthermore, implicit models offer a valuable accuracy-efficiency trade-off, making them adaptable to varying application requirements (Chen et al., 2018).

Among these, deep equilibrium model defines the implicit layer by solving a fixed-point problem (Bai et al., 2019, 2020). There are many fundamental works investigating the existence and the convergence of the fixed point (Winston & Kolter, 2020; Revay et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2021b; Ling et al., 2023). With many advantages, DEQs achieve superior performance in many tasks, such as image recognition (Bai et al., 2020), image generation (Pokle et al., 2022), graph modeling (Gu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022), language modeling (Bai et al., 2019), and solving complex equations (Marwah et al., 2023). Though DEQs catch up with the performance of DNNs, the computation inefficiency borders the deployment of deep implicit models in practice (Chen et al., 2018; Dupont et al., 2019; Bai et al., 2019). Related works focus on reusing information from diffusion models and optical flows, demonstrating the effectiveness of reducing computational redundancy of DEQs (Bai & Melas-Kyriazi, 2024; Bai et al., 2022).

Some existing works improve the robustness of DEQs by applying adversarial training (Gurumurthy et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023, 2022). Different from the empirical defense like adversarial training, certified defenses theoretically guarantee the predictions in a small ball maintain as a constant (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019). The most common way to certify robustness is to define a convex program, which lower bounds the worst-case perturbed output of the network (Raghunathan et al., 2018; Wong & Kolter, 2018). The increasing computation complexity in high-dimension optimization hinders the generalization of these methods. Interval bound propagation (IBP) is another certification method for neural networks, which computes an upper bound of the class margin through forward propagation (Gowal et al., 2018). However, the layer-bylayer computation mode brings a potentially loose certified radius. Recently, randomized smoothing has drawn much attention due to its flexibility (Cohen et al., 2019). Randomized smoothing certifies $\\ell_{2}$ -norm robustness for arbitrary classifiers by constructing a smoothed version of the classifier. There are some existing works certifying robustness for DEQs. Most of them adapt IBP to DEQs by constructing a joint fixed-point problem (Wei & Kolter, 2021; Li et al., 2022).
