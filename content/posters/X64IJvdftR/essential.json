Existing certification methods for DEQs using deterministic techniques are computationally expensive and limited to specific DEQ architectures.  This creates a major hurdle for using DEQs in real-world scenarios with large datasets.\nThis research introduces Serialized Random Smoothing (SRS), a novel randomized smoothing approach to address these limitations. SRS leverages historical information to significantly reduce redundant computation. The researchers also derive a new certified radius estimation, ensuring theoretical correctness. Experimental results on image recognition datasets show that SRS accelerates DEQ certification by up to 7x with minimal accuracy loss, enabling certification on large-scale datasets like ImageNet for the first time.", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "X64IJvdftR/podcast.wav"}
