The intrinsic similarity is measured using the affine alignment method (dAff(V)), while the extrinsic similarity (d\") is calculated based on the performance on downstream tasks.  The plot shows a positive correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic similarity, suggesting that encoders that are intrinsically similar also tend to perform similarly on downstream tasks. The data points are grouped by the \"mappability\" of the encoders, illustrating how easily an encoder can be transformed into another using affine transformations.
