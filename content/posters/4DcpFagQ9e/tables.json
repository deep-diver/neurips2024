The metrics used for comparison include CLIP Score (measuring alignment between generated 3D shapes and text prompts), CLIP IQA (assessing image quality, sharpness, and realism), ImageReward (imitating human preferences), and the percentage of generation failures (diverged). The table also provides the average generation time and VRAM usage for each method. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the performance and efficiency of different approaches to text-to-3D generation.", "section": "6.1 3D generation"}, {"figure_path": "4DcpFagQ9e/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparisons to baselines for text-to-3D generation, evaluated by CLIP Score and CLIP IQA.

The comparison is conducted with 5000 steps of each method.  Lower values are better for ImageReward and higher values are better for the remaining metrics. The results indicate similar performance between the two methods, but SDI shows slightly better results in certain metrics.", "section": "6.2 Ablations"}]
