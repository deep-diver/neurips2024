However, real-world data, particularly graph data, often exhibits heterogeneity in node types, attributes, and structures, posing significant challenges for direct application of LDL methods.  Existing LDL approaches struggle to effectively handle such heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal label distribution predictions.\nThis paper introduces Heterogeneous Graph Label Distribution Learning (HGDL), a novel framework designed to address the limitations of existing LDL methods on heterogeneous graphs. HGDL employs a two-component approach: proactive graph topology homogenization to preemptively address node heterogeneity and a topology and content consistency-aware graph transformer to learn consistent representations across meta-paths and node attributes. The proposed framework demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in handling the complexities of heterogeneous graph data. The code and datasets are publicly available, facilitating further research and development in the field.", "affiliation": "Florida Atlantic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "OwguhIAh8R/podcast.wav"}
