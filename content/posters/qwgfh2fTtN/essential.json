This poses a significant challenge as AI systems are rapidly advancing beyond human capabilities. The research tackles this problem by exploring \"easy-to-hard generalization.\" This approach trains reward models (evaluators) using human annotations on simple tasks and utilizes these trained evaluators to assess solutions for more complex problems. This allows for scalable AI alignment beyond human expertise. \nThe proposed easy-to-hard generalization approach uses process-supervised reward models trained on easy tasks to evaluate and improve the generators on hard tasks.  Experiments demonstrate successful easy-to-hard generalization across various tasks and model sizes, achieving significant performance gains, particularly in challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The research also investigates various RL approaches for optimizing generators against evaluators, achieving state-of-the-art results.  This novel alignment methodology enables AI progress beyond the boundaries of human supervision, which is a significant step towards robust, scalable, and reliable AI development. **The key insight is that an evaluator trained on easy tasks can be effectively used to evaluate solutions for harder tasks, thus enabling easy-to-hard generalization.**", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "qwgfh2fTtN/podcast.wav"}
