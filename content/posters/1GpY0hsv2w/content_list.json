In practice, the human decision-making process is understood as finding the most possible sequence of releases based on cognitive information [41]. Human planning is a sequential process that ensures temporal consistency and global optimality. However, prior methods of ObjectNav employ single-step planning rather than sequential planning for navigation.

Modular methods [4, 31, 65, 59, 64] attempt to address this by constructing a semantic map during navigation to geometrically store historical observations, helping the agent avoid redundant searching. However, their decision-making process is still single-step. They train a waypoint predictor via supervised learning to plan the next subgoal based on the current semantic map and target.

Diffusion models gradually add noise to the data during the diffusion process, transforming the data distribution into a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution). In the reserve process (i.e., denoising process), noise is iteratively predicted and removed, generating complex data distributions from the simple random distribution. This iterative refinement learning manner enhances the stability and controllability of learning high-dimensional data distributions.

Then, an agent equipped with a semantic map module is driven to follow these trajectories, gathering semantic maps and poses at each timestep along the way. The collected data are further divided into data pairs consisting of a semantic map at a given moment and the corresponding future trajectory segments.

Goal-driven navigation [22, 42, 43, 44, 63] is a fundamental task in embodied AI, and this paper focuses on a specific variant of this task, namely the ObjectNav task, where the goal is defined by object semantics. Current works for ObjectNav task can be categorized into two types: end-to-end learning methods and modular methods. End-to-end learning methods develop a navigation policy by interacting with the environment trained by reinforcement learning (RL) [45, 66, 61] or imitation learning (IL) [34, 33]. These approaches typically take inputs such as target object categories and extra information, including visual representations[20, 29, 18] and object relationship graphs[51, 62, 11, 55]. Then they predict single-step planning in each timestep. The endto-end method implicitly encodes all past observations, which results in the loss of geographic spatial information. Consequently, its generalization ability in environments with complex layouts is limited. Modular methods [4, 5, 6] typically preserve a top-down geometric map enriched with semantic details. They are also single-step planners that predict waypoints as sub-goals at each time step based on the constructed semantic map. Through supervised learning, PONI[31] learns to predict the nearest frontier with the current semantic map to infer where to explore, while PEANUT[59] directly predicts the target location in the form of a probabilistic goal map. Current end-to-end learning methods are single-step planners with implicit memory, while modular methods are single-step planners with geometric memory. Alternatively, our trajectory diffusion approach is a sequence planner with geometric memory, predicting future sequential trajectories based on the current semantic map.

Diffusion models (DDPMs [16]) are generative models that learn complex data distributions by iteratively predicting and removing randomly sampled noise to obtain target samples.

Diffusion models predominantly use UNet-based [36, 37] and Transformer-based [30, 32, 46] architectures. UNet excels in preserving spatial details for high-resolution images, while Transformers capture global context, suited for sequential data. Therefore, we adopt a Transformer-based diffusion model to implement our trajectory diffusion.

The agent performs one of several discrete actions, includeing move_forward, turn_left, turn_right, and stop. The action stop is autonomously initiated by the agent once it determines to complete the task.

Sparse rewards are desirable, but they result in most sample trajectories having difficulty obtaining positive rewards, making the learning process challenging. Moreover, as the policy parameters are updated, previously sampled trajectories become obsolete, necessitating the collection of new data. Consequently, the low sample efficiency of end-to-end learning methods results in high computational costs for training.
