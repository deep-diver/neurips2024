### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current research on scaling large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on model parameters and training data, often overlooking the crucial role of vocabulary size. This leads to a significant variability in vocabulary sizes across different LLMs, potentially hindering their performance and efficiency.  The paper identifies this as a major limitation and emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the LLM scaling laws that consider vocabulary size.

This paper introduces three novel approaches for predicting the optimal vocabulary size for LLMs based on compute budget, loss function analysis, and derivative estimation. These methods are validated empirically, demonstrating that larger models indeed benefit from larger vocabularies.  The study highlights that many existing LLMs use insufficient vocabulary sizes, leading to suboptimal performance.  By jointly considering tokenization, model size and training data, the research improves downstream performance and offers valuable insights for optimizing LLM training and deployment.

> This figure illustrates the relationship between the number of non-vocabulary parameters (Nnv) in a language model and the corresponding optimal number of vocabulary parameters (Nopt).  The data suggests a power-law relationship, where Nopt scales slower than Nnv (y < 1).  The plot shows empirical results from model training, which generally align with the predictions made using three different approaches proposed in the paper. Larger circles represent higher loss values during training.

### In-depth insights


#### Vocab Scaling Laws
The concept of 'Vocab Scaling Laws' explores how the size of a language model's vocabulary affects its performance and scaling behavior.  **Research suggests that larger models benefit from significantly larger vocabularies than conventionally used.**  This is because an insufficient vocabulary can limit the model's ability to capture nuances of language, hindering both training efficiency and downstream performance.  However, increasing vocabulary size also comes with computational costs. Therefore, finding the **optimal vocabulary size, which scales with model size and compute budget, is a crucial aspect of efficient LLM training.**  This research highlights the need to move beyond simplistic scaling laws focusing solely on parameters and data, and instead consider the intricate interplay between vocabulary, model size, compute resources, and data quantity for efficient and effective large language model development.

#### Optimal Vocab Size
The concept of 'optimal vocabulary size' in large language models (LLMs) is explored in depth, challenging the conventional wisdom of using fixed vocabulary sizes.  **Research reveals a strong correlation between optimal vocabulary size and the model's computational budget**, suggesting larger models benefit from significantly larger vocabularies than currently implemented. Three complementary approaches, IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric loss fitting, are utilized to predict this optimal size. The findings consistently indicate that most LLMs underutilize their vocabulary capacity, hindering potential performance gains. **Empirically, increasing the vocabulary size demonstrably improves downstream task performance** within the same computational constraints.  However, **the research also highlights the non-trivial trade-offs involved**, acknowledging that excessively large vocabularies can negatively impact performance due to undertraining and data sparsity issues. This highlights the importance of carefully balancing vocabulary size with both the model's capacity and the amount of training data.

#### IsoFLOPs Analysis
IsoFLOPs analysis, short for Isofunctional FLOPs analysis, is a crucial methodology in evaluating the scaling laws of large language models (LLMs).  It involves training multiple LLMs with varying model parameters (such as vocabulary size and number of non-vocabulary parameters), but maintaining a constant computational budget (measured in FLOPs). **By holding FLOPs constant, IsoFLOPs analysis isolates the effect of individual parameters on model performance**, allowing researchers to determine optimal parameter configurations for a given compute budget.  **This approach is particularly insightful for analyzing the relationship between vocabulary size and overall LLM performance**, shedding light on whether larger models benefit from larger vocabularies and how this scales with computational constraints. The results from IsoFLOPs analysis are often visualized as power laws, demonstrating how the optimal vocabulary size changes as the computational budget varies.  **This methodology provides a systematic way to optimize LLM development by identifying compute-optimal vocabulary sizes, maximizing the performance gains for a given level of computational resources.** By carefully considering the impact of individual parameters within a fixed FLOPs budget, IsoFLOPs analysis helps researchers make better-informed decisions about LLM architecture and resource allocation.

#### Derivative Method
A derivative-based method offers a computationally efficient approach to estimating the optimal vocabulary size for large language models.  **It leverages the concept of finding the minimum FLOPs (floating-point operations) required to achieve a certain loss by calculating the derivative of FLOPs with respect to vocabulary size.** This approach cleverly sidesteps the need for extensive experimentation across various vocabulary configurations.  However, **its accuracy relies heavily on the precision of the FLOPs equation and the pre-existing relationship between FLOPs and other model attributes.**  While it provides a fast estimation, it doesn't independently optimize the allocation of other crucial resources like model parameters and training data, instead relying on pre-existing knowledge about their relationships with FLOPs. This reliance on empirically derived relationships limits its generalizability and makes it less suitable for scenarios beyond compute-optimal settings.  Despite these limitations, the method's speed and simplicity make it useful for quick estimations during preliminary model configurations.

#### Future Directions
Future research directions in large language model (LLM) scaling should prioritize a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between vocabulary size, model architecture, and training data.  **Extending current scaling laws to encompass diverse model architectures (beyond transformers) and multilingual settings is crucial.**  Furthermore, investigating the optimal vocabulary size in the context of specific downstream tasks and data scarcity is needed.  **The impact of different tokenization strategies and their effects on scaling laws should be explored.**  Finally, **developing more sophisticated loss functions that accurately capture the influence of vocabulary size on model performance** across various compute budgets will pave the way for more efficient and effective LLM training. Addressing these areas will unlock the full potential of LLMs and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of their development.

The color intensity represents the log frequency of words.  The figure shows that smaller vocabularies lead to a more dispersed distribution of embeddings, while larger vocabularies show more clustering, especially for low-frequency words, indicating insufficient training for those embeddings.  This suggests an optimal vocabulary size exists that balances adequate representation of words with sufficient training for all embeddings.

BPC measures the average number of bits needed to represent each character in the text corpus. The high correlation (p=0.9888) and low error (e=0.0683) indicate that these two metrics are highly related, demonstrating the effectiveness of Lu as a metric for comparing language models with different vocabulary sizes.

It shows a strong negative correlation between the unigram-normalized loss and the average normalized accuracy across seven downstream tasks.  This confirms that Lu is a suitable metric for comparing models with varying vocabulary sizes, as it avoids the bias introduced by the raw language modeling loss, which increases with vocabulary size.
