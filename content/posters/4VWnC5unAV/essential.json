Existing analyses often rely on worst-case scenarios or simplifying assumptions, failing to capture the nuances of real-world optimization problems.  This limits our ability to precisely compare algorithms' performance and design better strategies. \nThis paper addresses these limitations by developing a novel framework for analyzing stochastic adaptive learning rate algorithms using a deterministic system of ODEs. The analysis reveals that the data covariance matrix significantly influences the training dynamics and performance of these algorithms. For instance, a simple, commonly used adaptive strategy, the exact line search, can exhibit arbitrarily slower convergence than the best fixed learning rate. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of AdaGrad-Norm, demonstrating its convergence to a deterministic constant in certain situations and identifying a phase transition when the eigenvalues follow a power-law distribution.", "affiliation": "McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "4VWnC5unAV/podcast.wav"}
