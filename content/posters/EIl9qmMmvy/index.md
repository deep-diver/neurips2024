### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from existing data without additional online interactions.  However, existing model-free methods often struggle due to extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution actions and the difficulty of handling multi-modal policy distributions.  Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods offer an implicit regularization technique but are limited by unimodal Gaussian policy extraction.

This paper introduces Diffusion-DICE, a novel offline RL approach that tackles these limitations.  It views DICE methods as a transformation from behavior to optimal policy distributions and leverages diffusion models to perform this transformation directly.  By carefully selecting actions using a value function, it minimizes error exploitation and outperforms existing diffusion-based and DICE-based methods in benchmark evaluations.  The in-sample learning objective further enhances its robustness and efficiency.

> üîº This figure illustrates the difference between the guide-then-select paradigm used in Diffusion-DICE and the guide-only or select-only approaches used in previous diffusion-based offline RL methods.  The guide-then-select approach uses in-sample actions for training, minimizing error exploitation in the value function. In contrast, guide-only methods use predictions of actions' values to guide toward high-return actions, and select-only methods sample many actions and choose the best one according to the value function, both introducing potential error.

### In-depth insights


#### DICE Transform
The concept of a "DICE Transform" in offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a novel perspective on distribution correction methods.  It suggests viewing DICE (Distribution Correction Estimation) not merely as an optimization technique but as a **direct transformation** between the behavior policy distribution and the optimal policy distribution. This reframing allows the use of generative models, such as diffusion models, to directly learn this mapping. The strength of this approach lies in its potential to bypass the limitations of traditional methods that often struggle with multi-modal optimal policy distributions, and to leverage the expressive power of generative models for handling complex probability densities. A key benefit would be the capability of **generating in-distribution actions** by the transform, thus mitigating the risks of out-of-distribution errors that plague many offline RL techniques. The challenge, however, is the need for careful design to ensure the transform accurately reflects the optimal policy without overfitting to the training data and to handle potential issues of multimodality.

#### Diffusion Guidance
Diffusion guidance, in the context of offline reinforcement learning, represents a novel approach to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.  It leverages the power of diffusion models to subtly transform the behavior policy distribution into the target optimal policy distribution. This transformation is not a direct mapping but rather a carefully guided process, using the optimal distribution ratio (often learned via DICE) to steer the diffusion process towards high-value, in-distribution actions. The key advantage lies in the **in-sample nature** of this guidance: it relies solely on data from the observed behavior, minimizing the risk of extrapolation errors from out-of-distribution actions. This approach contrasts with other methods, where direct value estimation on potentially out-of-distribution actions from a diffusion model can lead to significant error.  **The guide-then-select paradigm** further refines the process, generating multiple candidate actions and selecting the optimal one based on an accurate value function. This two-step process enhances efficiency and robustness, particularly in scenarios with multi-modal optimal policies.

#### In-sample Learning
In-sample learning, a crucial aspect of offline reinforcement learning, focuses on training models exclusively using data from the available offline dataset.  This approach directly addresses the challenge of avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) errors, a common pitfall in offline RL. Unlike methods that rely on value function estimates for OOD actions, **in-sample learning minimizes error by leveraging only in-distribution actions**. This significantly enhances the reliability of the trained policy and avoids the overestimation of value often associated with OOD samples.  By restricting training to the data distribution, in-sample learning ensures a more robust and effective policy for the target environment.  The key is that the learned policy remains within the bounds of the observed data distribution preventing unpredictable behavior outside of this range.  However, the success of this approach is **heavily dependent on the quality and representativeness of the initial dataset.** A biased or insufficient dataset would likely result in an inadequate policy even with a perfectly implemented in-sample learning strategy.

#### Guide-then-Select
The "Guide-then-Select" paradigm offers a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL) by cleverly combining the strengths of generative models and value-based methods.  The **guidance phase** leverages a diffusion model trained on in-sample data to generate candidate actions, which are carefully selected in the **selection phase** based on their predicted values derived from a critic network.  This dual approach helps address several limitations of previous methods.  **In-sample learning** mitigates the issue of extrapolation error, making the method robust and reliable.  **Multi-modality** in optimal policies is addressed by evaluating multiple candidates instead of relying on single actions, potentially improving performance on complex tasks.  The framework's strong performance on benchmark datasets suggests its effectiveness in combining generative modeling and value estimation for offline RL, providing a promising avenue for future research.

#### Error Exploitation
The concept of 'error exploitation' in offline reinforcement learning (RL) centers on how algorithms might mistakenly leverage errors in their learned models to produce seemingly good, yet ultimately suboptimal, results.  **Guide-based methods**, which use learned value functions to guide the generation of actions, are particularly vulnerable.  If the value function contains errors, especially overestimations of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, the algorithm may be misled towards these inaccurate high-value regions.  **Select-based methods**, which sample many actions and select the best one, can also suffer if the value function is inaccurate.  This is because the selection process may pick an OOD action with an erroneously high value.  **Diffusion-DICE's strength lies in its ability to mitigate this problem**. By focusing on in-sample data and a guide-then-select paradigm, it minimizes reliance on potentially erroneous value estimations for OOD actions, thereby reducing the risk of error exploitation and achieving better performance.
