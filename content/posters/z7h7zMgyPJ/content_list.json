Before giving the formal details, we present the main ideas in our proof. Our analysis is at a high level inspired by recent work of Aden-Ali et al. [1] for realizable PAC learning. The first ingredient we need is the notion of margins. For a voting classifier $\\begin{array}{r}{f(x)=\\mathrm{sign}(\\sum_{h\\in\\mathcal{H}}\\bar{\\alpha_{h}}h(x))}\\end{array}$ with $\\alpha_{h}\\geq0$ for all $h$ , consider the function $\\begin{array}{r}{f^{\\prime}(x)=\\sum_{h\\in\\mathcal{H}}\\alpha_{h}^{\\prime}h(x)}\\end{array}$ with $\\begin{array}{r}{\\alpha_{h}^{\\prime}=\\alpha_{h}/\\sum_{h}{\\alpha_{h}}}\\end{array}$ . That is, $f^{\\prime}$ is simply the voting classifier $f$ without the $\\mathrm{{sign}(\\cdot)}$ and normalized to have coefficients summing to 1. The margin of $f$ on a sample $(x,c(x))$ is then $c(x)f^{\\prime}(x)\\in[-1,1]$ . The margin is 1 if all hypotheses combined by $f$ agree and are correct. It is 0 if half of the mass is on hypothesis that are correct and half of the mass is on the hypothesis that are wrong. We can thus think of the margin as a confidence of the voting classifier. Margins have been extensively studied in the context of boosting and were originally introduced to give theoretical justification for the impressive practical performance of AdaBoost [2]. In particular, there are strong generalization bounds for voting classifiers with large margins [2, 6, 11]. Indeed, the best known sample complexity bound for AdaBoost, as stated in (1), is derived by showing that AdaBoost produces a voting classifier with margins $\\Omega(\\gamma)$ .

This fact follows from previous work on Rademacher co\u221amplexity. Note that this is sub-optimal compared to our target error by a polynomial factor since $\\bar{\\sqrt{x}}\\geq\\bar{x}$ for $x$ between 0 and 1.

Unfortunately, if we examine (1) carefully and state $\\varepsilon$ as a function of $m$ , we get $\\varepsilon=O(\\bar{d}\\ln(\\bar{m_{}}/d)\\ln m/(\\gamma^{2}m))$ . The problem is that the two log-factors are not bounded by a polynomial in $d/(\\gamma^{2}m)$ .

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
