The results are shown for varying numbers of inference steps (1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200), demonstrating the impact of the number of inference steps on model performance.  It highlights the performance difference between SemFlow and the DSM methods, especially when fewer inference steps are used.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Studies"}]
