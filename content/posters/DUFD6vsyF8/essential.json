Existing FRL methods struggle with multi-task scenarios, where each agent has a unique reward function, and decentralized settings, where agents only communicate with neighbors.  This limits scalability and the ability to find optimal global policies.\nThis work presents novel federated natural policy gradient (NPG) and actor-critic (NAC) methods designed for multi-task learning in fully decentralized environments.  These methods leverage gradient tracking for accurate global Q-function estimation, and they are theoretically proven to converge quickly, even with limited information exchange between agents and function approximation errors. The findings significantly advance the understanding and efficiency of FRL in complex multi-task settings.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "DUFD6vsyF8/podcast.wav"}
