We render frontal views at a resolution of $1024\\times1024$ with Blender EEVEE as input for all methods. All generated mesh results are normalized to the bounding box $[-0.5,0.5]$ to ensure alignment. The geometric quality is assessed by calculating the distance to the ground truth mesh using metrics such as Chamfer Distance (CD), Volume IoU, and F-Score. Concurrently, we render 24 views around the object, selecting one of $[0,15,30]$ for elevation angles and 8 evenly distributed azimuth angles spanning a full 360-degree rotation. We employ PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and Clip-Similarity [38] to evaluate the visual quality. The results are presented in Table 1. As evidenced in table, both our geometric and material quality outperform those of existing methods. We find that ISOMER can even be used to improve the consistency of other methods. For example, in Table 1, we replace Wonder3D\u2019s reconstruction method with ISOMER, which is not only faster but also of higher quality.

Edge collapse can prevent the creation of topological artifacts and maintain the quality of the mesh. Edge Split: This is the opposite of edge collapse. In edge split, an edge that is longer than a specified maximum length is divided into two, creating new vertices at the midpoint of the edge. This operation is used to refine the mesh, ensuring that the local edge length is kept close to the optimal length. It helps to maintain the quality of the mesh by avoiding edges that are too long, which could lead to an inaccurate representation of the surface. Edge Flip: Edge flip is an operation that adjusts the connectivity of the mesh to improve its quality. It involves flipping an edge within a triangle to connect two non-adjacent vertices, effectively changing the triangulation of the mesh. This can help to maintain the degree of the vertices close to their optimal value, which is typically six for internal vertices (or four for boundary vertices).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
