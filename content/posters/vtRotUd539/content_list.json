Though the phenomenon has been measured in a variety of settings, its emergence is typically explained via data-agnostic approaches, such as the unconstrained features model. In this work, we introduce a data-dependent setting where DNC forms due to feature learning through the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The AGOP is defined with respect to a learned predictor and is equal to the uncentered covariance matrix of its input-output gradients averaged over the training dataset. The Deep Recursive Feature Machine (Deep RFM) is a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate empirically that DNC occurs in Deep RFM across standard settings as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. Further, we theoretically explain DNC in Deep RFM in an asymptotic setting and as a result of kernel learning. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally. In particular, we show that the right singular vectors and values of the weights can be responsible for the majority of within-class variability collapse for DNNs trained in the feature learning regime.

A promising avenue to understand the hidden mechanisms of DNNs is Neural Collapse (NC) [Papyan et al., 2020]. NC is a widely observed structural property of overparametrized DNNs, occurring in the terminal phase of gradient descent training on classification tasks. This property is linked with the performance of DNNs, such as generalization and robustness [Papyan et al., 2020, Su et al., 2023]. NC is defined by four properties that describe the geometry of feature representations of the training data in the last layer. Of these, in this paper we focus on the following two, because they are relevant in the context of deeper layers. The within-class variability collapse (NC1) states that feature vectors of the training samples within a single class collapse to the common class-mean. The orthogonality or simplex equiangular tight frame property (NC2) states that these class-means form an orthogonal or simplex equiangular tight frame. While initially observed in just the final hidden layer, these properties were measured for the intermediate layers of DNNs as well [Rangamani et al., 2023, He and Su, 2022], indicating that NC progresses depth-wise. This has lead to the study of Deep Neural Collapse (DNC), a direct depth-wise extension of standard NC [S\u00faken\u00edk et al., 2023].

This assumes that DNNs are infinitely expressive and, thus, optimizes for the feature vectors in the last layer directly. The deep UFM (DUFM) was then introduced to account for more layers [S\u00faken\u00edk et al., 2023, Tirer and Bruna, 2022]. The (D)UFM has been identified as a useful analogy for neural network collapse, as (D)NC emerges naturally in this setting for a variety of loss functions and training regimes (see Section 2). However, (D)UFM discards the training data and most of the network completely, thus ignoring also the role of learning in DNC formation. This is a serious gap to fully understand the formation of DNC in the context of the full DNN pipeline.

Recent work has utilized this object to understand various surprising phenomena in neural networks including grokking, lottery tickets, simplicity bias, and adversarial examples [Radhakrishnan et al., 2024a]. Additional work incorporated layer-wise linear transformation with the AGOP into kernel machines, to model the deep feature learning mechanism of neural networks [Beaglehole et al., 2023]. The output of their backpropagation-free method, Deep Recursive Feature Machines (Deep RFM), is a standard neural network at i.i.d. initialization, where each random weight matrix is additionally right-multiplied by the AGOP of a kernel machine trained on the input to that layer. Their method was shown to improve performance of convolutional kernels on vision datasets and recreate the edge detection ability of convolutional neural networks.

We verify these claims with an extensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates a consistent formation of DNC in Deep RFM across several vision datasets. We then provide theoretical analyses that explain the mechanism for Deep RFM in the asymptotic high-dimensional regime and derive NC formation as a consequence of kernel learning (Section 5). Our first analysis is primarily based on the approximate linearity of kernel matrices when the dimension and the number of data points are large and proportional. Our second analysis demonstrates that DNC is an implicit bias of optimizing over the choice of kernel and its regression coefficients.

In particular, we show that within-class variability for DNNs trained using SGD with small initialization is primarily reduced by the application of the right singular vectors of the weight matrix and the subsequent multiplication with its singular values (Section 6). These singular structures of a weight matrix $W$ are fully deducible from the Gram matrix of the weights at each layer, $W^{\\top}W.$ Radhakrishnan et al. [2024a], Beaglehole et al. [2023] have identified that, in many settings and across all layers of the network, $W^{\\bar{\\top}}W$ is highly correlated with the average gradient outer product (AGOP) with respect to the inputs to that layer, in a statement termed the Neural Feature Ansatz (NFA).

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
