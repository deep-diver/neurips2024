This is a crucial area because acquiring labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming.  The paper likely explores techniques such as **self-training**, **semi-supervised learning**, or **consistency regularization** to effectively utilize unlabeled data.  **Self-training**, for instance, might involve training a model on labeled data, then using it to predict labels for unlabeled data, and subsequently retraining the model on the expanded dataset.  **Semi-supervised learning** methods aim to learn from both labeled and unlabeled examples simultaneously.  **Consistency regularization** techniques enforce consistency in the model's predictions for different augmented versions of the same unlabeled data point. The paper's findings likely demonstrate a significant improvement in model accuracy or robustness when integrating unlabeled data, showcasing a cost-effective approach for enhancing model performance."}}, {"heading_title": "Robust Depth Model", "details": {"summary": "A robust depth model is crucial for reliable performance in various applications, particularly in challenging conditions.  **Robustness** typically encompasses the model's ability to handle noisy or incomplete data, variations in lighting and viewpoint, and the presence of artifacts or occlusions.  Achieving robustness often requires careful design choices, including the selection of appropriate training data and loss functions, and the incorporation of techniques that improve generalization.  **Data augmentation** plays a critical role in training a robust model. **Synthetic data**, combined with real-world data, can help to mitigate overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen situations.  The choice of **model architecture** is equally important; using architectures with inherent robustness can significantly improve results.
