Previous MDE models often rely on real-world datasets, which can be noisy and lack diversity.  This creates challenges in training robust and accurate models, especially in complex or nuanced scenes.  Real-world dataset annotation is also expensive and time-consuming, limiting the scale of existing datasets. \nDepth Anything V2 tackles these limitations by using **synthetic training images** to generate high-quality depth labels. This addresses the noise and diversity issues in real-world datasets. The model is then improved further through a **teacher-student training approach**. A large teacher model is trained on synthetic images, and a smaller student model learns from this teacher via large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. The paper also introduces a new evaluation benchmark, DA-2K, with precise annotations and diverse scenes to improve the evaluation of MDE models. The proposed methods result in a superior MDE model compared to previous state-of-the-art models in both speed and accuracy.", "affiliation": "TikTok", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "cFTi3gLJ1X/podcast.wav"}
