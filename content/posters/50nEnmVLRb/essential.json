Existing bandit algorithms frequently make simplifying assumptions about the feedback, such as assuming the reward for each item is disclosed instead of single scalar feedback for the set. This limits their applicability to real-world scenarios. \nThe proposed GP-TopK algorithm addresses these challenges by using Gaussian processes with a Kendall kernel. This allows it to model reward functions without restrictive assumptions on feedback.  The paper shows that GP-TopK achieves sub-linear regret and outperforms baselines in simulations, making it a significant improvement over existing methods for top-k recommendations.  The algorithm's computational efficiency is also improved using novel feature representations and iterative algorithms.", "affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "50nEnmVLRb/podcast.wav"}
