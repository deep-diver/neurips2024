{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers studying learning in strategic environments.  It challenges the common assumption that repeated interactions alone enable uninformed players to achieve optimal outcomes. **The findings highlight the persistence of information asymmetry even with repeated interactions**, and **provide a more nuanced understanding of learning dynamics**, which is vital for developing effective learning algorithms and strategies in strategic settings.", "summary": "In strategic settings, repeated interactions alone may not enable uninformed players to achieve optimal outcomes, highlighting the persistent impact of information asymmetry.", "takeaways": ["Information asymmetry significantly impacts learning outcomes in strategic interactions.", "Repeated interactions alone are insufficient for uninformed agents to attain their Stackelberg optimal value.", "The quality of information alone doesn't solely determine the agent's ability to achieve optimal outcomes."], "tldr": "Many studies assume that agents in strategic games can overcome uncertainty about others' preferences and achieve optimal outcomes solely through repeated interactions. This paper challenges this assumption by focusing on the impact of information asymmetry in such settings. It investigates whether agents can attain the value of their Stackelberg optimal strategy through repeated interactions, considering scenarios with different levels of information asymmetry.\nThe paper employs a meta-game framework to analyze the repeated strategic interactions, where players' actions are learning algorithms.  It demonstrates that when one player has complete game knowledge, information gaps persist, and the uninformed player may never achieve their optimal outcome even with repeated interactions.  However, when both players initially have uncertain knowledge, the situation is far more complex and depends heavily on the game's structure.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Dlm6Z1RrjV/podcast.wav"}
