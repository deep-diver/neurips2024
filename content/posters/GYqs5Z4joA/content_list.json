This superior performance is due to: 1) The SNN structure\u2019s alignment with the biological basis of sEMG generation, providing a natural modeling of the processes. 2) The SJA mechanism\u2019s enhancement of sparse spike train features, focusing on the key characteristics of sEMG signals. Compared to other SNN models like LSNN [7], $\\mathrm{SIB+SNN}$ [78], and SCNN, our model achieves higher accuracy. Models like $\\mathrm{SIB+SNN}$ and SCNN perform lower, likely due to the absence of a feature enhancement design like SJA, which is crucial for capturing the temporal dynamics of sEMG signals. Incorporating SJA into Xu et al.\u2018s LSNN network [63] significantly improved performance, demonstrating SJA\u2019s scalability in recurrent SNNs.

Emulating the precise mechanism of neuronal spike transmission in the human brain, SNNs stand at the frontier of biologically inspired artificial intelligence [72], offering potential advancements in neuromorphic computing [18] and beyond. SNN processes information and generates \u2018spikes\u2019 or \u2018impulses\u2019 only when a certain or dynamic threshold of neuron activation is reached, leading to a more efficient representation and transmission of information. Fundamentally, sEMG signals are generated by neural impulses, making them naturally compatible with the processing mechanism of SNNs. The spikes in an SNN represent discrete events in time, which parallels the nature of sEMG signals containing valuable information in spatial (across different muscles) and temporal (over time) dimensions. This innate alignment between SNNs and sEMG data enables the efficient decoding of intricate patterns for gesture recognition. Furthermore, SNNs have lower power consumption compared to traditional DL models [18]. This feature aligns with the typical use case of sEMG in wearable technology, where power efficiency is a crucial consideration [38]. Traditional DL models require substantial computational resources for training and inference, but SNNs operate in an event-driven manner, only processing data when a spike occurs [55].
