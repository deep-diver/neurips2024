It shows the top-1 accuracy and standard deviation achieved by different models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Transformers, GRUs, and Informers, as well as various Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The table highlights SpGesture's superior performance compared to other DNN and SNN baselines.", "section": "5 Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "GYqs5Z4joA/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study results", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study conducted to evaluate the individual contributions of different components of the proposed SpGesture framework.  It shows the impact of various attention mechanisms (Raw Attention, MA-SNN, and Spiking Jaccard Attention), loss functions (NLL and SNLL+KLL), and pseudo-label selection methods (PL, NPL, and PLG) on the overall accuracy of the model, both with and without source-free domain adaptation.  The \"Improved ACC\" column indicates the performance gain achieved by incorporating each component.", "section": "5.2 Ablation Study"}]
