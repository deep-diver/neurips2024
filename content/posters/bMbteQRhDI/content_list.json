Computation heterogeneity in FL has become a critical area of research due to the varying computational capacities of participating clients. In traditional FL setups, each client is expected to perform the same volume of computation, such as training on local datasets for a fixed number of iterations, regardless of their hardware capabilities or resource availability [14, 15, 18, 24, 63, 68]. This assumption leads to inefficiencies, particularly when slower devices cause stragglers that delay model aggregation [23, 44, 64]. Recent work has proposed adaptive aggregation strategies to handle computation heterogeneity by assigning different workloads or varying the number of local updates based on client resources, allowing faster clients to contribute more to the global model while slower clients contribute less frequently [43, 50, 53, 57, 64, 72]. However, these works require the clients to train the full model, so they are infeasible when some of the clients cannot load the full model due to limited computation resources. In contrast, our work extracts a submodel for each client that fits within their computational capacity. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Model Customization in FL. In addition to submodel extraction, another effective method for facilitating model heterogeneity is model customization [11, 28, 46, 66, 77, 80]. This approach allows clients to construct local models that align with their local computation resources. Since the clients\u2019 local models could be very distinct, the existing works implement model aggregation through the technique of knowledge distillation [19, 46, 61, 78]. In detail, each client first locally trains its model on a shared public dataset, and then sends the model's output (i.e., logits) to the server. The server gathers and aggregates clients\u2019 outputs into a unified model output and broadcasts it to the clients [60]. Prior to the next round of local training, the clients thereby fine-tune the local models by incorporating the aggregated logits. Although the process effectively transfers knowledge across heterogeneous models, model customization requires a shared public dataset that should have a similar distribution with the clients\u2019 training data, which is unattainable in some cases [3, 59]. In our work, we do not require a public dataset, rendering it applicable to a broader range of applications. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Model Sparsification in FL. Model sparsification, also known as model pruning, intrigues increasing research focuses with the introduction of lottery ticket hypothesis [16]. This hypothesis addresses the existence of a sparse submodel within a large model, capable of direct training to yield improved performance. Early works [9, 47, 82] have explored sparse models to mitigate the computation overhead. Notably, the industry has recently achieved remarkable advancements in the development of hardware that facilitates the training and inference of sparse models [20, 26, 38, 39]. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the context of FL, two distinct strategies in search of an optimal sparse submodel: dense-to-sparse [27, 31, 41] and sparse-to-sparse [5, 12, 40, 55, 56]. These strategies are distinguished based on whether the global model starts at dense. In both approaches, clients initialize with a global model and iteratively train towards a sparse model to mitigate over-parameterization. Nonetheless, these methods face challenges when client computation capacities differ, particularly when loading the global model exceeds the maximum computation capacities of some clients. Consequently, there arises a need for algorithms capable of tailoring submodels to accommodate various client computation capacities. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "An existing work, Flado [45], realizes that the server tailors the submodels to align with various computation resources among clients. It achieves the performance trade-off between the global model and the clients\u2019 submodels by differentiating model parameters based on their importance levels. However, this advantage comes at the cost of requiring clients to explicitly maintain the importance score of each model parameter. This requirement, consequently, introduces a considerable overhead on each client in terms of both storage and computation, which imposes great challenges on resource-constrained devices. Contrasting with Flado, our FIARSE explores the correlation between a model parameter's importance level and its value. It implicitly represents the importance level through the parameter's value, thereby eliminating the need to explicitly maintain separate importance scores for each model parameter.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u00b7 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
