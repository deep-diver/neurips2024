Existing static and dynamic submodel extraction approaches have limitations: static methods are inflexible and fail to account for model evolution, while dynamic methods may compromise individual submodel performance.  These limitations impact both the training speed and overall accuracy.\nFIARSE addresses these issues through an importance-aware submodel extraction technique.  It dynamically adjusts submodels based on parameter importance, enhancing model efficiency without requiring additional information beyond model parameters.  **FIARSE outperforms existing static and dynamic methods** across various datasets and model sizes, demonstrating its ability to optimize both local submodel accuracy and global model convergence.  **Its theoretical analysis confirms a convergence rate comparable to state-of-the-art FL algorithms**, solidifying its efficiency and effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "bMbteQRhDI/podcast.wav"}
