[{"figure_path": "eddHTvb5eM/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Denoiser performance via average PSNR on held-out images. Our method performs nearly as well as a supervised denoiser, despite being trained exclusively on highly corrupted data without access to clean images.", "description": "The table presents the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in decibels (dB) achieved by different denoising methods on held-out images.  The methods compared are BM3D, the proposed method, Noise2Noise (N2N), and a supervised method.  Results are shown for two noise levels (\u03c3 = 1 and \u03c3 = 2) and two datasets (Imagenet and CBSD68).  The table highlights that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the supervised denoiser, even when trained only on noisy images.", "section": "5 Applications"}]
