As a result, extensive research is focused on formally verifying the safety of DNNs. However, most of the existing $L_{\\infty}$ robustness verification techniques can not handle relational properties common in practical situations. While significant efforts have been invested in verifying the absence of input-specific adversarial examples within the local neighborhood of test inputs, recent studies [Li et al., 2019a] emphasize that input-specific attacks are impractical regardless. Conversely, practical attack scenarios [Liu et al., 2023, Li et al., 2019b,a] involve the creation of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) [Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017], which are crafted to impact a substantial portion of inputs from the training distribution. RaVeN [Banerjee et al., 2024b] and subsequently RACoon [Banerjee and Singh, 2024] showed that since the same adversarial perturbation is applied to multiple inputs, the executions on different perturbed inputs are related, exploiting the relationship between different executions significantly improves the precision of the verifier.

Theoretically, MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) can exactly encode DNN executions with piecewise linear activation functions like ReLU over any input regions specified by linear inequalities. However, the associated MILP optimization problem is computationally expensive. For instance, encoding $k$ executions of a DNN with $n_{r}$ ReLU activations introduces $O(n_{r}\\times k)$ integer variables in the worst case. As the cost of MILP optimization grows exponentially with the number of integer variables, even SOTA off-the-shelf solvers like Gurobi [Gurobi Optimization, LLC, 2018] struggle to verify small DNNs for a relational property over $k$ executions within a reasonable time limit. For scalability, SOTA non-relational verifiers like $\\alpha,\\beta$ - CROWN [Wang et al., 2021] design custom \"Branch and Bound\" (BaB) solvers using more scalable differentiable optimization techniques such as gradient descent. However, these verifiers ignore dependencies between multiple executions, resulting in imprecise relational verification. Conversely, the SOTA relational verifier RACoon uses parametric linear relaxation for each activation to avoid integer variables and employs gradient descent to learn parameters that leverage cross-executional dependencies for verification. This method, however, introduces imprecision due to the replacement of non-linear activations with parametric linear approximations.

If the verification process fails, the verifier generates a counter-example where the output specification $\\psi$ does not hold. DNN verifiers are broadly divided into three main types based on their ability to prove properties: - (i) sound but incomplete verifiers which may not always prove property even if it holds [Gehr et al., 2018, Singh et al., 2018, 2019b,a, Zhang et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2020, 2021], (ii) complete verifiers that can always prove the property if it holds [Wang et al., 2018, Gehr et al., 2018, Bunel et al., 2020a,c, Bak et al., 2020, Ehlers, 2017, Ferrari et al., 2022, Fromherz et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021, Palma et al., 2021, Anderson et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2022a] and (iii) verifiers with probabilistic guarantees [Cohen et al., 2019, Li et al., 2022].

For relational properties defined across multiple executions of the same DNN, existing verifiers [Khedr and Shoukry, 2023] reduce the verification problem to an $L_{\\infty}$ robustness problem by constructing a \"product DNN\" that includes multiple copies of the same DNN. However, the relational verifier in [Khedr and Shoukry, 2023] treats all $k$ executions of the DNN as independent, which results in a loss of precision. On the other hand, [Zeng et al., 2023] (referred to as the I/O formulation) tracks the relationships between inputs used in multiple executions at the input layer, but it does not maintain the relationships between the outputs fed into the subsequent hidden layers. As a result, it achieves only limited improvement over baseline verifiers that treat all executions independently. RaVeN [Banerjee et al., 2024b] uses DiffPoly a abstract intepretation based framework to track linear relationships between the outputs at all layers resulting from multiple executions of the same DNN. While RaVeN is significantly more precise than the I/O formulation, tracking linear constraints at each layer across all DNN executions can be computationally expensive. The SOTA relational verifier RACoon [Banerjee and Singh, 2024] improves the scalability of RaVeN while maintaining RaVeN\u2019s precision by introducing a new gradient-descent based bounding strategy called cross-executional bound refinement, as detailed in Section 3.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
