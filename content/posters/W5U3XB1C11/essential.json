This leads to unreliable verification results, especially in safety-critical applications where robustness against adversarial attacks is paramount.  The inability to reason about these dependencies hinders the development of truly trustworthy AI systems.\nThis paper introduces RABBit, a novel Branch-and-Bound based verifier that addresses these limitations. **RABBit efficiently combines branching strategies over multiple executions with a cross-executional bounding method**, effectively leveraging dependencies between DNN outputs. The resulting MILP instance is efficiently solved, providing substantial precision improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.  **RABBit's superior performance is demonstrated through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and network architectures**, proving its practical relevance in ensuring the safety and reliability of DNNs in critical applications.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "W5U3XB1C11/podcast.wav"}
