It's a hybrid approach that alternates between two main processes: global optimization of bundle-adjusting neural LiDAR fields (using a coarse-to-fine training strategy) and graph-based pure geometric optimization (using a graph constructed from multiple frame point clouds and a graph-based loss).  Key components include selective re-weighting to mitigate overfitting from outlier frames and explicit geometric constraints derived from point cloud data (e.g., normal information) to improve the accuracy and geometric consistency of the results.  The framework takes multi-frame LiDAR point clouds as input and produces rendered range images and point cloud reconstructions.", "section": "3.1 Overview of GeoNLF Framework"}, {"figure_path": "v3y785TN7B/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Graph-based RCD (left).
