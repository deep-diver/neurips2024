### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current LiDAR-based novel view synthesis heavily relies on pre-computed poses, which are often inaccurate due to limitations in point cloud registration.  Pose-free Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) methods, while promising, lack geometric consistency. This paper tackles these issues by presenting a novel framework.

GeoNLF tackles these challenges with a hybrid approach. It alternates between global neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization.  A selective-reweighting strategy prevents overfitting, while geometric constraints enhance the robustness of optimization, producing superior results in both novel view synthesis and multi-view registration of low-frequency large-scale point clouds, as demonstrated on the NuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### Pose-Free LiDAR
Pose-free LiDAR methods are transforming 3D scene understanding by eliminating the reliance on precise pre-computed poses, a significant challenge in traditional LiDAR processing. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios with sparse or low-frequency point cloud data where accurate pose estimation is difficult.  **Key advantages** include robustness to noisy or incomplete data, and the ability to reconstruct scenes from fewer viewpoints.  The core idea lies in incorporating geometric constraints and employing neural networks to learn the scene's structure directly from the point cloud data, thus sidestepping the need for accurate initial pose estimates. **Challenges** remain in balancing geometric consistency with accurate scene representation, avoiding overfitting, and efficiently handling large-scale datasets.  Furthermore, **future research** should focus on addressing the trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy, developing more effective strategies for outlier rejection and robust optimization, and exploring applications in dynamic scene reconstruction.

#### GeoNLF Framework
The GeoNLF framework, a hybrid approach for large-scale LiDAR data processing, cleverly combines neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with geometric optimization.  **Alternating between global NeRF refinement and pure geometric pose optimization**, GeoNLF addresses limitations of existing pose-free methods by leveraging point cloud's inherent geometric structure.  **A crucial aspect is selective-reweighting**, mitigating overfitting on outlier frames, enhancing robustness, especially under sparse data conditions. The framework's success is further bolstered by the incorporation of **explicit geometric constraints**, maximizing the utilization of point cloud information beyond simple depth supervision, thus significantly improving registration and novel view synthesis accuracy. This sophisticated design allows GeoNLF to excel in challenging large-scale, low-frequency scenarios where traditional methods often struggle. The synergy of neural reconstruction and geometric refinement is a key innovation, providing a robust and accurate solution for LiDAR data processing.

#### Geometric Optimization
The core of the proposed method lies in its **hybrid approach** to geometric optimization, cleverly alternating between global neural reconstruction (using Neural LiDAR Fields) and a pure geometric pose refinement stage.  This synergistic strategy leverages the strengths of both approaches: NeRF's capability for global scene understanding and a geometric optimizer's precision in aligning point clouds locally. The **geometric optimizer** itself is a graph-based method, enhancing robustness by incorporating geometric constraints derived directly from the LiDAR point cloud data and employing a **selective-reweighting strategy**. This effectively mitigates overfitting and addresses the issue of outlier frames, which can significantly hinder traditional methods.  The **integration of geometric constraints** further improves optimization by fully utilizing the implicit geometric information abundant in point clouds, surpassing reliance solely on range maps.  This holistic approach is key to GeoNLF's success in achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate multi-view registration, particularly impressive in challenging scenarios involving sparse and low-frequency large-scale point clouds.

#### Selective Re-weighting
The selective re-weighting strategy in this research is a crucial technique to enhance the robustness of the model during training. It directly addresses the issue of overfitting, especially prevalent when dealing with sparse and low-frequency LiDAR data. By identifying frames with outlier poses, which manifest as significantly higher rendering losses, this method dynamically adjusts the learning rate. **Outlier frames receive a reduced learning rate**, preventing the model from overfitting to these unreliable observations while still allowing for pose correction through gradient propagation. This approach is vital for maintaining multi-view consistency and improving the overall quality of the reconstruction. The strategy is elegantly implemented, avoiding negative impacts on radiance fields. **The selective re-weighting acts as a filter**, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of outliers during global optimization and leading to more accurate pose estimation. This technique, in combination with the geometric constraints and the graph-based optimization, demonstrates a powerful and efficient strategy to achieve state-of-the-art performance in challenging large-scale LiDAR processing.

#### Ablation Experiments
Ablation experiments systematically remove components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In this context, it is crucial to **carefully select which components to ablate**, ensuring that the ablated parts are meaningful and well-defined.  The results should be interpreted cautiously, as removing one component might indirectly affect others, masking true individual impacts.  A well-designed ablation study will incorporate **multiple ablation settings**, ideally exploring various combinations of components, to gain a more complete understanding.  Moreover, it's important to **quantify the impact** of each ablation, using clear metrics to demonstrate a statistically significant effect. This allows for a robust comparison between different model configurations, providing insights that support the claims made regarding the importance of specific components.  Finally, a strong ablation study will acknowledge and discuss **potential limitations**, such as confounding effects between ablated components, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of the results.

> This figure shows the architecture of the GeoNLF framework.  It's a hybrid approach that alternates between two main processes: global optimization of bundle-adjusting neural LiDAR fields (using a coarse-to-fine training strategy) and graph-based pure geometric optimization (using a graph constructed from multiple frame point clouds and a graph-based loss).  Key components include selective re-weighting to mitigate overfitting from outlier frames and explicit geometric constraints derived from point cloud data (e.g., normal information) to improve the accuracy and geometric consistency of the results.  The framework takes multi-frame LiDAR point clouds as input and produces rendered range images and point cloud reconstructions.

> This figure shows the impact of the proposed geometry-guided optimization on the pose estimation. The left part illustrates how the graph-based robust Chamfer distance (RCD) is used to reduce the weight of non-overlapping regions between point clouds. The right part demonstrates how the Geo-optimizer corrects the wrong optimization direction caused by the neural radiance field (NeRF).  The comparison between (a) and (b) shows that the Geo-optimizer significantly improves the pose estimation accuracy by preventing incorrect pose optimization.

> This figure shows the effect of selective-reweighting on pose optimization.  The top row displays results without selective re-weighting, demonstrating that outlier frames have significantly higher losses and lead to poor global optimization. The bottom row shows that with selective re-weighting, outlier frames still have higher losses, but the overfitting is mitigated, leading to improved global optimization after training.
