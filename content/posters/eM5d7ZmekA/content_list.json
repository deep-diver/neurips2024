Previous works neglect the inherent sparsity of 3D structure and do not utilize explicit geometric relationships between 3D and 2D images. This limits these methods to a low-resolution representation and makes it difficult to scale up to the dense views for better quality. GeoLRM tackles these issues by incorporating a novel 3D-aware transformer structure that directly processes 3D points and uses deformable cross-attention mechanisms to effectively integrate image features into 3D representations. We implement this solution through a two-stage pipeline: initially, a lightweight proposal network generates a sparse set of 3D anchor points from the posed image inputs; subsequently, a specialized reconstruction transformer refines the geometry and retrieves textural details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeoLRM significantly outperforms existing models, especially for dense view inputs.

Historically, the creation of these assets has been a labour-intensive process, demanding the skills of expert artists and developers. While recent years have witnessed groundbreaking advancements in 2D image generation technologies, such as diffusion models [43, 44, 42] which iteratively refine images, their adaptation to 3D asset creation remains challenging. Directly applying diffusion models to 3D generation [20, 36] is less than satisfactory, primarily due to a dearth of large-scale and high-quality data. DreamFusion [40] innovatively optimize a 3D representation [2] by distilling the score of image distribution from pre-trained image diffusion models [43, 44]. However, this approach lacks a deep integration of 3D-specific knowledge, such as geometric consistency and spatial coherence, leading to significant issues such as the multi-head problem and the inconsistent 3D structure. Additionally, these methods require extensive per-scene optimizations, which severely limits their practical applications.

Utilizing this dataset, researchers have fine-tuned 2D diffusion models to produce images consistent with 3D structures [28, 47, 48]. Moreover, recent innovations [74, 64, 54, 72, 65] have combined these 3D-aware models with large reconstruction models (LRMs) [18] to achieve rapid and accurate 3D image generation. These methods typically employ large transformers or UNet models that convert sparse-view images into 3D representations in a single forward step. While they excel in speed and maintaining 3D consistency, they confront two primary limitations. Firstly, previous works utilize triplanes [18, 72, 64] to represent the 3D models, wasting lots of features in regions devoid of actual content and involving dense computations during rendering. This violates the sparse nature of $3D$ as our analysis shows that the visible portions of the 3D models in the Objaverse dataset constitute only about $5\\%$ of the overall spatial volume. Though Gaussian-based methods [54, 74, 65] may use pixel-aligned Gaussians for better efficiency, this representation is incapable of recovering the unseen area and thus heavily relies on the input images. Secondly, previous works tend to overlook the explicit geometric relationships between 3D and 2D images, which results in ineffective processing. The tri-plane or pixel-aligned Gaussian tokens do not correspond to a specific space in 3D, thus being unable to utilize the projection relationship between 3D points and images. In other words, they conduct dense attention between the 3D queries and the image keys. This leads to the fact that these methods tend to reconstruct 3D with sparse view inputs but cannot achieve better performance with denser inputs.

However, directly generating 3D Gaussians in the whole 3D space requires huge memory costs. To this end, we first propose a specialized proposal network to predict an occupancy grid from input images. Only the occupied voxels will be further processed to generate 3D Gaussian features.

Beyond LRM, Instant3D [22] improves reconstruction quality with sparse-view inputs. It employs a two-stage paradigm, which first generates four views with the diffusion model and then regresses NeRF [33] from generated multi-view images. Instead of NeRF, InstantMesh [72] utilizes mesh representation to reconstruct 3D objects, which adopts a differentiable iso-surface extraction module. However, many works [54, 82, 74, 71] choose 3D Gaussians [21] as the outputs.

This indicates robust scalability, a critical feature for practical applications. In contrast, the performance of InstantMesh [72], does not follow this pattern. Specifically, InstantMesh shows a decline in performance when the input views increase to 12. This degradation could be due to two primary factors. First, the low-resolution tri-planes may reach their maximum capacity to represent details. Second, the model tends to oversmooth details when handling a large volume of image tokens. Our approach strategically addresses these issues. We employ an extendable sequence of 3D tokens that can be dynamically adjusted to fti the resolution requirements. Additionally, our model features deformable attention mechanisms that intelligently focus on the most pertinent information, preventing the loss of critical details.

Our approach distinguishes itself from previous methods by effectively utilizing the inherent sparsity of 3D structures and explicitly integrating geometric relationships between 3D and 2D images. The GeoLRM framework employs a 3D-aware transformer architecture that predicts 3D Gaussians through a sophisticated coarse-to-fine methodology. Initially, a proposal network estimates coarse occupancy grids, which serve as foundational 3D anchor points for subsequent refinement. The second stage leverages deformable cross-attention to enhance the 3D structure, integrating detailed textural information. Extensive experiments validate that GeoLRM can process higher resolutions and accommodate denser image inputs, outperforming existing models in terms of detail and accuracy. This innovation demonstrates significant potential for real-world applications, particularly in domains where dense view inputs can enhance output quality and user experience. GeoLRM\u2019s ability to handle up to 21 images efficiently underscores its scalability and adaptability, paving the way for integration with advanced video generation technologies.

This segmentation can lead to the accumulation of errors. The reliance on a proposal network is currently indispensable due to the computational intensity of processing Gaussian points across the entire 3D space. This necessity introduces potential inefficiencies and constraints that could hinder real-time applications. Future research will focus on developing an end-to-end solution that integrates these stages seamlessly, reducing error propagation and optimizing processing time. By addressing these limitations, we aim to enhance the model\u2019s robustness and applicability across a broader range of 3D generation tasks.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
