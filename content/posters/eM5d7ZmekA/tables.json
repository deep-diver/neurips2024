The model's performance is evaluated using four metrics: PSNR, SSIM, inference time, and memory usage.  The results show how the model's performance improves as the number of input views increases, indicating that the model benefits from denser input data.  The table shows that while the performance of InstantMesh plateaus and then declines as the input views increase, our method continues to improve.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "eM5d7ZmekA/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Ablation study of some key designs.

It shows the effect of using different numbers of sampling points (0, 4, 8, and 16) on the model's performance, measured by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.  The results demonstrate that increasing the number of sampling points generally improves performance, suggesting that the deformable attention mechanism effectively leverages multi-view features to improve the quality of 3D reconstruction.  However, there are diminishing returns with more than 8 sampling points, striking a balance between performance and computational cost.", "section": "4.5 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "eM5d7ZmekA/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results on Google Scanned Objects (GSO) [13], where we used six views for inputs and four for evaluation.
