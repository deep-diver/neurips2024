The F1 score is a common metric for evaluating the performance of classification models, and here it measures the accuracy of identifying the hierarchical structure of the model. The high F1 scores obtained by the proposed method indicate its superior performance in recovering the correct graph structures compared to the baseline.", "section": "5 Synthetic Data Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "bO5bUxvH6m/tables/tables_26_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: F1 scores for our method and the baseline Kivva et al.

The graphs are visualized in Figure A2 of the supplementary material. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, achieving near-perfect F1 scores across all graphs while the baseline method falls significantly short.
