The dependence of the sample complexities of PMD-PD and PD-NAC on \u03b3 is not depicted in [9, 10].", "description": "The table summarizes the sample complexity of various algorithms for solving constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with different policy parameterizations.  It shows the sample complexity (a measure of the number of samples needed to find a near-optimal solution) for both softmax and general parameterizations, along with the theoretical lower bound. The discount factor (\u03b3) is also considered, reflecting its influence on sample complexity.  The table highlights the improvement achieved by the proposed PD-ANPG algorithm.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
