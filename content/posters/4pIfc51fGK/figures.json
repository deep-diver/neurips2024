(a) shows the ideal case where anchors are learned from complete data. (b) demonstrates the anchor shift problem where anchors are learned from incomplete data, resulting in their misalignment.

Convex combination limits reconstruction to the convex hull of the anchors, leading to blind spots.  Affine combination extends beyond the convex hull, illuminating these blind spots and allowing for a more accurate reconstruction of the missing data.
