Consequently, it is nontrivial for diffusion models to model such intricate data from scratch without extensive captioned multi-view video datasets. Second, there are no publicly available large-scale datasets of captioned multi-view videos, but it has been shown that billions of text and 2D image pairs are essential for powerful image diffusion models [74, 76, 83]. For example, Stable Diffusion [76] is trained on the massive LAION-5B dataset [78]. Unlike downloading 2D images available on the Internet, collecting a large quantity of multi-view videos is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge is further compounded when high-quality captioned videos are needed, hindering the extension of diffusion models to T2MVid generation.

However, studies have revealed that naively fine-tuning a large pre-trained model on limited data can result in overftiting [30, 75, 115]. Our intuition is that we can factor the multi-view video generation problem into viewpoint-space and time components. The viewpoint-space component ensures that the generated multi-view videos are geometrically consistent and aligned with the input text, and the temporal component ensures temporal coherence. With such factorization, a straightforward approach is to leverage large-scale multi-view image datasets (e.g., [51] [67]) and 2D video datasets (e.g., Web10M [4]) to pre-train the viewpoint-space component and temporal component, respectively.

We quantitatively evaluate text alignment via CLIP [68] and temporal coherence via Frechet Video Distance (FVD) [87]. Yet, Ge et al.[20] pointed out FVD leans more towards per-frame quality than temporal consistency. To compensate for FVD, we conduct a user study to evaluate the overall performance incorporating text alignment, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency according to human preference (H. Pref.). CLIP and FVD scores in Tab. 1 are computed from 25 multi-view videos, where most input prompts used to generate these videos are separate from the training set, and only two prompts are from the training set. For ablation study, there are five methods and ten subjects for evaluating human preference, leading to $5{\\times}2{\\times}10=100$ questionnaires per input text prompt. To reduce the cost, we use input prompts to evaluate human preference in the ablation.

For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
