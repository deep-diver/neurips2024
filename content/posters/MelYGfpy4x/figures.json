Under different settings of the generated model, the testing group and the signal strength, simulated results of the proposed method for the proportion of outliers pout from 0 to 0.5 in increments of 0.1 when the error term follows the standard normal distribution.", "description": "This figure displays the empirical rejection rates for different settings, including linear and nonlinear models, two group sizes (G1 and G2), three signal strengths (\u03b4 = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5), and varying proportions of outliers (pout). The results are based on the standard normal distribution for the error terms.  The plot shows how the empirical rejection rate varies across these conditions. The proposed method in the paper is evaluated.", "section": "A.5 Additional simulation results for group inference"}]
