This approach struggles with complex tasks and overlooks potential benefits from leveraging relationships between tasks. The limited access to information during reasoning hinders performance.\nThis paper introduces an innovative \"open-book\" learning framework, providing the network with access to the entire training dataset during reasoning. This allows the network to aggregate information from various instances, enhancing its reasoning capabilities. Experiments show significant improvements over traditional methods on the CLRS benchmark.  The attention mechanism used further provides valuable insights into task relationships, which can lead to improved multi-task training strategies.", "affiliation": "East China Normal University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6HO33urpaI/podcast.wav"}
