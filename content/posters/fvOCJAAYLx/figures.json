We define two types of diffusion processes: (1) multiple Stem processes (sp\u2081), which unravel the interactions between graph structure and single properties, and (2) the Trunk process, which orchestrates the combination of the graph structure score from se with the stem process contributions from 84\u2081. During the forward process, the structure y, and the properties {yi}k co-evolve toward noise. In each step of the reverse process, the structure is first denoised and subsequently used to denoise the properties (indicated by the green-dashed line). Such de-noised properties are then utilized, in turn, to further denoise the structure (red line), in a process that resembles a guidance loop.", "description": "This figure illustrates the Twigs framework, comparing it to classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance.  Twigs uses a central trunk diffusion process for the main variable (e.g., graph structure) and additional stem processes for dependent variables (e.g., graph properties).  The key innovation is 'loop guidance', where information flows between the trunk and stem processes during sampling, allowing for intricate interactions and dependencies.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "fvOCJAAYLx/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: First row: Samples by Twigs for 3D molecules conditioned on single properties on QM9.
