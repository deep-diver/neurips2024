Traditional approaches, like classifier-based and classifier-free guidance, fall short in capturing these nuances, leading to suboptimal results.  The vast combinatorial spaces involved pose significant challenges for brute-force techniques.\nThis paper introduces \"Twigs,\" a novel score-based diffusion framework that elegantly addresses these challenges. Twigs uses multiple co-evolving diffusion processes, a central 'trunk' process for graph structures and additional 'stem' processes for properties.  A key innovation, 'loop guidance,' skillfully orchestrates information flow between these processes.  Extensive experiments demonstrate Twigs's superior performance across various tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods, proving its potential for complex conditional graph generation problems.", "affiliation": "University of Manchester", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fvOCJAAYLx/podcast.wav"}
