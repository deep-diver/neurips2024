Each node has a feature vector composed of 12 dimensions indicating the piece type, 2 dimensions indicating whether the position has been repeated before in the game, 98 dimensions describing the positions of pieces for the last 7 moves, and 5 additional dimensions representing the current player, the total move count, castling rights, and the number of moves without progress.  This rich node feature set allows the model to capture complex game states.", "section": "4.2 Graph Design"}]
