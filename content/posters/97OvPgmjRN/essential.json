For instance, a model trained for 19x19 Go struggles to adapt to 13x13 Go, despite shared underlying rules. This inflexibility also leads to high computational costs for training models from scratch for each game variant.\nThis research introduces AlphaGateau, a novel approach using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and a modified Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer called GATEAU**, which naturally incorporate edge features for policy output. Experiments show that AlphaGateau significantly outperforms previous architectures with similar parameters, achieving a magnitude order of increased playing strength with faster training times.  Crucially, a model trained on a smaller 5x5 chess variant quickly adapts to the standard 8x8 chessboard, illustrating impressive generalization.", "affiliation": "Kyoto University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "97OvPgmjRN/podcast.wav"}
