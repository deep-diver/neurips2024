The core issue lies in the reward function used for policy learning often being unstable and noisy, which is generated by GAIL's discriminator. This results in unreliable and inefficient training.  \n\nThe proposed Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL) tackles this problem by incorporating diffusion models into GAIL to enhance the discriminator. This refined discriminator provides smoother and more informative rewards, leading to significantly improved policy learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks (navigation, manipulation, locomotion) demonstrate DRAIL's superior performance in terms of stability, generalizability, and data efficiency compared to existing methods.  **DRAIL's novel approach to reward generation makes a substantial contribution to the field of imitation learning**.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "k9SH68MvJs/podcast.wav"}
