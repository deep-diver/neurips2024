A conventional black-box approach is to assess a given function at sampled points to derive the complex of the function, commonly through marching cubes [9] or marching tetrahedra [10, 16]. Despite the inclusion of mesh optimization techniques [17] in modern mesh packages, this exhaustive method often generates redundant complexities due to discretization, increasing the computational load by using unnecessary mesh elements (e.g., fragmented planars). Aiming for exact extraction, initial efforts focused on identifying linear regions [18] and employing Analytical Marching [2] to exactly reconstruct the zero-level isosurface. Contemporary approaches involve region subdivision, wherein the regions of the complex are progressively subdivided from neuron to neuron and layer to layer, allowing for the efficient calculation of the exponentially increasing linear regions [4, 19\u201321]. Nevertheless, many previous studies have explored CPWA functions consisting of fully connected layers and ReLU activation, primarily owing to the mathematical simplicity of hyperplanes defining linear regions.

Furthermore, to address its slow convergence and enhance rendering quality, novel positional encoding methods using trilinear interpolations, e.g., HashGrid [12] or TensoRF [13], are introduced. Both techniques generate positional features through trilinear interpolation among the eight nearest corner features derived from pre-defined 3D grids. These features are obtained by hashing from multi-resolution hash tables or factorized representations of a feature space, respectively.

Instead, previous works on neural implicit surface learning methods resort to optimizing the SDF on nearsurface since we are interested in modeling the zero-set surfaces, allowing some errors for the points that are far from the surfaces. Practically, this is done by defining a loss function using clamps and ignoring far-surface points. For this reason, the online adaptivity of HashGrid or low-rank factorization of TensoRF can exploit this nature: focused learning of the surfaces adaptively allocating their learnable parameters to the near-surface, which means there might be enough room for the regularization by the eikonal equation. The investigation of the efficiency of representing the implicit neural surfaces using various positional encodings is seemingly out of the scope of this work since our main interest lies in the theoretical exposition of the mesh extraction from it and setting up a feasible bridge between theory and practice.
