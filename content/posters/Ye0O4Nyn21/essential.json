This paper introduces challenges in real-time processing of such data, highlighting the need for fast and robust algorithms. The limitations of current real-time approaches are discussed, emphasizing problems such as handling incomplete knowledge of cell identities and false-positive activity detections.\nThe paper's main contribution is realSEUDO, an improved version of the SEUDO algorithm.  It is optimized for speed and robustness, simultaneously identifying neurons and inferring their activity in real time.  The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through experiments, showing comparable results to offline methods and superior performance to existing online techniques with an average processing speed of 120 Hz. This enables the use of calcium imaging in closed-loop studies requiring high-speed feedback.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "Ye0O4Nyn21/podcast.wav"}
