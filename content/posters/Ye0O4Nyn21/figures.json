A: Real-time inference of cells and their activity from calcium imaging is crucial to closed-loop experiments, however, Typical CI demixing requires batch processing, e.g., via matrix factorization. B: realSEUDO builds on the robust SEUDO algorithm that prevents activity in missing or unknown cells from creating false activity in known cells by explicitly modeling contamination as a sparse sum of small Gaussian blobs (right). The sum of the estimated Guassians further provides an approximation of shape of the unknown cells, which can be used to seen new known cells.
