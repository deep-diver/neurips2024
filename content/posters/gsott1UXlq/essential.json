Existing generalized additive models (GAMs) lack the ability to effectively capture temporal patterns, while post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods can produce unreliable interpretations.  This creates a critical need for transparent models that can accurately capture temporal dynamics in data while providing interpretable predictions.\nTo address this, the paper introduces the Generalized Additive Time Series Model (GATSM).  GATSM employs a novel architecture consisting of independent feature networks and a transparent temporal module. This allows the model to learn both time-independent feature contributions and complex temporal patterns effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that **GATSM significantly outperforms existing GAMs and achieves comparable performance to black-box models** while providing valuable insights through its interpretable structure.  The source code for GATSM is also publicly available.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gsott1UXlq/podcast.wav"}
