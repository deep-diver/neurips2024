This is challenging, especially in the online setting where data arrives sequentially and requires fast updates. Existing methods using gradient descent on the variational loss often suffer from computational inefficiency or high variance due to sampling methods.\nThe proposed Bayesian Online Natural Gradient (BONG) algorithm directly addresses these challenges. It cleverly simplifies the online learning problem by omitting the KL regularization term in the variational loss and performing a single step of natural gradient descent. BONG recovers exact Bayesian inference for conjugate models and provides a deterministic approximation for non-conjugate models, leading to significant computational gains while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that BONG consistently outperforms existing online VB methods across several benchmarks.", "affiliation": "University of Colorado", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "E7en5DyO2G/podcast.wav"}
