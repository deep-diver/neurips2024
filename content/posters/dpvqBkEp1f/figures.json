Trajectory data X depends on a symmetrised Hamiltonian H induced by non-symmetrised observable F and conservation laws C.", "description": "This figure shows a graphical model representing the probabilistic relationships between different variables in the proposed method.  The non-symmetrised observable *F<sub>\u03b8</sub>* acts as a prior on the Hamiltonian function. The conserved quantities *C<sub>\u03b7</sub>* influence the Hamiltonian by enforcing symmetries. The symmetrised Hamiltonian *H* then generates the observed trajectory data *X*. This model incorporates the concept of Noether's theorem, linking symmetries to conserved quantities, into a Bayesian framework for learning Hamiltonian systems.", "section": "4.1 Probabilistic model with symmetries embedded in the prior"}, {"figure_path": "dpvqBkEp1f/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Learned Hamiltonians on phase space of simple harmonic oscillator by HNN models.", "description": "This figure compares the learned Hamiltonians from three different models on the phase space of a simple harmonic oscillator.  The first model is a vanilla Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN). The second model incorporates the proposed symmetry learning method, while the third model uses the correct SO(2) symmetry as an oracle. The final image shows the true Hamiltonian. This visualization helps to understand how each model learns and represents the inherent symmetry of the system, highlighting the impact of the proposed method in learning the rotational symmetry from data.", "section": "5.2 Simple Harmonic Oscillator"}, {"figure_path": "dpvqBkEp1f/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Singular value and parallelness of the singular vectors of the learned generators, for n oscilators.

The right plot shows the parallelness (a measure of how closely the learned generators align with the ground truth generators) for each of the learned generators. The plots demonstrate that as *n* increases, the method correctly learns the U(*n*) symmetry group, indicated by the presence of *n*\u00b2 non-zero singular values and high parallelness values for the corresponding generators.  This provides strong visual evidence supporting the paper's claim of successful automatic symmetry discovery for n-harmonic oscillators.", "section": "5.3 n-Harmonic Oscillators"}, {"figure_path": "dpvqBkEp1f/figures/figures_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Singular value and parallelness of the singular vectors of the learned generators, for n oscilators. U(n) is correctly learned.", "description": "This figure shows the results of analyzing the learned symmetries for n-harmonic oscillators. The left panel displays the singular values of the learned generators, demonstrating that there are n\u00b2 non-zero singular values, consistent with the U(n) symmetry group's dimensionality. The right panel shows the parallelness (the cosine similarity) of the first n\u00b2 right singular vectors with the ground truth generators.  The high parallelness values (close to 1) confirm that the learned generators effectively span the same subspace as the true generators, indicating successful learning of the U(n) symmetry.", "section": "5.3 n-Harmonic Oscillators"}]
