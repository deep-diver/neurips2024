### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning models benefit from incorporating inductive biases, such as symmetries.  Recent advancements model physical dynamics through Hamiltonian mechanics, guaranteeing energy conservation.  However, manually embedding such constraints can be challenging.  This work addresses this challenge by using Noether's theorem to link symmetries with conserved quantities which can be learned. 

This paper proposes "Noether's Razor," a novel method that jointly learns the Hamiltonian and conserved quantities.  It uses approximate Bayesian model selection, avoiding the need for manual regularization to prevent trivial solutions.  This end-to-end training procedure leverages the Occam's razor effect to find the simplest representation. Experiments on harmonic oscillators and n-body systems demonstrate the efficacy of Noether's Razor in accurately identifying conserved quantities and symmetries, leading to improved predictive accuracy.

### In-depth insights


#### Noether's Theorem
Noether's Theorem, a cornerstone of theoretical physics, elegantly connects symmetries in a system with conserved quantities.  **Its application in machine learning, as explored in this paper, offers a powerful way to incorporate inductive biases**. By framing symmetries as learnable conserved quantities, the model can directly learn these symmetries from data, rather than relying on pre-defined constraints. This approach leverages the principle of **Occam's Razor**, favoring simpler models that explain the data effectively while avoiding overfitting by penalizing overly complex or unconstrained hypotheses.  **The method's strength lies in its ability to automatically discover and utilize symmetries inherent in the data**, improving generalization and predictive accuracy, which contrasts with traditional methods that require manually specifying symmetries.  **The Bayesian model selection framework provides a natural mechanism for implementing this approach**, allowing the model to learn both the Hamiltonian and conserved quantities simultaneously, enhancing performance further.  However, limitations exist: the approach is restricted to quadratic conserved quantities, and the scaling of the method to more complex systems is still an active area of research.  Despite these limitations, this novel use of Noether's theorem presents a significant advance in the intersection of physics-informed machine learning and Bayesian model selection.

#### Bayesian Symmetry
Bayesian approaches to symmetry detection offer a powerful alternative to classical methods.  Instead of imposing symmetries a priori, **Bayesian methods learn symmetries from data**, using the data to inform the prior distribution over possible symmetries. This is particularly appealing when the true symmetries of a system are unknown or complex.  A Bayesian framework allows for quantifying uncertainty in the identified symmetries through posterior distributions. This **uncertainty quantification is crucial** as it acknowledges that the observed data may be imperfect or incomplete, and thus the inferred symmetries might only be approximate. By incorporating prior knowledge about likely symmetries, Bayesian methods can guide the learning process and reduce overfitting, while simultaneously learning the strength of the symmetry from the data.  The use of **model selection techniques** within the Bayesian framework (e.g., marginal likelihood maximization) can assist in automatically choosing the model complexity appropriate for the observed data, effectively acting as an Occam's razor in identifying the most parsimonious representation that balances fit with complexity.  This **combines inductive bias with data-driven learning**, making them particularly useful for complex systems where classical methods struggle.

#### Variational Inference
Variational inference (VI) is a powerful approximation technique for Bayesian inference, particularly useful when dealing with intractable posterior distributions.  **VI frames Bayesian inference as an optimization problem**, where a simpler, tractable distribution (the variational distribution) is chosen to approximate the true posterior. This approximation is optimized by minimizing a divergence measure, often the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, between the variational distribution and the true posterior.  The core idea is to find the variational distribution that is closest to the true posterior, allowing for approximate posterior computations such as calculating moments or sampling.  **A key advantage is scalability:** VI can handle high-dimensional data and complex models, where exact inference methods become computationally infeasible.  However, **the accuracy of VI depends heavily on the choice of the variational family**; a poorly chosen family might result in a poor approximation and inaccurate inferences.  Furthermore, **the optimization process in VI can be challenging**, requiring careful selection of hyperparameters and potentially getting stuck in local optima.  Despite these limitations, VI remains a prominent and versatile technique in various applications, including machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and Bayesian statistics, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

#### Hamiltonian Learning
Hamiltonian learning leverages principles of Hamiltonian mechanics to model dynamical systems.  **Key to this approach is the representation of the system's energy (Hamiltonian) as a neural network**, allowing for learning from data while respecting fundamental physical constraints.  This contrasts with standard neural network approaches which may not guarantee energy conservation or other physical properties. **A major advantage is improved generalization and predictive accuracy**, especially for long-term predictions, as the learned dynamics are inherently consistent with the laws of physics.  However, challenges include **efficiently learning complex Hamiltonians from potentially noisy or incomplete data**, as well as **handling high-dimensional systems**.  Furthermore, **choosing appropriate neural network architectures and loss functions** is critical for successful learning.  Research in this area is actively exploring ways to incorporate symmetries and conserved quantities to further enhance learning efficiency and generalization.

#### Symmetry Discovery
The concept of 'Symmetry Discovery' within the context of the provided research paper centers around the **automated identification of conserved quantities and their associated symmetries directly from data**, bypassing the need for manual specification. This is achieved through a novel application of Noether's theorem, which elegantly connects symmetries with conserved quantities in Hamiltonian systems. The approach uses a **Bayesian model selection framework**, enabling the model to automatically favor the simplest (most parsimonious) yet effective symmetry that explains the data, effectively implementing Occam's Razor. **A crucial aspect is the parameterization of symmetries as learnable conserved quantities**, directly incorporated into the model's prior, thus enabling end-to-end learning of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetries.  The method leverages a variational lower bound to the marginal likelihood, providing a differentiable objective for optimization. This innovative technique allows the model to **simultaneously learn both the Hamiltonian and the conserved quantities from data**, demonstrating a practical approach to automated symmetry discovery in complex dynamical systems.

The right plot shows the parallelness (a measure of how closely the learned generators align with the ground truth generators) for each of the learned generators. The plots demonstrate that as *n* increases, the method correctly learns the U(*n*) symmetry group, indicated by the presence of *n*¬≤ non-zero singular values and high parallelness values for the corresponding generators.  This provides strong visual evidence supporting the paper's claim of successful automatic symmetry discovery for n-harmonic oscillators.
