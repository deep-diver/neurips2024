### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current data valuation methods suffer from a critical limitation: they assign a single scalar score to each data point, neglecting the varying quality of individual cells within the point. This makes it difficult to pinpoint noisy cells and rectify the issues accordingly, potentially leading to discarding valuable data points entirely. In addition, this approach obscures the distinct roles individual cells play, hindering transparency and sub-optimizing data allocation in various practical scenarios.

To overcome these issues, the paper proposes 2D-OOB, a novel out-of-bag estimation framework for jointly assessing data point usefulness and identifying the specific features driving this impact. The experimental results demonstrate 2D-OOB's superior performance in cell-level outlier detection, model performance enhancement via cell fixation, and localization of backdoor triggers. The method is computationally efficient, significantly outperforming existing methods and showing promising results in multiple use cases. This addresses the critical challenge of fine-grained data analysis, advancing the field of data valuation and improving model interpretability.

### In-depth insights


#### Joint Data Valuation
Joint data valuation tackles the limitations of traditional data valuation methods by moving beyond assigning a single scalar value to each data point.  Instead, it **focuses on attributing value to individual features or cells within a data point**, acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity within datasets. This approach is particularly valuable when data quality varies substantially across different features of a data point, or when data originates from multiple sources with different levels of reliability.  **By disaggregating data valuation to the feature level**, joint data valuation provides more granular insights and enables a more nuanced understanding of data quality and contribution.  This is crucial for tasks such as **identifying and rectifying outliers at the cell level**, **improving model performance through targeted data refinement**, and fairly allocating compensation in data marketplaces where individual features might originate from different sellers.  The challenge lies in developing computationally efficient methods to achieve this fine-grained valuation without sacrificing accuracy, which existing methods like 2D-Shapley struggle to do.

#### 2D-OOB Framework
The proposed 2D-OOB framework offers a novel approach to data valuation by **jointly assessing the contribution of individual data points and their constituent features**. Unlike traditional methods that assign a single scalar value to each data point, 2D-OOB provides a more nuanced perspective by assigning scores to individual cells (features) within each data point, thereby enabling **fine-grained analysis of data quality**.  This granular approach is particularly valuable for identifying and addressing noisy cells, outliers, and even malicious backdoors within datasets.  The method's computational efficiency, stemming from its out-of-bag estimation strategy, makes it applicable to large-scale datasets.  **2D-OOB's versatility extends to various machine learning tasks**, demonstrating improved performance in cell-level outlier detection, cell fixation, and backdoor trigger localization.  Its theoretical grounding in Data-OOB and its connection to DataShapley provide a strong foundation for its effectiveness and interpretability. The ability to pinpoint problematic features at the cell level, not just at the data point level, is a major strength, leading to **more informed decisions regarding data cleaning, model training, and data market valuation.**

#### Cell-Level Insights
The concept of 'Cell-Level Insights' in a research paper would involve a granular analysis of data, moving beyond aggregate or row-level observations.  This approach would offer a **deeper understanding** of individual data points by examining the contribution of each feature or variable.  For example, in a dataset containing patient information, 'cell-level insights' might reveal the independent influence of specific medical tests or demographic factors. **Identifying influential cells** could lead to crucial discoveries.  It may pinpoint outliers or anomalies within individual data points that aggregate-level analysis would miss, potentially improving data quality and model accuracy.  Moreover, **a cell-level approach** may highlight interactions between features that are not apparent at a higher level, allowing for more nuanced interpretations of the data. It is essential to note that the computational demands of this approach increase substantially, and careful consideration of statistical significance in the resulting analysis would be crucial.

#### Data Poisoning
Data poisoning, a significant threat to machine learning systems, involves surreptitiously injecting malicious data into training datasets.  **Adversaries aim to compromise model integrity and performance by introducing subtle manipulations that cause the model to behave erratically or produce biased outputs.**  This can be achieved through various techniques, including adding slightly altered data points, strategically injecting mislabeled data, or crafting backdoor triggers. The impact can be substantial, from causing inaccuracies in predictions to manipulating model behavior for malicious purposes. **Effective defense mechanisms against data poisoning often focus on robust training methods, data validation techniques, and anomaly detection.**  Detecting subtle poisoned data is challenging, necessitating advanced algorithms that can identify patterns deviating from the expected data distribution.  Furthermore, **understanding the specific methods of attack is vital for developing robust defenses.**  Current research is actively exploring both proactive methods such as data sanitization, and reactive techniques such as post-training model inspection and remediation.

#### Future Extensions
Future extensions of this research could explore several promising directions. **Firstly**, scaling the method to handle significantly larger datasets and higher-dimensional data is crucial for broader applicability.  This might involve investigating more efficient approximations or alternative computational techniques.  **Secondly**, exploring the robustness of the approach to different types of noisy data and addressing scenarios with missing data values would enhance its practical utility. **Thirdly**, extending the method beyond tabular data and images to other modalities like text and time-series data could open up new applications in various domains.  **Finally**, integrating the method with existing model-agnostic explainability techniques could enhance the interpretation of results and provide richer insights into data-model interactions.  Investigating the potential for adversarial attacks against the valuation method is important for security and fairness.

> This figure shows four examples of poisoned images and their corresponding cell valuation heatmaps generated by 2D-OOB.  The heatmaps visually represent the importance of each cell in the image, with red indicating higher importance and blue indicating lower importance. The examples demonstrate that 2D-OOB accurately highlights the backdoor triggers (the manipulated parts of the images) as the most important features driving misclassification, even when the actual object is present.
