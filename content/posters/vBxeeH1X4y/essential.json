This makes it difficult to pinpoint noisy cells and rectify the issues accordingly, potentially leading to discarding valuable data points entirely. In addition, this approach obscures the distinct roles individual cells play, hindering transparency and sub-optimizing data allocation in various practical scenarios.\nTo overcome these issues, the paper proposes 2D-OOB, a novel out-of-bag estimation framework for jointly assessing data point usefulness and identifying the specific features driving this impact. The experimental results demonstrate 2D-OOB's superior performance in cell-level outlier detection, model performance enhancement via cell fixation, and localization of backdoor triggers. The method is computationally efficient, significantly outperforming existing methods and showing promising results in multiple use cases. This addresses the critical challenge of fine-grained data analysis, advancing the field of data valuation and improving model interpretability.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "vBxeeH1X4y/podcast.wav"}
