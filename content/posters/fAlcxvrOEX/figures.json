It shows two parts: diffusion sampling and AdjointDEIS. The diffusion sampling part depicts the forward process of generating samples from noise by iteratively applying a neural network (\u03b5\u03b8) at different timesteps (tN to t0). The AdjointDEIS part shows the backward process of computing gradients (\u2202x(ti))  by applying the AdjointDEIS solver. These gradients are used to optimize the initial latent representation (xN) to achieve a desired output.  The number of timesteps are different for sampling (N) and AdjointDEIS (M).", "section": "1.1 Contributions"}, {"figure_path": "fAlcxvrOEX/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Example of guided morphed face generation with AdjointDEIS on the FRLL dataset.", "description": "This figure shows a successful face morphing attack generated using the AdjointDEIS method.
