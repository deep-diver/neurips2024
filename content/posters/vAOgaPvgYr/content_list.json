Another thrust of prior research has focused on LLM tool use, which we believe is most directly related to our methods. Calc-X [22] introduces a technique to offload arithmetic computations to an external tool like a calculator. The authors curated a large dataset of arithmetic problems and trained a language model that learns to interact with a calculator through the use of tags to signify the calling of the external tool. Several other works [23, 24, 25] follow a similar idea, using crowd workers to annotate tool calls and using this data to train language models to interact with external tools such as a web searching tool, a calculator, or a translation system. These approaches can be prohibitively expensive in annotation costs; Toolformer [26] overcomes this cost by using in-context learning and a language model to generate datasets containing the necessary \u2018API\u2019 tool calls via a self-supervised loss. Further, the above methods all require finetuning of the LLM, placing the LLM at risk of losing generality and its original language modelling abilities through catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, our approach does not involve training the language model. Our \u2018external tool\u2019 is a symbolic model which can be trained to correctly use the hidden states of the language model to perform the required arithmetic computations. The language model is kept frozen throughout this process. Unlike other tool-calling approaches, where the cost of data annotation to train for tool-calling interaction can be prohibitively expensive, in our method, each task only requires manually annotating tens of prompts, a high annotation efficiency. Other prior methods leverage prompt engineering to improve arithmetic performance of LLMs; this is done either through chain-of-thought [27], or to encourage LLMs to use a code interpreter [28, 29, 30]. Contrary to these methods, our approach does not use code kernels; this provides several advantages: 1) it enables tool use without expending compute on autoregressive steps for token generation, and 2) it avoids running potentially incorrect or malicious code generated by language models.

A single-layer OccamNet cannot evaluate these expressions. We attempted to overcome this by prompting Llama to break down compound expressions into multiple steps, but we find it difficult to coerce Llama to follow these instructions. Another challenge is that Llama often generates expressions in fractions or percentages, which also constitute compound expressions that are not properly handled by the OccamLLM system. Fortunately, we observed that these compound expressions were typically simple enough for the LLM to evaluate without OccamNet. Therefore, in our experiments, we trained the OccamLLM switch to avoid using OccamNet for compound operations, largely mitigating this issue. Future work could explore other solutions such as integrating a two-layer OccamNet as the symbolic network.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
