This stage iteratively eliminates sub-optimal arms until the best arm is identified.  It combines 'Successive Elimination' to remove clearly inferior arms and 'Checking for Best Arm Elimination' to mitigate the risk of prematurely discarding the best arm. The algorithm dynamically adjusts parameters based on the confidence level (\u03b4) to achieve near-optimal performance in both asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings.", "section": "4 Best of Both Worlds: Achieving Asymptotic and Non-asymptotic Optimalities"}]
