{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in 3D graphics and digital watermarking.  It **directly addresses the challenge of copyright protection for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models**, a rapidly growing area with significant commercial value. The proposed uncertainty-aware method provides a robust and effective technique that is highly relevant to current research trends in digital asset protection and deep learning.  Further research can explore its applications in various other 3D model formats and improvements in robustness against more sophisticated attacks.", "summary": "GaussianMarker:  A novel uncertainty-aware watermarking method ensures robust copyright protection for 3D Gaussian Splatting assets, invisibly embedding messages into model parameters and extractable from both 3D models and 2D renderings.", "takeaways": ["Uncertainty-aware watermarking protects 3D Gaussian Splatting models by embedding copyright messages into parameters with high uncertainty, maintaining invisibility.", "Robust message extraction is achieved from both 3D Gaussian parameters and 2D rendered images, even under various distortions.", "GaussianMarker demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, balancing message decoding accuracy and view synthesis quality."], "tldr": "The rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for creating 3D assets necessitates robust copyright protection.  Existing watermarking methods for other 3D representations are unsuitable for 3DGS due to its unique structure.  Naive watermarking on pre-trained 3DGS models causes noticeable distortions.\n\nGaussianMarker introduces an uncertainty-aware method that cleverly addresses these issues. It leverages Laplace approximation to estimate uncertainty in radiance fields. Only 3D Gaussian parameters with high uncertainty receive perturbations for embedding copyright messages.  This maintains invisibility and ensures robust extraction from both 3D Gaussians and 2D rendered images via specialized decoders, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on various datasets.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "wcxHbAY8B3/podcast.wav"}
