### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for creating 3D assets necessitates robust copyright protection.  Existing watermarking methods for other 3D representations are unsuitable for 3DGS due to its unique structure.  Naive watermarking on pre-trained 3DGS models causes noticeable distortions.



GaussianMarker introduces an uncertainty-aware method that cleverly addresses these issues. It leverages Laplace approximation to estimate uncertainty in radiance fields. Only 3D Gaussian parameters with high uncertainty receive perturbations for embedding copyright messages.  This maintains invisibility and ensures robust extraction from both 3D Gaussians and 2D rendered images via specialized decoders, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on various datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### 3DGS watermarking
The core of this research lies in developing a novel and robust 3DGS watermarking technique.  The approach cleverly leverages **uncertainty estimation** to embed copyright messages within the 3D Gaussian parameters of the model, focusing on areas with high uncertainty to minimize visible distortion. This method's strength is its **dual-decoding capability**, extracting messages reliably from both the 3D Gaussian parameters and 2D rendered images, significantly enhancing robustness against various distortions and attacks.  By using a **Bayesian inference perspective**, they identify parameters tolerant to larger perturbations, ensuring invisibility and preventing any perceivable alteration in the rendered scenes.  The work introduces **innovative decoders** - one for 3D Gaussians (PointNet based) and another for 2D images (HiDDeN) - to handle different distortion types, further increasing robustness.  **Uncertainty-aware perturbation** makes it highly resistant to manipulation while maintaining invisibility, leading to a truly effective solution for copyright protection of 3D Gaussian Splatting assets.

#### Uncertainty-aware
The concept of 'uncertainty-aware' in the context of copyright protection for 3D Gaussian splatting models is crucial.  It highlights the **intelligent embedding of copyright information** by leveraging the inherent uncertainty present within the model's parameters.  Instead of imposing potentially disruptive changes across all parameters, this approach strategically focuses on areas where modifications would be less noticeable.  **High-uncertainty parameters** are identified, enabling the integration of watermarking signals without causing significant visual distortions in rendered images. This approach balances the need for **robustness against various attacks and manipulations** while ensuring **invisibility of the watermark**. It‚Äôs a significant advancement over previous methods that blindly perturb parameters, potentially leading to perceivable artifacts.  This methodology represents a **sophisticated balance** between robust copyright protection and maintaining the quality of the 3D model and its associated renderings.

#### Robustness analysis
A robust watermarking scheme needs to withstand various attacks.  A thorough robustness analysis would evaluate performance under different distortions, including **common image manipulations** (e.g., JPEG compression, scaling, blurring, noise addition) and **geometric transformations** (rotation, cropping, translation) for 2D robustness.  For 3D robustness, attacks might include noise injection to 3D Gaussian parameters, alterations to Gaussian positions and orientations, or even mesh-based attacks if the 3D representation allows for mesh extraction. The analysis should quantify the impact of each attack on watermark extraction accuracy, ideally providing metrics such as bit error rate and demonstrating resilience to adversarial attacks.  **Quantitative results**, including precision and recall, should be presented across a wide range of attack strengths to fully characterize robustness.  Visual examples of attacked watermarked images and 3D models alongside their successfully extracted watermarks further strengthen the analysis.  The robustness analysis is critical to ascertain the practical applicability and reliability of the copyright protection method.

#### Message decoding
The effectiveness of any watermarking scheme hinges on robust message decoding.  In this research, the authors cleverly address this by employing a **dual-decoder approach**: one for 3D Gaussian parameters and another for 2D rendered images. This redundancy is crucial because it provides multiple avenues for recovering the embedded copyright message, even when one method may be compromised by distortions or manipulations.  The 3D decoder leverages a PointNet architecture to extract the message directly from the 3D Gaussian parameters, while the 2D decoder utilizes a pre-trained HiDDeN model, trained to handle various image distortions.  The use of a **pre-trained HiDDeN model** shows the authors' understanding of existing robust techniques in the 2D image watermarking space and indicates a strategic choice, rather than reinventing the wheel.  However, **future work** could explore developing a more unified or synergistic decoder architecture that leverages information from both domains concurrently for even more robust decoding, possibly using a joint optimization strategy.  Furthermore, analysis of the decoders' performance under various attack types and intensity levels would enhance the comprehensiveness of the evaluation, allowing for a deeper understanding of the system's resilience and limitations.

#### Future directions
Future research could explore enhancing the robustness of GaussianMarker in dynamic 3DGS scenarios.  **Motion transfer-based data augmentation** could be particularly valuable here, aiming to maintain high bit accuracies while improving robustness.  Investigating alternative methods for embedding copyright messages, potentially exploring techniques less reliant on uncertainty estimations, would be valuable.  **Exploring different deep learning architectures** for the 3D and 2D message decoders, beyond PointNet and HiDDeN, might lead to improved performance.  A thorough investigation into the computational efficiency of the watermarking process is needed.  **Optimizing for real-time performance** is crucial for practical applications. Finally, further research should explore the potential vulnerabilities of this approach to sophisticated attacks and develop countermeasures, enhancing the overall security and robustness of the copyright protection method.
