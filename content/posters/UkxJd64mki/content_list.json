However, most of these approaches require manual annotation of reasoning processes, limiting their generalizability and flexibility. By comparison, our StrategyLLM framework can automatically construct strategy-based few-shot prompts for any task, ensuring generalizable and consistent solutions following effective strategies. This approach sets it apart from existing automatic prompt construction methods [48, 37, 45], which may generate inconsistent solutions within the prompt. The plan-and-solve prompting method [40] aims to address missing-step errors by requesting LLMs to generate a plan before solving a specific example in a zero-shot manner. The plan is instance-specific and significantly different from the task-solving strategy which can be applied to all task examples. The learning-to-plan approach [15] learns a text plan for each task to assist LLMs in problem-solving. The plan, which is not necessarily a strategy, can be any instruction helpful for solving the task. Moreover, it demands a large training and validation set during the learning process, resulting in high costs. In contrast, our framework is efficient and cost-effective.

By utilizing the extensive knowledge embedded in these LLMs, which are trained on diverse data sources spanning multiple domains, StrategyLLM is able to generate generalizable strategies that incorporate domain-specific expertise. However, if the model possesses limited knowledge in a particular domain, it is unlikely to create effective strategies for that domain. In such cases, merely optimizing the prompt may not significantly improve performance, and domain-specific continual training may be necessary.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
