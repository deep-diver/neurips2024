### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) uses imaging to extract blood volume pulse signals, converting spatial-temporal data into time series.  Existing rPPG methods often compute attention separately across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions, limiting their accuracy and ability to generalize across different datasets. This creates a need for a more comprehensive approach to multidimensional attention that can improve rPPG signal estimation.



This research proposes FactorizePhys, which uses a novel Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM). FSAM computes multidimensional attention by jointly processing spatial-temporal information using nonnegative matrix factorization.  **FactorizePhys shows significantly improved accuracy and cross-dataset generalization** compared to other rPPG methods. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the architectural decisions and hyperparameters in FSAM, highlighting its potential as a broadly applicable multidimensional attention mechanism.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF).  NMF decomposes a large matrix (V) into two smaller matrices (W and H). Matrix W represents the basis matrix, containing the basis vectors, while matrix H represents the coefficient matrix, indicating how much each basis vector contributes to each column of the original matrix. The process aims to approximate the original matrix V as closely as possible by the product of W and H, resulting in an approximated matrix  V.  The difference between the original matrix V and the approximated matrix  V is represented by the error matrix E.

The study explores three different mappings:  1) Mapping temporal features to M and spatial-channel features to N; 2) mapping channel features to M and spatial-temporal features to N; and 3) mapping spatial features to N and temporal-channel features to M. The results are evaluated in terms of MAE(HR), RMSE(HR), MAPE(HR), Corr(HR), SNR(BVP), and MACC(BVP) on three different datasets: PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and iBVP.  The goal is to determine the optimal mapping for achieving the best performance in rPPG estimation.

### In-depth insights


#### rPPG Attention
Remote PPG (rPPG) signal extraction from videos heavily relies on attention mechanisms to effectively filter relevant information and suppress noise.  **Multidimensional attention**, considering spatial, temporal, and spectral domains simultaneously, is crucial for robust performance.  Traditional approaches often treat these dimensions separately, limiting their effectiveness. The core challenge lies in developing methods that effectively combine these dimensions to create a comprehensive representation of the data, crucial for accurate pulse estimation. A promising direction involves **matrix factorization techniques**, which can uncover latent relationships within multidimensional rPPG data and enhance the signal's discriminative features.  **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** is particularly well-suited due to its ability to discover parts-based representations in non-negative data.  Furthermore, **attention modules based on NMF** present a computationally efficient and effective alternative to more complex attention methods, particularly relevant when dealing with high-dimensional rPPG data often seen in video-based extraction.

#### FSAM: NMF Power
The heading "FSAM: NMF Power" suggests an exploration of the capabilities of the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM) leveraging Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).  The core idea appears to be harnessing NMF's **dimensionality reduction** and **parts-based representation** properties to enhance the attention mechanism.  Instead of calculating attention separately across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions, FSAM likely uses NMF to jointly compute multidimensional attention from voxel embeddings. This approach could offer advantages such as **improved computational efficiency** and the ability to capture complex interactions between different feature dimensions.  The "power" aspect likely refers to the effectiveness of this integrated approach in tasks such as remote physiological signal (rPPG) estimation, potentially leading to better accuracy, robustness, and generalizability compared to traditional, disjoint attention mechanisms.  A key contribution may be demonstrating that NMF-based FSAM provides a **computationally efficient** alternative to more complex attention methods while achieving comparable or superior performance.

#### 3D-CNN Design
A 3D-CNN architecture presents a unique opportunity to leverage the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in video data for rPPG signal extraction.  **The design choices within the 3D-CNN are crucial**:  kernel size, number of layers, and the use of techniques like instance normalization and residual connections significantly impact model performance and efficiency.  The use of 3D convolutions allows the model to effectively capture spatiotemporal features, but the computational cost increases compared to 2D-CNNs.  **Careful consideration must be given to balancing performance and efficiency.**  Furthermore, the integration of attention mechanisms, such as the proposed Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM), further enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features, leading to potentially improved accuracy and robustness.  Ablation studies investigating these design choices are essential for optimizing the network architecture and achieving optimal performance.

#### Cross-Dataset Gains
The concept of "Cross-Dataset Gains" in a research paper would revolve around evaluating a model's ability to generalize well across multiple, distinct datasets.  A strong model demonstrates **consistent performance** regardless of the specific dataset used for testing.  Analysis of cross-dataset results would involve comparing various performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) across different datasets.  **Significant improvements** on unseen test sets compared to training sets highlight strong generalization.  The discussion might explore reasons for these gains, such as robust architectural design, effective attention mechanisms, and perhaps even dataset characteristics.  Conversely, **performance degradation** on certain test sets would signal limitations in the model's generalization ability and potentially indicate areas needing further improvement in the model's design or training methodology. The presence or absence of cross-dataset gains is a critical indicator of a model's robustness and practical applicability.

#### Future of FSAM
The Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM) presents a promising avenue for multidimensional attention mechanisms.  **Future research could explore FSAM's adaptability to various architectures beyond 2D and 3D CNNs, such as transformers or graph neural networks.**  Investigating its performance on a wider range of physiological signals beyond rPPG, like EEG or EMG, would further validate its versatility.  **Optimizing FSAM's computational efficiency, especially for high-resolution data or real-time applications, is crucial.**  The impact of different NMF variants and the optimal rank selection for diverse tasks also warrants further study. Finally, **thorough investigation into the interpretability of FSAM's learned features could unlock deeper insights into physiological processes and lead to more advanced signal processing techniques.**
