The training process involves a generator (policy) and a discriminator which are updated iteratively. The discriminator's goal is to distinguish between expert and generated trajectories while the generator aims to produce trajectories that fool the discriminator. However, the optimization process is prone to oscillations and may not converge to the desired state where the generator perfectly mimics the expert.\nThis paper proposes a novel solution, Controlled-GAIL (C-GAIL), using control theory to stabilize GAIL's training. It analyzes the training dynamics as a dynamical system, revealing that GAIL fails to converge to the desired equilibrium.  A differentiable regularizer is added to the objective function to act as a controller, pushing the system towards the desired equilibrium and enhancing asymptotic stability.  Experimental results show C-GAIL consistently improves the convergence speed, reduces oscillations, and matches the expert's behavior more closely compared to standard GAIL methods, across several benchmark environments.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "t4VwoIYBf0/podcast.wav"}
