### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many applications require understanding macroscopic system behavior, often relying on computationally expensive microscopic simulations.  Current methods demand computing forces on all microscopic coordinates, a significant hurdle for large systems.  This study addresses this limitation by focusing on macroscopic properties directly, rather than relying on full microscopic detail. 



The researchers propose a novel method that learns macroscopic dynamics using only partial microscopic force computations. This approach relies on a sparsity assumption; each microscopic force depends only on a few others. By mapping the training to the microscopic level and using partial forces as a stochastic estimate, the method updates model parameters efficiently.  The paper demonstrates accuracy and efficiency gains through various simulations, showcasing its potential for modeling complex systems more effectively.

### In-depth insights


#### Partial Force Learning
Partial force learning presents a **novel approach** to modeling macroscopic dynamics by leveraging only partial microscopic force computations. This strategy is particularly beneficial for large-scale systems where computing all microscopic forces becomes computationally prohibitive.  The core idea is to **exploit sparsity assumptions** within the system, suggesting that each microscopic coordinate's force depends significantly on only a small subset of other coordinates. By mapping the learning process to the macroscopic level and employing stochastic estimation techniques using partial forces, the method achieves a significant reduction in computational costs while maintaining accuracy in predicting macroscopic behaviors. The theoretical justification for this approach, based on stochastic estimation, is a significant contribution.  **Robustness and efficiency** are empirically validated across diverse microscopic systems, showcasing the wide applicability and potential of partial force learning for simulations and modeling.

#### Sparsity Assumption
The Sparsity Assumption, crucial to the proposed method, posits that each microscopic coordinate's force depends only on a limited subset of other coordinates.  This assumption is **key** to achieving computational efficiency, as it avoids the need to compute forces for all microscopic coordinates, a task that is computationally prohibitive for large systems. The assumption's validity hinges on the underlying physics of the system.  **Suitable conditions** are needed to ensure its accuracy; otherwise, using partial forces may lead to inaccuracies in the learned dynamics.  The theoretical justification provided for this assumption is crucial for understanding the robustness and reliability of the model.  In essence, the Sparsity Assumption is a **trade-off** between computational cost and accuracy; it allows the model to learn effectively from limited information, providing a balance between efficiency and result quality.

#### Autoencoder Closure
Autoencoder closure is a technique employed to learn the dynamics of macroscopic observables from a complex system using only partial microscopic information.  It leverages the power of autoencoders to **discover lower-dimensional latent space representations** of the system's state. By training the autoencoder on partial microscopic force computations, the method effectively reduces the computational burden of simulating the full system.  **Sparsity assumptions** about the underlying microscopic forces are crucial for the efficiency gains.  The core idea is that if the macroscopic dynamics can be represented as a closed system in the latent space, then accurate macroscopic predictions can be made even if we only have incomplete microscopic data.  This approach allows us to avoid expensive computations of forces across the entire microscopic system, making it a highly efficient technique for large-scale systems where full microscopic modeling is intractable.  **Theoretical guarantees** are provided to support the method's validity under specific conditions, ensuring robustness and accuracy.

#### Macroscopic Dynamics
The concept of macroscopic dynamics, focusing on the collective behavior of systems, is central to this research.  The paper addresses the challenge of computationally expensive simulations needed to accurately predict macroscopic dynamics from microscopic interactions.  **A key insight is the sparsity assumption**, suggesting that individual microscopic forces depend only on a small subset of other coordinates. This allows for significant computational savings by focusing on partial force computations. The core of the methodology is a novel method to learn macroscopic dynamics directly, mapping the learning procedure back to the microscopic level for efficient, partial force calculations.  **Theoretical justification is provided**, showing that this partial force approach provides a stochastic estimation of the full system.  **Validation is demonstrated** through multiple experiments on diverse microscopic models including those based on differential equations and molecular dynamics, showcasing robustness and efficiency.  The approach is framed within a closure modeling context, but differentiates itself from existing reduced order models by directly addressing the macroscopic observables without needing full microscopic reconstruction.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work on learning macroscopic dynamics from partial microscopic observations could explore several avenues. **Improving the efficiency and scalability** of the method for even larger systems is crucial.  This might involve investigating more sophisticated sparsity patterns or incorporating advanced machine learning techniques for more effective data representation and model training.  Another key area would be to **relax the sparsity assumption**, developing techniques robust to systems where forces are highly interdependent.  Exploring alternative latent model structures, beyond the ones used (MLPs, OnsagerNet, GFINNs), could also enhance performance and interpretability.   Finally, **extending the methodology** to handle stochastic microscopic systems and more complex macroscopic observables would broaden its applicability significantly.  This may necessitate integrating advanced statistical methods and incorporating domain-specific knowledge to handle the complexities introduced by stochasticity and high dimensionality.
