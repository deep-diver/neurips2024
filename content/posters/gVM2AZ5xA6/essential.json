These methods are computationally expensive and struggle to produce high-fidelity results for unseen identities.  This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a novel approach.\nThe proposed method, GAGAvatar, utilizes a **dual-lifting technique** to generate the parameters of 3D Gaussians from a single image.  This approach, combined with the use of global image features and a 3D morphable model, enables high-fidelity 3D Gaussian reconstruction that captures facial details and identity information, and allows for real-time expression control.  Experiments show that GAGAvatar significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstruction quality, expression accuracy, and rendering speed.", "affiliation": "University of Tokyo", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "gVM2AZ5xA6/podcast.wav"}
