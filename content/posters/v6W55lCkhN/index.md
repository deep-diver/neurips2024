### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is crucial for designing efficient deep learning models but is computationally expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Existing NAS methods don't consider the varying carbon intensity across different geographical locations and time periods. This results in high energy and carbon consumption, hindering sustainable AI development.  



The proposed CE-NAS framework tackles this issue by dynamically allocating GPU resources based on predicted carbon emissions. **It leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the balance between energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation of model architectures**. CE-NAS integrates a time-series transformer to predict carbon intensity and a multi-objective optimizer to reduce the search space. The results demonstrate that CE-NAS significantly reduces carbon emissions while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on various image classification benchmarks.

> This table compares the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the proposed time-series transformer model against three other baseline methods (STCF [11], DACF [56], and CC [55]) for forecasting carbon intensity.  The comparison is done for one-day, two-day, and three-day ahead forecasts across three different geographical regions (CISO, DE, and PJM). Lower MAPE values indicate better forecasting accuracy.





### In-depth insights


#### Carbon-Aware NAS
A 'Carbon-Aware NAS' approach is crucial for responsible AI development.  It directly addresses the **high carbon footprint** associated with traditional Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which often involve training massive numbers of models. By incorporating carbon emission awareness, this approach could significantly reduce the environmental impact of NAS, making it more sustainable and ethically sound.  **Dynamically adjusting GPU resource allocation** based on real-time carbon intensity is a key innovation.  This allows for shifting resources towards energy-efficient sampling during high-carbon periods and energy-intensive evaluation during low-carbon periods, achieving a balance between search efficiency and sustainability.  **Integrating multi-objective optimization** allows the search to consider not just accuracy, but also other metrics like latency and parameter count. This results in models which are optimized for both performance and energy consumption, further enhancing the carbon efficiency of the entire process.  Incorporating carbon forecasting models helps in proactively managing resource allocation, enabling a truly 'carbon-aware' system.

#### RL-Based Allocation
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based resource allocation in the context of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) presents a compelling approach to optimize the energy efficiency of the search process.  **The core idea is to dynamically allocate GPU resources** between energy-efficient sampling methods and energy-intensive evaluation tasks, adapting to real-time variations in carbon intensity.  This dynamic allocation, learned by an RL agent, avoids the limitations of static strategies that are unable to effectively balance search efficiency and energy cost.  **The RL agent learns a policy to allocate GPUs based on several factors** such as the remaining carbon budget, the number of already searched architectures and their performance, and the predicted future carbon intensity. This results in a more efficient model design process in terms of both energy and carbon consumption.  However, the effectiveness of this approach relies heavily on the accuracy of carbon intensity prediction and the design of the RL agent, which requires careful tuning and consideration of various factors.  **The key challenge lies in balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off** during RL training.  A purely exploration-based strategy could lead to excessive energy consumption, while a purely exploitation-based approach could result in suboptimal architectural designs.  Therefore, designing an effective RL agent requires careful consideration of the reward function, action space, and state representation to guide the agent towards carbon-efficient and high-performing architectures.

#### Multi-objective Search
In tackling complex neural architecture search (NAS) problems, a **multi-objective search** strategy offers a powerful approach.  Instead of focusing solely on accuracy, this method considers multiple, often competing, objectives such as accuracy, efficiency (latency, parameter count), and energy consumption. This holistic perspective is crucial for designing practical neural networks that are not only performant but also resource-friendly and environmentally conscious.  The adoption of multi-objective optimizers, such as LaMOO, allows for the exploration of the Pareto frontier, identifying a set of optimal architectures representing the best trade-offs between objectives. This approach avoids the limitations of single-objective optimization, which might prioritize one aspect at the cost of others.  Further, a **multi-objective search** facilitates exploration of a wider range of architectural designs, potentially leading to the discovery of innovative network structures that were previously overlooked by single-objective methods.

#### Benchmark Results
A dedicated 'Benchmark Results' section would ideally present a thorough comparison of the proposed carbon-efficient neural architecture search (NAS) framework, CE-NAS, against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.  This would involve showcasing CE-NAS's performance on established NAS benchmarks such as NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-301. Key metrics to report include **top-1 accuracy**, **parameter count**, **latency**, and crucially, **carbon emissions (CO2)**.  A strong analysis should highlight not only the improved accuracy and efficiency of CE-NAS but also its significant reduction in carbon footprint compared to baselines, possibly quantified as an X-fold reduction.  Furthermore, the results should be presented clearly, perhaps using tables and graphs to facilitate easy understanding and comparison.  Ideally, a discussion on the statistical significance of observed performance differences, such as p-values, should be included.  Finally, open-domain tasks on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are crucial to show real-world applicability and demonstrate CE-NAS's ability to produce competitive models with a considerably smaller environmental impact.

#### Future of CE-NAS
The future of CE-NAS hinges on **addressing its current limitations**. While CE-NAS effectively integrates carbon awareness into neural architecture search, scalability remains a challenge.  Future work could explore **distributed training strategies** to handle larger search spaces and datasets, reducing overall computation time and carbon footprint.  Furthermore, **improving the accuracy** of the carbon intensity prediction model is crucial.  More sophisticated models, potentially incorporating real-time grid data and weather patterns, could enhance predictive capabilities.  Research into **more efficient NAS algorithms** would also enhance CE-NAS performance.  Investigating novel multi-objective optimization techniques and exploring the use of proxy-based methods might significantly reduce computation. Finally, expanding the applicability of CE-NAS beyond image classification to other domains such as natural language processing and time series forecasting would broaden its impact. This would necessitate developing task-specific adaptation strategies, potentially involving transfer learning or meta-learning techniques.
