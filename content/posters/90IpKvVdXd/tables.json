The size of the label set is k \u2265 2, there are n \u2265 k experts, and the best expert is inconsistent with the feedback for r* many times. No prior knowledge on r* is required. The randomized bounds are due to Theorem C.7 and Lemmas C.10 and C.11. The deterministic bounds are stated in Theorem C.1.", "description": "This table presents the mistake bounds for prediction with expert advice under different settings. The settings vary based on whether the learner is randomized or deterministic, and whether the adversary is oblivious or adaptive. The bounds account for the number of labels (k), the number of experts (n), and the number of times the best expert is inconsistent with the feedback (r*).", "section": "1.2 Bounds for prediction with expert advice"}]
