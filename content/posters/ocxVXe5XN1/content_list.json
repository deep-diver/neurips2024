Recently, information-theoretic generalization measures, e.g., mutual information (MI) between the input (i.e. data) and output (i.e. hypothesis) of a learning algorithm, have been proposed by [2\u20134]. While original MI-based information-theoretic generalization bounds have made significant progress in analyzing the generalization of stochastic gradient-based algorithms in nonconvex learning problems (e.g., deep learning) [5\u201313], they are found to have several limitations. One of the most severe limitations is their unboundedness, where the MI measure can be infinite while the true generalization error is small [14]. To mitigate this issue, various bound-tightening techniques have been proposed [15, 6, 7]. Among them, [16] introduces a conditional mutual information (CMI) framework, which allows for the derivation of a CMI-based bound that is strictly upper-bounded by a constant. In the CMI framework, an additional \u201cghost sample\u201d is introduced alongside the original sample drawn from the unknown data distribution. A Bernoulli random variable sequence is then used to determine the membership of training data from these two samples. Ultimately, the CMI between these Bernoulli random variables and the output hypothesis of the learning algorithm, conditioned on these two samples, characterizes generalization. This setup, known as the \u201csupersample\u201d setting, ensures the boundedness of the CMI bound due to the constant entropy of a Bernoulli random variable. Intuitively, this CMI quantity leaks less information between data and the hypothesis, resulting in tighter bounds compared to the original MI quantity, as theoretically justified in [17]. Furthermore, several studies have aimed to further tighten CMI-based bounds. For example, previous tightening techniques in [15, 6, 7] are also applicable to CMI bounds [17\u201321]. Notably, another way to tighten the CMI bound is by utilizing variants of the original CMI quantity, such as functional CMI ( $f$ -CMI) [22], evaluated CMI (e-CMI) [16, 23], and loss-difference CMI (ld-CMI) [24]. As the output hypothesis is replaced by the predictions, loss pairs, and loss differences of the two samples, these CMI quantities are tighter than the original hypothesis-based CMI due to the data-processing inequality. While most information-theoretic bounds in the supersample setting focus on (conditional) mutual information measures, it is natural to ask whether there is a general way to extend this CMI framework to other statistical distance/divergence measures, such as other $f$ -divergences.

In particular, [26] provides some Wasserstein distance-based and total variation-based bounds in the supersample setting. Furthermore, [29] proposes a general convex analysis-based framework that replaces the input-output MI quantity in [2\u20134] with any strongly convex function. While [29] itself does not discuss the supersample setting, the further extension in [30] indeed considers invoking the supersample setting to strengthen the bounds. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this work, we present a generic approach to derive generalization bounds based on conditional $f$ -information, a natural extension from mutual information to other $f$ -dvergence-based dependence measures. Our proof strategy is significantly different from the original CMI framework [16] and the convex analysis (or regret analysis) based framework [29, 30]. Specifically, our development starts from the variational representation of $f$ -divergence, which involves the convex conjugate of a convex function used to define the $f$ -divergence. While the previous CMI framework focuses on upper-bounding the cumulant generating function (CGF) of a selected measurable function (which relates to the generalization error), we make a particular choice of such a measurable function, namely the inverse of that convex conjugate function. This choice makes CGF equal to (or upper bounded by) zero, hence eliminated from the variational representation. The remaining task is to lower bound this inverse of the convex conjugate function under a joint distribution. In the case of MI (or KL), the expectation of this inverse function is close to the log wealth quantity used in the coin-betting framework for obtaining concentration inequalities [31, 1, 32]. Indeed, the lower bounding techniques here are inspired by some inequalities used in the coin-betting framework [31, 1, 32], and we extend them to the cases of other $f$ -divergence in the supersample setting. Notably, unlike [30, 1], our conditional $f$ -information generalization bounds do not rely on any existing regret guarantees of online learning algorithms. We discuss the connection with the coin-betting framework in Appendix E.

Specifically, our main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) In the case where the loss difference between a data pair is bounded, we first provide a novel variational formula (cf. Lemma 3.1) for $f$ -information, enabling us to derive conditional $f$ -information-based generalization bounds; 2) For the KL case, we first provide an \u201coracle\u201d CMI bound (cf. Theorem 3.1). This bound recovers many previous CMI bounds, including the square-root bound and fast-rate bounds in low empirical risk settings. It also helps us understand the potential looseness of previous square-root CMI bounds, where some quantities that can vanish as the sample size $n$ increases are simply ignored. Additionally, some novel fast-rate bounds are implied (cf. Corollary 3.1-3.2). Particularly, Corollary 3.2 contains a term in the form of the product of total variation and KL divergence, a similar quantity also appearing in a recent PAC-Bayesian bound [34]; 3) We present several other $f$ -information-based bounds, including the looser measure, $\\chi^{2}$ -information (cf. Theorem B.2) and tighter measures, squared Hellinger (SH)- information (cf. Theorem 3.2) and Jensen-Shannon (JS)-information (cf. Theorem 3.3). Due to the similarity in expressions, most arguments for our CMI bounds are also applicable to these bounds based on $f$ -information measures; 4) We extend our framework to the unbounded loss difference case, where we provide a refined variational formula for $f$ -information (cf. Lemma 4.1), enabling us to provide a novel $f$ -information-based bound (cf. Theorem 4.1 for the case of KL). The obtained bound is no worse than a previous information-theoretic generalization bound in [25] (adapted to the same supersample setting); 5) Empirical results show that the new bounds in our framework, particularly the squared Hellinger-information bound, outperform previous results.

Specifically, we consider the oracle bounds, given in Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, and Theorem 3.3, which we denote as CMI(Oracle), CSHI(Oracle), and CJSI(Oracle), respectively. Given that the squared Hellinger-information is a tighter measure than MI, and the constants in Theorem 3.2 exhibit less pessimism compared to those in the JS-information bound, we introduce two additional squared Hellinger-information bounds for comparison. The first one, akin to Corollary 3.2, is E $\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\cdot}_{\\mu}({\\cal A})\\,\\le\\,\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbb{E}\\sqrt{\\Bigl(4\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta L_{i}^{2}]+2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{TV}}\\left(P_{\\Delta L_{i}|U_{i},\\widetilde{Z}_{i}},P_{\\Delta L_{i}|\\widetilde{Z}_{i}}\\right)\\right]\\Bigr)\\,I_{\\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\\widetilde{Z}_{i}}(\\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}}\\end{array}$ (cf. Corollary B.1 in Appendix B.7), denoted as $C S H I(V a r)$ . The second one adopts a more pessimistic choice by replacing $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta L_{i}^{2}]$ with the constant 1, labeled as CSHI(Worst). Additionally, we include three previous information-theoretic generalization bounds as baselines: the original ld-CMI bound in [24, Theorem3.1] (ld-CMI), the sharpness-based single-loss MI bound in [24, Theorem 4.5] (Sharpness), and the binary KL-based CMI bound in [23, Theorem 5] (Binary $k l_{.}$ . Further details on experimental settings are available in the Appendix D. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "The final results are shown in Figure 2. First, we observe that for the linear classifier on the two-class data (Figure 2a), most bounds are close to the exact generalization error, with Sharpness being the tightest. Note that the sharpness-based MI bound in [24, Theorem 4.5] is applicable solely for zero-one loss. As the prediction task becomes more complex (Figures 2b-2f), our squared Hellingerinformation-based bounds are the tightest. Specifically, the squared Hellinger-information-based bound is always tighter than the CMI bound in the oracle type. Notably, $C S H I(V a r)$ also outperforms all other $f$ -information-based bounds in these cases, and even the pessimistic CSHI(Worst) bound outperforms them, except for Sharpness, in Figures 2c-2d. Additionally, by comparing CMI(Oracle) and ld-CMI, we see significant potential for improving the original ld-CMI bound. Finally, although the JS-information bound contains relatively pessimistic constants, it still outperforms some MI-based bounds in many cases (e.g., Figures 2c-2e). These observations suggest that considering alternative $f$ -information rather than MI is indeed necessary for studying generalization.

For example, [54, 44] propose a \u201cleaveone-out\u201d (LOO) construction of supersamples, reducing the size of the supersample from $2n$ to $n+1$ . Additionally, [55] constructs a \u201cneighboring-hypothesis\u201d matrix, enabling the derivation of a hypothesis-conditioned CMI bound. The key component in this bound is the product of the new CMI term and an algorithmic stability parameter. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in understanding MI or CMI as generalization measures in stochastic convex optimization (SCO) problems. Specifically, [56\u201358] all point out that MI or CMI bounds can be non-vanishing in some SCO examples, while the exact generalization error is vanishing. Notably, [58] discovers a \u201cCMI-accuracy tradeoff\u201d phenomenon in certain scenarios: For the generalization error to be upper bounded by a vanishing parameter, the original hypothesis-based CMI must be lower bounded by the reciprocal of this parameter (or even the reciprocal of its square), indicating that the CMI bound cannot characterize the learnability of such problems. Although this limitation is currently only observed for hypothesis-based CMI, it is anticipated to hold in other variants of CMI, such as ld-CMI. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our work also contributes to understanding the potential looseness of previous CMI generalization bounds. However, the current state of our bounds cannot explain or resolve the limitation presented in [58] in a non-trivial way. Nonetheless, our framework provides some intuition that, as long as a gap exists between $\\phi^{*-1}$ and $x-a x^{2}$ (see Figure 1(Right)), there will always be room for constructing counterexamples that challenge information-theoretic measures, although such examples may be rare. Another limitation of this work is the lack of a high-probability generalization guarantee. There are two potential directions to address this: either by applying similar techniques to the framework in [59], which is the PAC-Bayesian counterpart of the CMI bound, or by combining it with recent information-bottleneck generalization bounds [60, 61].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
