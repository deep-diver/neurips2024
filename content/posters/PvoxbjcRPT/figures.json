The figure highlights the agents' initial inconsistent plans at time step t=0, where each agent makes independent decisions leading to potential collisions, and the eventual convergence towards consistent plans at time step t=4, showcasing MADIFF's ability to coordinate agents' behaviors.

Four datasets (Expert, Md-Replay, Medium, Random) are used for evaluation across three MPE tasks (Spread, Tag, World).
