Existing offline MARL methods often suffer from issues such as extrapolation errors and low expressiveness, hindering effective learning from pre-collected datasets. This paper introduces MADIFF, a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations by using an attention-based diffusion model. \nMADIFF models the complex interactions among agents using an attention mechanism which dynamically weighs interactions between agents. This allows it to effectively handle the coordination challenges inherent in multi-agent systems.  Furthermore, MADIFF operates under a centralized training, decentralized execution scheme which improves sample efficiency.  Experiments on several benchmark tasks demonstrate MADIFF's superior performance over existing methods, showing its effectiveness in both decentralized and centralized settings.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PvoxbjcRPT/podcast.wav"}
