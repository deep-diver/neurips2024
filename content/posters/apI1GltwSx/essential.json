Existing batch-to-global methods often lack diversity in synthetic images, hindering performance. This limits the effectiveness of dataset distillation, particularly for large datasets.\nDELT tackles this by introducing an EarlyLate training scheme. It partitions data into subtasks, training each with varied iterations to produce diverse images.  This strategy enhances intra-class diversity without added computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1K show DELT's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "apI1GltwSx/podcast.wav"}
