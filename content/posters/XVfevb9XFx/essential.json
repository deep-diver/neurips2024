However, existing methods often struggle with inconsistencies between offline datasets and online environments, leading to unstable performance.  This paper identifies two key problems: evaluation and improvement mismatches.  Evaluation mismatches arise from differences in how policies are evaluated offline and online; improvement mismatches stem from inconsistencies in how policies are updated. \nThis paper proposes a general framework, OCR-CFT, to address these mismatches.  First, it re-evaluates the offline policy optimistically to avoid performance drops during initial online fine-tuning. Second, it calibrates the critic to align with the offline policy to prevent errors during policy updates. Finally, it uses constrained fine-tuning to handle distribution shifts.  Experiments demonstrate that OCR-CFT achieves significant and stable performance improvements on multiple benchmark tasks, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art O2O methods.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XVfevb9XFx/podcast.wav"}
