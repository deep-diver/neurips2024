### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Reinforcement learning often struggles in scenarios with partial observability, where agents only have incomplete information about the environment.  Existing methods that use complete state information during training often encounter unstable learning due to high variance.  This is because they over-rely on the complete state, causing instability when dealing with real-world uncertainties.



To address this, the authors propose DCRL (Dual Critic Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that uses **two critics**: one with full state information (oracle) and another with only partial observations. A synergistic strategy smoothly transitions and weighs these critics, leveraging the strengths of each while reducing variance and maintaining unbiasedness.  The **theoretical analysis proves its unbiasedness and variance reduction**, and **empirical results demonstrate that DCRL outperforms existing methods across various challenging environments**.

### In-depth insights


#### DCRL Framework
The DCRL framework, a **Dual Critic Reinforcement Learning** approach, innovatively addresses the challenges of partial observability in reinforcement learning.  It elegantly combines the strengths of two distinct critics: a standard critic operating solely on observable history and an oracle critic leveraging the complete state information available during training. This **asymmetric design** enables efficient learning by harnessing full-state knowledge while mitigating the variance often associated with over-reliance on complete states.  A **synergistic weighting mechanism** seamlessly transitions between the two critics, dynamically adjusting their influence based on the observed learning progress and uncertainty. This intelligent blending reduces variance while maintaining unbiasedness, leading to improved online performance. **Theoretical analysis** and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of DCRL in several benchmark environments. The framework's simplicity, adaptability, and theoretical grounding makes it a significant contribution to the field of partial observability RL.

#### Dual Critic Synergy
The concept of "Dual Critic Synergy" in reinforcement learning proposes a powerful approach to address the challenges of partial observability. By employing **two distinct critics**, one with access to the complete state (the oracle critic) and another operating solely on observable information (the standard critic), this framework aims to leverage the strengths of both. The oracle critic enhances learning efficiency by providing a more accurate value function estimate, while the standard critic mitigates variance and promotes robustness in online performance. A key innovation lies in the **synergistic strategy** that seamlessly transitions and weights the outputs of both critics, optimizing the balance between efficiency and stability. This approach is theoretically grounded, with proofs demonstrating unbiasedness and variance reduction.  The method's effectiveness is experimentally validated, showcasing superior performance across various environments compared to alternative approaches. **Adaptive weighting mechanisms**, responsive to the performance of both critics, dynamically balance the contributions of complete and partial state information. This dynamic adaptation proves crucial in navigating uncertain environments, effectively leveraging full-state information during training while ensuring reliable performance during deployment where access to full states is limited.

#### Variance Reduction
The concept of variance reduction is central to the success of reinforcement learning, especially in complex environments.  High variance in learning can lead to unstable training and poor generalization.  **The paper tackles this challenge by introducing a dual-critic reinforcement learning framework (DCRL).** DCRL cleverly utilizes both a standard critic operating on limited observations and an oracle critic with access to the full state, achieving a balance. The oracle critic enhances learning efficiency, while the standard critic mitigates the variance introduced by the oracle.  **A key innovation is a weighting mechanism that dynamically blends the advantages of both critics.** This adaptive strategy not only improves performance but also contributes to theoretical unbiasedness.  **The theoretical analysis and empirical results convincingly showcase DCRL's superior performance over traditional methods** in challenging partially observable scenarios.  The weighting mechanism acts as a form of robust regularization, preventing overreliance on potentially noisy complete-state information. In essence, DCRL presents a well-founded and effective solution to the persistent problem of variance in reinforcement learning, particularly relevant to real-world applications with partial observability.

#### MiniGrid & MiniWorld
The experimental evaluation of the proposed Dual Critic Reinforcement Learning (DCRL) framework is conducted on MiniGrid and MiniWorld environments.  **MiniGrid**, a procedurally generated environment, presents various goal-oriented tasks with partial observability. DCRL's performance is compared against baselines like Recurrent Actor-Critic, Asymmetric Actor-Critic, and Unbiased Asymmetric Actor-Critic across multiple MiniGrid tasks. The results demonstrate that DCRL outperforms these baselines in most scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in partially observable environments. MiniWorld, on the other hand, offers more complex continuous state space tasks, further testing DCRL's robustness.  Again, DCRL is shown to improve upon baseline methods, particularly those that do not effectively utilize state information. **The consistent superior performance of DCRL in both MiniGrid and MiniWorld highlights its ability to mitigate the high variance often associated with using full state information during training while retaining unbiasedness**.  These results strongly support the core claims of the paper.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising directions. **Extending DCRL to handle more complex environments** with continuous state and action spaces is crucial, requiring investigation of appropriate function approximation techniques.  **Addressing the computational cost** of DCRL, particularly with large state spaces, might involve exploring more efficient architectures or approximation methods.  **Investigating alternative weighting strategies** between the oracle and standard critics, possibly incorporating adaptive or learned weighting schemes, could improve performance.  **Theoretical analysis of DCRL's convergence properties** under various assumptions warrants further study. Finally, **empirical evaluations on diverse real-world problems** should be conducted to demonstrate DCRL's generalizability and practical applicability.

> üîº This figure illustrates the architecture of the Dual Critic Reinforcement Learning (DCRL) framework.  It shows how the two critics (oracle and standard) process the state and observation information separately. The oracle critic uses both history and full state information, while the standard critic only uses history. A weighting mechanism (Œ≤) combines the advantages from both critics to mitigate variance while improving efficiency. This combined advantage is then used to update the actor's policy, minimizing the policy loss. The figure also highlights the data flow and policy gradient flow through the system.

The full state reveals the complete layout of the environment, including the agent's location (red triangle), the goal location (red box), and obstacles (orange wavy blocks). However, the agent only perceives a partial observation, which is a limited field of view and doesn't show the complete environment layout.  This illustrates the challenge of partial observability in reinforcement learning, where the agent must make decisions based on incomplete information.
