{"importance": "This paper is important because it introduces a novel method to improve the accuracy of time series forecasting models, particularly in situations with **non-stationary data**. The proposed method, Dual-domain Dynamic Normalization (DDN), can be easily integrated into existing forecasting models and has shown significant performance improvements in various benchmark datasets.  This makes DDN a valuable tool for researchers working on time series forecasting, opening up new avenues for enhancing the robustness and accuracy of their models. The model-agnostic nature of DDN makes it particularly useful for a wide range of applications.", "summary": "DDN: Dual-domain Dynamic Normalization dynamically improves time series forecasting accuracy by addressing data distribution changes in both time and frequency domains via a plug-in module.", "takeaways": ["DDN significantly enhances time series forecasting accuracy by dynamically capturing distribution variations.", "DDN is a model-agnostic, plug-in module easily integrated into various existing forecasting models.", "Extensive experiments demonstrate DDN's superiority over other normalization methods across diverse datasets."], "tldr": "Time series forecasting (TSF) models often struggle with real-world data due to its non-stationary nature, meaning data distribution changes over time.  Existing normalization methods using fixed-time windows cannot effectively capture these complex variations, leading to unreliable predictions.  This is a significant limitation for DNN-based TSF methods.\n\nTo address this, the paper proposes Dual-domain Dynamic Normalization (DDN), which uses wavelet transforms to decompose time series into different frequencies, then normalizes data in both time and frequency domains using sliding windows.  This dynamic approach effectively captures time-varying distribution changes, leading to improved prediction accuracy.  Extensive experiments showed that DDN significantly outperforms existing normalization methods when integrated into various forecasting models on multiple benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "RVZfra6sZo/podcast.wav"}
