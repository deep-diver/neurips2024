### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Time series forecasting (TSF) models often struggle with real-world data due to its non-stationary nature, meaning data distribution changes over time.  Existing normalization methods using fixed-time windows cannot effectively capture these complex variations, leading to unreliable predictions.  This is a significant limitation for DNN-based TSF methods.



To address this, the paper proposes Dual-domain Dynamic Normalization (DDN), which uses wavelet transforms to decompose time series into different frequencies, then normalizes data in both time and frequency domains using sliding windows.  This dynamic approach effectively captures time-varying distribution changes, leading to improved prediction accuracy.  Extensive experiments showed that DDN significantly outperforms existing normalization methods when integrated into various forecasting models on multiple benchmark datasets.

(a) shows how existing methods using a fixed window size for normalization fail to capture distribution variations effectively, especially in dealing with time series data where the distribution changes frequently.

### In-depth insights


#### DDN's Dual-Domain
The core idea of DDN's dual-domain approach lies in its ability to capture distribution variations in both the time and frequency domains.  **Traditional normalization methods often struggle with non-stationary time series**, where the data distribution shifts over time, because they only operate in the time domain.  DDN addresses this limitation by using the wavelet transform to decompose the time series into different frequency components. **This decomposition reveals distribution shifts that might be obscured in the time domain alone**, enabling more accurate normalization. By normalizing both the time and frequency domains, DDN provides a more comprehensive and robust way to handle non-stationarity, leading to improved forecasting accuracy.  The method‚Äôs effectiveness is further enhanced by a sliding window approach, allowing it to adapt to evolving distribution shifts over time.  **DDN's modular design makes it easily adaptable to various forecasting models**, increasing its versatility and potential impact across various applications.

#### Dynamic Normalization
Dynamic normalization methods in time series forecasting aim to address the challenge of non-stationary data, where statistical properties like mean and variance change over time.  **Traditional normalization techniques** often fail because they assume stationarity, leading to inaccurate predictions. Dynamic methods overcome this by adapting the normalization parameters over time, typically using a sliding window approach.  This allows the model to focus on recent data with more relevant statistical information for prediction.  **Key considerations** include window size selection‚Äîtoo small may not capture underlying trends, while too large can oversmooth important changes, and the choice of statistics to dynamically compute (e.g., moving averages, rolling standard deviations).  **The benefits** are improved model accuracy and robustness for time series exhibiting distribution shifts and trends.  However, **limitations** exist; computational costs increase, and effective window size and statistic selection are model- and data-dependent. Future research should investigate more sophisticated adaptive techniques and automatic parameter tuning for optimal performance.

#### Non-Stationarity Tackled
The concept of tackling non-stationarity in time series forecasting is crucial because real-world data often exhibits significant shifts in its statistical properties over time.  **Traditional methods that assume stationarity fail in these situations**, leading to inaccurate predictions.  Addressing this challenge often involves techniques that adapt to these changes.  **Normalization strategies**, for instance, aim to stabilize the data's distribution, but static normalization may not sufficiently capture dynamic variations. Therefore, **dynamic normalization techniques** that adjust their parameters based on a sliding window or other adaptive mechanisms are required.  Another approach involves incorporating **explicit models of distribution changes**, either through predicting the distribution directly or using techniques that implicitly learn to represent shifts in statistical properties.  **Wavelet transforms** provide a powerful means of decomposing the time series into different frequency components, separating high and low frequency variations, thus allowing for the flexible modeling of distribution changes across different time scales.  **Combining techniques**, such as wavelet-based decomposition with adaptive normalization, offers a particularly powerful approach, since wavelet transform help to isolate non-stationary aspects while dynamic normalization helps to capture variations.

#### Benchmark Results
A dedicated 'Benchmark Results' section in a research paper provides crucial insights into the model's performance.  It should present a **comparison** of the proposed model against established benchmarks or state-of-the-art methods.  **Quantitative metrics**, such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, or MSE, should be clearly reported and analyzed, ideally with statistical significance testing. The choice of metrics should be justified and relevant to the problem domain. A good benchmark analysis also involves a **qualitative discussion** of results, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.  **Visualizations**, such as graphs or tables, are essential for effective communication of results, allowing for easy comparison of performance across different metrics and models. The discussion should also critically consider the limitations of the benchmarks, potential biases, and the context of the results.  **Addressing limitations** and suggesting future work based on the benchmark results further enhances the section's value. Overall, a well-structured 'Benchmark Results' section demonstrates the model's capabilities, provides context, and informs future research directions.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this Dual-domain Dynamic Normalization (DDN) for non-stationary time series forecasting could explore several promising avenues. **Extending DDN's applicability to other deep learning architectures** beyond the tested models is crucial.  Investigating **the optimal window size selection** for sliding normalization within DDN across various datasets and frequencies merits further study.  A potential area for advancement is **improving the efficiency of the wavelet transform** process within DDN, perhaps through the exploration of alternative wavelet families or optimized algorithms.   Moreover, a detailed analysis of DDN's performance characteristics under different levels of non-stationarity and noise is needed. Finally, **research into combining DDN with other advanced time series techniques**, such as attention mechanisms or recurrent networks, could lead to even more robust and accurate forecasting models.  A comprehensive evaluation on a wider range of real-world datasets representing diverse domains and complexities will strengthen the claims made in this study.

It shows the two main processing paths: one for the forecasting model itself, and another for handling the non-stationarity of the time series. The non-stationary elimination stage consists of Time Domain Normalization and Frequency Domain Normalization. Then, the non-stationary reconstruction takes the output from the distribution prediction model to reconstruct the non-stationary factors and combine them with the forecasting results to produce a final prediction.
