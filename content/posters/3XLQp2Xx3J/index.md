### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular method for 3D rendering, but the lack of effective copyright protection for 3D assets is a significant issue.  Classical 3D steganography methods are not suitable for 3DGS because of its explicit 3D representation and real-time rendering speed.  Previous methods that try to modify 3DGS either compromised rendering quality or were insecure.

This paper introduces GS-Hider, a new steganography framework designed specifically for 3DGS.  **GS-Hider uses a coupled secured feature attribute to replace the original spherical harmonics coefficients, creating a robust system that hides both images and 3D scenes while preserving rendering quality**. The use of a coupled feature with parallel scene and message decoders ensures both high security and high fidelity.  Extensive experiments demonstrate GS-Hider's effectiveness in various scenarios.

> This figure illustrates the application scenario of the proposed GS-Hider steganography framework.  Alice, the 3DGS trainer, uses training views of both the original and a hidden 3D scene to train the GS-Hider model.  The model then produces a 3DGS point cloud file, a scene decoder (publicly available), and a message decoder (private). Alice uploads the point cloud file and scene decoder. Bob, a 3DGS user, can render the original 3D scene from the publicly available files. However, only Alice, possessing the private message decoder, can extract the hidden 3D scene, thus enabling copyright protection or secure communication.

### In-depth insights


#### 3DGS Steganography
3DGS steganography, a novel approach to data hiding, leverages the unique properties of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for embedding information within 3D scene representations.  **Unlike previous methods which often target implicit representations or simple modifications to explicit ones, 3DGS steganography must contend with the explicit nature of the 3D point cloud and its real-time renderability.** This requires carefully designed techniques to avoid impacting the rendering quality or introducing obvious artifacts.  The core challenge is to find ways to modify 3DGS parameters, such as spherical harmonics coefficients or Gaussian distributions, that subtly encode data while preserving visual fidelity. **Security is paramount, as the transparency of the 3DGS format necessitates robust techniques to prevent unauthorized extraction of the hidden information.**  The successful implementation of 3DGS steganography requires a balance between capacity, security, robustness, and fidelity, which presents a significant research opportunity.

#### GS-Hider Framework
The GS-Hider framework presents a novel approach to steganography within the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).  It cleverly addresses the challenges posed by the explicit and transparent nature of 3DGS data, where each point carries clear physical meaning, unlike implicit representations like NeRF.  **GS-Hider's core innovation lies in the introduction of a 'coupled secured feature attribute'**. This attribute replaces the original spherical harmonics coefficients, allowing for the simultaneous encoding of both the original scene and a hidden message (multimodal messages such as 3D scenes and images are supported).  **The use of separate scene and message decoders is crucial**, enabling the disentanglement of the original and hidden information without compromising rendering quality or security. The framework demonstrates **exceptional security**, **robustness**, and **capacity**, effectively hiding multi-modal data while maintaining high fidelity.  **The dual-decoder architecture contributes significantly to the security**, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access the hidden information.

#### Security and Fidelity
Achieving both high security and high fidelity in a steganography system is a significant challenge.  **Security** focuses on preventing unauthorized access to the hidden message; strong encryption and robust embedding techniques are crucial.  **Fidelity**, on the other hand, centers on preserving the quality of the cover media (in this case, the 3D model) after the secret message is embedded; imperceptible changes are vital.  The interplay between these two is complex; strong security measures might compromise fidelity, and conversely, prioritizing fidelity could weaken security.  A successful approach requires a careful balancing act.  **This balance is often achieved through sophisticated algorithms and careful selection of embedding locations within the 3D model.**  For example, modifying less visually salient features or using techniques that are resistant to common attacks is beneficial.  Evaluation often involves quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR for fidelity, detection rate for security) and qualitative assessments to ensure the trade-off is acceptable.  Ultimately, the effectiveness of any steganographic method hinges on the specific context and the relative importance of security vs. fidelity.

#### Capacity and Versatility
The capacity and versatility of a steganography method are crucial for practical applications.  **High capacity** allows embedding substantial amounts of information, increasing the potential for data hiding.  **Versatility** refers to the method's ability to handle diverse data types (images, 3D scenes, audio, etc.) and conceal information in various media formats.  A versatile method also adapts to different application scenarios, offering flexibility in the types of messages hidden and the ways they are extracted. The combination of high capacity and versatility makes a steganography system more robust and adaptable, capable of addressing diverse security and data-hiding needs in various contexts.  **Robustness** against attacks is essential; a system with high capacity and versatility is valuable only if it can withstand attempts to detect or remove the hidden information.

#### Future Enhancements
Future enhancements for this 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) steganography method, GS-Hider, could significantly improve its capabilities.  **Improving rendering quality** is crucial, potentially by integrating with advanced rendering techniques like Mip-Splatting to reduce artifacts and increase visual fidelity. This would enhance the imperceptibility of hidden messages.  **Efficiency enhancements** are also key; the current system's rendering speed is slower than the original 3DGS. Optimizations like pruning Gaussian points, reducing feature dimension, or refining network architectures could address this.  Further research should explore **security against more sophisticated attacks**, and the robustness of the system under various conditions.  **Expanding the range of hidden data types** beyond 3D scenes and images is another avenue of improvement, potentially incorporating multimodal data.  Finally, developing a more user-friendly interface and providing clear guidelines would enhance practicality and accessibility, increasing GS-Hider's adoption and impact. **Expanding the research to other implicit 3D representations**, such as NeRF, would also be valuable to test the generality of the method.

> This figure compares three different approaches to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) steganography.  (a) shows the original 3DGS pipeline. (b) demonstrates a naive approach of adding a spherical harmonic (SH) coefficient to embed information, which is insecure as the added coefficient is easily detectable.  (c) illustrates another naive approach of jointly optimizing the 3DGS and a separate message decoder, which may compromise the original scene's fidelity.  The figure highlights that these intuitive methods are unsuitable for secure and high-fidelity 3DGS steganography.

> This figure illustrates the GS-Hider framework.  It begins with the input of 3D Gaussian parameters (position Œº·µ¢, opacity Œ±·µ¢, scaling factor s·µ¢, rotation q·µ¢, and coupled secured feature f·µ¢). These parameters go through the projection, adaptive density control, and coupled feature Gaussian rasterizer stages. The resulting coupled feature Fcoup is then input to two parallel decoder networks: a scene decoder that outputs the rendered original RGB scene Ipred and a message decoder that outputs the hidden message Mpred.  The message decoder's output is private, protecting the hidden information.
