Existing algorithms either have high time complexity or minimize weaker notions of regret.  This problem stems from the difficulty of computing approximate fixed points, a crucial step in many regret minimization algorithms.  The existing methods for computing fixed points have high time complexity, or they only minimize weaker notions of regret.\nThis paper introduces new, efficient algorithms that minimize regret against low-degree polynomial swap deviations. The key innovation is a relaxed notion of \"fixed points in expectation\", which is computationally tractable unlike the traditional fixed point problem.  The authors also relate low-degree deviations to low-depth decision trees, resulting in improved time complexity bounds.  These contributions provide a significant advancement in the field by bridging the gap between existing methods and offering a more practical approach to regret minimization.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "c4ElkpA0kh/podcast.wav"}
