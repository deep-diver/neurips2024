On the one hand, generating sentences with more details is usually required in order to provide more precise object descriptions.

To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework, named as \u201cunleash-then-eliminate\u201d, which first elicits the latent information in the intermediate layers, and then adopts a cycle-consistency-based decoding method to alleviate the production of hallucinations.

Additionally, a further complication arises in the context of region-level understanding, where models are required to generate precise and identifiable descriptions for specific regions. To achieve that, the MLLMs sometimes have to make use of the surroundings for reference while effectively avoiding out-of-region information distorting the description of the target object, e.g. incorrectly attributing characteristics of other objects to the targeted region (Figure 7 in appendix). This requirement exacerbates the issue of attribute-level hallucinations [3, 50]. In this paper, we aim to explore this potential trade-off between the detailed description and accurate targeting of referring objects in MLLM-based REG task. To be specific, providing precise object descriptions necessitates generating sentences with more details, which results in longer sentences. Meanwhile, the text with increased granularity (length) is more likely to contain inaccurate or spurious information, commonly defined as \u201challucinations.\u201d Table 1 shows an example of quantitative analysis. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address the trade-off between information richness and reliability, we propose a novel approach called \u201cunleash-then-eliminate,\u201d as depicted in Figure 1. We observed that the alignment of regionlevel multi-modal information does not maintain a monotonic progression during inter-layer transitions. Moreover, when multi-modal hidden states are projected into the language space using the language head, the intermediate layers sometimes hold more descriptive region information than the final layer. These observations (Section 3.2) imply that the most suitable layer for each referred region should not be solely confined to the final layer. Accordingly, we adopt contrastive decoding [8, 22] to unleash the object information contained in the intermediate layers. To eliminate unsuitable candidate outputs, we leverage the dual task of REG: Referring expression segmentation (RES) [37, 48], which aims to segment a target object mask from the entire image given a sentence describing the object. Ideally, for the same object, the region input (formed as a mask) for the REG task and the mask output from the RES task should exhibit cycle consistency. Based on this insight, we propose a cycle-consistency-based decoding method, which enables us to choose among multiple outputs based on their descriptive quality thus reducing hallucinations while maintaining the richness of the output sentences. Furthermore, considering the need to diminish the computational load of RES, we develop a hybrid layer importance measurement strategy to select the best layer for each token during the next word prediction. This strategy leverages both the layer-wise prior importance estimated over probing subset, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence [8] between the logits of each candidate layer and the last layer. With the layer-wise prior importance, the MLLM-based REG model maintains promising performance in reducing hallucinations and enhancing the granularity of the generated sentences, even without the assistance of RES model.

Significant progress has been made in unleashing the region-level understanding ability in MLLMs [6, 18, 37, 52, 55, 57]. To incorporate region-level information into sequence generation of MLLMs, some approaches [6, 52] integrate bounding box coordinates into the language input in the form of natural language prompts. Ferret [52] proposes a spatial-aware visual sampler that enables the arbitrary shapes of visual prompts. The current proposed Osprey [55] unlocked the capability of pixel understanding, alleviating the influence of irrelevant information in the visual prompt inputs. These methods have propelled the REG task into the era of MLLMs. Considering that MLLMs incorporate extensive knowledge from unimodal and multimodal pre-trained corpora, there is a potential for the REG task to leverage this inherent knowledge within the models to generate more specific and detailed expressions without additional training, thus more effectively addressing real-world applications [21, 39, 41].

Large language models are pre-trained on unlabeled corpora to acquire extensive world knowledge and subsequently undergo post-training to learn to follow instructions [34] and align with human preferences [2]. This systematic pre- and post-training pipeline makes them powerful at solving a wide range of NLP tasks [16, 36, 40, 43]. However, some studies indicate that they may fail to accurately assess their own knowledge [51] and often exhibit overconfidence in their responses [47], which results in hallucinations [59]. To mitigate these issues, recent research [5, 8, 20] proposes inference-time decoding strategies for trained LLMs to find latent knowledge inside the internal activations without additional training. C. Burns et al. [5] introduce a Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) algorithm to identify a direction of truth in the activation space of LLMs that remains consistent across negations, thereby reducing generated errors. Based on the discovery of CCS, ITI [20] dives deep into attention heads and suggests shifting model activations alongside factuality-related heads during inference to help reduce hallucinations. Besides \u201cfinding the direction of truth,\u201d DoLa [8] proposes contrastive decoding by comparing the differences in logits between the projections of later and earlier layers to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. In line with the motivations of [5, 20], our investigation uncovers that well-trained MLLMs\u2019 intermediate layers differ in multi-modal alignment and region-level understanding capabilities.

In the realm of MLLMs, \u201challucination\u201d typically refers to \u201cobject hallucination,\u201d where the models generate plausible outputs containing objects that are either absent from or mismatched with the images [15, 19, 24, 38, 50], and is commonly categorized into three types: category, attribute and relation hallucinations [3, 49]. Some efforts based on instruction tuning have been made to mitigate this issue in MLLMs. LRV-Instruction [26] introduces a dataset with positive instructions and unique negative prompts with different semantic levels to better align responses with image content. HACL [15] explores the vision-language embedding space, using contrastive learning to separate non-hallucinated from hallucinated texts. Without instruction tuning, Woodpecker [50] offers a training-free pipeline for hallucination correction, using expert models to enrich image context and ensuring each phase is interpretable by a step-by-step correction process. In another line of work, some efforts have sought new decoding strategies to avoid relying on extensive additional data and training: Opera [14] tackles the partial over-trust issue in decoding by applying a penalty to the model logits during beam-search decoding. VCD [19] links object hallucinations to biases and language priors, contrasting outputs from distorted and original visuals to ensure consistent generation.
