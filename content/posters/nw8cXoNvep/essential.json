Current methods often use Euler angles or quaternions to represent 3D rotations, but these representations can have discontinuities and singularities, hindering performance.  SO(3)-equivariant networks offer a structured way to capture pose patterns, but their use with spherical CNNs (which operate in the frequency domain for efficiency) has been limited by incompatible spatial domain parameterizations.\nThis paper introduces a frequency-domain approach that directly predicts Wigner-D coefficients for 3D rotation regression. This aligns with the operations of spherical CNNs, avoiding issues of spatial representations.  Using a frequency-domain regression loss, the SO(3)-equivariant pose harmonics predictor achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet10-SO(3) and PASCAL3D+, showing significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency.  The method bypasses limitations of spatial parameterizations, ensuring consistent pose estimation under arbitrary rotations.", "affiliation": "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "nw8cXoNvep/podcast.wav"}
