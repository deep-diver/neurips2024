Existing methods consider predicting 3D rotations in the spatial domain.

The spatial-domain methods include predicting the rotation parameters directly (e.g., Euler angles, quaternions, or 6D representations), or predicting a parametric distribution of rotations (e.g., Gaussian, von Mises-Fisher, or Bingham distributions). The frequency-domain method, shown as the preferred method in this paper, involves predicting the Wigner-D harmonics, which are coefficients representing the rotation in the frequency domain.  The figure highlights the advantage of the Wigner-D harmonic approach for continuous representation of rotations, avoiding the discontinuities and singularities present in spatial-domain methods.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "nw8cXoNvep/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overall architecture.
