### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally expensive to train, mainly due to the computationally intensive feedforward networks (FFNs).  This paper addresses this by exploring efficient low-rank and block-diagonal matrix parameterizations for FFNs, aiming to reduce parameters and FLOPs.  Previous works often explored these approximations with pre-trained models and focused on specific tasks. This research investigates training LLMs with structured FFNs from scratch, scaling up to 1.3B parameters.  

The study introduces a novel training technique called "self-guided training" to overcome the poor training dynamics associated with structured matrices, and compares the performance of these structured models to traditional dense models trained at an optimal scaling trade-off.  Results indicate that structured networks can lead to significant computational gains and maintain comparable or superior performance, especially regarding training FLOPs utilization and throughput. These improvements hold across different model sizes and even in the overtraining regime. The proposed method showcases the benefits of these parameterizations, especially when combined with the self-guided training approach.

### In-depth insights


#### Structured FFNs
This research explores the use of structured matrices to create more efficient feedforward networks (FFNs) within large language models (LLMs).  **Three main types of structured matrices are investigated: LowRank, BlockShuffle, and BlockDense.**  Each offers a unique approach to reducing the computational cost and parameter count of FFNs, which typically constitute a significant portion of LLM training and inference costs. The study contrasts these structured FFNs against traditional dense FFNs, highlighting the trade-offs between efficiency and performance.  **A novel training regime, 'self-guided training', is introduced to address the challenges of training structured FFNs from scratch**, overcoming issues such as loss spikes and slow convergence often observed in these models. The results demonstrate that these structured FFNs can achieve computational gains while maintaining competitive performance, especially when scaled to larger models.  **The findings suggest that wide and structured networks, combining improvements in both attention and FFN modules, offer the most favorable performance versus parameter/FLOP trade-offs.** This work provides valuable insights for building more efficient and cost-effective LLMs.

#### Self-Guided Training
The proposed 'Self-Guided Training' method ingeniously addresses the optimization challenges inherent in training neural networks with structured matrices.  **It leverages a dense matrix as a temporary guide during the initial training phase**, gradually transitioning to the structured representation. This approach mitigates the issues of poor training dynamics, such as loss spikes and slow convergence, often observed when using structured matrices from initialization. By acting as a stabilizing residual component, the dense matrix steers the training away from suboptimal starting points and facilitates the learning of feature specialization within the structured parameters. The method's flexibility and speed are highlighted; it can be easily integrated into various stages of training and incorporates a stochastic variation to reduce computational overhead.  Ultimately, self-guided training demonstrably improves both training dynamics and final model performance with structured matrices, making them more viable for practical large-scale language model applications.

#### Efficiency Gains
The research paper explores efficiency gains in training large language models (LLMs) by employing structured feedforward networks (FFNs).  **Structured FFNs, utilizing low-rank and block-diagonal matrices, reduce computational costs without significantly compromising performance.** The study demonstrates that these structures lead to steeper scaling curves when considering training FLOPs. This implies that wide and structured networks achieve better performance with fewer parameters than dense models at their optimal trade-off. Furthermore, the paper introduces a novel training regime called **self-guided training** to address the optimization challenges associated with structured matrices, resulting in improved training dynamics and ultimately better model performance.  **Pre-merge techniques are also employed to maintain efficiency during online decoding** where computational resources might be limited. The findings highlight the potential of structured matrices for creating computationally efficient and high-performing LLMs, particularly when combined with techniques like self-guided training.

#### Scaling Behavior
The scaling behavior analysis in this research is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of structured feedforward networks (FFNs) in large language models (LLMs).  The authors meticulously examine scaling performance from two perspectives: **training compute scaling** and **model size scaling**.  The training compute scaling analysis reveals that structured FFNs exhibit steeper loss curves than traditional transformers, implying greater efficiency in FLOP utilization. This is particularly important at larger model sizes and training FLOP budgets.  The model size scaling analysis, conducted in the overtraining regime, further confirms the superiority of structured models, demonstrating **favorable scaling trends** in terms of both perplexity and downstream task performance. These results strongly suggest that the efficiency gains offered by structured FFNs are not merely artifacts of a specific training regime, but rather reflect a fundamental advantage in how these models leverage computational resources as they grow in scale.  Ultimately, these findings have important implications for the design and deployment of computationally efficient LLMs, offering a viable path to achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the exploration of structured matrices to other LLM components beyond FFNs**, such as attention mechanisms, could yield further efficiency gains.  **Investigating alternative structured matrix types** not considered in this study, or novel combinations of existing types, might unlock superior performance.  **A deeper dive into the optimization challenges** associated with structured matrices is warranted, potentially leading to the development of more effective training techniques than self-guided training.  **Scaling experiments to even larger LLMs**, potentially exceeding 100B parameters, would solidify the findings and assess the practical limitations of these methods at extreme scale.  Finally, **applying these techniques to diverse downstream tasks** beyond language modeling could reveal further insights into their generalizability and effectiveness in different application domains.
