(Right) CDF for the same distribution (green, solid line), along with a (non-private) minimax optimal learnt distribution (blue, dashed line), as well as 1-DP instance-optimal algorithm (red, dotted), both learnt from the same 1600 samples. The W\u2081 error for the minimax optimal algorithm is 13.4, whereas the DP estimated distribution has W\u2081 error of 0.86. While this example is artificial, it demonstrates the large potential gap between minimax optimal and instance optimal algorithms on specific instances.", "description": "The figure shows a comparison of the performance of minimax optimal and instance-optimal algorithms on a sparsely supported distribution. The left panel shows the probability density function (pdf) of the distribution, while the right panel shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) along with the CDFs learned by a minimax optimal algorithm and a differentially private instance-optimal algorithm. The instance-optimal algorithm outperforms the minimax optimal algorithm in terms of the Wasserstein distance (W1 error).", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
