However, most existing algorithms focus on worst-case analysis, which can be overly pessimistic in practice.  Existing algorithms don't adapt to easy instances, resulting in suboptimal performance and higher error rates.\nThis paper addresses this limitation by designing and analyzing instance-optimal differentially private algorithms for density estimation in the Wasserstein distance.  The algorithms adapt to easy instances, uniformly achieving instance-optimal estimation rates, and perform competitively with algorithms that have additional prior information about the data distribution. The work demonstrates uniformly achievable instance-optimal estimation rates in 1-dimension and 2-dimensions and extends to arbitrary metric spaces by leveraging hierarchically separated trees. This offers a major advancement towards efficient and accurate differentially private learning.", "affiliation": "Apple", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "Apq6corvfZ/podcast.wav"}
