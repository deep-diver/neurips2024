{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in **federated learning** and **dimensionality reduction**. It tackles the challenge of visualizing high-dimensional data distributed across multiple clients without compromising privacy, a critical need in many applications.  The proposed method, FEDNE, offers a novel approach to address this challenge, opening doors for further research in **privacy-preserving data visualization** techniques and their application to various real-world problems. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through extensive experiments, making it a valuable resource for those working in related fields.", "summary": "FEDNE: a novel approach enabling collaborative dimensionality reduction of distributed data in federated learning without data sharing, achieved via surrogate loss functions and data augmentation.", "takeaways": ["FEDNE effectively visualizes high-dimensional data across distributed clients in a privacy-preserving manner.", "The surrogate loss function cleverly addresses the lack of inter-client repulsion in traditional neighbor embedding methods.", "Data-mixing strategy improves the local data representation, reducing biases and errors in constructing neighborhood relationships within each client's data."], "tldr": "Federated learning (FL) is rapidly advancing, but visualizing high-dimensional data collaboratively across distributed devices without direct data sharing remains a significant challenge.  Existing neighbor embedding (NE) techniques, which are highly effective at visualizing data, are difficult to adapt to the FL setting due to the need to compute loss functions across all data pairs. This necessitates sharing data or using reference datasets, both of which violate the privacy-preserving essence of FL.\nThis paper introduces FEDNE, a novel solution that leverages the FEDAVG framework.  **FEDNE cleverly integrates contrastive NE with a surrogate loss function**, mitigating the lack of inter-client repulsion. A **data-mixing strategy augments local data**, enhancing local neighborhood graph accuracy.  Experiments show FEDNE's effectiveness in preserving neighborhood structures and enhancing alignment across clients, outperforming baseline methods on various datasets. This is highly significant for data visualization in privacy-sensitive FL scenarios.", "affiliation": "Ohio State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "zBMKodNgKX/podcast.wav"}
