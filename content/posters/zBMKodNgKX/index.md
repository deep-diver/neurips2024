### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated learning (FL) is rapidly advancing, but visualizing high-dimensional data collaboratively across distributed devices without direct data sharing remains a significant challenge.  Existing neighbor embedding (NE) techniques, which are highly effective at visualizing data, are difficult to adapt to the FL setting due to the need to compute loss functions across all data pairs. This necessitates sharing data or using reference datasets, both of which violate the privacy-preserving essence of FL.

This paper introduces FEDNE, a novel solution that leverages the FEDAVG framework.  **FEDNE cleverly integrates contrastive NE with a surrogate loss function**, mitigating the lack of inter-client repulsion. A **data-mixing strategy augments local data**, enhancing local neighborhood graph accuracy.  Experiments show FEDNE's effectiveness in preserving neighborhood structures and enhancing alignment across clients, outperforming baseline methods on various datasets. This is highly significant for data visualization in privacy-sensitive FL scenarios.

> This figure illustrates a single round of the FEDNE algorithm.  It shows the interaction between the server and multiple clients involved in federated neighbor embedding.  The steps highlight the flow of information:  the server distributes the neural network model, each client updates its local surrogate model and then trains its local model using augmented data incorporating surrogate models from other clients, then uploads its updated local model to the server, finally, the server aggregates the models.

> This table presents the characteristics of the four benchmark datasets used in the paper's experiments (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, scRNA-Seq, and CIFAR-10).  For each dataset, it lists the number of classes, the number of training and testing samples, the number of clients (M) used in the federated learning simulations (with two different settings of the number of clients), and the dimensionality of the data points.  This information is crucial for understanding the experimental setup and the scale of the federated learning tasks.





### In-depth insights


#### Federated Neighbor Embedding
Federated learning (FL) presents a unique challenge for dimensionality reduction techniques like neighbor embedding (NE), as NE requires computing pairwise distances across all data points.  A **federated neighbor embedding (FNE)** approach aims to address this by enabling collaborative model training across distributed participants without directly sharing data.  This typically involves training a shared NE model, but the challenge lies in handling the lack of inter-client information. To overcome this, techniques such as **surrogate loss functions** and **data-mixing strategies** are often implemented. Surrogate models approximate inter-client repulsive forces, while data mixing aims to mitigate the biases caused by local data only being available.  The effectiveness of any FNE method hinges on its ability to **preserve neighborhood structures** while **enforcing global alignment** in the low-dimensional embedding space, striking a balance between local data fidelity and global consistency.  Privacy remains a critical consideration, as strategies to minimize direct data sharing are essential.

#### Surrogate Loss Function
The concept of a 'Surrogate Loss Function' in federated learning addresses a crucial challenge: the inability to directly compute pairwise distances between data points residing on different clients.  **This function approximates the inter-client repulsion loss**, a key component in neighbor embedding algorithms for dimensionality reduction that's usually calculated using global data.  By training a surrogate model at each client to represent its local repulsive forces and sharing these models, **FEDNE sidesteps the need for sharing raw data while preserving the neighborhood structure in the global embedding space.**  This approach cleverly compensates for the lack of direct inter-client interaction, improving embedding alignment and making federated dimensionality reduction more effective. The design of the surrogate model, including its training method (supervised learning on generated query points), directly impacts the accuracy and efficiency of the overall FEDNE algorithm.  **Successfully approximating the repulsive force is critical for the separation of dissimilar data points across clients**, a key feature lacking in naive federated neighbor embedding implementations.

#### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a crucial technique in machine learning, especially when dealing with limited datasets.  The paper cleverly addresses the challenges of data scarcity in federated learning by introducing an 'intra-client data mixing' strategy. This approach tackles the problem of **biased local kNN graphs**, which often lead to inaccurate neighbor representations due to data partitioning among clients. By interpolating between data points and their neighbors within each client, the method effectively increases the diversity of local data.  This is particularly important in non-IID settings where data distribution across clients is uneven.  The augmentation enhances the robustness of local kNN graphs by **simulating the presence of potential neighbors residing on other clients**, thus improving the overall accuracy of the model.  The method's simplicity and ease of implementation are further strengths, making it a valuable tool for improving federated neighbor embedding and related techniques.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contribution. In the context of a federated neighbor embedding (FNE) model, this would involve removing elements like the surrogate loss function or the data augmentation strategy.  By observing the impact on performance metrics such as trustworthiness, continuity, and k-NN accuracy, researchers can **quantify the impact** of each component. **A well-designed ablation study should reveal which components are essential for achieving good performance** and highlight potential areas for improvement or simplification of the FNE architecture. The study also provides crucial insights into the interplay between different components and justifies the design choices made by highlighting the **unique contributions of each component**.  The results of the ablation study can guide future work in optimizing the FNE model or developing alternative FNE techniques. The results in this section strengthen the claims by demonstrating the impact of the introduced methods in the FNE setting.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore several avenues. **Extending the framework to handle non-IID data distributions more robustly** is crucial.  Currently, the effectiveness relies on the surrogate models' capacity to approximate inter-client repulsion; however, this approximation might be challenged under extremely non-IID scenarios.  Further investigation into more sophisticated data augmentation strategies, possibly incorporating techniques like GANs to generate synthetic data that bridges the gap between client data distributions, should be considered. Another promising area is **improving the efficiency of the surrogate model training and communication**. The current approach adds computational overhead; exploring model compression or more efficient aggregation techniques would significantly enhance the scalability and practicality of FEDNE.  Finally, a **rigorous privacy analysis** of the FEDNE framework is needed to quantify the privacy risks associated with sharing the surrogate models.  This will establish the balance between the benefits of improved embedding quality and the potential privacy vulnerabilities. This thorough analysis could potentially lead to the development of privacy-preserving modifications, strengthening the framework's resilience and acceptability in privacy-sensitive applications.

> This figure illustrates one round of the FEDNE algorithm.  It shows how the FEDAVG framework is extended with a surrogate model training step.  Each client trains a local surrogate model to approximate repulsion loss, which is then shared with other clients. This shared information helps to compensate for the lack of direct data sharing between clients during local training. FEDAVG steps 1 to 6 represent the distribution and aggregation of the central model parameters.
