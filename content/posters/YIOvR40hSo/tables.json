The comparison is based on three metrics: Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and CLIP Score (CS).  Lower FID indicates better image quality, higher IS suggests both better quality and diversity, and higher CS shows better consistency between generated images and input text descriptions.  Inference time is also compared to show the efficiency of each method.", "section": "5.1 Single-View Panorama Generation"}, {"figure_path": "YIOvR40hSo/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: User Study of Text to Multi-view Panoramas", "description": "This table presents the results of a user study comparing three different methods for generating multi-view panoramas from text descriptions: MVDream, PanFusion, and DiffPano (the authors' method).  Users rated each method on three aspects: image quality, image-text consistency (how well the generated images matched the text), and multi-view consistency (how consistent the multiple views of the same scene were).  Higher scores indicate better performance.  The results show that DiffPano outperforms the other two methods across all three criteria.", "section": "5 Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "YIOvR40hSo/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation Study on the Number of Sampling Points and Reference Frames", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study conducted to investigate the impact of varying the number of sampling points (S) and reference frames (K) on the performance of the multi-view panorama generation model.
