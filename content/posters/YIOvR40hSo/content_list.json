However, they generally only generate a series of perspective images, making it impossible to comprehensively simulate the entire environment for scene understanding [27, 19, 67] and reconstruction [3, 5, 66, 64, 30, 35, 34, 26, 21, 65, 7, 12, 47, 49, 58, 69].

Single scene optimization methods [53] with inpainting have no generalization ability and cost too much time for optimization. 4) Directly extending the multiple perspective views generation methods [43] to the ERP panorama, which is difficult to converge and results in poor multi-view consistency (see Fig. 5).

However, achieving this goal is not trivial. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently a lack of rich and diverse panoramic datasets to meet the task of text-to-multi-view ERP panorama generation. To this end, we propose a novel panoramic video-text dataset and a generation framework suitable for the text-to-multi-view panorama generation task, advancing the development of this field. Specifically, we first establish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset using Habitat Simulator [41] (see Sec. 3), which contains millions of panoramic keyframes and corresponding panoramic depths, camera poses, and text descriptions. Next, built upon the proposed dataset, we propose a generation framework for consistent multi-view ERP panorama generation (see Sec. 4), termed DiffPano. The DiffPano framework consists of a single-view text-to-panorama diffusion model (see Sec. 4.1) and a spherical epipolar-aware multiview diffusion model (see Sec. 4.2). The single-view text-to-panorama diffusion model is obtained by fine-tuning the stable diffusion model [38] of perspective images using LoRA [18]. Considering that the single-view pano-based diffusion model cannot guarantee the consistency of generated multiview panoramas with different camera poses, we derive a spherical epipolar constraint applicable to panoramic images, inspired by the perspective epipolar constraint.

Among them, MVDiffusion [48] simultaneously generates eight fixed-viewpoint perspective images through a multi-view Correspondence-Aware diffusion model and stitches them together to produce a panorama. However, it cannot support the generation of top and bottom views, and the generated panorama resembles wide-angle images with an extensive field of view rather than true $360^{\\circ}$ images. Some methods [55, 13] solve this problem using equirectangular projection (ERP) and try to facilitate the interaction between the left and right sides during the panorama generation process to enhance the left-right continuity property inherent in ERP images. To address the domain gap between panorama and perspective images, PanFusion [72] proposed a novel dual-branch diffusion model that mitigates the distortion of perspective images projected on panoramas while providing global layout guidance. However, its more complex model architecture incurs longer inference times for panorama generation. In addition, PanFusion cannot be expanded as an effective pre-trained model to the multi-view panorama generation task due to its excessive network parameters.

The FID, IS, and CS values of Text2Light are from the PanFusion [72]. We trained our proposed Pano-SD using the same dataset as PanFusion [72] and re-evaluated the performance of PanFusion. From the results, it can be observed that our method slightly outperforms others in terms of CS value and achieves a significantly lower FID value compared to Text2Light, which is close to PanFusion [72]. Moreover, due to the simplicity and efficiency of our model architecture, our method has a substantial advantage in inference time, which can significantly improve the efficiency of subsequent multi-view generation tasks.

We compare our method with the two models trained on their respective datasets. The panoramas generated by Text2Light exhibit poor left-right consistency. On the other hand, the panoramas generated by PanFusion suffer from blurriness at the bottom and top regions, which affects the overall integrity of the panoramas. In contrast, our model is capable of generating panoramas with clear bottom and top regions and better left-right continuity. However, due to the quality of the dataset, the image quality may be slightly inferior.
