Existing methods often pre-determine the number of tokens, neglecting the potential benefits of dynamic adaptation. This inflexibility hinders deployment on resource-constrained devices and limits the model's adaptability to various tasks.\n\nThis paper introduces the Matryoshka Query Transformer (MQT), a novel technique that allows LVLMs to use a flexible number of visual tokens during inference. MQT achieves this by employing a query transformer with latent tokens, randomly selecting a subset for training. Experiments using MQT-LLaVA show significant improvements in efficiency and a considerable reduction in the number of visual tokens needed, without significant performance loss, across various vision-language benchmarks. **The ability to dynamically adjust the number of visual tokens makes MQT-LLaVA extremely versatile and efficient.**", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "B1vGiSgELw/podcast.wav"}
