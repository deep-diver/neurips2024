### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Transformer models are increasingly used in applications demanding low latency, but autoregressive inference is resource-intensive. Existing parallelism techniques introduce expensive collective communication, leading to underutilized hardware and high latency. This necessitates developing new architectures optimized for multi-device inference.



This paper introduces Kraken, a Transformer architecture modification that complements existing parallelism schemes. Kraken introduces model parallelism to allow collective operations to overlap with computations, decreasing latency and increasing hardware utilization.  Evaluations show Kraken achieves similar perplexity to standard Transformers while significantly reducing Time To First Token (TTFT) across various model sizes and multi-GPU setups using TensorRT-LLM.  **Kraken demonstrates a mean 35.6% speedup in TTFT**, highlighting its potential for enhancing interactive applications using large language models.

### In-depth insights


#### Kraken's Parallelism
Kraken introduces a novel form of model parallelism, deviating from standard tensor parallelism.  Instead of partitioning layers, **Kraken partitions each Transformer layer into smaller, independent sub-layers**, executing them in parallel on multiple devices. This approach allows overlapping communication (AllReduce operations) with computation, a crucial optimization to reduce inference latency. **The fixed degree of intra-layer parallelism** in Kraken is a key design choice, simplifying implementation and aligning with common multi-GPU system topologies. While it may limit adaptability to diverse hardware configurations, it provides a significant advantage in latency reduction by cleverly hiding collective communication costs.  **The effectiveness is demonstrated across varying model sizes and context lengths**, showcasing a mean speedup of 35.6% in Time To First Token (TTFT) compared to standard Transformers using TensorRT-LLM. This inherent parallelism is a substantial contribution towards efficient multi-device inference in large language models.

#### Multi-Device Speedup
The research paper's findings on multi-device speedup are significant, demonstrating a **substantial improvement in inference latency** for large transformer models.  The authors achieve this speedup by introducing Kraken, a modified transformer architecture that complements existing tensor parallelism schemes.  **Kraken's key innovation is a fixed degree of intra-layer model parallelism**, which allows collective operations to overlap with computation, thereby reducing idle time and increasing hardware utilization. This approach leads to a **mean speedup of 35.6% in Time To First Token (TTFT)** across various model sizes, context lengths, and degrees of tensor parallelism, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world multi-GPU systems. The improvement is not solely due to reduced collective communication; it also stems from better hardware utilization. The results highlight Kraken as a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency of multi-device inference for large language models.  **Further research into optimizing Kraken for various hardware configurations and exploring its compatibility with other state-of-the-art transformer optimizations** is warranted to unlock its full potential.

#### Model Architecture
The core of the proposed Kraken model lies in its novel layer construction.  Instead of the standard Transformer's monolithic layers, Kraken introduces **intra-layer model parallelism**, dividing each layer into smaller, independent sub-layers. This design is crucial for mitigating the latency penalties of collective communication operations inherent in tensor parallelism schemes. By employing a fixed degree of parallelism, Kraken allows collective operations (such as AllReduce) to be cleverly overlapped with the computations of subsequent layers. This approach, therefore, significantly improves hardware utilization and reduces overall inference latency, making Kraken particularly efficient in multi-device settings.  The architecture is specifically designed to complement existing tensor parallelism methods, effectively hiding the runtime impact of collective operations which are typically a major performance bottleneck.  **Preserving the overall functionality of standard Transformers**, the design cleverly integrates the outputs from these sub-layers to maintain the model's quality and language modeling capabilities, demonstrated by achieving comparable perplexity scores and SuperGLUE benchmarks.

#### SuperGLUE Benchmarks
The SuperGLUE benchmark results section likely evaluates the Kraken model's performance on a diverse range of natural language understanding tasks.  **High SuperGLUE scores would validate Kraken's strong language modeling capabilities**, demonstrating its ability to generalize well beyond the training data.  A comparison to standard Transformer models on this benchmark is crucial; **similar or superior performance would highlight Kraken's efficacy without sacrificing model quality.**  The results likely detail performance across various tasks, enabling a nuanced understanding of Kraken's strengths and weaknesses.  **Analysis of task-specific performance may reveal areas where Kraken excels and areas needing improvement.** This detailed breakdown will be key to assessing Kraken's potential and its advantages over existing Transformer architectures for practical applications.

#### Future Work
The authors outline several promising avenues for future research.  **Improving Kraken's training efficiency** is paramount, as current methods are resource-intensive.  Exploring techniques like knowledge distillation from pre-trained models to initialize Kraken weights could significantly reduce training costs.  Furthermore, the fixed degree of model parallelism necessitates investigation into **adaptive or dynamic parallelism strategies** to optimize performance across diverse hardware configurations.  **Investigating compatibility with existing Transformer optimizations** (like FlashAttention and sparse attention mechanisms) is crucial for maximizing efficiency.  Finally, exploring the application of Kraken's inherent parallelism to other large language model architectures (like Mixture-of-Experts models) and other deep learning models beyond Transformers warrants attention, potentially yielding substantial performance improvements.  **Combining Kraken with existing state-of-the-art training techniques** is also an important area for future work.

The results demonstrate that even when model weights and the key-value cache fit within the memory of a single GPU, increasing the degree of parallelism (using multiple GPUs) leads to a reduction in TTFT.
