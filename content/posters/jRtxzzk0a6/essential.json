Existing parallelism techniques introduce expensive collective communication, leading to underutilized hardware and high latency. This necessitates developing new architectures optimized for multi-device inference.\n\nThis paper introduces Kraken, a Transformer architecture modification that complements existing parallelism schemes. Kraken introduces model parallelism to allow collective operations to overlap with computations, decreasing latency and increasing hardware utilization.  Evaluations show Kraken achieves similar perplexity to standard Transformers while significantly reducing Time To First Token (TTFT) across various model sizes and multi-GPU setups using TensorRT-LLM.  **Kraken demonstrates a mean 35.6% speedup in TTFT**, highlighting its potential for enhancing interactive applications using large language models.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "jRtxzzk0a6/podcast.wav"}
