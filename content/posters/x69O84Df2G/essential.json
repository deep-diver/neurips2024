Existing RL methods typically focus on a single reward, making them unsuitable for such multi-reward scenarios.  Furthermore, designing reward functions can be complex and iterative, highlighting the need for efficient methods to explore policies across different rewards. This necessitates exploring optimal policies for multiple reward functions simultaneously. \nThis paper addresses this challenge by introducing the Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification (MR-BPI) problem and presenting two novel algorithms: MR-NaS for tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and DBMR-BPI for deep RL (DRL). **MR-NaS leverages a convex approximation of a theoretical lower bound on sample complexity to design an optimal exploration policy.**  DBMR-BPI extends this approach to model-free exploration in DRL.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that these algorithms outperform existing methods in various challenging environments and generalize well to unseen reward functions.", "affiliation": "Ericsson AB", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "x69O84Df2G/podcast.wav"}
