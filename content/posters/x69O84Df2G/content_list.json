Exploration algorithms for BPI typically aim to find the optimal policy for a single reward function, which is known and fixed in advance.

Closely related settings are reward-free RL [21, 22, 23], unsupervised RL [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], and multi-objective RL [30, 31]. In reward-free RL, the goal of the agent is to estimate the optimal policy for any possible reward, using methods such as maximum entropy exploration [32, 33]. This reward-free phase is then followed by a downstream task adaptation in unsupervised RL. Lastly, in multi-objective RL, the agent optimizes over multiple (potentially confilcting) rewards, with the goal of identifying a Pareto frontier of optimal policies. While reward-free RL is the closest to our setting, exploration for any possible reward is unlikely to occur in practical problems. On the other hand, unsupervised RL and multi-objective RL do not directly address the multi-reward pure exploration problem \u2014 a setting we deem to be of practical use in a wide range of applications. For instance, in intent-based radio network optimization, rewards are designed to reflect network operator intents, such as maximizing throughput or coverage in a given network area.

This bound provides insights into the fundamental difficulty of the problem and guides the design of an optimal exploration policy. As in previous works [16, 17, 19, 34], determining such an exploration policy requires to solve a non-convex optimization problem. To address this issue, we propose a convex formulation of the lower bound based on a finite set of rewards.

A relevant body of literature considers Reward-Free Exploration (RFE) [21, 22, 68, 69, 23, 70], where the agent learns behaviours without a specific reward. For example, Jin et al. [21] study reward-free RL in the tabular episodic case to identify $\\varepsilon$ -optimal policies for any possible reward. They provide a lower bound on the length of exploration phase scaling as $\\Omega(H^{2}S^{2}A/\\varepsilon^{2})$ and devise an algorithm nearly matching it of order ${\\tilde{O}}(H^{5}S^{2}A/\\varepsilon^{2})$ . This bound was improved in [22] and [68], where the authors propose the RF-UCRL and RF-Express algorithms for episodic reward-free RL. On a similar line, the authors of [23] focus on an RFE setting where the minimal sub-optimality gap is a known quantity, and provide an algorithm with reduced sample complexity. Another relevant RFE framework is maximum entropy exploration [32, 33, 24, 71], which studies the problem of state entropy maximization. This type of exploration is particularly useful for offline RL [72] since it is well know that the coverage of the state space characterizes the sample complexity of the problem [73, 74].

In this work, we investigated the MR-BPI problem, focusing on efficiently determining the best policies for a diverse set of rewards $\\mathcal{R}$ with a specified confidence level. We established a fundamental sample complexity result for MR-BPI and proposed two efficient methods for multi-reward exploration: MR-NaS for tabular MDPs and DBMR-BPI for DRL. Numerical results on challenging exploration environments suggests that both algorithms exhibit strong exploration capabilities and generalization properties. We believe that our study benefits various areas of RL by enabling more principled exploration in multi-reward scenarios. This includes applications in multi-objective RL, which naturally lends itself to optimization over multiple objectives, and offilne RL, where it is crucial to collect a dataset that performs well across different rewards.

The current theoretical analysis only applies to tabular MDPs, and may not necessarily extend to continuous domains in a similar way.   \n\u2022 Tracking of the allocation. In MR-NaS we employ a probabilistic policy, which may lead to worse tracking performance compared to deterministic approaches (see e.g., the classical tracking procedures for best arm identification in multi-armed bandits [20]). These approaches are, however, harder to use in an MDP setting, since it becomes harder to guarantee correct tracking and convergence of the allocation $\\omega_{t}^{\\star}$ to $\\omega^{\\star}$ .   \n\u2022 Lazy updates. MR-NaS computes an allocation $\\omega_{t}^{\\star}=\\arg\\operatorname*{inf}_{\\omega\\in\\Omega(M_{t})}U(\\omega_{t};M_{t})$ at each time step, which could be computationally prohibitive for large-dimensional problems. A possible way to address this issue is to use \"lazyness\" [78], i.e., to compute $\\omega_{t}^{\\star}$ only at time steps $t\\in\\mathcal T$ , where $\\tau\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ prescribes the allocation update schedule (see [78]).   \n\u2022 Scaling of the rewards for DBMR-BPI. The method that we introduce for exploration in deep-RL, DBMR-BPI, explores according to a set of rewards. These rewards, if not correctly scaled, may impact the learning performance since the method relies on estimating the sub-optimality gaps.   \n\u2022 Number of rewards for DBMR-BPI. The usage of DBMR-BPI could be limited by the number of rewards if it is too high, as the output size of the $Q$ -network in DBMF-BPI is $A\\cdot|{\\mathcal{R}}|$ . However, our experiments with an ensemble size of 20 and $A\\cdot|\\mathcal{R}|\\approx90$ did not encounter any issues. Furthermore, the training can be efficiently done as shown in the code, without looping over the rewards. Nevertheless, exploring the scalability to a larger number of rewards remains an interesting area for future research.   \n\u2022 Finite action space for DBMR-BPI. In this paper, we analyze DBMR-BPI within a finite action space. Although continuous action spaces are equally important, extending the algorithm to such spaces requires additional work. It is currently unclear how to adapt the approach presented in [53] to continuous action spaces.   \n\u2022 Assumption on the uniqueness of the optimal policy. In the paper we assume that there is a unique optimal policy. This assumption is common in the BPI literature [18, 16, 17, 53, 20]. Addressing MDPs with multiple optimal policies or identifying $\\varepsilon$ -optimal policies necessitates the use of more complex overlapping hypothesis tests [79]. This approach is already complex when applied to multi-armed bandits (i.e., MDPs with a single state), and extending it to full MDPs presents an even greater challenge. In that sense, we can provide some insights on the main problems and potential solutions: \u2013 In presence of multiple optimal policies, one may be interested in ensuring that at the stopping time we have $\\Pi^{\\star}(M_{\\tau,r})\\subseteq\\Pi^{\\star}(M_{r})$ for all rewards $r\\in\\mathcal{R}$ . This guarantees that we identify a subset of policies that are optimal. Unfortunately, ensuring this condition causes an asymmetry between the definition of the set of confusing models, and the event $M\\;\\in\\;\\operatorname{\\dot{Alt}}(M_{t})$ in proof of the stopping rule, that cannot be easily reconciled. \u2013 A positive result is that if the set of confusing models can be decomposed as a union, or intersection, over the optimal policies in $M$ , then the decomposition proofs presented in apps. B.2 and B.4.3, can be easily extended to the case of multiple optimal policies by considering the sub-optimal actions $a\\notin O_{r}(s)$ in the decomposition, where $O_{r}(s)=$ $\\{a:Q_{M_{r}}^{\\star}(\\bar{s},a)=V_{M_{r}}^{\\star}(s)\\}$ .

Therefore, while the immediate societal impact of our work may not be evident, we urge future researchers and practitioners to carefully consider the ethical implications and potential negative impacts in their specific applications.
