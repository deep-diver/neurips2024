Existing methods often use Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but NeRF methods are computationally expensive and 3DGS struggles with sparse data, sometimes needing additional supervision like depth information from pre-trained models which can be noisy and inaccurate.  This creates a need for more robust and efficient novel view synthesis techniques, especially when dealing with limited input views. \nThis paper introduces a novel method that leverages the inherent self-supervision in binocular vision to improve 3DGS, avoiding reliance on external data.  The method uses binocular stereo consistency to constrain the depth estimations, improving scene geometry.  An additional opacity decay strategy effectively reduces redundant Gaussians, enhancing efficiency and quality. The use of dense point cloud initialization further improves the initial geometry estimation. Experiments on various datasets show significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "oTEttMIymz/podcast.wav"}
