The problem is to divide the resource among multiple participants so that everyone believes the allocation is fair. There is an extensive literature on cake cutting in mathematics, political science, economics (Robertson and Webb (1998); Brams and Taylor (1996); Moulin (2003)) and computer science (Brandt et al.

These settings reflect the reality of many social and economic interactions, necessitating a model that not only addresses the fairness of a single division, but also the dynamics and strategies that emerge among participants over repeated interactions.

One direction is to consider a wider class of regret benchmarks and understand how the choice of benchmark influences the outcomes reached. Moreover, what payoff profiles are attained when the players use randomized algorithms such as exponential weights to update their strategies? It would also make sense to consider settings where the cake has both good and bad parts. Finally, studying richer feedback models, e.g., when Alice and Bob takes turns cutting and choosing, or allowing Alice to divide the cake into any multiple measurable sets would be intriguing directions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
