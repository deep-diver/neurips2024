In intracranial hemorrhage detection from Computerized Tomographic (CT) scans, the full scan represents the bag, and the slices at different heights are the instances.

To account for this, TransMIL [32] proposed to model global dependencies using a transformer encoder. The idea is to use the self-attention mechanism to introduce interactions between each pair of instances. Based on it, other transformer-based approaches have emerged, also focusing on global dependencies [9, 22, 37].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
