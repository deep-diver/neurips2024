Opening angle curves of DiffPhyCon-lite show an obvious fast-close-slow-open shape, which is proven to produce high speed in jellyfish movement [28]. The reason is that the fast closing of wings leads to a thrust from fluid in the early state, resulting in a long-term high speed, and followed by a slow opening to reduce resistance. While this mode of movement appears rarely in the training dataset, DiffPhyCon-lite could generate such control sequences for most test samples. This reflects that diffusion models under guidance are effective in optimizing the control objective. Furthermore, DiffPhyCon makes this mode of movement more aggressive, with sharper change of the opening angle in the beginning and end stage within a period. This provides strong evidence that reweighting the prior distribution of control sequences allows for flexible sampling over a flattened distribution, thus control sequences with low prior but good objectives are more likely to be sampled. The movement and the resulting fluid field of the jellyfish corresponding to the middle subfigure of Figure 4 controlled by DiffPhyCon is illustrated in Figure 5 and more examples are provided in Figure 10 in Appendix C.2. Conversely, opening angles obtained by baselines are inferior. The reason may be that they predict opening angles sequentially and hard to globally optimize the objective with three confilcting terms: average speed, $R(\\mathbf{w})$ , and $d(\\mathbf{w}_{T},\\mathbf{w}_{0})$ .

While classical numerical techniques for simulating physical systems are renowned for their accuracy, they are often associated with significant computational expenses [41, 31]. Recently, neural network-based solvers show a significant advantage over classical solvers in accelerating simulations. They could be roughly divided into three primary classes: data-driven methods [34, 56, 48, 6, 67, 5, 30], Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [53, 8, 65], and solver-in-the-loop methods [61, 63]. Most of them use an iterative horizontal prediction framework. Instead, we treat the system trajectory as a whole variable and use diffusion models to learn an explicit simulator conditioned on control sequences. A notable work is by [7], which introduces diffusion models for temporal forecasting. While both our work and [7]\u2019s employ diffusion models, we tackle a different task of physical system control. Furthermore, we incorporate the control objective into the inference and introduce prior reweighting to tune the influence of the prior.

It is accurate but computationally expensive. Deep learning-based methods have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical systems\u2019 dynamics. Supervised learning (SL) [22, 24] trains parameterized models to directly optimize control using backpropagation through time over the entire trajectory. For example, [22] proposes a hierarchical predictor-corrector scheme to control complex nonlinear physical systems over long time frames. A more recent work proposed by [24] designs two stages which respectively learn the solution operator and search for optimal control. Different from these methods, we do not use the surrogate model, and learn both state trajectories and control sequences in an integrated way. Reinforcement learning (RL) [15, 46, 52] treats control signals as actions and learns policies to make sequential decisions. Particularly in the field of fluid dynamics [32], reinforcement learning has been applied to a multitude of specific problems including drag reduction [52, 14], conjugate heat transfer [4, 17] and swimming [45, 62]. But they implicitly consider physics information and sequentially make decisions. In contrast, we generalize the entire trajectories, which results in a global optimization with consideration of physical information learned by models.

In particular, recent progress in robot control shows that diffusion models have significant advantages over existing reinforcement learning methods for action planning [9, 69]. Generating diverse yet consistent samples poses a challenge. For diversity, methods [38, 3, 71, 13] that integrate score estimates from various models have been effective. For consistency, guidance diffusion techniques [11, 20] have been utilized to generate condition-specific samples. Our approach differs by flattening the joint distribution to achieve better control by slightly expanding beyond the prior distribution range.

Specifically, when solving the jellyfish movement problem using SAC, we incorporated a constraint to achieve periodic motion of the jellyfish in the reward function, namely, we added a hyperparameter as the weight of the term $d(w_{T},w_{0})$ in Eq. (19). The challenge caused by the periodicity condition is that the average speed and $R(\\mathbf{w})$ are calculated over the whole horizon while the periodicity condition is only evaluated at the final time step of the horizon. Thus, when the control objective consists of all three terms, it requires global optimization over the whole horizon to balance different terms. In Table 22, we present the original results (weigh $=1000$ , corresponding to Table 3) and the results after reducing the weighting of this term (weigh $=100$ ). It can be observed that while the speed of the jellyfish increases (though still not reaching the results of DiffPhyCon), the $R({\\bf w})$ and constraint term for periodicity sharply rise. From these results and the additional results in Table 20 and Table 21 where we test the performance of SAC under different weights $\\zeta$ of $R(\\mathbf{w})$ , we conclude that SAC struggles to provide satisfactory policies that simultaneously satisfy multiple conflicting constraints with different time coverage, resulting in a myopic failure model.
