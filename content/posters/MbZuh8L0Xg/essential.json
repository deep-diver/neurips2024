Existing methods often struggle with global optimization and generating controls that deviate from training data. \n\nDiffPhyCon addresses these issues by using diffusion models for energy optimization across entire trajectories and control sequences.  This approach facilitates global optimization and plans near-optimal sequences, even those deviating from training data, as shown by experiments on Burgers' equation, jellyfish movement, and smoke control. The method's superiority is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to existing approaches and the release of a new benchmark jellyfish dataset makes it a valuable contribution to the field.", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "MbZuh8L0Xg/podcast.wav"}
