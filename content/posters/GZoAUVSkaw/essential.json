Existing algorithms are often computationally expensive due to the need for second-order derivatives or memory-intensive storage of model parameters. This poses a significant challenge for their practical application.\nThis paper tackles this challenge by proposing two novel first-order algorithms: FOSL (fully single-loop) and MemCS (memory-efficient).  These algorithms avoid the computationally expensive second-order derivatives.  **FOSL updates all variables simultaneously**, while **MemCS uses cold-start initialization to save memory**. The paper provides rigorous convergence analyses for both algorithms and shows that their sample complexity matches or exceeds that of existing state-of-the-art algorithms.  They demonstrate superior performance across various datasets in deep AUC maximization and robust meta-learning experiments.", "affiliation": "University at Buffalo", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GZoAUVSkaw/podcast.wav"}
