The existing supervised learning approaches struggle to handle evolving models and diverse text patterns, highlighting a need for more adaptable and robust techniques.\nThis paper introduces DeTeCtive, a novel multi-task auxiliary multi-level contrastive learning framework designed to address these issues.  DeTeCtive focuses on distinguishing writing styles, incorporating a dense information retrieval pipeline for efficient detection.  The experiments showcase its superior performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in OOD scenarios, surpassing existing methods by a large margin.  Furthermore, DeTeCtive's Training-Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA) capability enables adaptation to OOD data without retraining, enhancing its efficacy. The open-sourcing of code and models promotes further research and development in the field.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "cdTTTJfJe3/podcast.wav"}
