The table also shows the specific expressions for bias (h<sub>B</sub>) and variance (h<sub>V</sub>) terms resulting from each of the four functions. These h<sub>B</sub> and h<sub>V</sub> expressions are key components in the bias-variance joint optimization strategy proposed in the paper, allowing the framework to adaptively select estimators that achieve a balance between bias and variance for each user-item pair.", "section": "3.2 Dynamic Estimator Designs With Quantitative Optimization"}, {"figure_path": "gLoe70Tn8V/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performances of the proposed method and baselines (mean \u00b1 standard deviation across 10 runs).", "description": "This table presents the performance comparison of the proposed dynamic learning framework against various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
