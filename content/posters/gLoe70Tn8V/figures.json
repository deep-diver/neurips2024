Finally, (d) presents the optimal objective values, showing how the optimal value of the objective function varies with the propensity (pu).  This demonstrates how the framework dynamically adapts to various propensities, optimizing both bias and variance.", "section": "3 Fine-Grained Dynamic Framework for Quantitative Bias-Variance Joint Optimization"}, {"figure_path": "gLoe70Tn8V/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The surfaces of determining factors and the objective function of dynamic estimators, and the optimal objective values: (a) hst; (b) hest; (c) w\u2081 (hest)2 + w2hest; Est; (d) Objectiveopt", "description": "This figure visualizes the behavior of several key functions and the objective function in the dynamic estimator framework.
