This poses significant challenges to predictive model accuracy as standard methods struggle to provide unbiased estimates with bounded variances.  Existing techniques, like regularization, often fail to adequately address this issue, leading to unstable and unreliable model performance.  The issue is further compounded as attempts to achieve unbiased estimation often result in unbounded variances.\nThis research introduces a novel framework that directly addresses this critical problem. The key innovation is a **fine-grained dynamic learning approach**, which adaptively selects the best estimator for each data point based on a defined objective function. This approach not only reduces bias and variance but also provides theoretical guarantees on the boundedness of variance and generalization error. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this dynamic framework through extensive experiments, showcasing significant improvements in predictive performance and robustness compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "MYbank, Ant Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gLoe70Tn8V/podcast.wav"}
