Traditional methods rely on manually designed feature extraction and similarity measurements, but it is difficult to adequately capture the complexity and diversity of data when dealing with large-scale high-dimensional data.

It has low retrieval accuracy in complex cross-modal scenarios due to a lack of semantic alignment. In contrast, supervised methods leverage labeled data to establish the associations between different modalities and therefore accurately capture the similarities between different modalities, thus improving the accuracy of retrieval. Despite the wide application of supervised methods in cross-modal retrieval, there are some challenges that still remain. Traditional feature extraction techniques tend to focus on local features, which can hinder the capture of global information in images, ultimately affecting semantic consistency across modalities.

Labels are processed as word embeddings, and the predicted labels are obtained from these classifiers, enhancing cross-modal feature representation. We delve into the hidden features and relationships within the graph structure, achieving effective encoding and representation of data, and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Future work could explore the extension of EGATH to other types of multimodal data, such as audio and text, and investigate its scalability with larger datasets. Notably, this method is limited by the high computational complexity of the graph attention network, which constrains the model\u2019s scalability under large-scale label sets.
