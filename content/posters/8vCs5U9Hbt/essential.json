However, task imbalance, where some tasks significantly underperform, hinders MTL's effectiveness.  Existing methods struggle to achieve both high performance and computational efficiency; gradient-oriented methods excel in performance but are computationally expensive, while loss-oriented methods prioritize efficiency over performance. \nGO4Align, a new loss-oriented MTL approach, tackles task imbalance by explicitly aligning optimization across tasks. This is achieved using an adaptive group risk minimization strategy, comprising (i) dynamical group assignment clustering similar tasks, and (ii) risk-guided group indicators using consistent task correlations.  Extensive experiments demonstrate GO4Align's superior performance and even lower computational costs compared to current state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Multi-Task Learning"}, "podcast_path": "8vCs5U9Hbt/podcast.wav"}
