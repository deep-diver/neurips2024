Notably, Mamba [21] excels in long-sequence modeling with its selective scan operator for information flitering and hardware-aware algorithms for efficient storage of intermediate results. As SSMs have drawn more and more attention recently, they also have extensive applications in domains that need long sequences processing such as medical [44, 6], video [34], tabular domain [2] and audio/speech [20, 30].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
