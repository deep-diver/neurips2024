Each subgraph represents a learning rate and weight decay coefficient. Colors indicate the cosine similarity between neurons, with warmer colors representing higher similarity. The neurons are grouped by cosine similarity greater than 0.7 to highlight the condensation properties.", "description": "This table in the paper shows the cosine similarity matrices of the WQ(1) neurons at different learning rates and weight decay coefficients.  The heatmaps visualize the parameter condensation. Warmer colors indicate higher similarity, and neurons with cosine similarity greater than 0.7 are grouped together to highlight the condensation effect.  This is used to analyze the model complexity at different hyperparameter settings.", "section": "E.1 Detailed Results for Condensation with Different Learning Rates and Weight Decay Coefficients"}]
