Existing methods often make simplifying assumptions or have high computational costs. This paper tackles the problem of online monotone DR-submodular maximization with stochastic long-term constraints, a setting relevant to various applications, particularly those involving resource allocation or budget management. The challenge lies in the uncertainty of both future rewards and resource availability. \nThe researchers address these challenges by proposing novel gradient ascent-based algorithms.  These algorithms handle both semi-bandit and full-information feedback settings, offering improved efficiency. **They achieve O(\u221aT) regret and O(T3/4) constraint violation with high probability**, demonstrating a significant improvement in query complexity compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The stochastic nature of the problem is carefully considered in the theoretical analysis, leading to robust performance guarantees.
