### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges due to the inherent limitations of individual client datasets and the privacy concerns associated with data sharing.  Existing techniques struggle with data heterogeneity and the diverse quality of policies learned on these small datasets.  Simply combining standard offline RL with standard federated learning approaches proves insufficient for achieving optimal results.



The researchers developed FEDORA, a novel algorithm that effectively addresses these challenges.  FEDORA utilizes an ensemble learning approach to distill the collective wisdom of the clients, employing strategies to mitigate issues of data heterogeneity and pessimistic value computation.  Through various experiments across simulated environments and real-world robotic tasks, FEDORA demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in collaboratively learning a high-quality control policy from distributed offline data.

> This figure compares the performance of various offline reinforcement learning algorithms on the Hopper environment from MuJoCo.  It showcases the results for different approaches including centralized offline RL (trained on combined data from all clients), individual offline RL (trained separately on each client's data), and three federated offline RL approaches (Fed-A, Fed-AC, and FEDORA). FEDORA is shown to significantly outperform the other federated approaches and performs comparably to centralized training, despite the use of only local data at each client, highlighting its strength in handling heterogeneous data and learning from ensembles of policies.

> This figure analyzes the performance of clients (with expert and medium quality data) during the federated learning process.  It shows how the average performance metric changes over communication rounds, highlighting the contribution of different client data qualities to the overall federated learning process. The plots visualize the performance of clients with expert and medium datasets in various environments (HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d). The analysis covers both client ratios (the proportion of expert and medium clients participating) and client decay (how the influence of local data decreases over time), illustrating the impact of various factors on individual client performance and their overall contribution to the federated model.





### In-depth insights


#### Fed Offline RL
Federated offline reinforcement learning (Fed Offline RL) presents a unique challenge in machine learning by combining the complexities of offline RL with the distributed nature of federated learning.  **The core problem lies in collaboratively training high-quality reinforcement learning policies across multiple clients using only pre-collected, local datasets**. Each client's data is generated under different, unknown behavior policies, leading to significant heterogeneity.  Naively applying standard offline RL and federated learning techniques often results in suboptimal performance.  **Key challenges include handling the ensemble heterogeneity of locally-trained policies, overcoming pessimistic value computation inherent in offline RL, and mitigating data heterogeneity across clients.**  Successful Fed Offline RL algorithms must address these issues through innovative approaches, such as ensemble learning techniques to distill collective client wisdom and sophisticated regularization methods to ensure policy convergence despite data inconsistencies.  **The development of robust, efficient Fed Offline RL algorithms has significant implications for real-world applications where centralized data collection is impractical or impossible, while respecting user privacy.**

#### Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning, in the context of federated offline reinforcement learning (RL), offers a powerful strategy to overcome the limitations of individual learners trained on heterogeneous data.  Instead of relying on a simple average of models, **ensemble methods leverage the collective wisdom of multiple policies and critics**.  This is crucial because individual clients' data may be of varying quality and relevance due to the diverse behavior policies under which data were collected.  By carefully weighing the contributions of different agents, **an ensemble approach can identify and emphasize high-performing policies**, mitigating the negative influence of poorly trained or biased models.  The weighting schemes, often incorporating techniques such as maximum entropy, are designed to encourage diversity and prevent dominance by a few exceptionally good, yet potentially over-specialized, learners. This approach enhances the robustness and overall performance of the final federated policy, addressing the challenges of ensemble heterogeneity that hinder standard federation strategies in offline RL.

#### Heterogeneous Data
The concept of "Heterogeneous Data" in federated learning is crucial, especially within the context of offline reinforcement learning. It highlights the challenge of combining datasets collected under different and often unknown behavior policies.  This heterogeneity introduces significant complexities because the data from each client may reflect vastly different levels of expertise or operational conditions.  **Simply averaging models trained on these diverse datasets, as in a naive federated approach, can be severely detrimental**, leading to poor performance or even worse results than utilizing individual local data.  Therefore, effective strategies, such as FEDORA, must address this issue by leveraging the collective wisdom of the ensemble of policies, not simply averaging their parameters. **Regularization techniques are essential** to manage distribution shift and mitigate the biases introduced by heterogeneous local training.  **Methods for assessing the quality of each client's dataset and assigning weights accordingly are crucial** for successful ensemble learning and optimal federated policy generation.  In essence, handling heterogeneous data requires a sophisticated and principled approach that goes beyond simplistic averaging, and the success of federated offline RL rests on its effective management.

#### Optimistic Critic
The concept of an "Optimistic Critic" in offline reinforcement learning is crucial for addressing the inherent pessimism of standard offline RL algorithms.  Standard algorithms often underestimate the value of actions poorly represented in the offline dataset, leading to overly conservative policies. An optimistic critic, in contrast, **actively seeks to overestimate action values**, encouraging exploration and potentially better performance.  This optimism is particularly important in federated settings where datasets are heterogeneous and sparse at individual clients. **By combining optimistic local critics with a globally federated critic, the algorithm benefits from both local and global information**, leading to more informed and less conservative policies.  However, **careful design is needed to avoid overly optimistic estimates that might lead to instability**. Regularization techniques and strategies to balance optimism with data-driven estimations are critical elements of a successful optimistic critic approach within a federated learning framework.

#### FEDORA Algorithm
The FEDORA algorithm tackles the complex problem of **federated offline reinforcement learning**, where multiple agents collaboratively learn a high-quality policy from pre-collected, heterogeneous datasets without directly sharing data.  Its core innovation lies in its **ensemble-directed approach**, leveraging the diverse strengths of locally-trained policies and critics from different agents. Unlike naive federation methods, FEDORA avoids simple averaging, instead strategically weighting agents' contributions based on their performance and employing an **entropy-regularized optimization** to prevent dominance by a few high-performing agents.  Furthermore, it addresses data heterogeneity and the inherent pessimism of offline RL through **data-aware regularization** and a novel **federated optimistic critic**. Finally, a mechanism to **decay the influence of low-quality local data** enhances robustness and global optimality. FEDORA demonstrates a superior approach in diverse environments, showcasing the significant advantages of this sophisticated strategy over naive federation techniques or centralized learning on combined datasets.
