Existing techniques struggle with data heterogeneity and the diverse quality of policies learned on these small datasets.  Simply combining standard offline RL with standard federated learning approaches proves insufficient for achieving optimal results.\n\nThe researchers developed FEDORA, a novel algorithm that effectively addresses these challenges.  FEDORA utilizes an ensemble learning approach to distill the collective wisdom of the clients, employing strategies to mitigate issues of data heterogeneity and pessimistic value computation.  Through various experiments across simulated environments and real-world robotic tasks, FEDORA demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in collaboratively learning a high-quality control policy from distributed offline data.", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ypaqE8UwsC/podcast.wav"}
