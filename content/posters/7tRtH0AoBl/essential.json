The multinomial logistic (MNL) model offers a more flexible, non-linear alternative, but existing RL algorithms for MNL models are computationally expensive or lack rigorous theoretical guarantees.  This paper addresses these issues by presenting **two novel randomized exploration algorithms, RRL-MNL and ORRL-MNL, which leverage the structure of the MNL model for efficient exploration and parameter estimation.** These algorithms achieve statistically efficient regret bounds with constant-time computational cost per episode.  The paper rigorously analyzes the regret guarantees for both algorithms and experimentally evaluates their performance on tabular MDPs and a variant of the RiverSwim problem, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MNL-MDP algorithms. \nThe paper focuses on addressing the challenges of RL with non-linear MNL transition models by proposing efficient algorithms that combine randomized exploration with online parameter estimation.  **RRL-MNL uses optimistic sampling for exploration and achieves a regret bound scaling with the problem-dependent constant \u03ba\u22121, while the more advanced ORRL-MNL employs local gradient information to achieve a regret bound that has reduced dependence on \u043a.**  This improved dependence on \u043a is a significant contribution, as previous methods suffered from potentially large regret bounds due to a poor dependence on this constant. The authors also demonstrate the computational efficiency of their algorithms in comparison to existing MNL-MDP approaches.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7tRtH0AoBl/podcast.wav"}
