It shows how, starting with an arbitrary initial transport plan (a way to map points from the source distribution *p\u2080* to the target distribution *p\u2081*), OFM achieves straight trajectories in a single step that precisely solve the optimal transport problem for quadratic cost.  In contrast to other methods that use iterative procedures and might produce curved trajectories, OFM leverages convex functions to directly produce straight paths.", "section": "Contributions"}, {"figure_path": "kqmucDKVcU/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Flow Matching (FM) obtains a vector field u moving po to p1.

It shows two probability distributions, p0 (green) and p1 (orange), and samples drawn from them.  Initially, there are direct connections between samples from p0 and p1.

This vector field aims to align the movement with the direction connecting each pair of samples from the original distributions, making the trajectories more direct, ideally straight lines.

The initial transport plan (e.g., independent plan) is gradually rectified.  In each iteration, Flow Matching (FM) is applied to the current transport plan (\u03c0<sup>k</sup>) to generate a new flow map (\u03c6<sup>k+1</sup>). This flow map is then used to update the transport plan (\u03c0<sup>k+1</sup>) for the next iteration.  This process continues for K iterations.  With each iteration, the trajectories generated by the flow map become increasingly straight, improving the approximation of the Optimal Transport (OT) map. The figure depicts this process visually, showing the trajectories becoming more aligned between the initial distribution and the target distribution as the number of iterations (k) increases.", "section": "2.4.3 Rectified Flow (RF)"}, {"figure_path": "kqmucDKVcU/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: An Optimal Vector Field: a vector field u with straight paths is parametrized by a gradient of a convex function \u03a8.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of an optimal vector field in the context of Optimal Flow Matching.  It shows how a vector field, denoted as *u*, can be parameterized by the gradient of a convex function, \u03a8.  The key feature is that this specific type of vector field, by its design, will always generate straight trajectories (paths) when used to transport probability distributions. The figure displays sample points (z0, z1, z2) from an initial distribution (p0) being transported to corresponding points in the target distribution (p1) along straight lines. The vector field *u*(xt) is calculated at any point xt, based on the inverse of the flow map \u03c6-1(xt), which recovers the origin point z0 along the straight path.
