A promising approach uses generative models, specifically those based on flow matching, as image priors to improve reconstruction quality. However, a major obstacle is the slow computation of log-likelihoods, which are crucial for efficient estimation.  This is particularly problematic for high-dimensional images. \nThis paper introduces Iterative Corrupted Trajectory Matching (ICTM), a novel algorithm to efficiently solve these problems. ICTM cleverly approximates the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) estimator by breaking down the complex objective function into smaller, more manageable local objectives.  By leveraging Tweedie's formula, ICTM efficiently performs gradient-based optimization steps, leading to computationally efficient and accurate reconstruction of images.  Experiments on various linear inverse problems (super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, compressed sensing) demonstrate that ICTM significantly outperforms existing flow-matching-based methods in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality.", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "1H2e7USI09/podcast.wav"}
