[{"heading_title": "Flow Matching Priors", "details": {"summary": "Flow matching priors offer a powerful approach to incorporating generative models into inverse problems.  They leverage the efficiency of flow-based models, which directly estimate densities using a change-of-variables formula, avoiding the computationally expensive sampling required by diffusion models. **The invertibility of flows provides direct access to likelihoods**, facilitating MAP estimation. A key advantage lies in the ability to compute image likelihoods directly from the learned flow, making them suitable priors for various inverse problems like image deblurring and super-resolution. However, **challenges remain in efficiently computing the log-likelihood, often requiring backpropagation through an ODE solver**. This computational bottleneck is particularly problematic for high-dimensional problems.  To address this, innovative techniques like Iterative Corrupted Trajectory Matching (ICTM) are developed to approximate MAP estimation efficiently, making flow matching priors a viable and increasingly attractive option for high-resolution image reconstruction."}}, {"heading_title": "Iterative ICTM", "details": {"summary": "The proposed Iterative Corrupted Trajectory Matching (ICTM) algorithm offers an efficient approach to solving linear inverse problems by leveraging flow-based generative models.  **Instead of directly optimizing the computationally expensive global MAP objective**, ICTM cleverly approximates it through a sequence of simpler, local MAP objectives. This iterative refinement strategy, mathematically grounded in Tweedie's formula and the concept of local posterior distributions, allows for significantly faster convergence.  **The algorithm sequentially refines intermediate trajectory points**, ensuring both likelihood and prior consistency, ultimately leading to a high-quality reconstruction. **The efficacy of ICTM is demonstrated across various inverse problems**, including super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring, showcasing its competitive performance against existing flow-matching based methods.
