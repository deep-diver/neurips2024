Existing research primarily focuses on maximizing in-distribution (ID) accuracy, neglecting OoD performance.  This leads to a critical research gap in understanding how to design ViTs that generalize well under OoD shifts.\nThis paper introduces OoD-ViT-NAS, the first comprehensive benchmark for ViT Neural Architecture Search (NAS) focused on OoD generalization.  It evaluates 3,000 ViT architectures on 8 common large-scale OoD datasets, revealing that ViT architecture significantly impacts OoD accuracy.  The study also challenges the assumption that high ID accuracy translates to good OoD performance and explores training-free NAS for ViT OoD robustness, discovering that simple metrics like parameter count outperform complex methods.", "affiliation": "Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2AIwiIkE0s/podcast.wav"}
