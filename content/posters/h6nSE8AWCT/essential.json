This compositional misalignment is very common in real-world scenarios and reduces the practical usefulness of the technology. The inconsistency and low fidelity in outputs stem from the diffusion model's reliance on visual similarity between reference image and target pose; when they are misaligned, the attention mechanism can fail to accurately match relevant features, resulting in artifacts and inconsistencies. \nTo address this, the authors propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC). This method pre-processes the reference image using Procrustes analysis to align its human shape with the target pose before feeding it into the diffusion model. By doing so, TPC ensures that the model's attention mechanism is always properly guided, resulting in improved fidelity and consistency of the output animation even in cases with compositional misalignment. Experimental results on various benchmarks and datasets demonstrate TPC's effectiveness in improving animation quality, especially when dealing with real-world scenarios and compositional misalignment. The method is shown to be model-agnostic and easily adaptable to a range of diffusion-based animation systems.", "affiliation": "Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "h6nSE8AWCT/podcast.wav"}
