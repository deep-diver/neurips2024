Embedding c \u2208 R to fE(c) \u2208 RD from Cmin to Cmax with B bins to obtain M \u2208 RB\u00d7D, the fix figures show from the left, (i) the Euclidean distance matrix of M, (ii) its slice at 0, (iii) the norm of embedding vectors, (iv) the dot product MMT with M of the row-normalized M, (v) fE(0)TM and (vi) fE(c0)TM. (a) Trained on R[X1,X2]; (Cmin, Cmax) = (\u2212100, 100). (b) Trained on F31[X1,X2]; (Cmin, Cmax) = (0,31). The embedding layer fE has one/two hidden layers (top/bottom rows). As can be seen, the relationship between embedding vectors in terms of distance and dot product is aligned well in the infinite field and not in the finite field.", "description": "This figure visualizes the embedding vectors of numbers generated by the proposed hybrid embedding method. It compares the embeddings of real numbers (R) and finite field numbers (F31).  The plots show Euclidean distance matrices, slices of these matrices, norms of embedding vectors, dot products of normalized embeddings, and dot products with specific embedding vectors (fE(0) and fE(c0)). The results highlight that the continuous embedding scheme better captures the relationships between numbers in the infinite field (R) compared to the finite field (F31).", "section": "5 Hybrid Input Embedding"}]
