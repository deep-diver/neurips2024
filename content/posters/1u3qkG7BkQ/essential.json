Existing methods primarily focus on individual vehicle trajectories, lacking the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics which significantly limits the controllability and realism of generated scenarios. This makes it hard to test autonomous vehicles' ability to respond to complex situations and real-world challenges such as traffic jams.\nInteractTraj tackles this by directly learning the mapping between abstract language descriptions of traffic scenarios and concrete, formatted interaction-aware numerical codes. It interprets natural language into three types of codes: interaction, vehicle, and map codes, which are then used by the code-to-trajectory decoder to produce the final interactive trajectories. The decoder employs a two-step interaction-aware feature aggregation to effectively integrate code information with environmental map data. **Extensive experiments demonstrate InteractTraj's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods,** achieving significant improvements in accuracy and demonstrating high controllability via diverse natural language commands. User studies confirm the model's improved realism.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "1u3qkG7BkQ/podcast.wav"}
