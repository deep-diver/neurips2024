One plausible solution is to collect a large dataset for each sensor for training or fine-tuning, which is inevitably time-consuming. To address this cross-domain challenge, we present a novel adaptive domain learning (ADL) scheme for crossdomain RAW image denoising by utilizing existing data from different sensors (source domain) plus a small amount of data from the new sensor (target domain). The ADL training scheme automatically removes the data in the source domain that are harmful to fine-tuning a model for the target domain (some data are harmful as adding them during training lowers the performance due to domain gaps). Also, we introduce a modulation module to adopt sensor-specific information (sensor type and ISO) to understand input data for image denoising.

Over the past few years, learningbased methods have made significant progress in RAW image denoising [5, 22, 25, 42]. However, building a large-scale real-world dataset with noise-clean pairs for training a denoising model is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is hard to collect ground truth that is noise-free and has no misalignment with the input noisy data. Moreover, due to the different noise distributions of different sensors (such as read noise and shot noise), the collected data from a particular sensor usually cannot be used to train the denoising model of other sensors, which causes a waste of resources. Therefore, it is important to develop a method to solve this problem.

Noise synthesis and calibration methods first build a noise model, optimize for noise parameters according to a particular camera, and then synthesize training pairs from the noise model to train a network. Self-supervised denoising is designed based on the blindspots schemes. When the input noisy image masks out some pixels and forms a similar but different image from the input, the network learns to denoise instead of identity mapping. Therefore, the network can learn to denoise without pairwise noise-clean data. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "While the noise synthesis and calibration methods are top-performing ones for RAW data denoising and self-supervised denoising does not need to collect pairwise data, both of them have their practical limitations. First, noise synthesis and calibration methods are not able to obtain the exact noise model of the real noise. For example, fixed pattern noise such as dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU) and Photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) are not included in the model. As a result, some of the sampled noise training pairs might be harmful to the training of the denoising model (i.e., decrease in performance). Second, building a calibration model still needs to collect data under particular circumstances. Third, these models can only be used to synthesize training data for specific sensors, which leads to a waste of resources. On the other hand, self-supervised denoising is designed under some unverified assumptions of noise distribution. First, the noise distribution has zero means. Second, the noise in different pixels is independent of each other. These assumptions do not match the noise in the real world, especially when the noise distribution is complicated.

Our method can utilize existing RAW image denoising datasets from various sensors (source domains) combined with very little data from a new sensor (target domain) together to train a denoising model for that new sensor. Some data in a source domain may be harmful to fine-tuning a model due to the large domain gap: for instance, synthetic data may be harmful to training a model for real-world applications if the synthetic data imposes unrealistic and unreasonable assumptions. In such cases, our method dynamically evaluates whether a data sample from a source domain is beneficial or harmful by evaluating the performance on a small validation set of the target domain, before and after fine-tuning the model on this data sample. If the performance improves after fine-tuning, we can use this data sample for training; otherwise, we should ignore it.

The large intensity distribution gap between the simulation cameras and the test set will lead to low performance.

Our method can outperform Led [16] in this case. This is because the performance of Led [16] highly depends on the prior knowledge of noise distribution learning from the simulated camera.

On the contrary, the model will fail if the noise intensity between these two sensors is very different. Based on this observation, we can say that the source domain data with similar noise intensity to the target domain data is useful, while the data with a large noise intensity difference is harmful.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
