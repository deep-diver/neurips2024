Existing approaches often rely heavily on synthetic datasets or task-specific loss functions, which limit their real-world applicability. \nThis paper introduces YOLA, a novel framework that tackles low-light object detection by learning illumination-invariant features using a novel Illumination-Invariant Module (IIM). The IIM effectively extracts these features by leveraging the Lambertian image formation model and employing a zero-mean constraint on task-driven learnable kernels.  YOLA demonstrates significant improvements in low-light object detection, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.  The code's availability promotes further research and real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Megvii Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "MocRdX0n7B/podcast.wav"}
