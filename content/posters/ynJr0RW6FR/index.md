### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing reference-based scene stylization methods struggle with slow rendering times due to reliance on neural radiance fields (NeRFs).  These methods also suffer from an inability to accurately capture fine texture details in the reference image when editing the appearance of pre-trained NeRFs. This paper introduces ReGS, which leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting for significantly faster rendering while addressing these texture limitations. 

ReGS introduces a novel texture-guided control mechanism. This method identifies areas where the appearance needs improvement, then adapts the underlying Gaussian splat geometry for better matching to the reference image.  The method also incorporates depth regularization to preserve the original scene geometry.  Experimental results demonstrate that ReGS achieves state-of-the-art stylization quality with real-time performance, surpassing existing NeRF-based approaches in speed and accuracy.

### In-depth insights


#### Ref-based 3D Stylization
Reference-based 3D stylization is a rapidly evolving field aiming to transfer the style of a 2D reference image onto a 3D scene.  Early approaches often suffered from limitations in handling complex geometries and achieving high-fidelity texture transfer.  **Neural radiance fields (NeRFs)**, while offering high-quality results, often prove computationally expensive, making real-time applications challenging.  **Gaussian splatting** emerges as a promising technique due to its efficiency.  However, directly applying 2D stylization techniques to 3D Gaussian splatting faces hurdles as appearance is tightly coupled with geometry.  Therefore, novel methods focus on decoupling appearance and geometry, often involving **texture-guided control mechanisms** to manipulate Gaussian parameters and ensure fine-grained texture control without compromising the original 3D structure. **Real-time performance** is a significant goal, requiring efficient rendering and optimization techniques.  Future research will likely explore enhancing controllability, addressing limitations in handling occlusions and complex textures, and further optimizing for speed and scalability.

#### Gaussian Splatting
Gaussian splatting, a novel 3D scene representation technique, presents a compelling alternative to traditional volumetric rendering methods.  Its core innovation lies in representing scenes using millions of colored 3D Gaussians, each with learnable attributes like position, color, opacity, and covariance. This discrete representation, unlike continuous radiance fields, allows for **highly efficient differentiable rendering** via splatting-based rasterization. This approach significantly accelerates view synthesis, enabling real-time performance and free-view navigation, which is often challenging with traditional NeRFs. However, the discrete nature of Gaussian splatting also presents challenges.  **Directly optimizing the appearance of pre-trained Gaussians is often insufficient** for capturing fine details and continuous textures. The inherent entanglement of geometry and appearance in the Gaussian representation requires more sophisticated editing techniques beyond simple appearance optimization.  Therefore, methods like texture-guided control are crucial for effective stylization and high-fidelity texture editing while preserving original scene geometry.

#### Texture-Guided Control
The proposed 'Texture-Guided Gaussian Control' method is a crucial innovation for high-fidelity texture editing in 3D scenes.  It directly addresses the limitations of prior methods that struggle with continuous textures by **adaptively adjusting the arrangement of local Gaussians**.  Instead of solely optimizing appearance, this method leverages texture clues to identify and modify the relevant Gaussians, ensuring the desired texture details are precisely reflected.  **Depth-based regularization** prevents undesired geometric distortions, maintaining the scene's structural integrity. The use of **color gradients** as guidance offers a significant advantage over positional gradients by more effectively pinpointing areas needing texture refinement. This texture-guided approach makes high-fidelity appearance editing more achievable, resulting in **state-of-the-art stylization results** while maintaining real-time performance, as demonstrated by the high frame rate reported.  This intelligent control mechanism truly unlocks the potential of Gaussian splatting for realistic scene stylization.

#### Real-time Rendering
Real-time rendering in 3D scene stylization presents a significant challenge, demanding efficient techniques to process and display complex visual data rapidly.  The paper addresses this by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), **a method known for its speed**.  However, directly applying 3DGS to stylization is nontrivial due to its discrete Gaussian representation.  The core innovation lies in the texture-guided Gaussian control, which dynamically adjusts the spatial arrangement of Gaussians to achieve high-fidelity texture reproduction, **balancing speed and quality**.  The effectiveness of this approach is clearly demonstrated with quantitative metrics like FPS, showcasing considerable improvement over existing NeRF-based methods. While real-time rendering is achieved, the trade-off between speed and the quality of texture details remains a factor. Future work could investigate further optimizations and explore different trade-offs, especially for high-resolution scenes and complex stylization effects.  **The real-time aspect is crucial for interactive applications**, enabling seamless navigation and manipulation of the stylized 3D scenes.  This contributes significantly to user experience in fields such as digital art, film production, and virtual reality.

#### Future Directions
The paper's 'Future Directions' section would ideally explore extending ReGS's capabilities beyond image-based stylization.  **Investigating text-driven or multi-modal control** would significantly enhance the system's versatility.  Furthermore, addressing the current limitation of handling only minor geometric changes by incorporating more sophisticated geometry editing techniques, perhaps leveraging generative models or learning shape transformations from reference images, is crucial.  **Improving efficiency** is also critical; reducing computational demands could facilitate real-time applications on more constrained devices.  Finally, a thorough **exploration of the robustness and generalizability** of ReGS across various scene types, texture characteristics, and styles is necessary, along with careful consideration of potential ethical implications, especially regarding the creation of realistic yet manipulated content.

> This figure shows the process of ReGS. First, a pretrained 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) model of the target scene is used as input (a). Then, the stylized 3DGS model is obtained by applying Texture-Guided Gaussian Control to resolve texture underfitting and adjust local Gaussian geometry (b, c). Finally, real-time stylized scene navigation is enabled by rendering the stylized 3DGS model (d).
