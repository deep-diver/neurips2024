Existing methods often underutilize the shared characteristics in part-level shapes across categories. This paper addresses these limitations.  The proposed Hypergraph-Based Assembly Fuzzy Representation (HAFR) framework is designed to address these challenges by using a bottom-up approach, starting from part-level features and assembling them into object representations, hence, utilizing the commonalities in part-level shapes of objects. \nHAFR uses Hypergraph Isomorphism Convolution (HIConv) to smooth features and Isomorphic Assembly Embedding (IAE) to generate geometric-semantic consistent embeddings. To address open-set generalization, it employs Structure Fuzzy Reconstruction (SFR) with a leverage hypergraph that captures correlations between seen and unseen categories, mitigating distribution skew.  Experiments on three new open-set datasets (OP-SHNP, OP-INTRA, OP-COSEG) demonstrate that HAFR significantly outperforms existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in handling unseen object categories. **HAFR's success highlights the potential of assembly-based representation and fuzzy reconstruction techniques for open-set 3D object retrieval.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "xOCAURlVM9/podcast.wav"}
