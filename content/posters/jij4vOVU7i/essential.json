Existing methods often involve multiple stages and resource-intensive post-processing, hindering real-time applications.  This necessitates the development of more efficient methods without compromising accuracy.\n\nBaFormer addresses these issues with a novel single-stage approach centered around per-segment classification using Transformers.  It employs instance queries for instance segmentation and a global query for boundary prediction, enabling a simple yet effective voting strategy during inference. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while achieving better or comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.  The code's public availability promotes reproducibility and further research.", "affiliation": "Stony Brook University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "jij4vOVU7i/podcast.wav"}
