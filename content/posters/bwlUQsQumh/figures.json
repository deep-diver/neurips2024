The variables include:\n\n* **X**: Observed pre-treatment covariates.\n* **Z**: Instrumental variable (IV).\n* **U**: Unobserved confounder (latent variable).\n* **A**: Treatment assignment.\n* **Y**: Outcome.\n\nThe arrows indicate causal effects.  For example, X has a direct causal effect on A and Y, and Z has a direct effect on A. U influences both A and Y, representing unmeasured confounding. Z is selected as an instrumental variable because it is associated with A but is not directly affected by U or Y, providing a path to identify the effect of A on Y even in the presence of the unobserved confounder.", "section": "3 Direct Learning with Instrumental Variable Approach"}, {"figure_path": "bwlUQsQumh/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Tree splitting of estimated CATE on covariates. The five leaf nodes shall be numbered 1-5.", "description": "This figure shows a tree-based model for visualizing heterogeneity in conditional average treatment effects (CATE). The tree uses pre-treatment covariates (mother's age at census, age at first birth, and father's income) to predict CATE. Each leaf node represents a subgroup of the population with a specific range of covariate values and a corresponding average treatment effect estimate. The numbers in each leaf node represent the estimated CATE and the percentage of the population in that subgroup. The tree shows that there are different subgroups with different treatment effects.", "section": "7 Data Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "bwlUQsQumh/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Histograms of estimated CATE in three majority subgroups", "description": "This figure presents histograms visualizing the distribution of estimated Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) for three major subgroups identified in the analysis of mother's labor force participation. Each histogram shows the frequency of different CATE values within each subgroup.  The subgroups are determined by a combination of factors such as mother's age at census, age at first birth, and father's income.

The plots use color to represent the magnitude of the estimated CATE, with a color gradient ranging from blue (negative CATE) to red (positive CATE). The two plots show the same data but from different viewing angles (rotations) to better illustrate the three-dimensional relationship between the covariates and the estimated treatment effect.  The visualization aims to demonstrate heterogeneity in treatment effects across different subpopulations defined by these three covariates.", "section": "7 Data Analysis"}]
