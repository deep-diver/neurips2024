Panel (a) details the construction pipeline, highlighting the selection of anchor samples, generation of K-shot in-context sequences, and the use of a scorer to evaluate the quality of these sequences. The darker shading of SK represents higher scores according to Equation 2. Panel (b) displays the Lever-LM architecture, which consists of a two-layer Transformer. The input embeddings are a combination of learnable embeddings, image embeddings, and text embeddings extracted using CLIP.  This shows how Lever-LM takes in queries and corresponding ICDs to learn patterns for effective ICD sequence generation.", "section": "3 Lever Language Model"}, {"figure_path": "TGC7HNf6nK/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (a) The traditional ICD configuration methods separately select and order the ICDs, leading to sub-optimal ICL performance.
