In this paper, we initiate a theoretical investigation into the emergence of planning capabilities in Transformer-based LLMs via their next-word prediction mechanisms. We model planning as a network path-finding task, where the objective is to generate a valid path from a specified source node to a designated target node. Our mathematical characterization shows that Transformer architectures can execute path-finding by embedding the adjacency and reachability matrices within their weights. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis of gradient-based learning dynamics reveals that LLMs can learn both the adjacency and a limited form of the reachability matrices. These theoretical insights are then validated through experiments, which demonstrate that Transformer architectures indeed learn the adjacency and an incomplete reachability matrices, consistent with our theoretical predictions. When applying our methodology to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, our observations remain consistent. Additionally, our analyses uncover a fundamental limitation of current Transformer architectures in path-finding: these architectures cannot identify reachability relationships through transitivity, which leads to failures in generating paths when concatenation is required.

Furthermore, theoretical analyses have been conducted on in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and other forms of reasoning [30, 8, 7, 27]. Beyond these, LLMs\u2019 capability for planning\u2014a fundamental component of human intelligence\u2014has also drawn considerable attention. Planning is involved in nearly every aspect of our daily life, such as organizing a task at work, planning a trip, or seeking a mathematical proof of a theorem. Additionally, task planning plays a pivotal role in state-of-the-art LLM-empowered autonomous agents, such as HuggingGPT [18], Voyager [23], and Reflection [19]. Understanding how LLMs complete a planning task can shed light on how the seemingly low-level statistical task of next-word prediction transforms into a high-level intelligent process. Several prior studies have empirically evaluated the planning capabilities of LLMs, yielding both positive and negative results [16, 22]. However, the current results are incomplete and do not fully explain why LLMs can or cannot successfully accomplish specific planning tasks (see Appendix A for a detailed discussion of related works). ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Given that planning often involves making sequential selections of next steps to achieve a desired goal, it naturally relates to the path-finding task in networks. For example, autonomous agents (e.g., HuggingGPT [18]) for scheduling API calls can be likened to finding a call path in the API call graph; a mathematical proof can be seen as a proof path from the axioms to the final theorem [21]; and a step-by-step solution to a grade-school math problem can be viewed as a path in the dependency graph among the variables [28, 29]. Many previous studies on LLM planning capabilities are related to path-finding. e.g., an LLM planning benchmark called Blocksworld [22] can be viewed as pathfinding from the initial state of the blocks to the final state in a state transition graph. Furthermore, in neuroscience, planning is often evaluated through path-finding in a maze [26]. Consequently, in this paper, we abstract planning in LLM learning as the following path-finding task: given an underlying directed graph, a Transformer architecture is provided with training data consisting of a collection of paths that specify the source node, the target node, and a path from the source to the target. The task of the language model is then to generate a path for a new source-target pair. In addition to measuring the performance of the trained model, we examine the internal weighting mechanism and the learning dynamics of the Transformer architecture during the learning and problem-solving process. This research is part of our broader project, ALPINE (Autoregressive Learning for Planning In NEtworks), which aims to answer the overarching question on the connection between the process of next-word prediction and the emergence of intelligence through the lens of planning. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our Contributions: Our project initiates a theoretical investigation into the development of planning capabilities in Transformer-based language models by focusing on characterizing their expressiveness and learning dynamics in the path-finding task. First, in Theorem 2, we present a mathematical construction of a Transformer that encodes both the adjacency and reachability matrices of the network, thereby establishing that Transformer architectures possess the expressive capacity to complete the path-finding task. Then, in Theorem 3, we prove that when applying gradient descent to minimize the cross-entropy loss on the training data, a model based on a simplified Transformer architecture can extract the adjacency matrix and a limited form of the reachability matrix, using them to mimic human-like intelligence in path-finding. Our theoretical analysis further reveals a fundamental limitation of current Transformer architectures: they do not learn certain types of reachability, particularly transitive reachability, resulting in an incomplete ability to reason about future steps when planning. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments training Transformers on the path language using autoregressive learning. First, these experiments demonstrate that Transformers achieve high accuracy in the path-finding task (Figure 3). Second, we show that it is indeed possible to extract both the adjacency and a limited form of the reachability matrices from the Transformers\u2019 weights (Figures 1,2,5,6(a)). Third, we observe a significant drop in test accuracy when the source and target nodes are connected only through concatenated path segments in the training data (Figure 6). These findings align with our theoretical analysis, confirming that current Transformers have limitations in learning transitive reachability relationships, unlike human intelligence. Finally, we validate these results on a real-world task planning benchmark, Blocksworld [22], which directly corresponds to the path-finding problem (see Appendix F).

Consequently, with the current training loss and Transformer architecture, the model cannot learn unobserved reachabilities, such as transitive reachability.

For instance, CogEval has introduced a variety of planning tasks set in mazes and graphs, ultimately finding no evidence to suggest LLMs grasp the intricacies of the maps or the planning tasks themselves [16]. Similarly, another study explored the Blocksworld game, a planning challenge where humans typically achieve success rates above $70\\%$ , in stark contrast to GPT-3\u2019s mere $5\\%$ success rate [22]. Our paper also proposes a novel approach by formulating a class of planning problems as path-finding on graphs, applying this model to the Blocksworld game and uncovering significant insights, as detailed in Appendix F. ", "page_idx": 12}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite these seemingly negative evaluations, LLMs have shown remarkable aptitude in executing real-world planning tasks, creating the field of autonomous agents [25]. Certain applications of autonomous agents feature explicit graphs. In the tool agent HuggingGPT [18], LLMs are deployed to trigger a sequence of external APIs in response to user requests. Here, APIs are conceptualized as graph nodes, with their interrelations represented as edges, and the selection process akin to identifying a path or subgraph that aligns with user demands. This scenario is an extension of the settings discussed in this paper, where the graph is text-attributed and the objective function is evaluated through textual analysis. In addition, the application of graph search techniques has been shown to enhance the performance of tool agents significantly [13, 12]. This demonstrates that our approach of abstracting planning as path-finding in graphs is reasonable. The math agent AlphaGeometry utilizes LLMs to solve geometry problems [21]. By treating lemmas as nodes and their interdependencies as edges, the process of finding a proof of a theorem is analogous to finding a path to the theorem node in the above graph formed by possible lemma nodes and their interdependency edges. However, [21] only focuses on using LLMs to generate auxiliary constructions, and the reasoning tasks are done by a non-LLM engine. This is very different from our approach. There are no explicit graphs in other agents, such as game agents [23], embodied agents [10], and code agents [19]. The core strategy in these domains is to employ verbal reinforcement learning within LLMs. However, it is noteworthy that any dynamic programming problem characterized by deterministic state transitions can be reformulated as a shortest path problem on a graph, with states and transitions represented as nodes and edges, respectively. As a result, the area of autonomous agents is also closely related to the path-finding task investigated in this paper.

These frameworks encompass a broad spectrum of challenges, including classic graph problems (e.g., connectivity, cycle detection, and topological sorting), graph neural network (GNN) tasks (e.g., node and graph classification), and semantic graph question answering (e.g., knowledge graph inquiries). They also explore various input formats, such as adjacency lists, edge lists, GML, and GraphML, alongside innovative prompting techniques such as few-shot, role prompting, chain-of-thought, and algorithmic prompting (e.g., stating \u201cwe are using DFS\u201d). These studies demonstrate that LLMs possess basic graph processing capabilities, and the choice of prompts and formats significantly influences the performance. Yet, they also reveal the models\u2019 susceptibility to spurious correlations within graphs. GPT-4, for instance, only achieves around $50\\%$ accuracy on shortest path tasks, even when utilizing complex prompts. To our knowledge, our paper presents the first theoretical analysis that identifies and explains the spurious correlations learned by transformers, partially supporting some of the negative outcomes reported in these studies.

This method of procedural supervision has extended the capacity of LLMs in graph tasks from the complexity class $\\bar{\\mathrm{T}}\\mathrm{C}^{0}$ to P/poly [7].

On the other hand, despite their impressive expressiveness, the Transformer is theoretically incapable of addressing a range of P-complete problems, including the testing of Context-Free Grammar Membership [15]. However, the advent of chain-of-thought prompting has enabled the Transformer to sequentially simulate algorithms, thereby equipping them to tackle P-complete problems in domains such as arithmetic and decision-making [7]. The exploration then extends to continuous algorithms, where it has been demonstrated that the Transformer can approximate functions such as matrix inversion, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and power iterations [8]. Our study specifically applies Transformer models to simulate path-finding algorithms, presenting evidence that their expressiveness is sufficient for such tasks (Theorem 2). Nevertheless, the usage of autoregressive loss and gradient descent introduces certain limitations, which have not been studied in existing works.

To demystify this paradox, numerous studies have employed experimental methodologies akin to those used in the physical and biological sciences. Their aim is to decode the mechanisms of LLMs. The foundational strategy is to generate controlled synthetic datasets to analyze how transformers (not necessarily LLMs) complete various tasks. Standard methods for this analysis include visualizing attention patterns to examine computational properties (such as locality and time invariance) and employing linear probing on the hidden states to determine the extent of learning. Given that the training data is synthetic and the ground-truth mappings are generally known, it becomes feasible to isolate the influence of various factors (e.g., prompting strategies, chain-of-thought reasoning, and data formatting). For example, a dataset designed for learning group operations, as detailed in [31], facilitates the exploration of how pretraining, data composition, and neural architecture influence reasoning tasks within LLMs. Similarly, the generation of synthetic context-free grammar (CFG) data, as described in [2], enables training GPT-2 models, uncovering their capacity to learn dynamic programming algorithms for parsing CFGs. Synthetic datasets focusing on biographical knowledge, presented in [3, 4, 5], probe into the mechanisms of knowledge storage, retrieval, manipulation, and the implications of scaling laws. Moreover, the work in [11] introduces synthetic datasets that aim to understand how smaller LLMs tackle basic arithmetic operations, e.g., addition, and examines the effects of few-shot prompting, pretraining, and model scaling [11]. Our work builds upon these investigations by conducting controlled experiments with a path-finding dataset, thereby shedding light on the complexities and challenges of planning in language models.
