The approximation is used because FFN (X2WV + Xn)W\uff61 is approximated by the sum of FFN (X2WV)W\uff61 and FFN (Xn)W\uff61. The approximation is surprisingly accurate with cosine similarity ranging from 0.870 to 0.926. This shows the validity of the approximation used in the paper's theoretical analysis.", "section": "E Complete Experimental Results on the Synthetic Datasets"}, {"figure_path": "WFbZusv14E/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Cosine Similarity of FFN (X2WV + Xn) W\u3002 and FFN (X2WV) W\uff61 + FFN (Xn) W\uff61", "description": "This table presents the cosine similarity between the approximation FFN(X2WV + Xn)W\uff61 \u2248 FFN(X2WV)W\uff61 + FFN(Xn)W\uff61 for different graph sizes.
