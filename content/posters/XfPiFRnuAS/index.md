### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods struggle with distinguishing subtle differences between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data because they rely on analyzing a single input, limiting their representation capacity. This can lead to misclassifications, especially with overconfident OOD samples. This paper reveals a phenomenon called 'confidence mutation', where OOD data confidence significantly decreases under common image corruptions, while ID data remains relatively stable.  This is because of their semantic difference.

To address this, the researchers propose a new method called CoVer (Confidence Average). CoVer cleverly expands input representation by incorporating both original and corrupted inputs. By averaging the model's confidence scores from these multiple inputs, CoVer enhances the separability of ID and OOD distributions, leading to improved detection accuracy.  Extensive experiments show that CoVer significantly outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets and is highly compatible with different network architectures.

### In-depth insights


#### Expanded Input OOD
The concept of "Expanded Input OOD" introduces a novel approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by **augmenting the input data** with various transformations or corruptions before feeding it to the model.  This method expands the representation dimension of the input, allowing the model to capture more nuanced information for distinguishing between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. The core idea is that OOD samples might exhibit sensitivity to these corruptions and change their confidence score differently than ID samples.  This **confidence mutation** phenomenon, combined with the average confidence across multiple input versions, is the key to improved separability between ID and OOD data. The method demonstrates the **effectiveness of input-level augmentation** for enhancing OOD detection performance, especially in scenarios where traditional methods relying solely on a single input struggle.  While computationally more expensive, the results suggest this trade-off is worth considering for improved robustness in real-world applications where the reliability of OOD detection is crucial.

#### Confidence Mutation
The concept of "Confidence Mutation" offers a novel perspective on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.  It posits that applying common corruptions to input data causes a disproportionate decrease in model confidence for OOD samples compared to in-distribution (ID) samples.  This phenomenon, **confidence mutation**, is crucial because it highlights the differing resilience of ID and OOD data to perturbations. While single corrupted inputs might not effectively separate ID and OOD data, the **averaging of confidence scores across multiple corrupted and original inputs** significantly enhances the discriminative power, leading to improved OOD detection. The underlying mechanism suggests that ID data, possessing inherent semantic consistency, retains high confidence even with corruptions, while OOD data's confidence is more dramatically affected by the removal of non-semantic features.  This dynamic, captured by the CoVer method, offers a powerful new way to leverage inherent differences between ID and OOD data for robust OOD detection.

#### CoVer Framework
The CoVer framework introduces a novel approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by expanding the input representation dimension.  Instead of relying solely on a single input, CoVer leverages multiple inputs created by applying common corruptions to the original input. This strategy reveals a phenomenon called "confidence mutation," where OOD data exhibit significantly decreased confidence under corruptions, while in-distribution (ID) data maintain higher confidence due to their robust semantic features.  **CoVer's innovative approach improves the separability of ID and OOD distributions**, leading to more accurate OOD detection.  By averaging the confidence scores from the original and corrupted inputs, CoVer effectively captures the dynamic differences and enhances model robustness. **The framework's simplicity and compatibility with various networks, including both single-modal and multi-modal models, make it a significant contribution to the field.**  Its effectiveness is validated by extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. The study also explores the impact of different corruption types and levels, offering valuable insights for practical implementation.

#### Zero-Shot OOD
Zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tackles a crucial challenge in deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios.  Traditional OOD methods typically require retraining or fine-tuning on OOD examples, which is often infeasible or impractical. **Zero-shot OOD detection, in contrast, leverages pre-trained models, often vision-language models like CLIP, without any further training on OOD data.** This significantly reduces the time and resources needed for adaptation, making it more suitable for dynamic environments where new OOD data continuously emerge.  However, zero-shot OOD detection presents its own set of difficulties. **The effectiveness relies heavily on the quality and representational capacity of the pre-trained model**, and there's a risk of overconfidence or misclassification, particularly when dealing with highly dissimilar OOD examples. **Therefore, designing robust scoring functions that effectively capture the discriminative features between ID and OOD data within a zero-shot setting remains a key research focus**. Future advancements might explore innovative ways to integrate prior knowledge about OOD distributions or employ more sophisticated representation learning techniques to enhance the performance of zero-shot OOD methods.

#### Future of CoVer
The future of CoVer, a novel OOD detection framework, looks promising.  **Expanding its applicability to diverse data modalities** beyond images and text is a key area for future exploration, leveraging the inherent strength of CoVer's input-side design. Investigating the effectiveness of CoVer in combination with other advanced OOD detection methods, particularly those employing newer architectures and techniques, could **yield substantial performance improvements**.  Furthermore,  **a deeper theoretical understanding of confidence mutation** and its relationship to different corruption strategies, through formal analysis and empirical studies, will enhance CoVer's robustness and reliability.  Finally, **developing efficient implementations and optimizing CoVer's computational costs** is crucial for real-world deployments, particularly in resource-constrained environments.  Addressing these areas will establish CoVer as a leading method in the field.

> This figure compares the score distributions obtained using three different input methods: a single original input, a single corrupted input, and multiple inputs (CoVer).  The left panel shows that using the single original input produces overlapping distributions of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, making accurate classification difficult. The middle panel shows that while a single corrupted input reduces the model's confidence, it doesn't significantly improve the separation.  The right panel demonstrates the effectiveness of CoVer by showing that utilizing multiple inputs (the original and its corrupted versions) significantly reduces the variance of the ID distribution and leads to a far better separation of ID and OOD data, resulting in improved detection performance.  The improvement is quantified using AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate).

The left panel focuses on unconfident ID samples, showing that their low-frequency features (semantic features) are robust to corruptions, and the confidence does not change much. In contrast, the right panel demonstrates how the confidence scores of overconfident OOD samples decrease significantly after applying corruptions, highlighting the vulnerability of their non-semantic high-frequency features.

It shows how multiple corrupted versions of an input image are processed by a pre-trained model (single or multi-modal).  Different scoring functions are applied to the model outputs, and these scores are then averaged to produce the final CoVer score, improving the separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Finally, the right panel illustrates how CoVer, by averaging scores across multiple (original and corrupted) inputs, significantly reduces the variance in the ID data and improves the separation between ID and OOD data. This improvement suggests that expanding the input representation dimension helps improve the accuracy of OOD detection.
