The error types are categorized into five types: Correct, Location Error, Background Error, Classification Error, and Other.  The pie charts show the distribution of these errors for three frequency categories of classes (Rare, Common, and Frequent) in the LVIS v1.0 validation set. The results demonstrate that 2DRCL significantly improves the performance on tail classes (rare classes) without a substantial decrease in accuracy for more frequent classes.", "section": "4.3 Further Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "mGz3Jux9wS/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Attention map comparisons w.r.t Baseline [11], ECM [22], 2DRCL (w/o DRC) and 2DRCL (our method) on LVIS dataset.

Each row shows the attention map for a specific image and method. The top row shows the class of the corresponding image. Red color indicates high attention.
