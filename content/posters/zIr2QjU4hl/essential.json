However, existing methods often struggle in offline scenarios where accurate reward models are unavailable, leading to over-optimization. This paper introduces BRAID, a novel approach that tackles these challenges by conservatively fine-tuning diffusion models using a learned reward model that incorporates uncertainty quantification and penalizes out-of-distribution regions. This helps prevent overfitting to the limited training data and avoid generating invalid designs.\n\nBRAID achieves this by optimizing a conservative reward model that incorporates uncertainty quantification terms.  It then uses this reward model to fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model, adding a KL-divergence penalty to ensure that generated designs remain within the valid design space. This \"doubly conservative\" approach ensures high-quality designs that outperform the best designs in the offline dataset.  The paper demonstrates BRAID's efficacy through empirical evaluations in diverse domains, including DNA/RNA sequences and images, showcasing its significant improvement over existing methods.", "affiliation": "Genentech", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "zIr2QjU4hl/podcast.wav"}
