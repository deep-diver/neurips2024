### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many AI-driven design problems leverage generative modeling for exploring design spaces and model-based optimization for refining designs using reward functions. However, existing methods often struggle in offline scenarios where accurate reward models are unavailable, leading to over-optimization. This paper introduces BRAID, a novel approach that tackles these challenges by conservatively fine-tuning diffusion models using a learned reward model that incorporates uncertainty quantification and penalizes out-of-distribution regions. This helps prevent overfitting to the limited training data and avoid generating invalid designs.



BRAID achieves this by optimizing a conservative reward model that incorporates uncertainty quantification terms.  It then uses this reward model to fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model, adding a KL-divergence penalty to ensure that generated designs remain within the valid design space. This "doubly conservative" approach ensures high-quality designs that outperform the best designs in the offline dataset.  The paper demonstrates BRAID's efficacy through empirical evaluations in diverse domains, including DNA/RNA sequences and images, showcasing its significant improvement over existing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### Offline RL for Design
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique opportunity for design optimization problems.  **Traditional RL methods rely on extensive online interactions**, often impractical in many design settings due to the high cost or time constraints associated with obtaining feedback. Offline RL, using pre-collected datasets, offers a promising alternative. In design, this translates to leveraging historical design data (simulations, experiments) to train an RL agent that can generate improved designs without needing new simulations or experiments for each iteration. However, **challenges arise in handling biases and limitations inherent in offline datasets**. These datasets might not comprehensively represent the entire design space or contain noisy/sparse reward signals, potentially misleading the learned policy. To tackle these issues, **conservative offline RL techniques** that place more emphasis on regions of known reliability, incorporate uncertainty estimations, and reduce extrapolation errors are crucial.  The use of generative models in conjunction with offline RL is also valuable, generating candidate designs that can then be evaluated and further refined by the RL agent. **Such hybrid approaches offer a powerful framework** for efficiently exploring a vast design space while mitigating risks associated with limited or unreliable offline data.

#### BRAID: A New Approach
BRAID presents a novel approach to AI-driven design problems by **bridging the gap between generative modeling and model-based optimization**.  Unlike previous methods which often assume readily available reward models, BRAID tackles the more realistic scenario of an offline setting with limited, static data. The approach cleverly uses **conservative fine-tuning** of pre-trained diffusion models, preventing over-optimization by penalizing designs outside the observed data distribution. This ensures that generated designs remain valid and high-quality, leveraging the power of reward models for extrapolation without risking the generation of unrealistic or invalid outputs.  **BRAID's doubly conservative strategy**, incorporating both reward and KL penalties, is theoretically grounded, providing a regret guarantee and empirically showing superior performance across diverse tasks like DNA/RNA sequence and image generation.

#### Conservative Tuning
Conservative tuning, in the context of AI model training, particularly diffusion models, emphasizes **mitigating the risks associated with over-optimization**.  Standard fine-tuning methods might exploit uncertainties in reward models, leading to poor generalization.  Conservative approaches, as explored in the paper, address this by **incorporating penalty terms** that discourage the model from venturing into data regions where the reward model's confidence is low or where the model might generate invalid designs. This strategy promotes generalization and avoids adversarial designs by **encouraging the model to remain within the well-understood regions of the data distribution.**  The effectiveness of conservative tuning depends crucially on the design of the penalty function, which needs to carefully balance exploration and exploitation. The paper's proposal of a doubly conservative approach that combines both reward model conservatism and KL regularization on the diffusion process is particularly interesting, as it suggests a more robust strategy that directly addresses concerns about model overfitting and out-of-distribution generalization.

#### Extrapolation Limits
The concept of 'Extrapolation Limits' in the context of AI-driven design is crucial.  **It highlights the inherent risk of relying solely on learned reward models, especially in offline settings**, where the model's understanding of the design space is limited to the provided data.  When an AI attempts to optimize beyond the bounds of this data (extrapolation), it may encounter regions of the design space where the reward model is inaccurate or undefined. This could lead to **over-optimization and the generation of designs that are not only suboptimal but also invalid**.  The success of an AI-driven design process hinges on carefully considering and mitigating these limits.  **Conservative approaches** that incorporate uncertainty quantification or penalization mechanisms outside the training data distribution are therefore vital for reliable extrapolation and to ensure that designs remain feasible within the true design space. **Theoretical guarantees** that bound the performance degradation due to extrapolation are highly desirable and necessary to ensure the trustworthiness of AI-driven design optimization.

#### Future Work: Open Set
The concept of "Future Work: Open Set" in the context of AI-driven design problems suggests a significant direction for future research.  The current methods often rely on closed-set assumptions, meaning that the model is trained only on data representing the known design space. This limitation restricts the model's ability to generate novel or unexpected designs, hindering creativity and potentially missing optimal solutions.  **Extending AI-driven design to the open-set setting, where the model encounters unseen designs and learns to classify and extrapolate appropriately, will be crucial.** This requires developing robust techniques that handle uncertainty, outlier detection, and generalization to novel design features effectively. **A key challenge lies in creating learning methods that allow the model to distinguish between truly novel designs and simply invalid designs**.  Robustness is crucial as the model must avoid being misled by outliers or invalid designs during open-set testing, maintaining its ability to extrapolate appropriately. A promising avenue is **combining generative models with mechanisms for uncertainty quantification, allowing for cautious exploration of uncharted design spaces**. Further research should explore how to incorporate human feedback effectively in an open-set setting to steer the model towards desired solutions, improving the model's ability to generalize and create truly innovative designs.
