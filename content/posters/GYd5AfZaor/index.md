### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Noisy labels are a pervasive problem in real-world regression tasks, hindering the accuracy and reliability of models.  Existing methods for handling noisy labels often struggle with continuous labels, which are common in regression problems.  There's also a lack of standardized benchmark datasets for evaluating these methods, making comparisons difficult. 

This paper introduces ConFrag, a novel approach that addresses these challenges. ConFrag transforms regression data into contrasting fragmentation pairs, enabling the training of distinctive representations for selecting clean samples.  The method uses a mixture of neighboring fragments to identify noisy labels and is evaluated on six new benchmark datasets. Experiments show that ConFrag significantly outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art baselines across various noise types, demonstrating robustness and improved accuracy.  A new metric, ERR, is also proposed to better evaluate the performance of methods on datasets with varying noise levels.

The data with label noise are grouped into six fragments (f ‚àà [1-6]) and formed into three contrastive pairs (f‚àà [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]). Contrastive fragment pairing transforms some of closed-set noise (whose ground truth is within the target label set) into open-set noise (whose ground truth is not within the label set). For example, in the [1,4] figure, label noise whose ground truth fragment is either 1 or 4 is closed-set noise, and the others are open-set noise. The t-SNE illustration shows that learned features of open-set noises tend to reside outside the feature clusters of the clean samples. (b) The open-set noise is less harmful with much lower errors (MRAE) in the downstream regression. (c) The contrastive pairing ([1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]) is more effective than using all-fragments together ([1-6]), resulting in much lower MRAE scores.

### In-depth insights


#### Noisy Label Reg
Noisy label regression tackles the challenges of training accurate models when the training data contains incorrect or unreliable labels.  This is a pervasive issue in real-world applications where data acquisition is costly or time-consuming, leading to imperfect annotations.  **Techniques for addressing noisy labels often involve either modifying the loss function to down-weight noisy samples or attempting to identify and remove noisy data points**.  Methods may leverage data augmentation to generate more robust representations or incorporate regularization to prevent overfitting to the incorrect labels. The choice of technique depends on factors such as the type of noise, its prevalence, and the complexity of the model. **Research in this area is actively exploring the use of deep learning and advanced statistical models to improve the robustness and accuracy of noisy label regression.** Furthermore, evaluating and selecting the most suitable approach for a given dataset remains a challenge requiring careful consideration of the noise characteristics and model limitations.  **Creating benchmark datasets to evaluate noisy label regression methods is vital to advance the field and allow for fair comparisons between different techniques.**

#### ConFrag Method
The ConFrag method, designed for noisy label regression, leverages the inherent property of continuous ordered correlations in real-world data.  It begins by dividing the data into **contrastive fragment pairs**, maximizing the distance between paired fragments in label space. This step is crucial, transforming some closed-set noise (noise within the target label range) into less harmful open-set noise.  The method trains **expert feature extractors** on these pairs, generating distinctive representations which are less susceptible to overfitting.  To further refine sample selection, ConFrag utilizes a **mixture model** incorporating neighboring fragments, leveraging neighborhood agreement to identify clean samples.  This multi-expert approach improves robustness and generalizability.  Finally, the method incorporates **neighborhood jittering** as a regularizer to avoid overfitting by expanding data coverage for each expert during training, resulting in improved model performance.

#### Benchmark Data
The effectiveness of any novel approach in noisy label regression heavily relies on the quality and diversity of benchmark datasets used for evaluation.  A robust benchmark should encompass diverse data domains, varying noise types and intensities, and ideally, real-world noisy labels reflecting the challenges faced in practical applications.  **Creating such a benchmark is crucial**, as the absence of a standardized, well-curated benchmark hinders fair comparison and limits the generalizability of findings.  **The selection of datasets should be guided by the characteristics** of the proposed method, ensuring that the datasets adequately challenge the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses. For instance, a method focusing on continuous labels would benefit from datasets with intrinsically ordered correlations between labels and features, while a method designed for image-based regression should include datasets containing image data with noisy labels.  **Careful analysis of existing datasets** is essential to identify and address potential biases or limitations before incorporating them into the benchmark. This includes checking for class imbalances, noise distribution patterns, and ensuring a representative range of sample complexities. Ultimately, a comprehensive benchmark ensures the rigorous evaluation of new methods, promoting advancement in the field by facilitating consistent and meaningful comparisons.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the scalability of the ConFrag framework** is crucial, potentially through exploring more efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures or alternative sample selection methods.  Investigating the impact of different fragmentation strategies and the optimal number of fragments (F) across diverse datasets would also be valuable.  **Developing a more robust and theoretically grounded method for neighborhood agreement** could enhance sample selection accuracy.  Further research could explore ConFrag's application to other regression tasks and potentially other machine learning problems beyond noisy label scenarios.  Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis incorporating more state-of-the-art noisy label regression techniques and a broader range of noise types would solidify the findings and advance the understanding of noisy label regression.

#### ConFrag Limits
The effectiveness of ConFrag hinges on several factors, creating potential limitations.  **The reliance on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) model introduces scalability challenges**, particularly concerning memory and computational resources, especially as the number of fragments increases.  This could restrict its applicability to datasets exceeding a certain size or complexity.  **The reliance on neighborhood agreement for clean sample selection might be sensitive to the density and distribution of the data**.  In sparsely populated regions of the feature space or with high levels of label noise, the algorithm's accuracy in identifying clean samples may be compromised.  Moreover, **the performance of ConFrag is affected by the hyperparameters**, such as the number of fragments and the jitter range.  Careful tuning is necessary to obtain optimal results, which can be computationally expensive. Finally, while ConFrag shows robustness to several types of noise, its performance might degrade with entirely different noise distributions or complex noise patterns not considered in the experiments.

Then, a graph is constructed where each fragment is a node, and the edge weight between nodes represents the distance between the closest samples of the fragments in the label space. Finally, the algorithm finds a perfect matching (a pairing of fragments) that maximizes the minimum edge weight, ensuring the selected pairs are maximally contrasting.

> üîº This table presents a comparison of the mean prediction depths achieved by different fragment pairing strategies in feature extractor learning tasks.  It compares the performance of using all fragments, contrastive fragment pairings, and alternative fragment pairings when the number of fragments (F) is set to 4. The mean prediction depth is a metric that indicates how early in the network layers a sample's class can be correctly predicted. Lower prediction depths generally indicate better generalization and less memorization.  The table shows the mean prediction depths for both datasets with no noise and with symmetric 40% noise added.
