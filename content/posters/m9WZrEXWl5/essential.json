The limitations of existing methods are evident in their failure to predict optimization speed accurately.  This makes it hard to devise efficient and adaptive algorithms. \nThis paper introduces the concept of *directional smoothness*, a measure of how much the gradient changes along specific directions. Using directional smoothness, the authors develop new suboptimality bounds for gradient descent (GD) that depend on the optimization path, providing tighter guarantees. They also show that classical step-size methods like the Polyak step-size implicitly adapt to directional smoothness, resulting in faster convergence than predicted by traditional theory.  The findings are supported by experiments demonstrating the improved convergence of adaptive step-sizes compared to standard methods.
