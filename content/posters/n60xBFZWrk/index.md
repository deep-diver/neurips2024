### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for supervised learning primarily focus on embedding data in hyperbolic space, while ignoring the representation of the models themselves. This creates challenges in visualizing model properties and understanding their behavior, especially for tree-based models such as decision trees. This paper aims to solve this limitation by proposing an effective and interpretable approach for embedding supervised models, particularly decision trees, into a hyperbolic space.

The paper's approach involves three key contributions: First, it establishes a connection between loss functions used in class probability estimation and hyperbolic distances. Second, it introduces "monotonic decision trees"‚Äîa novel type of supervised model‚Äîfor obtaining unambiguous embeddings of decision trees.  Third, it introduces a generalized version of the hyperbolic distance function that enhances visualization and improves numerical stability, particularly around the disk's edge. These contributions, together, provide a comprehensive method for representing and visualizing supervised models in hyperbolic geometry, advancing the interpretability of such models.

It bridges the gap between unsupervised and supervised learning by applying hyperbolic geometry to supervised models, introducing the new method of **monotonic decision trees**. This opens avenues for improved visualization, better understanding of model behavior, and enhanced model interpretability, especially for tree-based models.

> The figure shows a comparison between a standard decision tree and its monotonic version. The left panel illustrates that a simple embedding approach fails to accurately represent the structure of the decision tree. The right panel introduces monotonic decision trees (MDTs) as a solution, which provides a more accurate and unambiguous embedding by only considering the monotonically increasing path of node confidences.

### In-depth insights


#### Hyperbolic Embeddings
Hyperbolic embeddings offer a compelling alternative to Euclidean embeddings, particularly when dealing with hierarchical or tree-like structures.  **Their inherent ability to capture hierarchical relationships with lower distortion is a key advantage**, especially when modeling data exhibiting tree-like characteristics or possessing inherent hierarchies.  However, the non-Euclidean nature of hyperbolic space presents challenges, especially in terms of **computation and visualization**.  While methods for creating such embeddings exist, they often require careful consideration of computational efficiency and the potential for numerical instability near the boundary of the hyperbolic space.   **Effective visualizations are crucial** for interpreting the results and understanding the embedded structure.  Furthermore, the choice of the hyperbolic model (e.g., Poincar√© disk, hyperboloid) needs careful consideration, influencing both computational aspects and the embedding's geometrical properties.  Finally, **applications of hyperbolic embeddings are diverse**, ranging from natural language processing to graph representation and recommendation systems, highlighting its versatility and potential.

#### Decision Tree Encoding
Decision tree encoding in machine learning focuses on representing tree-structured models effectively within a chosen embedding space.  A core challenge is capturing both the **structural properties** (hierarchical relationships) and **numerical properties** (e.g., confidence scores, classification performance) of the tree.  Several methods exist, often relying on specific geometric spaces, such as hyperbolic geometry, to account for the tree's hierarchical nature and potentially reduce distortion when mapping nodes to vectors.  The choice of encoding influences both model interpretation and downstream tasks involving tree comparison or manipulation.  **Efficient encoding** is crucial for handling large trees, while preserving semantic meaning remains paramount.  Furthermore, the selection of an appropriate loss function plays a role in influencing the encoding process and its fidelity to the original tree's predictive capabilities.  **Visualizations** often accompany such encodings to facilitate understanding and comparison of different decision trees or ensembles.

#### Visualization Refinement
Visualization refinement in research papers often focuses on improving the clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness of visual representations of data or models.  **Effective visualization is crucial for conveying complex information concisely and facilitating understanding**.  This refinement process may involve exploring different visualization techniques, optimizing visual parameters (e.g., color schemes, scales, layouts), enhancing interactive elements for data exploration, or improving the integration of visualizations within the overall narrative of the paper.  **A thoughtful approach considers the target audience and the specific message being conveyed**. For instance, choosing between a 2D or 3D plot, or selecting appropriate chart types (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.) is driven by the nature of the data and the insights one wants to highlight.  **Furthermore, attention should be paid to potential limitations and biases that can be introduced by visual representations** and strategies to address them, such as providing clear labels and legends, appropriately scaling axes, and using effective annotations to guide interpretation.  Ultimately, successful visualization refinement results in figures and graphics that not only enhance the reader's comprehension but also actively strengthen the overall argument and impact of the research.

#### Tempered Integration
Tempered integration offers a **generalization of classical Riemann integration** by introducing a parameter, *t*, that modifies the addition operation within Riemann sums.  This seemingly minor change yields profound consequences, smoothly altering the properties of the integral while maintaining hyperbolicity.  **Crucially, it generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus**, providing a smooth transition between classical and non-classical integration.  This is particularly useful in contexts, like hyperbolic geometry, where standard integration proves problematic near boundaries; **tempered integration allows for improved control and numerical stability** in these critical regions, addressing the limitations of existing hyperbolic embedding techniques.  The *t*-parameter acts as a **tuning knob**, enabling a flexible adjustment of the integral's behavior to optimize visualization and encoding in applications involving hyperbolic spaces.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore **extending the t-calculus framework** to other distance metrics beyond Poincar√©, potentially enhancing the versatility and applicability of the proposed hyperbolic embeddings.  Investigating the **impact of different t-values on model performance and interpretability** would also be valuable, leading to better visualizations and insights.  Furthermore, exploring the **application of monotonic decision trees (MDTs) in various supervised learning tasks** would provide more comprehensive insights into the utility of this novel model. Finally, a **rigorous theoretical analysis comparing the performance of MDTs to traditional decision trees**, along with a deeper exploration of the connections between the t-self and other hyperbolic models are warranted.
