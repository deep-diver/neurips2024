Common examples of datasets that are well-represented by data streams include database logs generated from e-commerce transactions, Internet of Things sensors, scientific observations, social network traffic, or stock markets. To capture these applications, the one-pass streaming model defines an underlying dataset that evolves over time through a number of sequential updates that are discarded irrevocably after processing, and the goal is to compute or approximate some fixed function of the dataset while using space sublinear in both the length $m$ of the data stream and the dimension $n$ of the dataset.

In other words, the dataset is oblivious to any algorithmic design choices, such as instantiations of internal random variables. This is vital for many streaming algorithms, which crucially leverage randomness to achieve meaningful guarantees in sublinear space.

Moreover, the total number of such items in the level set can be estimated accurately by rescaling the number of the heavy-hitters in the subsampled universe inversely by the sampling probability.

On the other hand, if the frequency vector is not sparse, then a query to SPARSERECOVER could be erroneous. Hence, our algorithm thus utilizes robust LZEROEST to detect whether the underlying frequency vector is dense or sparse. Similar to [BEO22], the intuition is that due to the sparse case always succeeding, the adversary can only induce failure if the vector is dense, which in turn decreases the flip number. However, because we also accurately track the heavy-hitters, then the adversary must spread the updates across a multiple number of coordinates, resulting in a larger number of updates necessary to double the residual vector. Since the number of updates is larger, then the filp number is smaller, and so our algorithm can use less space. Unfortunately, even though the residual vector may not double in its $p$ -th moment, the $p$ -th moment of entire frequency vector $f$ may change drastically. This is a nuance for the analysis because our error guarantee can no longer be relative to the $\\|f\\|_{p}^{p}$ .
