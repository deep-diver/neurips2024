Each line represents a different user, and the x-axis shows the magnitude of the perturbation applied during a random attack. The y-axis represents the NDCG@20 score, indicating the effectiveness of the recommender system's ranking under the attack.  The figure demonstrates that for each user there's an optimal perturbation magnitude that maximizes NDCG@20, which then decreases as the perturbation level increases further.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "k8AYft5ED1/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) PamaCF brings real preference items closer; (b) PamaCF achieves larger magnitudes.", "description": "This figure contains two subfigures. Subfigure (a) shows a t-SNE visualization of embeddings from APR and PamaCF. The visualization shows that PamaCF brings real preference items closer together while pushing the target item further away from the real preference items, which supports the effectiveness of PamaCF in improving recommendation accuracy and robustness. Subfigure (b) compares the maximum perturbation magnitudes used by APR and PamaCF and shows the distribution of perturbation magnitudes used by PamaCF across all users. The results indicate that PamaCF achieves higher maximum perturbation magnitudes and more dynamic perturbation magnitudes across users compared to APR.", "section": "5.3 Augmentation Analysis (RQ2)"}, {"figure_path": "k8AYft5ED1/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Left: Analysis of Hyper-Parameters p; Right: Analysis of Hyper-Parameters \u03bb.", "description": "This figure analyzes the impact of hyperparameters (p and \u03bb) on the performance and robustness of PamaCF.  The left side shows how varying the uniform perturbation magnitude (p) affects NDCG@20 and T-NDCG@50 across different attack types (clean, random, bandwagon, DP, Rev) with the base MF model on clean data as a reference. The right side shows similar results but this time varying the adversarial training weight (\u03bb).  The results illustrate the optimal ranges for p and \u03bb to balance performance and robustness.", "section": "5.4 Hyper-Parameters Analysis (RQ3)"}, {"figure_path": "k8AYft5ED1/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Robustness against popular items promotion.", "description": "This figure displays the robustness of different methods against attacks targeting popular items.  It shows the T-HR@50 and T-NDCG@50 scores for various attack types (Random, Bandwagon, DP, Rev) on the Gowalla dataset.  The baseline is the performance of the recommendation model without any defense mechanism.  The \"Best Baselines\" represent the best-performing defense method other than PamaCF.  PamaCF consistently demonstrates superior defense capabilities against these attacks, maintaining significantly lower success ratios for manipulating the ranking of popular items.", "section": "5.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)"}]
