### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Creating realistic 3D scene representations from a limited number of images (few-shot novel view synthesis) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods often struggle with sparse data, leading to inaccurate or incomplete scene reconstructions.  The challenge is further amplified when dealing with unstructured scene representations, as commonly seen in Gaussian Splatting methods.  These methods tend to overfit to available data resulting in poor rendering performance for previously unseen viewpoints. 

This paper introduces FewViewGS, a novel approach that overcomes these limitations. FewViewGS uses a multi-stage training strategy with matching-based consistency constraints imposed on novel views.  This means the model learns to render novel views that are coherent with the existing views by leveraging geometric and semantic information.  In addition, FewViewGS introduces a locality preserving regularization for 3D Gaussians, improving the accuracy and reducing artifacts in the rendered novel views. Experiments demonstrate that FewViewGS achieves competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in low-data scenarios.

> This figure illustrates the FewViewGS pipeline, a multi-stage training approach for novel view synthesis. It shows three stages: pre-training (using only known views), intermediate (introducing correspondence-driven losses for novel views sampled between known views), and tuning (fine-tuning on known views). The pre-training and tuning stages focus on optimizing Gaussians using color re-rendering loss and regularization. The intermediate stage leverages correspondences between known views to project and render virtual views, using color, geometry, and semantic losses to enforce consistency between known and novel views.

### In-depth insights


#### Few-Shot View Synth
Few-shot view synthesis tackles the challenge of reconstructing 3D scenes and generating novel views from limited input images.  This is a significant departure from traditional methods that require extensive datasets.  The core difficulty lies in effectively learning a robust 3D representation from sparse data, avoiding overfitting and producing high-quality novel views.  **Successful approaches often incorporate techniques such as multi-stage training, regularization strategies (e.g., depth or semantic consistency losses), and clever data augmentation schemes**.  The trade-off between rendering quality, computational efficiency, and the number of training views remains a key area of active research, with ongoing efforts to push the boundaries of what's achievable in low-data regimes.  **Prior work demonstrates that leveraging multi-view geometry and exploiting image correspondences can significantly improve results**, especially in dealing with regions not observed directly in the training images.  Future work will likely explore improved 3D representations, more sophisticated regularization methods, and ways to leverage other forms of weak supervision, such as semantic labels or depth cues.

#### Multi-Stage Training
The proposed multi-stage training strategy is a key innovation, addressing the challenges of few-shot novel view synthesis.  **The initial pre-training stage** leverages only the available training views to establish a foundational scene representation, preventing overfitting to sparse data.  This is followed by an **intermediate stage** focused on novel view consistency.  Here,  **geometric constraints**, derived from image matching, are used to supervise the synthesis of novel views, ensuring coherence with the known views.  Finally, a **tuning stage** refines the model with further optimization using only the initial known views, balancing knowledge transfer and preventing overfitting to novel views. This phased approach facilitates seamless knowledge propagation, enabling the model to generate high-quality novel views with limited training data. The strategy's effectiveness is clearly demonstrated by the experimental results, showcasing its superior performance compared to other single-stage training methods.

#### Gaussian Splatting
Gaussian splatting is a novel technique in 3D scene representation that leverages the efficiency and accuracy of Gaussian distributions.  Instead of using complex neural networks, it represents a scene using a collection of 3D Gaussians, each with properties like position, covariance, opacity, and color.  This explicit representation offers **significant advantages** in terms of rendering speed and training efficiency, making it particularly well-suited for real-time applications and scenarios with limited computational resources.  **However, the method's performance can degrade significantly when the input data is sparse**, which limits its applicability to few-shot novel view synthesis tasks.  Researchers are actively exploring methods to mitigate this limitation, including multi-stage training and the incorporation of consistency constraints to improve rendering quality under data scarcity.  The **unstructured nature of the Gaussian splatting representation** also presents challenges for effective regularization and artifact removal.  Addressing these challenges will be crucial to further improve the robustness and versatility of Gaussian splatting for various 3D computer graphics applications.

#### Novel View Matching
Novel view matching, in the context of 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, is a crucial technique to improve the accuracy and consistency of novel view synthesis. It addresses the challenge of generating realistic images from viewpoints not present in the training data by establishing correspondences between known views and newly synthesized views.  **The core idea is to leverage existing image pairs to guide the creation of intermediate views, enforcing consistency constraints on color, geometry, and even semantic information.** This approach differs significantly from methods relying on depth estimation or diffusion models, which often struggle with sparse input. **By employing feature matching techniques, the method robustly warps corresponding pixels from known views onto randomly sampled novel viewpoints**. This approach mitigates issues stemming from inaccuracies in depth estimation or the limitations of diffusion models. **This warping process, combined with loss functions that penalize inconsistencies, enforces coherence, resulting in visually plausible novel views.** The success of novel view matching hinges on the effectiveness of the feature matching algorithm and the robustness of the warping process to handle any noise or inaccuracies in the input data.

#### Locality Regularization
Locality regularization, in the context of 3D Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis, addresses the issue of rendering artifacts arising from the sparsity of input images.  **Standard photometric losses fail to enforce smoothness in local color variations**, particularly problematic with limited data. This technique works by penalizing deviations of a Gaussian's color from the colors of its nearest neighbors in 3D space.  The penalty is weighted by a distance function, decreasing influence as spatial distance grows. This **preserves local color structure**, effectively removing artifacts by ensuring smooth transitions between regions of the scene, especially beneficial in sparse scenarios where overfitting is a major concern. The method enhances the visual quality of novel views by preventing discontinuities and ensuring a more coherent rendering, ultimately improving the overall realism of the synthesized images.
