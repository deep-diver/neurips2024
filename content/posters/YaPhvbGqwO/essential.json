However, real-world scenarios often involve partial observability, where agents only have access to incomplete information about the environment's state. This limitation significantly hinders the ability of reinforcement learning agents to learn effective policies and achieve optimal performance. Existing methods for handling partial observability often require the explicit knowledge of the underlying state space or involve computationally expensive approaches. This paper addresses the problem by presenting a novel approach. \nThis research proposes the \u03bb-discrepancy, a metric to quantify the degree of partial observability in an environment.  The key idea is comparing value function estimates computed using two different temporal difference (TD) learning methods: TD(\u03bb=0) and TD(\u03bb=1). TD(0) implicitly assumes a Markovian environment, while TD(1) does not.  A significant difference between the two estimates suggests non-Markovianity and partial observability.  The paper demonstrates how minimizing this discrepancy can improve the performance of reinforcement learning agents, enabling them to handle partially observable environments more effectively.  Furthermore, the research showcases that this approach is scalable to complex environments where traditional methods fail.  This work provides both a valuable theoretical contribution and a practical algorithm for researchers to leverage in their work.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "YaPhvbGqwO/podcast.wav"}
