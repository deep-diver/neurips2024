### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Machine learning models often struggle with generalization, particularly when the training data exhibits simplicity bias‚Äîa tendency to learn simple, low-complexity solutions that don't generalize well to unseen data. Existing approaches primarily focus on improving model architecture or optimization techniques. However, this research explores a different avenue: manipulating the training data distribution.  The core problem is that models tend to learn easily identifiable features first and might miss out on more subtle and useful features that are crucial for generalization. 

This paper introduces a novel method called USEFUL (UpSample Early For Uniform Learning). USEFUL first trains the model for a few epochs and then identifies examples containing features learned early in training, essentially the easily identifiable ones. It upsamples the remaining examples (those containing the less easily identifiable, subtle features) once and restarts training. This process improves the uniform learning of features, leading to more robust and generalized models. Through extensive experiments, USEFUL consistently improves the performance of various optimization algorithms across multiple datasets and model architectures, often achieving state-of-the-art results.

> This figure shows example images from the CIFAR-10 dataset that are classified as either slow-learnable or fast-learnable by the USEFUL method.  Slow-learnable examples are visually ambiguous, often partially obscured or with a cluttered background. Fast-learnable examples are easily identifiable and clearly represent their class.





![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/yySpldUsU2/tables_32_1.jpg)

> This table presents the sharpness of the solutions obtained by training ResNet18 on CIFAR10 using three different optimization methods: SGD, SGD+USEFUL, and SAM. Sharpness is measured using two metrics: the maximum Hessian eigenvalue (Œªmax) and the bulk spectrum (Œªmax/15). Lower values for both metrics generally indicate a flatter minimum, which is associated with better generalization performance.





### In-depth insights


#### Simplicity Bias Fix
The concept of a 'Simplicity Bias Fix' in machine learning is crucial because the inherent tendency of optimization algorithms to converge towards simpler solutions (minimum norm) can hinder generalization performance.  A 'Simplicity Bias Fix' aims to mitigate this bias, pushing the optimization landscape toward solutions that are not only accurate on the training data but also generalize well to unseen data.  **This often involves encouraging the model to learn a more diverse set of features**, rather than relying on a few easily learned, yet potentially less informative ones. Methods for achieving this might involve architectural modifications promoting diversity, novel loss functions penalizing simplicity, or data augmentation strategies specifically designed to surface under-represented features.  **The effectiveness of a 'Simplicity Bias Fix' is evaluated by measuring the generalization gap on held-out datasets**; a successful fix would result in a smaller gap.  The ultimate goal is to enhance robustness and overall performance by ensuring the learned model captures the underlying data structure and not just superficial correlations, leading to broader applicability and real-world impact.

#### SAM's Feature Learning
The heading 'SAM's Feature Learning' suggests an investigation into how the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithm impacts the learning process of a model, specifically focusing on feature extraction and representation.  A thoughtful analysis would delve into whether SAM learns features differently compared to standard gradient descent methods. Key aspects to consider include **the speed at which various features are learned**, exploring if SAM exhibits a more uniform learning rate across all features, potentially mitigating the well-known "simplicity bias" of gradient descent. The analysis should also investigate **how SAM's feature learning relates to generalization performance**. Does a more uniform learning of features correlate with improved generalization on both seen and unseen data? Finally, the investigation should explore the **theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence** supporting the claims related to SAM's feature learning, including a comparison with other optimization techniques.  **Understanding the theoretical properties** of SAM and how they influence its feature learning behavior is crucial to uncovering valuable insights.

#### USEFUL Method
The USEFUL method, designed to mitigate simplicity bias and enhance in-distribution generalization, is a three-step process.  First, it **clusters examples based on early network outputs**, identifying those with easily learned features.  Second, it **upsamples the remaining (less easily learned) examples**, accelerating their learning. This addresses the uneven feature learning typical of standard gradient descent, a key cause of simplicity bias. Finally, it restarts training on this modified distribution.  **USEFUL's theoretical underpinnings** lie in a rigorous analysis of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), showcasing how it learns features more uniformly than standard gradient descent.  This motivated the design of USEFUL, aiming to mimic SAM's beneficial behavior without its computational overhead. **Empirical results** demonstrate that USEFUL improves generalization performance across various datasets and model architectures, often achieving state-of-the-art results when combined with SAM and data augmentation techniques.  The method's relative simplicity and broad applicability are significant strengths.

#### Experimental Results
The Experimental Results section of a research paper is crucial for validating the claims made in the introduction and theoretical analysis.  A strong Experimental Results section will present the findings in a clear, concise manner, using appropriate visualizations such as graphs and tables to showcase the data.  **It's essential to include a detailed description of the experimental setup, including the datasets used, the evaluation metrics, and the hyperparameters chosen.**  Any limitations or potential biases in the experimental design should be transparently acknowledged.  The results should be presented in a way that readily demonstrates whether the hypotheses were supported or refuted.  **Statistical significance should be clearly reported**, using techniques such as p-values or confidence intervals, to ascertain the reliability of the results.  For reproducibility, **it's critical to provide sufficient information for other researchers to replicate the experiments**, including details about the computational resources employed.  **A thoughtful discussion of the results is paramount**, explaining any unexpected findings, analyzing potential sources of error, and comparing the results with prior research.  Overall, the Experimental Results section should not just present raw data, but provide a well-supported, critical analysis of the experimental findings to strengthen the paper's conclusions.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore extending the proposed method, USEFUL, to a broader range of models and datasets.  **Investigating its effectiveness on more complex architectures** beyond the two-layer CNN and ResNet models evaluated in the paper would be valuable.  Additionally, **testing its robustness against different types of noise and data corruption** (beyond the label noise briefly explored) would strengthen the findings.  A theoretical analysis of USEFUL's interaction with various optimization algorithms, including those beyond SGD and SAM, could offer significant insights into its underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, **a deeper investigation into the interplay between simplicity bias and out-of-distribution generalization**, potentially leading to novel strategies for improving both aspects, warrants further exploration. Finally, **exploring applications in other domains**, such as natural language processing or time-series analysis, could reveal the generalizability of the method and uncover previously unknown benefits.

The models are ResNet18 on CIFAR10, STL10, and TinyImageNet and ResNet34 on CIFAR100.  The optimization methods include SGD, SGD with USEFUL, SAM, SAM with USEFUL, SAM with TrivialAugment, and SAM with USEFUL and TrivialAugment.  The bars show the test error, and the numbers below indicate the relative training time compared to SGD.

The results demonstrate that USEFUL consistently improves the performance of both SGD and SAM across all architectures tested.  Additionally, the combination of SAM with TA further enhances the performance, and adding USEFUL to this combination yields the best results in most cases. The 'Time to Train w.r.t. SGD' indicates the relative training time of each method compared to SGD.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/yySpldUsU2/figures_9_1.jpg)

> This figure compares the performance of USEFUL against random upsampling when training ResNet18 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.  It shows that USEFUL significantly improves the test classification error compared to both standard training (Orig) and random upsampling (Rand) for both SGD and SAM optimizers.  The results highlight the effectiveness of USEFUL in improving generalization by carefully modifying the data distribution, rather than simply increasing the amount of data through random sampling.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/yySpldUsU2/figures_30_1.jpg)

> This figure illustrates the workflow of the USEFUL algorithm.  First, a model is trained on the original dataset for a small number of epochs. Then, USEFUL performs k-means clustering on the model's output for each class to separate examples into two clusters: one with a higher average loss (representing examples containing slow-learnable features), and one with a lower average loss (examples with fast-learnable features).  The algorithm then upsamples the cluster with the higher average loss and trains the model again from scratch on this modified dataset. The result is a model that learns features more uniformly.

> This figure compares the learning speed of fast-learnable and slow-learnable features for both GD and SAM. The y-axis represents the difference between the alignment of model weights with fast-learnable and slow-learnable features, while the x-axis represents the training iteration. The plot shows that SAM learns both types of features at a more uniform speed compared to GD.  The significant gap between the two curves in the early stages reflects the simplicity bias of GD, as it learns fast-learnable features much more quickly than slow-learnable ones. In contrast, SAM exhibits a more balanced learning rate for both feature types.

> This figure shows the test classification errors of a 3-layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using different optimization methods: SGD, SGD with USEFUL, SAM, SAM with USEFUL, SAM with TrivialAugment (TA), and SAM with USEFUL and TA.  The x-axis represents the training time relative to the time taken by SGD. The y-axis shows the test error rate (%). The bars show the mean test error for each method and the ticks on top represent the standard deviation across multiple runs. The figure demonstrates that incorporating USEFUL consistently improves the performance of both SGD and SAM, achieving lower test error rates compared to the baselines.  The combination of SAM and TA also leads to improved performance.  The best performance is obtained by combining SAM, USEFUL and TA.

> This figure compares the L1 norm of models trained using three different methods: SGD, SAM, and SGD+USEFUL.  Lower L1 norms generally indicate sparser solutions and better implicit regularization, leading to improved generalization.  The results show that SAM already achieves a lower L1 norm than SGD, and that the proposed USEFUL method further reduces the L1 norm when used in conjunction with SGD.

> This figure shows the forgetting scores for training ResNet18 on CIFAR10.  The forgetting score is a metric indicating how quickly examples are learned during training. A lower forgetting score implies that the example is learned quickly and retained effectively by the model. The figure compares the forgetting scores of three different training methods: standard SGD, SGD with USEFUL, and SAM.  It shows that both SGD+USEFUL and SAM have fewer examples with high forgetting scores (meaning that the model struggles to learn and retain them effectively) than standard SGD.  This demonstrates that USEFUL, by modifying the training data distribution, leads to similar training dynamics as SAM which improves model generalization, specifically in learning examples more uniformly in training.

The results show that USEFUL consistently improves the performance of both SGD and SAM, highlighting its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. The figure also demonstrates the effectiveness of USEFUL in fine-tuning pre-trained models, suggesting its applicability to transfer learning.

It shows how the model's performance changes depending on three factors: batch size, learning rate, and upsampling factor.  The results reveal the impact of these hyperparameters on the effectiveness of the USEFUL method and helps determine optimal values for each.

> This figure shows the training error trajectories for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.  The left panel shows the training error over epochs for CIFAR10, highlighting the point where the decrease in training error starts to slow (marked with a red dotted line).  This point is selected as the optimal epoch to apply USEFUL. The right panel visually represents the same information but for CIFAR100.  The red dotted line again indicates the suggested epoch for applying the USEFUL technique.  The figure visually supports the claim that choosing an appropriate separating epoch improves model accuracy.

> This table presents a comparison of the average forgetting score, first learned iteration, and iteration learned for two clusters of examples in CIFAR-10: fast-learnable and slow-learnable. The forgetting score measures the frequency with which an example is misclassified after being correctly classified. The first learned iteration is the epoch when a model predicts the example correctly for the first time. Iteration learned is the epoch after which the model correctly predicts the example consistently.
