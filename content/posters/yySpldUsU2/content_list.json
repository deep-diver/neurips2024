In this work, we approach this question for the first time by comparing the inductive bias of gradient descent (GD) with that of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). By studying a two-layer CNN, we rigorously prove that SAM learns different features more uniformly, particularly in early epochs. That is, SAM is less susceptible to simplicity bias compared to GD. We also show that examples containing features that are learned early are separable from the rest based on the model\u2019s output. Based on this observation, we propose a method that (i) clusters examples based on the network output early in training, (ii) identifies a cluster of examples with similar network output, and (iii) upsamples the rest of examples only once to alleviate the simplicity bias.

Over the last decade, there has been a large body of efforts concerned with improving learning from a given training dataset by designing more effective optimization methods [22, 38, 76] or neural networks with improved structures [47, 56, 82] or higher-capacity [49, 51]. More recently, improving the quality of the training data has emerged as a popular avenue to improve generalization performance. Interestingly, higher-quality data can further improve the performance when larger models and better optimization methods are unable to do so [23, 27]. Recent efforts to improve the data quality have mainly focused on filtering irrelevant, noisy, or harmful examples [23, 45, 66]. Nevertheless, it remains an open question if one can change the distribution of a clean training data to further improve the in-distribution generalization performance of models trained on it.

To do so, we rely on recent results in non-convex optimization, showing the superior generalization performance of sharpnessaware-minimization (SAM) [22] over (stochastic) gradient descent (GD). SAM finds flatter local minima by simultaneously minimizing the loss value and loss sharpness. In doing so, it outperforms (S)GD and obtains state-of-the-art performance, at the expense of doubling the training time [20, 81]. Our key idea is that if one can change the training data distribution such that learning shares similar properties to that of training with SAM, then the new distribution can drive (S)GD and even SAM toward finding more generalizable solutions.

Our method, UpSample Early For Uniform Learning (USEFUL), effectively alleviates the simplicity bias and consequently improves the generalization performance. Intuitively, learning features in a more uniform speed prevents the model to overfit underrepresented but useful features that otherwise are learned in late training stages. When the model overfits an example, it cannot learn its features in a generalizable manner. This harms the generalization performance on the original data distribution.

More recently, SAM is shown to also benefit out-of-distribution (OOD). In particular, [65] suggested that SAM promotes diverse feature learning by empirically studying a simplified version of SAM which only perturbs the last layer. They showed that SAM upscales the last layer\u2019s weights to induce feature diversity, which beneftis OOD. In contrast, we rigorously analyze a 2-layer non-linear CNN and prove that SAM learns (the same set of) features at a more uniform speed, which beneftis the in-distribution (ID) settings. Our results reveal an orthogonal effect of SAM that beneftis the ID generalization by reducing the simplicity bias, and provides a complementary view to prior works explaining superior ID generalization performance of SAM.

(S)GD has an inductive bias towards learning simpler solutions with minimum norm [25].

SB of SGD has been long conjectured to be the reason for the superior in-distribution generalization performance of overparameterized models, by providing capacity control or implicit regularization [26, 52, 55, 63]. On the other hand, in the OOD setting, simplicity bias is known to contribute to shortcut learning by causing models to exclusively rely on the simplest spurious feature and remain invariant to the complex but more predictive features [63, 67, 75]. Prior works on mitigating simplicity bias have been shown effective in the OOD settings [67, 68]. In contrast, our work shows, for the first time, that reducing the simplicity bias also beneftis the ID settings. By studying the mechanism of feature learning in a two-layer nonlinear CNN, we prove that SAM is less susceptible to simplicity bias than GD, in particular early in training, which contributes to its superior performance.

Intuitively, Theorem 3.5 implies that by descending over a flatter trajectory, SAM learns slow-learnable features relatively earlier in training, compared to GD. While the largest difference between feature learning of SAM and (S)GD is attributed to early training dynamics (due to the simplicity bias of (S)GD and its largest contribution early in training), SAM learns features at a more uniform speed during the entire training. This effect is, however, difficult to theoretically characterize exactly. Therefore, learning features at a more uniform speed via SAM help yield flatter minima with better generalization performance. We note that while SAM learns fast-learnable and slow-learnable features at a more uniform speed, it still suffers from simplicity bias and learns fast-learnable features earlier (although less so than GD) as evidenced in our Theorem 3.3.
