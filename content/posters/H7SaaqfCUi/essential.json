Conventional methods struggle with the unbounded nature of the infinitesimal generator (IG), which describes the system's dynamics.  Accurately learning the IG is critical for understanding the system's behavior and predicting its future states. Existing approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality and produce unreliable spectral estimations.\nThis paper proposes a new learning framework based on the energy functional of the stochastic process.  It uses a reduced-rank estimator in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) to estimate the IG's spectrum from a single trajectory. The method incorporates physical priors and provides learning bounds that are independent of the state space dimension, ensuring accurate and reliable spectral estimation.  This significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of learning IGs from limited data, addressing limitations of current methods.", "affiliation": "CSML, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "H7SaaqfCUi/podcast.wav"}
