### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is crucial for various applications but faces challenges like long-range dependencies and frequency-oriented dynamics.  Existing Fourier-based methods, while using Fourier transforms, often fail to accurately interpret frequency information and address issues like inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series lengths due to insufficient time-frequency considerations. This limits their forecasting accuracy. 

This paper introduces Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM), a novel method that tackles these limitations. FBM cleverly mixes the time and frequency domains by embedding the discrete Fourier transform with basis functions, leading to a more precise interpretation of frequency coefficients and a better understanding of the time-frequency relationship.  This improvement allows for "plug-and-play" integration with various neural networks, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of LTSF. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that FBM consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

> This figure compares existing Fourier-based methods with the proposed Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method.  Existing methods primarily operate in the frequency domain, transforming time series data and then applying a mapping network that focuses on frequency features. This often leads to issues like inconsistent starting cycles and series length problems, as highlighted in the figure.  In contrast, FBM operates in both the time and frequency domains.  It uses Fourier basis expansion, which is a key difference; FBM embeds the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with basis functions before applying a mapping network. This allows FBM to extract explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics and address the limitations of existing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### Basis Function View
The 'Basis Function View' offers a novel perspective on the Fourier Transform (FT) in time series forecasting.  Instead of viewing FT solely as a frequency domain transformation, this viewpoint reframes the real and imaginary components of FT coefficients as **coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions**. This interpretation reveals a deeper connection between time and frequency domains, highlighting the crucial role of basis functions in interpreting frequency information accurately. This perspective addresses limitations of prior FT-based methods, which fail to fully leverage the temporal dynamics inherently linked to frequency coefficients. **The authors argue that the explicit consideration of basis functions leads to more robust and interpretable models**, capable of handling inconsistencies related to series length and starting cycles, which are significant challenges in long-term forecasting.

#### FBM Method
The core of the proposed approach lies in the **Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM)** method.  FBM ingeniously tackles the limitations of existing Fourier-based time series forecasting methods by explicitly incorporating basis functions into the Fourier transform. This crucial step allows for a more precise interpretation of frequency coefficients and a more nuanced understanding of the time-frequency relationship.  **FBM's simultaneous operation in both the time and frequency domains** is a key differentiator, enabling the extraction of explicit time-frequency features.  This innovative approach overcomes the issues of inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series lengths, which plague many prior methods.  Importantly, FBM's modular design allows for seamless integration with various neural network architectures, enhancing their performance in long-term time series forecasting tasks.  The **plug-and-play nature of FBM** makes it a versatile tool applicable to a wide range of networks, making it a significant advancement in the field.

#### Time-Freq Features
The concept of 'Time-Freq Features' represents a powerful paradigm shift in time series analysis, particularly for long-term forecasting.  By integrating temporal and frequency-domain information, these features **capture the intricate interplay between the cyclical patterns and their evolution over time**.  This holistic approach surpasses the limitations of traditional methods that primarily focus on either time or frequency alone.  **The explicit consideration of time-dependent basis functions is crucial** for accurately interpreting frequency coefficients, addressing issues like inconsistent starting cycles and series length problems.  These features **facilitate the mapping of complex time-frequency relationships**, enabling more precise and interpretable forecasting models.  Therefore, the effectiveness of Time-Freq Features lies in their capacity to improve models' ability to learn from both time-dependent and frequency-independent information, ultimately leading to more accurate and robust long-term predictions.

#### LTSF Enhancements
The provided text focuses on enhancing long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) by revisiting the Fourier Transform (FT) from a basis function perspective.  The core argument is that existing FT-based methods neglect the underlying basis functions, leading to inconsistencies in starting cycles and series lengths.  **The proposed Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method directly addresses this by integrating time and frequency domain features via Fourier basis expansion.** This allows for more precise interpretation of frequency coefficients and a better understanding of time-frequency relationships.  **FBM's modular design enables seamless integration with diverse neural network architectures**, enhancing performance across various models and datasets.  The authors demonstrate the method's efficacy by incorporating FBM into linear, multilayer perceptron-based, transformer-based, and existing Fourier-based networks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.  **The key contribution lies in FBM's ability to extract explicit and interpretable time-frequency features**, overcoming limitations of prior approaches and paving the way for improved LTSF accuracy.

#### Future Works
Future research directions stemming from this Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method for long-term time series forecasting could involve several key areas.  **Extending FBM to handle multivariate time series** presents a significant challenge and opportunity, as real-world datasets often contain multiple interconnected variables.  Investigating **more sophisticated deep learning architectures** beyond simple linear and MLP networks within the FBM framework could unlock further performance gains.  A thorough exploration of **the optimal choice and design of basis functions** beyond sine and cosine is needed, potentially incorporating wavelet transforms or other suitable orthogonal basis sets tailored to specific data characteristics.  **A comprehensive evaluation across a broader range of datasets** is warranted to ascertain FBM's generalizability and robustness to varying data distributions and noise levels.  Finally, **developing a more theoretical understanding of FBM's ability to capture time-frequency relationships** and its connections to other established time series methods would strengthen its foundation and guide further development.
