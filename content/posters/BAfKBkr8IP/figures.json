Existing methods primarily operate in the frequency domain, transforming time series data and then applying a mapping network that focuses on frequency features. This often leads to issues like inconsistent starting cycles and series length problems, as highlighted in the figure.  In contrast, FBM operates in both the time and frequency domains.  It uses Fourier basis expansion, which is a key difference; FBM embeds the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with basis functions before applying a mapping network. This allows FBM to extract explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics and address the limitations of existing methods.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "BAfKBkr8IP/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of Existing Fourier-based Methods with Our Approach Fourier basis mapping.
