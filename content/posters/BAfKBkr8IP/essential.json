Existing Fourier-based methods, while using Fourier transforms, often fail to accurately interpret frequency information and address issues like inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series lengths due to insufficient time-frequency considerations. This limits their forecasting accuracy. \nThis paper introduces Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM), a novel method that tackles these limitations. FBM cleverly mixes the time and frequency domains by embedding the discrete Fourier transform with basis functions, leading to a more precise interpretation of frequency coefficients and a better understanding of the time-frequency relationship.  This improvement allows for \"plug-and-play\" integration with various neural networks, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of LTSF. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that FBM consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Macquarie University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "BAfKBkr8IP/podcast.wav"}
