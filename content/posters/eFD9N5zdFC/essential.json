Many CFR variants are unsuitable for Monte Carlo settings, limiting their application to real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, finding an equilibrium in incomplete information games is significantly more challenging than in complete information games, due to the inability to directly use subgame payoffs in backward induction.\nThis paper introduces MCCFVFP, a new algorithm that addresses these limitations. By cleverly combining CFR's counterfactual value calculations with the efficiency of Fictitious Play's best response strategy, MCCFVFP achieves convergence speeds 20-50% faster than state-of-the-art MCCFR variants in poker and other test games.  **The algorithm is particularly effective in games with many dominated strategies, a common characteristic of large-scale games.**  This improvement is significant because it enhances the ability to train and deploy game AI in more realistic and complex situations.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "eFD9N5zdFC/podcast.wav"}
