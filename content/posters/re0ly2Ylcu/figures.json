Each parameter is shown on a separate gradient bar, illustrating how different values of each parameter correspond to different decision-making tendencies (risk-averse, risk-neutral, risk-seeking; underweighting, no distortion, overweighting; more sensitive to loss, neutral, more sensitive to gain).", "section": "4 Framework and Design"}, {"figure_path": "re0ly2Ylcu/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Framework and evaluation illustration", "description": "This figure illustrates the framework used to evaluate LLMs' decision-making behavior.  It shows a step-by-step process, starting with experimentation using multiple-choice lottery games to elicit preferences from the LLMs.  These preferences are then analyzed using the TCN model to estimate risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion.  The framework also incorporates the embedding of socio-demographic features to explore how these factors influence LLM decision-making. The process culminates in a behavior analysis and assessment of the LLM's capability to understand and respond to those features.", "section": "4 Framework and Design"}, {"figure_path": "re0ly2Ylcu/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of context-free decision-making", "description": "This figure shows the comparison of the three LLMs' decision-making behavior under uncertainty in a context-free setting.
