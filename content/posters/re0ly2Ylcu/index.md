### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision support systems, raising concerns about their behavior aligning with human norms and ethical expectations.  This paper addresses this critical gap by investigating whether LLMs' decision-making processes exhibit biases similar to those observed in humans.  Existing research on LLM rationality and social behavior is limited and lacks a comprehensive framework to assess internal decision-making tendencies.

The paper proposes a novel framework grounded in behavioral economics theories to evaluate LLM decision-making behaviors across three dimensions: risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion. It uses a multiple-choice-list experiment to evaluate three commercial LLMs (ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro) in context-free settings and with embedded socio-demographic features.  The results show that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans but with significant variations and biases influenced by demographic factors.  This work underscores the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and potential biases when deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios.

> This figure visually represents the three key parameters of the TCN model used in the paper to evaluate LLMs' decision-making behavior under uncertainty.  The parameters are: œÉ (Risk Preference), Œ± (Probability Weighting), and Œª (Loss Aversion). Each parameter is shown on a separate gradient bar, illustrating how different values of each parameter correspond to different decision-making tendencies (risk-averse, risk-neutral, risk-seeking; underweighting, no distortion, overweighting; more sensitive to loss, neutral, more sensitive to gain).

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Decision Making
The study of LLM decision-making is a nascent but crucial area of research.  Current work highlights that LLMs, while exhibiting seemingly rational behavior in certain tasks, deviate significantly from human decision-making processes under uncertainty. **LLMs demonstrate tendencies towards risk aversion and loss aversion**, mirroring some human traits, but also display **significant variations in probability weighting and sensitivity to contextual factors**, such as demographic information. This suggests that LLMs' internal decision mechanisms are complex and not fully understood.  The presence of **biases and inconsistencies** across different LLMs and across various demographic contexts raises important ethical considerations for deployment in real-world decision support systems.  Future research should focus on developing more robust and standardized evaluation frameworks, investigating the root causes of these biases, and establishing guidelines for ensuring fairness and ethical considerations in LLM-driven decision-making.  **Transparency and explainability** of LLM decision processes remain critical challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of LLMs in decision support.

#### Behavioral Framework
A behavioral framework for evaluating LLMs' decision-making processes under uncertainty is crucial.  It should ground the evaluation in established behavioral economics theories, such as prospect theory, to analyze risk preferences, probability weighting, and loss aversion.  The framework must move beyond simply comparing LLM outputs to human averages and instead should **focus on underlying decision-making mechanisms**.  This includes exploring how these mechanisms respond to variations in contextual information, including socio-demographic features.  A robust framework would **quantify the degree to which LLMs exhibit biases** and deviations from human norms, and critically examine how these behaviors affect fairness and ethical implications in decision support systems.  Furthermore, such a framework could **provide a basis for developing standards and guidelines** for the ethical development and deployment of LLMs to ensure responsible use in real-world applications.  It is vital that the framework enable **reproducible and verifiable evaluations**, with clear methodological descriptions and accessible data.

#### LLM Bias & Ethics
LLMs, while powerful, inherit biases present in their training data, leading to ethical concerns.  **Bias can manifest in various ways**, such as gender, racial, or socioeconomic biases, impacting the fairness and equity of LLM outputs.  This necessitates careful consideration of ethical implications when deploying LLMs, especially in decision-making contexts.  **Mitigation strategies are crucial**, including bias detection and mitigation techniques during training, as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation to identify and address emerging biases.  **Transparency and accountability** are also vital, enabling users to understand the potential limitations and biases of the systems they employ.  Ultimately, responsible LLM development and deployment require a proactive approach to ethical considerations, fostering fairness, and minimizing harm.

#### Demographic Effects
Analyzing the influence of demographics on Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making reveals **significant disparities** across various groups.  The study reveals that embedding socio-demographic features, such as age, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, into LLM decision processes leads to **noticeable shifts** in risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion.  For instance, some LLMs demonstrate increased risk aversion when presented with attributes of individuals from minority groups, suggesting potential biases in the models. These findings highlight the critical need for researchers and developers to consider the ethical implications and potential biases of LLMs in diverse contexts. **Fairness and equity** are paramount concerns that require careful attention during model development and deployment.  Further research is needed to mitigate these biases and ensure that LLMs operate ethically and equitably across all populations.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore **more sophisticated models of human decision-making** under uncertainty, moving beyond the simplified TCN model.  This includes investigating the influence of cognitive biases, emotional factors, and social context on LLM choices.  A crucial area is **developing robust methods for detecting and mitigating biases** within LLMs, particularly those stemming from demographic features.  Further research should **assess the generalizability of findings** across different LLM architectures and datasets.  Finally, a deeper exploration into the **ethical implications of deploying LLMs in high-stakes decision-making scenarios** is needed, focusing on fairness, accountability, and transparency.

> This figure illustrates the framework used to evaluate LLMs' decision-making behavior.  It shows a step-by-step process, starting with experimentation using multiple-choice lottery games to elicit preferences from the LLMs.  These preferences are then analyzed using the TCN model to estimate risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion.
