Given the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in supporting decision-making processes, it is crucial to assess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations or exhibits potential biases. Although several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, their internal decisionmaking tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics theories, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. With a multiple-choice-list experiment, we initially estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities, but there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. Further, we explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features of human beings, uncovering significant disparities across various demographic characteristics. For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios.

Companies are increasingly offering customized ChatBots, and users can personalize their models through open versions of LLMs. However, if users from minority groups customize a model expecting it to understand their personalities, it could lead to problematic outcomes, as LLMs might produce responses based on generalized stereotypes. For instance, these users might receive misleading advice on critical decisions like investments in financial decision-making. Users may need to consider more carefully when assessing decisions made by LLMs. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Implications for developers and researchers: Previous research [15] has demonstrated that biases can be injected at various levels using different instructions, and our experiments provide evidence that injected demographic features can significantly affect how LLMs make decisions. Critical questions arise: should LLMs mirror human decision-making processes, including preexisting biases, or aim to satisfy ethical standards that remediate these flaws? How should LLMs perform when assisting in human decision-making? Prejudices objectively exist in human society, which are inevitably absorbed by the LLM from their datasets, training, and even aligning with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), with advancements such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [35], LLMs could potentially raise the bar for ethical decision-making by helping identify and correct biases through more structured reasoning. Moreover, LLMs that leverage these structured reasoning frameworks could potentially distinguish between decisions that reflect societal biases and those that follow ethical standards, prompting users to reconsider biased responses. If biases are corrected, methods such as targeted fine-tuning and RLHF adjustments could be used to realign the model\u2019s behavior toward fairness. However, a key question remains: in doing so, do we risk making LLMs less reflective of human-like behavior, and how do we balance ethical responsibility with the usability of these models in real-world applications? ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our study presents intriguing discrepancies between human and LLM behaviors. For example, while human studies may not find significant differences in risk preferences among sexually minority groups [3], our LLM results suggest otherwise. This discrepancy may result from two potential reasons: 1. Flaws in Human Studies: Studies on minority groups often face privacy challenges in obtaining representative samples for their personal information. 2. LLM misunderstanding: LLMs may possess flawed understandings due to biases from data and training. If LLMs could reflect real-world trends more accurately from broader and cleaner data and more careful training, should researchers consider LLM outputs as supplementary evidence for social studies? This can only be answered when further studies can address these discrepancies between human and LLM data. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "One more thing: Our observation indicates that LLMs behave quite differently from their contextfree baselines after specifying demographic features or who LLMs are \"pretending to be.\" Some might argue that LLMs should function as machines with an ensemble of human knowledge, particularly when set in a no-context situation, but it remains unclear what natural preferences LLMs should exhibit.

We evaluated three LLMs regarding their capability to process decision-making decisions through three perspectives: risk, probability, and loss. While all models exhibit general tendencies akin to human behavior, each demonstrates unique deviations to an extent. The incorporation of socio-demographic features into our analysis revealed significant impacts of human-related features on the LLM decision-making process, underscoring the potential biases and variability in their outputs. By addressing the complexities and biases inherent in LLM decision-making, we can better harness their capabilities to support fair and equitable outcomes in real-world applications. These findings emphasize the critical need for ongoing scrutiny and refinement of LLMs to ensure they do not perpetuate or exacerbate societal biases. Additionally, our work raises further exploration about how LLMs should be designed to balance realism with ethical responsibility and what their intrinsic behaviors should reflect, with and without human-demographic embeddings.

If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a $96\\%$ CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).

The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
