It shows two tasks (task a and task b), each with subsets of data. These data subsets are input to a meta-learner (g\u03b8), which produces multiple models (hw1, hw2, hw3) in the model space. The ConML objective contrasts the model outputs, minimizing the distance between models generated from the same task (alignment) and maximizing the distance between models from different tasks (discrimination). This encourages fast adaptation to new tasks and good generalization ability.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ZJZqO4grws/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Investigating the way ConML works.", "description": "This figure visualizes the model distributions and distance distributions for MAML and ConML-MAML in the model space.

It shows two tasks (Task A and Task B) feeding into a meta-learner. The meta-learner produces multiple models in the \"model space.\"  ConML uses a contrastive objective function to push models from the same task closer together (alignment), while simultaneously pushing models from different tasks farther apart (discrimination). This dual strategy enhances the meta-learner's ability to adapt quickly to new tasks and generalize well across various tasks.", "section": "3 Meta-Learning with Contrastive Meta-Objective"}]
