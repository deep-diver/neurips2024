However, current approaches often lack the alignment (integrating diverse information) and discrimination (distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information) capabilities of human learners. This leads to slower adaptation and poorer generalization to unseen tasks.  The paper addresses these limitations.\nThe paper proposes Contrastive Meta-learning (ConML), a novel method that directly contrasts the model outputs to encourage alignment and discrimination. By minimizing inner-task distance and maximizing inter-task distance, ConML improves both fast adaptation and generalization ability.  Experiments show significant performance improvements across various meta-learning and in-context learning methods, highlighting ConML's effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZJZqO4grws/podcast.wav"}
