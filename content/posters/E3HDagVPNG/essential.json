These methods usually rely on fine-scale details, making them vulnerable to these issues.  The difficulty is further compounded by the inherent thin and long nature of lane lines, making precise localization challenging.\nTo address these problems, the researchers developed a novel method called LAne TRansformer (LATR).  This approach uses a Siamese Transformer structure with hierarchical refinement, effectively combining global context with fine details.  A new Curve-IoU loss function further enhances accuracy by specifically addressing the unique shape of lane lines.  Extensive testing showed that LATR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "E3HDagVPNG/podcast.wav"}
