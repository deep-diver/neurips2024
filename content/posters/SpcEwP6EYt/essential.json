Existing methods like direct ANN-SNN weight transfer or knowledge distillation often yield suboptimal results.  This paper addresses the challenge of improving SNN accuracy by focusing on enriching the output feature representation.\nThe paper proposes two key methods: 1) LAF Loss, a novel knowledge distillation technique that aligns ANN and SNN output features using an ANN classifier, effectively transferring knowledge from the high-performing ANN to the SNN; 2) RepAct, which replaces the LIF activation layer with a ReLU layer to generate richer, full-precision output features. Experiments demonstrate that these methods significantly improve SNN performance across various datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques. **The findings suggest a promising approach to bridging the accuracy gap between SNNs and ANNs.**", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "SpcEwP6EYt/podcast.wav"}
