This paper tackles these challenges by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).  Existing LLM-based approaches often fail in these complex scenarios. \nThe paper introduces LLaMAR, a novel cognitive architecture built on a plan-act-correct-verify framework.  LLaMAR uses LLMs to handle high-level planning, action selection, failure correction, and subtask verification.  Crucially, this framework allows for self-correction based on real-time feedback, without relying on simulations or oracles, making it suitable for real-world application. The architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive benchmark dataset (MAP-THOR) designed for testing multi-agent robot planning capabilities in partially-observable environments.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "Y1rOWS2Z4i/podcast.wav"}
