Personalization addresses this issue by enabling each client to have a different model tailored to their own data while simultaneously benefiting from the other clients\u2019 data.

The benefti of this method is twofold: the clients (1) retain control over their local data (as they do not communicate them to a central server) and (2) share the computational workload during the learning procedure. Although FL is a promising learning paradigm, it also comes with its own technical challenges, the first of which is data heterogeneity. Indeed, each client holds only a portion of the common dataset, which is not necessarily a faithful representation of the entire population. This could lead to disagreements amongst clients on model updates, rendering the task of learning an accurate model in this context cumbersome. Nevertheless, when all machines correctly follow a prescribed algorithm, this problem can be solved using either a distributed implementation of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm or variants of the federated averaging scheme (McMahan et al., 2017; Khaled et al., 2020; Karimireddy et al., 2020). Another negative impact of data heterogeneity is the non-uniformity of model accuracy. Specifically, while an FL algorithm outputs a model that is accurate on average, the accuracy of this model on different clients\u2019 local data could vary significantly.

Personalized $\\mathrm{FL}$ attempts to address the aforementioned shortcoming on nonuniform model accuracy by having clients collaborate to design individual models that generalize well over their local data distributions (Vanhaesebrouck et al., 2017; Sattler et al., 2020; Fallah et al., 2020; Hanzely et al., 2020). This approach is highly relevant to many modern machine learning applications, as it tailors the training of each model to the needs of the respective client. To get a more precise view of this approach, consider a general supervised learning task with $\\mathcal{X}$ denoting the input space and $\\boldsymbol{\\wp}$ the output space. Personalized $\\mathrm{FL}$ involves $n$ clients which can communicate, through a central trusted machine (a.k.a. the server).

Standard personalized $\\mathrm{FL}$ approaches usually assume that all clients correctly follow a prescribed protocol, and hence do not consider the possibility of adversarial clients. Robustness to such clients, a.k.a \u201cByzantine robustness\u201d, refers to the design of FL schemes that yield accurate models even when some clients arbitrarily deviate from the algorithm and can send potentially corrupted information to other clients: This could result from poisonous data or code, or attacks from malicious players. Although Byzantine robustness has received significant attention in the FL community (Guerraoui et al., 2024), it remains largely understudied in the context of personalized FL. In fact, prior work has shown that the presence of adversarial clients induces a fundamental optimization error that grows with the heterogeneity across clients\u2019 local data (Karimireddy et al., 2022; Allouah et al., 2024). This optimization error is at odds with the improvement in generalization, which is offered by collaborating with other correct clients, to a point where collaboration is rendered vacuous.

In the context of Byzantine robust distributed learning, we show that even if data heterogeneity is low enough, the level of collaboration should be rescaled by a parameter that both depends on the fraction of adversaries and the gradient dissimilarity between correct clients. Essentially, while the effect of collaboration could be captured by substraction between the local task complexity and the heterogeneity of local distributions in a Byzantine-free context, we show that it is further captured by a multiplicative factor in the presence of adversaries.

The results we obtain suggest that the use of personalization can improve the performance of FL algorithms in the presence of adversarial clients, but also that the level of collaboration needs to be chosen carefully. Our theoretical analysis accounts for the necessity to strike a balance between the optimization error, which is impacted by adversarial clients, and the generalization gap, which is likely to benefit from a larger pool of data. We identify the main factors that impact the local performance, namely data heterogeneity, the fraction of adversarial clients, and data scarcity. This work could be extended in several directions. Firstly, as explained in Section 3, the study of Algorithm 1 primarily serves our understanding of the robust interpolated optimization problem in (3) from an information-theoretic perspective. However, it may not be efficient enough to cope with high-dimensional learning tasks involving a number of clients. An interesting future direction could be to investigate alternative algorithms with lower communication and computational costs, which would be able to handle these high-dimensional problems. Second, our study focuses on a personalization strategy that interpolates between client loss functions. Although this strategy is simple to interpret and allows us to derive optimization and generalization bounds, it is only one of many possible personalized FL schemes. Another interesting avenue would be to investigate whether the insights we drew from our interpolated problem could be derived in a similar fashion from other personalization frameworks such as regularization, layer specialization, or clustering.

A first category of personalized learning algorithms is based upon local fine-tuning (Fallah et al., 2020; Dinh et al., 2020), where the goal is to collaboratively find a good global model from which local fine-tuning can result in an improved local performance. A second category of personalized algorithms is based upon regularization between local models (Li et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2022), i.e., adding a regularization term penalizing a distance between local client models. Another line of research in personalized federated learning considers partial personalization where the parameters are split into globally shared and individual local parameters (Bietti et al., 2022; Mishchenko et al., 2023), this, however, creates the additional challenge of choosing this split. Personalization can also be implemented through clustering methods, where participants selectively collaborate with a smaller subset of clients to limit their exposure to heterogeneity (Ghosh et al., 2020; Werner et al., 2023; Bao et al., 2023).

A few works in the personalized learning literature suggest that personalization can improve the robustness to Byzantine participants (Li et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2022; Mishchenko et al., 2023). These works however only present a limited theoretical analysis in the general Byzantine context. For instance, contrary to our work, the theoretical results in (Li et al., 2021) only cover linear regression and random Gaussian noise attacks. Moreover, the results of (Mishchenko et al., 2023) concerning Byzantine robustness make very strong assumptions on the heterogeneity of loss functions, essentially assuming that they share a common minimum, which largely mitigates the effect of Byzantine adversaries on the optimization error (Allouah et al., 2024). Both (Kundu et al., 2022; Mishchenko et al., 2023) only analyze the optimization error and do not study the generalization error, which we showcase as an important part of the trade-off.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
