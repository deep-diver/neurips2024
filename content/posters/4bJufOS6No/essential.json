Current video forgery detection methods often struggle to identify these videos effectively, particularly those with diverse semantic content. Existing methods mainly focused on detecting facial forgeries and struggle with generalizing to various forgery types.  This paper addresses these issues. \nThe researchers propose a new algorithm called Multi-Modal Detection (MM-Det), which uses large multimodal models to analyze videos and learn a more robust representation of forgeries. It also uses a mechanism that pays attention to both spatial and temporal features in videos, improving detection accuracy. To support their work, they created a large-scale dataset called Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF). **MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on the DVF dataset.**  This work makes significant contributions to the field of video forensics by addressing its limitations and paving the way for more effective deepfake detection methods.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "4bJufOS6No/podcast.wav"}
