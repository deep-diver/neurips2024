VAE-based models are effective but slow, while clustering-based models are efficient but less effective.  These models also struggle with stability and transferability across different datasets and scenarios.  This instability and inefficiency hinders their real-world applicability. \nFASTopic, a novel topic model, addresses these issues using Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR) and Embedding Transport Plan (ETP). DSR directly models semantic relations between document, topic, and word embeddings, while ETP regularizes these relations as optimal transport plans.  This approach results in a more efficient and stable topic model with superior performance.  Extensive experiments demonstrate FASTopic's advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability compared to current state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Topic Modeling"}, "podcast_path": "7t6aq0Fa9D/podcast.wav"}
