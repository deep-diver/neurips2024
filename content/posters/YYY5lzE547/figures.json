Phase 2(a) focuses on resolving excess on the t-side of the cut and adjusting the cut accordingly. Phase 2(b) addresses deficits on the s-side and refines the cut further, leading to the min-cut at the end of this phase. Finally, Phase 3 maintains the min-cut while resolving any remaining excesses or deficits within the s- and t-sides, resulting in both a min-cut and a max-flow at the algorithm's conclusion.", "section": "Empirical Results"}, {"figure_path": "YYY5lzE547/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: An illustration of warm-start Push-Relabel, seeded with a cut-saturating pseudo-flow.
