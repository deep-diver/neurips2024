It iteratively updates the players' actions using a projected gradient step with a decreasing step size. The algorithm returns the average of the iterates over the second half of the iterations. This averaging helps to reduce the noise and improve the accuracy of the estimate of the Nash equilibrium.", "section": "4 Online Learning for Model Selection in Games"}]
