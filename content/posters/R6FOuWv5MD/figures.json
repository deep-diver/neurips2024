A visual description of a 2-player Markov game in which the learner can unilaterally increase their payoff by restricting the expressivity of their policy class.

The black diamond and star points indicate the Stackelberg equilibrium points for the smaller and larger models respectively.  The figure illustrates the non-monotonic relationship between model class expressivity and equilibrium performance; in this instance, the smaller model class achieves better performance at equilibrium than the larger model class. This highlights the concept of a Braess' paradox where restricting the model class leads to better equilibrium outcomes.", "section": "A.3 Stackelberg games where the learner follows"}]
