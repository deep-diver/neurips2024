### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated Graph Learning (FedGL) is vulnerable to model theft and unauthorized copying, lacking effective protection mechanisms. Existing watermarking techniques are either inapplicable to graph data or fall short in terms of performance and robustness guarantees. This work introduces FedGMark, a new approach. 

FedGMark addresses these challenges using a two-module design: a Customized Watermark Generator (CWG) that leverages unique graph structures and client information, and a Robust Model Loader (RML) ensuring robustness against watermark removal attacks and layer perturbation attacks.  Experiments across various datasets and models demonstrate FedGMark's superiority in terms of accuracy, robustness, and provable guarantees, significantly improving the security and reliability of FedGL.

> The figure illustrates the overall pipeline of the proposed certified watermarking method, FedGMark.  It consists of two main modules: the Customized Watermark Generator (CWG) and the Robust Model Loader (RML). The CWG integrates edge information from client graphs and unique client key features to generate customized and diverse watermarks for individual graphs and clients. The RML utilizes a novel GL architecture with multiple submodels and a voting classifier to enhance robustness against watermark removal attacks. The pipeline showcases how watermarked graphs are generated, loaded into the robust model, and how the model provides a certified robustness guarantee.

### In-depth insights


#### FedGL watermarking
Federated graph learning (FedGL) watermarking presents a unique challenge due to the distributed nature of the data and model training.  **Existing watermarking techniques often fail to adapt effectively to the graph structure and the decentralized learning environment.**  This necessitates the development of novel methods that are robust against various attacks, including watermark removal attacks, while maintaining the utility of the watermarked model.  **The ideal solution should leverage the inherent properties of graph data and the federated learning process to embed robust and difficult-to-remove watermarks.**  Furthermore, **formal guarantees of robustness are crucial to ensure the certifiability of the watermarking scheme**, providing strong evidence of model ownership against malicious actors.  A key area of future research is the exploration of efficient and privacy-preserving watermarking strategies for FedGL, addressing concerns about data leakage and model vulnerability during verification.

#### Certified robustness
The concept of "certified robustness" in the context of watermarking for Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a significant advancement.  It moves beyond empirical demonstrations of robustness against watermark removal attacks to **formal guarantees**. This is crucial because traditional watermarking methods often fail under sophisticated attacks.  The authors achieve this certification by employing a novel model architecture and a carefully designed watermark generation process, thus providing provable resilience.  **This provable robustness is a key strength**, as it offers stronger protection against malicious actors seeking to steal or invalidate model ownership, increasing trust and reliability in the system.  However, the practicality of achieving high certified robustness needs further investigation, **especially considering the trade-off with model accuracy and computational cost**.  The limited scope of the certification (e.g., specific types of attacks) also warrants attention; future work should explore broader attack models and explore the robustness boundaries more comprehensively.

#### Layer perturbation
Layer perturbation, as a threat model in the context of watermarking deep learning models, involves an attacker subtly modifying the model's internal parameters.  Unlike brute-force attacks, it focuses on altering specific layers to minimize impact on the model's primary functionality while significantly reducing watermark accuracy. **This targeted approach makes it a particularly potent attack vector**, requiring robust watermarking techniques that can withstand such targeted manipulation. The effectiveness of the layer perturbation attack highlights the need for watermarks that are not only empirically robust but also theoretically certified against such attacks.  **The development of certified robust methods**, which provide formal guarantees on the watermark's resilience against specific layer perturbation attacks, is crucial for ensuring the reliability of model ownership verification.  Such guarantees move beyond empirical evaluation to offer provable security, addressing a major shortcoming of previous watermarking techniques. **The use of ensemble methods and model architectures designed to tolerate layer-wise perturbations** is shown to improve watermark robustness and is a vital area of further research.

#### Watermark removal
Watermark removal techniques pose a significant threat to the effectiveness of watermarking systems.  This paper explores various attack strategies, including **distillation** and **finetuning**, which aim to remove the watermark without substantially impacting the model's primary functionality. A novel attack, **layer-perturbation**, is introduced, demonstrating the capability to significantly reduce watermark accuracy by selectively modifying model parameters.  The effectiveness of these attacks highlights the **need for robust watermarking schemes** capable of withstanding such adversarial manipulations.  **Formal guarantees** and **empirical robustness** are crucial aspects in designing effective watermarking systems that can withstand the ever-evolving landscape of watermark removal techniques.

#### Future directions
Future research could explore **more sophisticated watermarking techniques** that are robust to a wider range of attacks, including those that leverage advanced adversarial machine learning methods.  **Formal guarantees against these attacks**, potentially leveraging concepts from differential privacy or information-theoretic security, would strengthen the reliability of ownership verification.  Furthermore, investigating the **impact of different federated learning training protocols** on the effectiveness and robustness of FedGMark is crucial.  Another area deserving attention is the **development of methods for verifying the ownership of FedGL models without the need for a trusted third party**. This could involve using cryptographic techniques or distributed ledger technologies. Finally,  a significant challenge involves **adapting FedGMark to handle various types of graph data and different graph neural network architectures**.  Extending its capabilities beyond the specific models studied in the paper would enhance the general applicability and practical impact of the work.

This suggests that the federated training process effectively aggregates the effects of the local watermarks, strengthening the overall watermarking process.
