### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Machine learning models often rely on spurious correlations, leading to poor performance on minority groups.  This paper investigates the effects of finetuning and class balancing on worst-group accuracy (WGA), a key metric for assessing fairness.  Existing class-balancing techniques like mini-batch upsampling and loss upweighting are shown to sometimes harm WGA, unexpectedly. 

The researchers propose a novel mixture balancing method that combines the benefits of subsetting and upsampling to mitigate the shortcomings of existing methods. They also discover a previously unknown spectral imbalance in finetuning features, which contributes to group disparities. This comprehensive study highlights the nuanced interaction between model finetuning, class balancing, and group robustness, providing valuable insights for improving fairness in machine learning.

> This figure compares three class-balancing techniques (subsetting, upsampling, and upweighting) against a no-class-balancing baseline across three datasets (Waterbirds, CelebA, and CivilComments). It shows that upsampling and upweighting lead to a catastrophic collapse in worst-group accuracy (WGA) over training epochs, especially on the more imbalanced datasets (CelebA and CivilComments). In contrast, subsetting reduces WGA on Waterbirds due to its removal of data from a small minority group, while MultiNLI, already class-balanced, shows no change.

> This table compares the performance of different class balancing methods (upsampling, subsetting, mixture balancing) for model selection in the absence of group annotations.  Three different metrics are used for model selection: bias-unsupervised score, worst-class accuracy, and worst-group accuracy. The table shows the best performing method according to each metric and its average worst-group accuracy across three independent seeds for Waterbirds, CelebA, and CivilComments datasets.





### In-depth insights


#### Spurious Correlation
Spurious correlations, relationships that appear statistically significant but lack true causal connections, pose a significant challenge to machine learning models.  These misleading correlations can lead models to **over-rely on non-robust features** for prediction, impacting performance, particularly on underrepresented groups.  The paper explores the nuanced impact of spurious correlations on model finetuning, revealing surprising behaviors.  **Common class-balancing techniques** like upsampling, while aiming to improve minority group performance, can paradoxically worsen it by causing overfitting.  **Model scaling** also shows complex interaction with class-balancing, with the latter often being crucial for positive effects of scaling on worst-group accuracy. The detection and mitigation of spurious correlations are highlighted as crucial steps towards building truly robust and fair machine learning models. **Identifying the spectral imbalance** in group covariance matrices is proposed as a promising direction to diagnose and potentially address these issues.

#### Finetuning Dynamics
The paper's analysis of finetuning dynamics reveals crucial insights into how model scaling and class balancing interact to affect group robustness.  **Class-balancing techniques, while seemingly beneficial, can catastrophically harm worst-group accuracy (WGA) if not carefully implemented.** The study highlights the surprising ineffectiveness of commonly used methods like mini-batch upsampling and loss upweighting, demonstrating a nuanced behavior. **Overparameterization, contrary to some beliefs, does not automatically improve WGA, but rather interacts with class balancing in complex ways.**  The authors discover a spectral imbalance in finetuned features, where minority group covariance matrices exhibit larger spectral norms. This finding suggests that **minority groups are disproportionately affected by the model's reliance on spurious correlations**, even with class balancing. A proposed mixture method combines subsetting and upsampling, mitigating the shortcomings of individual techniques and improving WGA.

#### Class Balancing woes
The concept of 'Class Balancing woes' in machine learning highlights the challenges and unexpected outcomes associated with common class balancing techniques.  **Mini-batch upsampling and loss upweighting**, often used to address class imbalance, can paradoxically **reduce worst-group accuracy (WGA)**.  This counterintuitive result stems from the methods' potential to overfit to minority classes within already underrepresented groups.  **Data removal techniques**, while effective in certain scenarios, are shown to negatively impact WGA if the data removed disproportionately affects minority groups within larger classes.  The research emphasizes **the importance of considering group structure** and employing more sophisticated mixture methods, combining subsetting and upsampling, to mitigate these issues and achieve improved robustness and fairness.

#### Model Scaling Effects
The paper investigates the effects of model scaling on worst-group accuracy (WGA) in the context of finetuned models.  It challenges the common assumptions around overparameterization, demonstrating that **scaling can improve WGA, but crucially, only when combined with proper class balancing**.  The findings reveal nuanced interactions between model size and group robustness, highlighting that simply increasing model capacity does not guarantee improved fairness. Instead, the study underscores the importance of considering the interplay between overparameterization and class balancing techniques to effectively mitigate the impact of spurious correlations on minority groups. The authors find that **model scaling with appropriate class balancing methods is generally beneficial for WGA**, even after the interpolation threshold.  However, scaling without class balancing, or with the wrong balancing approach, can negatively impact WGA, emphasizing the need for a careful and holistic approach.  This research contributes significant insights into optimizing for group robustness in the context of modern deep learning practices.

#### Spectral Imbalance
The concept of spectral imbalance, explored in the context of group robustness, suggests that disparities in the eigenspectra of group covariance matrices might contribute to performance discrepancies across groups, **even when class balance is achieved**.  The analysis reveals that minority groups often exhibit covariance matrices with larger spectral norms compared to majority groups within the same class. This finding underscores a more nuanced understanding of group fairness than previously assumed, suggesting that simply balancing class distributions may be insufficient to address underlying group disparities.  **Spectral imbalance highlights the importance of considering not only the distribution of data but also the structure of the feature space** when aiming for robust and equitable model performance across all groups.  Further investigation into the root causes and mitigation strategies of spectral imbalance is essential for improving fairness in machine learning models.

Across four datasets, it demonstrates that scaling improves WGA only when combined with the appropriate class-balancing method.  Scaling without proper balancing, or on imbalanced datasets, can negatively affect WGA.  The MultiNLI dataset, being pre-balanced, shows a different trend.

> This figure visualizes the top 10 eigenvalues of group covariance matrices for four datasets (Waterbirds, CelebA, CivilComments, MultiNLI) after finetuning with the best class balancing method.  It highlights that the largest eigenvalue for each dataset belongs to a minority group, and that minority groups generally have larger eigenvalues than majority groups within the same class. This suggests a spectral imbalance that may contribute to group disparities in model performance.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/eHzIwAhj06/figures_9_1.jpg)

> This figure shows that even when classes are balanced, there is still a spectral imbalance between minority and majority groups within each class. The intra-class spectral norm ratio (p(y)) is calculated as the ratio of the top eigenvalue of the minority group's covariance matrix to that of the majority group's covariance matrix, within each class. The results show that p(y) is greater than or equal to 1 for almost all classes across all datasets, indicating that minority groups tend to have larger spectral norms than majority groups within the same class.

The results demonstrate that, even when classes are balanced, a spectral imbalance exists, where minority groups consistently exhibit larger spectral norms than majority groups within the same class. This suggests a potential link between spectral imbalance and group disparities.
