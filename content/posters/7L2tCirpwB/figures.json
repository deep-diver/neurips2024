It showcases how the estimation error decreases as the sample size increases, with different lines representing various sparsity levels.

The plots demonstrate the convergence of the SCLS method for different levels of sparsity under different regularization parameters (\u03b3). The results illustrate that as the number of samples increases, the estimation error approaches zero, confirming the theoretical findings of the paper.", "section": "5 Experiment Results"}]
