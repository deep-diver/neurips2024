The latest state-of-the-art method for solving the SPG-LS problem is the spherically constrained least squares reformulation (SCLS) method proposed in the work of [3].

Subsequently, we provide a theoretical error analysis for the SCLS method based on this simplified AO problem. This analysis not only strengthens the theoretical framework of the SCLS method but also confirms the reliability of the learner produced by it.

The learner\u2019s goal is to minimize its loss function under the assumption that the training data has been optimally modified from the data provider\u2019s perspective.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
