[{"figure_path": "QBCxWpOt5w/tables/tables_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Chain-of-Thought consists in eliciting reasoning steps before answering (A) a question (Q).", "description": "This table shows the difference between a single-token prediction and a chain-of-thought prediction. In single-token prediction, the model directly answers the question with one token.  In chain-of-thought prediction, the model first generates reasoning steps before giving the final answer. This illustrates how chain-of-thought improves the quality of answers generated by large language models, even when they are not explicitly trained for reasoning tasks. The example question is \"What is 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 3?\"", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
