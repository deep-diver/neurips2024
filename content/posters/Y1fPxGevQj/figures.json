Panel A shows a block diagram of a MIL model applied to a histopathology slide. The feature extraction module is typically a combination of a frozen foundation model followed by a shallow MLP. In most of the recent MIL models, the aggregation module uses attention mechanisms for combining the instance feature vectors into a single feature representation per bag. The prediction head is a linear layer or an MLP. Panel B schematically shows xMIL-LRP for explaining AttnMIL. In xMIL-LRP, the model output is backpropagated to the input instances. The colored lines represent the relevance flow. Red and blue colors encode the positive and negative values. The attention module is handled via the AH-rule as described in Section 3.2. As discussed in Section 3.3, the instance explanation scores can be computed at the output of the foundation model or at the input level.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two main steps of the xMIL framework: aggregation function estimation and evidence function estimation.
