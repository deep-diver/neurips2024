Neural operators (NOs) offer a data-driven alternative, but many existing NOs suffer from high computational complexity or limitations in capturing holistic function information.  Previous methods, like GNO, FNO, and Transformer-based NOs, exhibit complexities of O(N(N-1)), O(NlogN), and O(N^2), respectively, hindering their scalability.\nThis paper introduces MambaNO, a novel neural operator designed to overcome these limitations.  MambaNO cleverly balances global and local integration using a state space model (Mamba) for global scanning and an alias-free architecture for local integration.  The authors demonstrate the continuous-discrete equivalence property of MambaNO and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmark PDEs, surpassing existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy with fewer parameters.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gUEBXGV8JM/podcast.wav"}
