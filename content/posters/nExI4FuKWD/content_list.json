To evaluate whether the improved fine-grained understanding learned with FineCLIP translates to tasks requiring fine-grained localization, we serve FineCLIP as the backbone for open-vocabulary object detection. Following the previous work [55], we build open-vocabulary object detectors based on F-ViT architecture, which is a two-stage detector baseline built on frozen CLIP ViTs. Considering that the input resolution has a significant influence on detection performance, to ensure the comparison fairness, we utilize the checkpoints of FineCLIP and competing methods trained on CC2.5M with input image size of $224\\times224$ for ViT-B/16 and $336\\times336$ for ViT-L/14 to initialize the F-ViT.

These classifiers focus only on a limited range of objects, making it difficult to cover a wide range of semantics. CLIP [40] and its diverse variants [12, 18, 68] popularized learning general visual-language representations by pre-training on noisy large-scale datasets like LAION-400M [44] and LAION-5B [45], which exhibit potent representation capabilities and exceptional generalizability. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite the great achievements, CLIP model has shown weak alignment between regions and corresponding texts [37, 41, 62]. This problem can be roughly attributes to limitations of 1) CLIP loss which ignores the supervision of visual and textual dense features, and 2) brief coarse captions that are insufficient to allow the model in comprehending image details [10]. Recent works attempted to enhance CLIP\u2019s fine-grained understanding by building strong region-text alignment. One line of work leverages region-level annotations for vision-language pre-training [59, 64, 66]. For instance, GLIP [27] utilized large-scale human-labeled grounding data to align semantics at phase and region level, which achieved stronger performance on fully-supervised detection benchmarks. RegionCLIP [70] proposed to generate region descriptions by filling plausible concepts into pre-defined templates. Since the semantics of synthesized descriptions are limited by the pre-defined concept pool, RegionCLIP essentially models the finite category classification task. Although this approach brings benefits to downstream detection tasks, it still struggles to cover broad semantic diversity of open-world scenarios. Another remarkable work is CLIPSelf [55], which proposed to distill the global representation capability of the frozen teacher model to dense feature extraction of the student model. While CLIPSelf successfully enhancing the local representations, the frozen teacher model limits the performance ceiling of the student model, which is not consistent with the intention of pre-training. A separate line of work explored incorporating losses between image patch and text token embeddings to learn representations encoding more fine-grained details [3, 16, 35, 52, 60].

Common strategies for region proposal include random cropping, using Region Proposal Network (RPN) [43] or detectors [42, 65] to generate bounding boxes around objects, or leveraging segmentation models [24] such as SAM [21]. Region annotations can be obtained by expert manual labeling, synthesizing captions using traditional NLP techniques, or generating them with models. A notable work of the second way is Kosmos-2 [38], which introduced a pseudo-labeling pipeline that utilizes the pre-trained GLIP [27] to automatically generate fine-grained pseudo-labels of region boxes. In the era of large models, recent LVLMs [2, 31, 36, 53] have demonstrated impressive capabilities of visual understanding, instruction-following and generalization.

Considering that the negative textual samples for contrastive are object concepts that are not matched to the region but matched to other regions in the batch, it essentially models an object classification tasks with predefined finite categories.

However, a notable shortcoming of CLIPSelf is that the frozen teacher model limits the performance of student model, and also discrpts the semantic consistency in visual features. By comparison, our FineCLIP fully leverages the model to teach itself with the help of global contrastive learning.
