Existing methods often struggle to achieve fast convergence rates, especially when the feasible set is not strongly convex.  The O(\u221aT) regret bound is often considered a lower bound, limiting the performance of many learning algorithms.\nThis paper proposes a novel algorithm that leverages the curvature of both the loss functions and the feasible set.  By exploiting a new condition for 'sphere-enclosed' feasible sets, the authors prove a logarithmic regret bound, O(p ln T), under stochastic environments, where p is the radius of a sphere enclosing the feasible set. They also extend their analysis to uniformly convex sets and corrupted stochastic environments, achieving improved regret bounds compared to existing algorithms. This innovative approach offers significant improvements for OCO, achieving faster convergence and better performance in various settings.", "affiliation": "University of Tokyo", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Y58T1MQhh6/podcast.wav"}
