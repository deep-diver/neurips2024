The 'tug-of-war' problem, where the optimization of one task hinders others, is a major hurdle. Existing solutions mostly focus on improving individual components (LLMs or visual encoders), neglecting the connector between them. \nThis paper introduces Uni-Med, a medical generalist foundation model addressing this limitation.  Uni-Med uses a novel Connector-Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) module, which efficiently handles multi-task learning by using a mixture of projection experts to align visual and language spaces. Extensive experiments show that Uni-Med achieves significant performance gains (up to 8%) compared to previous state-of-the-art models.  It showcases successful multi-task learning in a unified architecture across six medical tasks: question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation, and image classification.  The open-source availability of Uni-Med further promotes reproducibility and future research.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "oyl2Fnzune/podcast.wav"}
