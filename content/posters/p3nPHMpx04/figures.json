The input image is first processed by a base-class model, which identifies base-class objects.  If a novel class is detected, a simple rule determines which base class it is most closely related to. Then, a specialized model for that base class is used to refine the segmentation for the novel class. Models for each novel class are trained separately with standard supervised learning.  This approach aims to maintain good performance on base classes while also effectively segmenting novel classes.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "p3nPHMpx04/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of BNM creation.
