For each algorithm, the table shows the average individual rewards for player 1 (r1) and player 2 (r2), the social welfare (SW, the sum of individual rewards), and an equality metric (E, based on the Gini coefficient). The results are based on 50 random runs, and the table displays the mean and 95% confidence intervals for each metric.", "section": "5.1 Two-Player Public Goods Game"}, {"figure_path": "2YSHEBRRol/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: The comparison of the average equality metric (denoted as E) on Harvest and Cleanup. We show the mean of equality value and standard deviation utilizing three random runs.", "description": "This table presents the average equality metric (E) for the Harvest and Cleanup environments. The equality metric, calculated using the Gini coefficient, measures the fairness of reward distribution among agents.  Higher values indicate greater equality. The table compares the performance of AgA with different lambda values (\u03bb = 0.1, 1, 100, 1000) against several baseline methods (Simul-Ind, Simul-Co, SVO, CGA, and SL). The results are averaged over three random runs, with mean and standard deviation reported. This table shows how AgA improves the equality of rewards compared to the baselines.", "section": "5.2 Sequential Social Dilemma: Cleanup and Harvest"}, {"figure_path": "2YSHEBRRol/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison of the average running time between baseline methods and AgA in the two-player public goods game, including total duration, timesteps, time per step, and the time per step ratio relative to Simul-Ind.", "description": "This table compares the computational efficiency of the AgA algorithm against several baseline methods in a two-player public goods game.  It shows the total running time (Duration), the number of steps taken to converge (Steps), the average time per step (Step Time), and the ratio of the Step Time for each method relative to the Simul-Ind method.  The table helps to demonstrate the trade-off between AgA's improved performance and its slightly increased computational cost.", "section": "6 Discussion"}]
