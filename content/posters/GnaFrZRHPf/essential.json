This inconsistency makes reward modeling complex and leads to suboptimal policies.  Previous methods using linear scaling are often insufficient, hindering the learning of versatile reward functions.\nThis paper introduces a novel adaptive preference loss function, based on DRO, that addresses this issue. By incorporating an adaptive scaling parameter for each pair of preferences, this method enables more flexibility in reward modeling. The loss function is strictly convex and univariate, allowing for efficient optimization.  Experiments with robotic control and natural language generation showcase improved policy performance and better alignment between reward function selection and policy optimization, simplifying hyperparameter tuning.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GnaFrZRHPf/podcast.wav"}
