### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep Image Prior (DIP) has shown promise in image reconstruction but suffers from overfitting.  **Existing solutions often rely on large datasets or pre-trained models, limiting their applicability to data-scarce scenarios like medical imaging.** This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel method called Autoencoding Sequential DIP. 



The proposed method sequentially updates network weights and incorporates an autoencoding regularization term, progressively denoising the input. This input-adaptive approach reduces overfitting. **The results demonstrate superior performance compared to other DIP methods and even leading diffusion models across various image recovery tasks (MRI, CT, denoising etc.)**, without requiring extensive training data or pre-trained models, making it particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments.

> This figure shows the results of an experiment investigating the impact of the network input on the performance of Vanilla DIP.  Two scenarios are compared: one where the network input is a noisy version of the ground truth image (blue line), and another where the input is pure noise (red line).  The y-axis represents the best possible PSNR achieved before overfitting occurs, and the x-axis represents the standard deviation (œÉ) of the added Gaussian noise. The results show that a closer similarity between the DIP network input and the ground truth leads to higher reconstruction quality (higher PSNR). This motivates the development of aSeqDIP which aims to mitigate noise overfitting by adaptively changing the network input.

### In-depth insights


#### aSeqDIP: Method
The core of the aSeqDIP method lies in its **sequential and adaptive approach** to image reconstruction. Unlike traditional DIP, which uses a fixed random input, aSeqDIP progressively refines its input through sequential optimization of network weights.  This is achieved via an **iterative process** where at each step, network parameters are optimized using an objective that balances **data consistency** (the fit to the noisy measurements) and **autoencoding regularization**. The autoencoding term acts as a form of noise overfitting prevention, essentially by encouraging the network's output to resemble its input, thus avoiding the pitfalls of fitting only to the noise in the measurements. This adaptive input strategy makes aSeqDIP robust and efficient. The **sequential nature** prevents early overfitting, a significant advantage over standard DIP and several other existing methods.  The iterative process, using an input-adaptive DIP objective, leads to improved reconstruction quality while maintaining similar computational costs compared to standard DIP. The **autoencoding regularization** is a key differentiator, enhancing the quality of results and stability.

#### DIP Input Impact
The impact of the Deep Image Prior (DIP) network's input is a critical yet often overlooked aspect.  **Early experiments reveal a strong correlation between the input's similarity to the ground truth and the reconstruction quality.**  While a random input is conventionally used, initializing the network with a noisy version of the ground truth, retaining structural information, consistently yields superior results. This observation underscores the network's sensitivity to its initial conditions.  The authors cleverly leverage this insight, proposing a novel sequential approach in which the network's input adapts iteratively, progressively denoising the input itself, and hence leading to improved results.  This input-adaptive strategy effectively mitigates the issue of overfitting, a common challenge in DIP methods.  **Essentially, instead of relying on a fixed random input, they introduce a gradual, structured refinement, moving the method closer to the benefits of diffusion models without requiring the training data.** This approach cleverly exploits the underlying architecture‚Äôs inherent capacity to learn and reconstruct from partial information, significantly improving noise overfitting mitigation.

#### Noise Overfitting
The phenomenon of noise overfitting in deep image prior (DIP) methods is a critical challenge.  **Overfitting occurs when the network learns the noise present in the input data rather than the underlying image structure.** This leads to poor generalization and hinders the accuracy of image reconstruction.  The paper introduces autoencoding sequential DIP (aSeqDIP) to mitigate noise overfitting.  **aSeqDIP achieves this by progressively denoising and reconstructing the image through a sequential optimization of network weights, employing an input-adaptive DIP objective and an autoencoding regularization term.** This approach is shown to effectively delay the onset of noise overfitting while maintaining a similar number of parameter updates as vanilla DIP.  The autoencoding term is particularly important; it forces the network output to remain consistent with the input, preventing overfitting by promoting learning of the true signal features.  **Ultimately, aSeqDIP offers a data-independent way to improve the robustness of DIP based methods to noise and improve reconstruction quality.**

#### DM Comparison
A comparative analysis of the proposed method against diffusion models (DMs) reveals **significant advantages**. While DMs achieve state-of-the-art results, they often require extensive training data and pre-trained models, limiting applicability to data-scarce scenarios. In contrast, the proposed method is **data-independent**, requiring only noisy measurements and a forward operator, making it particularly well-suited for applications where large datasets are unavailable.  The results demonstrate the proposed method's competitive performance, often surpassing or matching DMs in various image reconstruction tasks, while maintaining a significantly reduced computational burden. **This highlights a key strength**: the ability to deliver high-quality reconstruction without the computational overhead associated with training complex diffusion models.  Further exploration of this trade-off between data dependency and computational cost is important for future development in the field.

#### Future works
The authors suggest several promising avenues for future research.  **Extending aSeqDIP's applicability to a wider range of inverse problems** is a key goal, potentially broadening its impact across diverse fields.  Investigating the integration of a dynamic input update mechanism, allowing for adaptive adjustments to the autoencoding regularization parameter and the number of gradient updates per iteration, could significantly enhance the method's efficiency and robustness.  **Exploring the theoretical underpinnings of aSeqDIP further** using Neural Tangent Kernel analysis to better understand the training dynamics, particularly in relation to network architecture and input choice, warrants attention.  Finally, **comparative studies against other state-of-the-art methods** on more comprehensive benchmarks and datasets are important steps towards validating the generalizability and potential of aSeqDIP for various real-world applications.
