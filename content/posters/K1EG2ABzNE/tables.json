For MRI, we consider two Acceleration (Ax) factors, 4x and 8x, that determine the subsampling of the measurements. For 2D CT (parallel beam geometry), we use two sparse view settings: 18 and 30 views. For denoising, we perturb the ground truth images using two noise levels determined by \u03c3a. In in-painting, we use two hole-to-image area ratios (HIAR), 0.1 and 0.25. For non-linear deblurring, we use the Blurring Kernel Space Exploring (BKSE) setting [3], described in Equations (56) to (59) of [16]. Each baseline that utilizes pre-trained models or a reference image is considered data-dependent.
