### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world problems involve estimating properties of expensive black-box functions, often requiring the use of computationally intensive base algorithms.  Existing Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) methods, like INFO-BAX, often rely on expected information gain (EIG), which can be computationally expensive and limit their applicability.  This is especially true when the property of interest is complex or high-dimensional. 

This paper introduces PS-BAX, a new BAX method using posterior sampling.  **PS-BAX is significantly faster than EIG-based approaches because it only requires a single base algorithm execution per iteration.** It is also simpler to implement and easily parallelizable. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that PS-BAX performs competitively with existing baselines. Furthermore, the paper provides theoretical analysis showing that PS-BAX is asymptotically convergent under mild conditions.

> üîº This figure illustrates one iteration of the PS-BAX algorithm for level-set estimation.  It shows the true objective function, the currently observed data points, the threshold defining the level set, the posterior distribution over the function, a sample from that posterior, and the resulting target set identified from that sample. The algorithm then selects the next point to evaluate based on the uncertainty (variance) of the posterior in the sampled target set.

### In-depth insights


#### PS-BAX: A New BAX
The proposed PS-BAX algorithm offers a novel approach to Bayesian algorithm execution (BAX) by leveraging posterior sampling.  **This contrasts with existing BAX methods that rely on computationally expensive expected information gain (EIG) calculations.** PS-BAX's simplicity and scalability are highlighted as key advantages, enabling efficient exploration of a wide range of problems including optimization and level set estimation.  **The algorithm's core innovation lies in its ability to directly sample from the posterior distribution of the base algorithm's output (target set), thereby avoiding the need for complex EIG optimization.**  Empirical results demonstrate competitive performance with existing methods, coupled with significant speed improvements.  **Crucially, the paper provides theoretical guarantees of asymptotic convergence under mild conditions, offering a deeper understanding of posterior sampling's efficacy within the BAX framework.** The combination of practical efficiency and theoretical soundness positions PS-BAX as a promising contribution to the field, potentially establishing a new baseline for future research.

#### Posterior Sampling
Posterior sampling, a cornerstone of Bayesian methods, offers a powerful approach to algorithm execution (BAX).  Instead of relying on computationally expensive expected information gain (EIG) calculations, **posterior sampling directly leverages the posterior distribution of the function**.  This involves sampling a function from the posterior distribution, running the base algorithm on this sample, and selecting points based on the resulting output.  This approach makes BAX significantly more efficient, especially in high-dimensional problems or when the property of interest is complex.  The simplicity of implementation and ease of parallelization are significant advantages.  **Theoretical convergence guarantees** offer additional confidence, solidifying posterior sampling as a robust and scalable method for BAX. While the applicability may be narrower than EIG-based approaches, its efficiency and theoretical underpinnings position it as a strong contender and a valuable benchmark for future research in BAX.

#### PS-BAX Efficiency
The PS-BAX algorithm demonstrates significant computational efficiency advantages over existing Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) methods.  **Its core innovation lies in replacing the computationally expensive expected information gain (EIG) criterion with posterior sampling.** This simplification drastically reduces the runtime, particularly beneficial in high-dimensional problems or when the property of interest is complex.  **PS-BAX only requires a single base algorithm execution per iteration**, unlike EIG-based methods that demand multiple executions and optimizations, resulting in substantial speed-ups. This efficiency is further enhanced by the algorithm's inherent **parallelizability**, allowing for further computational gains.  The reduced computational complexity of PS-BAX makes it a strong candidate for real-world applications where computational resources are constrained.

#### Convergence Proofs
Convergence proofs in the context of Bayesian optimization algorithms are crucial for establishing the reliability and efficiency of these methods.  They provide **mathematical guarantees** that the algorithm will, under certain assumptions, ultimately converge to the true optimum or a satisfactory solution.  **Asymptotic convergence** is a common focus, proving convergence as the number of iterations or data points tends towards infinity.  These proofs often rely on assumptions regarding the properties of the objective function (e.g., continuity, smoothness) and the probabilistic model used (e.g., Gaussian process priors).  **Demonstrating convergence** can involve showing that the uncertainty in the estimated solution decreases over time, or that the sequence of points sampled by the algorithm converges to an optimal set.  The key challenge lies in balancing the theoretical rigor of the proofs with the practical applicability of the assumptions.  **Real-world problems** rarely meet all ideal conditions, so a careful consideration of the limitations and assumptions is important when interpreting convergence results.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore **extensions of PS-BAX to handle noisy or incomplete data**, a common challenge in real-world applications.  Investigating **alternative probabilistic models beyond Gaussian processes** could broaden PS-BAX's applicability and improve its performance on diverse problem types.  Another avenue is developing **more sophisticated acquisition functions** to select evaluation points more effectively, potentially combining the strengths of posterior sampling with other acquisition strategies.  Furthermore, research on **theoretical guarantees for PS-BAX under more relaxed assumptions** would strengthen its foundation and guide future algorithm design. Finally, **applying PS-BAX to more complex real-world problems** across various domains (beyond the examples presented) would demonstrate its broader utility and robustness.
