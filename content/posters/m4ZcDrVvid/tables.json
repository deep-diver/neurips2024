In all of them, PS-BAX is between one and three orders of magnitude faster than INFO-BAX. We also note that the runtimes for both algorithms are significantly longer on the Top-10 GB1 problem due to the use of a deep kernel GP model.", "description": "This table compares the average runtimes per iteration for PS-BAX and INFO-BAX algorithms across eight different problems, categorized into four problem classes.  The results highlight the significantly faster performance of PS-BAX (one to three orders of magnitude) compared to INFO-BAX across all problems tested. The runtime difference is particularly noticeable in the Top-10 GB1 problem, attributed to the use of a deep kernel GP model.", "section": "4 Numerical Experiments"}]
