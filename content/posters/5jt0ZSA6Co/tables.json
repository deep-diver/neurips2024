Subfigures (a), (b), and (c) show cumulative problem-solving counts over time for each domain, highlighting HYSYNTH's superior performance compared to baselines. Subfigure (d) shows the percentage of syntactically valid program completions generated by LLMs in each domain.", "section": "4.2 Results"}]
