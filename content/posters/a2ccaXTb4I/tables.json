The comparison is done across different garment types (Shirt, Pants, Top, Skirt) and manipulation types (Folding, Flattening).  Metrics used include Chamfer Distance (Def), Correspondence Distance (Der), and the percentage of frames where Der is below a certain threshold (A5 and A10).  The \"Init.\" column indicates the type of initialization used for the comparison methods.  The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy and pose estimation.", "section": "4.2 Quantitative Results"}, {"figure_path": "a2ccaXTb4I/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparisons of our method to GarmentNets and GarmentTracking on VR-Folding dataset.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed method's performance against two state-of-the-art methods, GarmentNets and GarmentTracking, using the VR-Folding dataset.

The results are shown separately for the \"Folding\" and \"Flattening\" tasks and for different garment types (Shirt, Pants, Top, Skirt). The table also indicates whether the compared methods used ground truth initialization (\"GT\"), perturbed ground truth initialization (\"Pert.\"), or GarmentNet's initialization (\"GN\"). This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches.", "section": "4.2 Quantitative Results"}, {"figure_path": "a2ccaXTb4I/tables/tables_16_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation study. +M, +O and +Mprev denote using the guidance of the sparse UV maps, the recovered panel mask and the recovery of previous frames, respectively.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study on the proposed method.  It shows the impact of using different combinations of guidance signals (sparse UV maps, recovered panel masks, and previous frame's recovery) on the reconstruction accuracy, measured by A3, A5, Dcr, and Dcf. The results demonstrate that using all three guidance signals leads to the best performance.", "section": "A.4 Ablation Study"}]
