To recover 3D garment shapes from incomplete 3D point clouds acquired when the garment is folded, we map the points to UV space, in which our priors are learned, to produce partial UV maps, and then fit the priors to recover complete UV maps and 2D to 3D mappings.

These methods aim to minimize the difference between the observations, such as captured images or point clouds, and the given template surface to recover the deformed state of the objects with geometric constraints or differentiable physics simulators. Unfortunately 3D templates are rarely available. Thus, there are many approaches that rely on free-form techniques without any geometric prior [17, 18, 19, 20], which warp and accumulate different observations across frames into a 3D volume. However, these methods face challenges when reconstructing regions that remain occluded throughout the sequence. While the algorithms of [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] can recover full object geometry from RGB-D videos, the shape representations they use are designed for watertight surfaces, and thus not suitable for garments that are thin open surfaces.

To cover the much wider range of possible states that garments can be in, a large-scale garment manipulation dataset is introduced in [2]. It relies on a VR system and uses it to learn a tracking model for estimating the complete pose of a given garment. Despite promising results, requiring a canonical geometry for garment and an initial shape estimate in the first frame imposes limitations similar to those of template-based methods.

To handle loose-fitting garments such as skirts and dresses, the methods of [36, 37, 38] leverage complex physics simulation steps or feature line estimation to align the garment surface with the input image.

The dataset features pants, shirts, tops, and skirts selected from the CLOTH3D, and each category covers a wide shape range. VR-Folding comprises 9767 manipulation videos and 790K multi-view RGB-D frames, which are used to generate point clouds. For the training of ISP, we use the same garments from CLOTH3D as those selected in VR-Folding and generate their sewing patterns as described in Sec. 3.1. We generate UV maps of deformed garments and the corresponding UV coordinates of point clouds using the mapping function of ISP. These UV maps and coordinates serve to train the diffusion model and the UV mapper, respectively.

Note that the correspondences of $D_{c r}$ are established by finding the closest point of the ground truth in canonical space instead of the deformed one as $D_{c f}$ .

In the third column, the abbreviation \"N/A\" indicates the absence of any initialization, while \"GT\", \"Pert.\" and \"GN\" represent the results of GarmentTracking using the ground-truth mesh, the noise-perturbed ground-truth mesh, and the estimation of GarmentNets as the initialization, respectively. Our method outperforms the baselines by a large margin for both the Folding and Flattening sets. GarmentNets can handle garments without prior knowledge of their geometry but has the lowest reconstruction accuracy. GarmentTracking is more accurate and beneftis from using the given garment mesh as a prior, but its performance is highly influenced by the choice of initialization. When using the network-predicted result (GN) instead of the ground truth, its performance drops substantially, particularly for Shirt, Skirt and Top. This greatly restricts its applicability in real-world scenarios where obtaining the ground truth garment mesh in advance is rarely possible. In contrast, our method has no such limitation while still achieving the highest reconstruction accuracy. The performance disparity between our method and the baselines is particularly significant for challenging metrics such as $A_{3}$ (on Folding) and $A_{5}$ (on Flattening), for instance, $84.7\\%$ vs $29.8\\%$ and $78.0\\%$ vs $24.5\\%$ on Shirt.

This discrepancy arises from the ambiguous definition of skirt sides due to its rotational symmetry. When the skirt is rotated by a specific amount around the medial axis, the resulting shape is nearly identical to the original one, which can yield high $D_{c r}$ and low $A_{d}$ values because they are computed using correspondence between the estimated canonical mesh and the ground truth. Consequently, this symmetrical ambiguity makes these metrics unsuitable for assessing the reconstruction quality of skirts, whereas the Chamfer distance $D_{c f}$ does not have this issue, on which we obtain the lowest values. An illustrative example is provided in the Appendix.
