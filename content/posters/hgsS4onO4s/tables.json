Three models (NCM, QNM, and the proposed model) were compared across 100 trials with two noise levels (\u03c3 = 0.1 and \u03c3 = 0.01).  The performance is measured using the integrated squared error (l2) between the model's approximation and the ground truth, and the CPU time (cpu) taken for each trial.  Lower l2 values indicate better performance.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
