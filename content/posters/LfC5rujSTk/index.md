### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many researchers assume that large language models (LLMs) can implicitly learn the numerical constraints within data science application programming interfaces (APIs) to produce valid code.  However, this paper empirically investigates the proficiency of LLMs in handling such constraints and finds that while LLMs excel at generating simple programs, their performance drastically declines when confronted with more complex or unusual inputs.

This research employed three evaluation settings: full programs, all parameters, and individual parameters of a single API.  The results reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs, even GPT-4-Turbo, still struggle with arithmetic API constraints. The study introduces DSEVAL, a novel benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM capabilities in this area.  DSEVAL provides a rigorous assessment of various LLMs and uncovers significant performance gaps, particularly highlighting the shortcomings of open-source models compared to their proprietary counterparts.

> This figure shows a typical data science (DS) program built using the PyTorch library.  It highlights the constraints that must be satisfied for the program to be valid.  These constraints involve relationships between the input data properties (like its dimensions) and the parameters of the PyTorch Conv2d API (such as kernel size and padding).  The example illustrates that satisfying these constraints is crucial for the correct execution of the DS program. The constraints are shown in a box on the right, illustrating how the numerical values must meet specific conditions.





![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/LfC5rujSTk/tables_2_1.jpg)

> This table categorizes different types of constraints found in data science APIs, providing examples of APIs that exhibit each constraint type.  The categories include Equality (where values must match exactly), Inequality (where values must be greater or less than), Arithmetic (constraints involving arithmetic operations), Set-related (constraints based on set properties), and Complex arithmetic (more intricate combinations of operations). For each category, example APIs are listed, and sample constraints are shown to illustrate their application.





### In-depth insights


#### LLM's API grasp
Analyzing LLMs' understanding of Data Science (DS) APIs reveals a nuanced picture. While LLMs demonstrate proficiency in generating simple DS programs and correctly utilizing commonly-seen API patterns, their true comprehension of underlying numerical constraints is questionable. **The ability to memorize common usage patterns from massive training data overshadows a genuine understanding of the mathematical and logical rules governing API parameters.**  This is particularly evident when dealing with more complex or unusual inputs, where performance significantly deteriorates.  **LLMs often resort to memorization of simple, frequently-encountered input-output pairs**, neglecting the underlying arithmetic relationships.  This highlights a critical limitation: while LLMs can mimic valid code generation superficially, they struggle to generalize their knowledge effectively, indicating a crucial gap between mimicking patterns and achieving genuine understanding of numerical API constraints. **Future research should focus on developing LLMs that possess a deeper understanding of the mathematical and logical constraints inherent in DS APIs**, moving beyond pattern recognition to true reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

#### Constraint types
The categorization of constraints in data science APIs is crucial for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating valid code.  A thoughtful approach to constraint types reveals several key dimensions. **Equality constraints**, which require exact value matches, often involve shape consistency checks or index validation, highlighting the LLM's proficiency in handling basic structural aspects of data. **Inequality constraints**, specifying value ranges (greater/less than), tend to be related to rank validation or dimension limits, presenting a more nuanced challenge that reveals the LLM's grasp of dimensional data structures.  **Arithmetic constraints**, involving numerical operations (modulo, division, etc.), pose the most significant hurdle and are indicative of true comprehension of the underlying mathematical properties; LLMs often struggle with these, highlighting a gap between pattern recognition and genuine mathematical understanding. Finally, **set-related constraints** address more complex relationships between data attributes, such as uniqueness or completeness checks. These constraints expose the LLMs' ability to manage intricate logical connections, indicating a potential weakness for dealing with high level abstractions.

#### DSEVAL benchmark
The DSEVAL benchmark emerges as a crucial contribution, systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to grasp numerical constraints within Data Science APIs.  Its strength lies in its comprehensive design, incorporating diverse APIs from popular libraries like PyTorch and NumPy, covering various constraint types (equality, inequality, arithmetic, set-related) and difficulty levels.  **DSEVAL's methodology is rigorous**, employing three distinct evaluation settings (full program, all parameters, individual parameter) to pinpoint LLM limitations. The benchmark's lightweight validation, leveraging SMT solvers, enhances efficiency and scalability.  **The results reveal a significant performance gap** between large proprietary models (like GPT-4-Turbo) and open-source models, highlighting the challenge of truly understanding underlying numerical constraints.  DSEVAL's public availability facilitates further research and improvements in LLM code generation, thereby paving the way for more robust and reliable DS applications.

#### LLM limitations
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in code generation, but their understanding of numerical constraints within data science APIs remains limited.  **LLMs struggle with complex or unusual input data**, often relying on memorized patterns from training data rather than genuine comprehension of underlying mathematical rules.  **Their performance degrades significantly as input complexity increases**, highlighting a lack of robust generalization. While advanced models like GPT-4-Turbo show higher overall accuracy, they still struggle with intricate arithmetic constraints.  **The reliance on memorization and pattern matching**, rather than true understanding, leads to a significant performance gap between the most advanced LLMs and open-source alternatives.  This suggests that **future research should focus on improving LLMs' capacity for true mathematical reasoning** rather than solely enhancing pattern recognition capabilities.  Furthermore, the creation of more comprehensive benchmarks is crucial for objectively evaluating these limitations and guiding future development.

#### Future work
Future research could explore several promising avenues.  **Expanding the benchmark (DSEVAL) to encompass a wider array of DS libraries and APIs** is crucial to enhance its generalizability and impact.  Investigating the effectiveness of various prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting or different instruction-tuning strategies, on improving LLMs' comprehension of numerical constraints is warranted.  **A deeper investigation into the interplay between LLM architecture, training data, and the ability to satisfy API constraints** would reveal valuable insights into model limitations and opportunities for improvement.  Furthermore, exploring the potential of incorporating symbolic reasoning or formal methods into LLMs to enhance their understanding of numerical constraints is a significant area of future work.  **Developing hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of LLMs with formal verification techniques** could lead to more reliable and robust DS code generation. Finally, research into the ethical implications of using LLMs for DS code generation and the development of mitigation strategies for potential misuse is vital.

> This figure shows three different settings used to evaluate the performance of LLMs in handling numeric constraints in data science APIs.  The settings vary in the level of detail provided to the LLM and the complexity of the task: 1) **Full program:** The LLM is asked to generate a complete DS program, including importing the necessary libraries and creating an input tensor. 2) **All parameters:** The LLM is provided with the input data and is only asked to generate the API parameters. 3) **Individual parameter:** The LLM is given the input data and all but one parameter and asked to predict only the missing parameter value. This figure also presents example problem inputs, expected outputs and the actual LLMs' outputs for each of the three settings.

> The figure shows how the authors use SMT solvers (Z3 and CVC5) to generate valid inputs and validate the outputs of LLMs.  Panel (a) illustrates input generation: SMT solvers check if a set of constraints (encoded as a formula) is satisfiable given concrete input values and symbolic variables representing the parameters that the LLM needs to predict. If satisfiable, the input is valid for the LLM. Panel (b) illustrates output validation: SMT solvers verify if the concrete values predicted by the LLM satisfy the constraints given the concrete input values. This process ensures that the input and output data used for evaluating the LLMs' performance are valid and properly constrained.
