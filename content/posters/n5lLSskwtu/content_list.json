This challenge is further exacerbated in active learning scenarios where labeling resources are constrained. Drawing inspiration from existing mixture of Bernoulli models, which efficiently compress the label space into a more manageable weight coefficient space by learning correlated Bernoulli components, we propose a novel model called Evidential Mixture Machines (EMM). Our model leverages mixture components derived from unsupervised learning in the label space and improves prediction accuracy by predicting weight coefficients following the evidential learning paradigm. These coefficients are aggregated as proxy pseudo counts to enhance component offset predictions. The evidential learning approach provides an uncertainty-aware connection between input features and the predicted coefficients and components. Additionally, our method combines evidential uncertainty with predicted label embedding covariances for active sample selection, creating a richer, multi-source uncertainty metric beyond traditional uncertainty scores.

Most AL methods focus on the selection strategy that helps the machine learner achieve better performances with an informed selection of labeled data instances. However, while AL for standard classification tasks has been studied extensively, an important task that is multi-label classification has been largely overlooked. In real-world problems, each data instance may be associated with more than one labels [11, 39, 27]. For machine learning models, the difference between the multi-class problem where only one ground truth label is associated with a data instance and the multi-label classification (MLC) problem is fundamental. Classic solutions either transforming the MLC problem into multiple binary problems or directly build a joint learning problem for all labels. With the binary approach, we lose the common underlying correlations between input features and labels. The number of classifiers may be large due to the large label space, thus the separated training process can be costly. Also, many labels are relatively rare and may depend on other labels, and we can not learn such dependencies when we isolate these labels. With the joint learning approach, the biggest challenge is to combine common labels with rare labels in a balanced way. For the rare labels, there might be few positive data instances. A typical model is likely to optimize the feature embedding according to popular labels or adopt the so-called \u201cshortcut\u201d learning, making a direct connection from the input features to the rare labels more difficult. Although we now have access to common and rare labels at the same time, it might not suffice to promote the learning of their correlations if we directly model the labels from the input features. These unique challenges of the MLC problem become more pronounced in AL settings, where the rare labels become even more scarce. They also increase the difficulty of obtaining high-quality uncertainty estimation, which is often crucial in many AL selection strategies as it allows us to know when the model \u201cdoes not know\u201d in order to make an educated decision on which data instances to label.

There are existing methods that try to capture the label correlation using such a model [17, 30]. However, to connect with the input features, they either resort to a purely conditional case, namely conditional Bernoulli mixtures (CBM) [17] or use a conjugate classification head, which is a Gaussian Process model (GP- $\\mathbf{B}^{2}\\mathbf{M}_{}$ ) [30]. For the former, a distinct set of label clusters is predicted for each data instance, meaning that the label correlations are completely separated from the learning tasks. This shortcoming makes the CBM model unsuitable for AL. The latter relies on the Gaussian Process (GP) which outputs the weights of the mixture components. For the intended task, a complete GP is too expensive [20, 16], while a sparse GP has limited predictive ability. Unlike the CBM model, GP- $\\mathbf{B}^{2}\\bar{\\mathbf{M}}$ creates a set of global label clusters. However, the label prediction for rare labels remains challenging because they can only ever be as good as the best label cluster available. Furthermore, the uncertainty quantification is superficial because it only captures the approximate covariance of the label prediction and the variance of the GP predictions. This point estimate does not fully capture the unknown and is not sufficiently effective in AL.

The uncertainty analysis can now include each evidential prediction. This flexibility is crucial in improving the informativeness evaluation of multi-label data samples as mentioned above. Structurally, the proposed model is composed of a shared encoder that provides embeddings and two decoders that predict the weight coefficients and the proxy pseudo counts correction for the Posterior Beta which models the global label cluster, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. The weight coefficient predictor is trained as a deep evidential regression model, which makes uncertainty-aware predictions of optimal assignments to the mixture of label clusters for each data instance. By using a deep evidential model as the classification head, we achieve the aforementioned improvement of efficiency during inference time. By sharing the encoder, we maintain a close connection beginning from the input features, through the weight coefficients, and to the label clusters. Compared to the CBM model, the proposed Evidential Mixture Machines (EMM) maintains a global label cluster. Compared to the GP- $\\cdot\\mathbf{\\dot{B}}^{2}\\mathbf{M}$ model, the EMM model allows adjustment to the label clusters based on each data instance. Additionally, the uncertainty information can be captured by both the fine-grained uncertainty decomposition from the evidential posterior parameters and the predicted variability in final labels. The evidential uncertainty decomposition is implemented through a conjugate interpretation of the Normal Inverse Gamma parameters, which gives these parameters a more impactful pseudo count meaning. The label variability is assessed using the covariance approximation in predictions and the discrepancy between the global label cluster and the proxy pseudo counts.

In the realm of multi-label classification (MLC) [41] [27], Binary Relevance Models (BRMs) have gained widespread use, leading to the development of various active learning (AL) models based on BRMs. Notable examples include employing the estimated reduction of a BRM loss function as an uncertainty criterion for data sampling, as demonstrated by [38]. A large portion of the multi-label active learning work do not require annotators to label all possible labels for a given data instance [25, 37, 7]. The main consideration behind these approaches is the significant reduction in annotator labeling costs. However, this strategy inevitably breaks the inherent connections between labels, making it impossible to comprehensively measure the informativeness of a data instance using label correlations. Additionally, models designed to handle partially labeled data are required, limiting the applicability of such methods. Therefore, in this paper, we will not compare our approach to these methods. Other approaches integrate the properties of the support vectors of individual support vector machines (SVM) within BRMs, using label correlation more as a means to simplify the querying process than to enhance active sampling [29, 32, 8, 9, 10]. While these methods incorporate label correlation to some extent, such as through label inconsistency [18], label ranking [26], or learning reularization[40], they do not systematically capture label correlations, potentially leading to imprecise uncertainty measures in ML-AL contexts.

Some existing models attempt to explicitly capture label correlations or use latent embeddings to facilitate active multi-label sampling. For instance, the CBM model uses the approximate entropy of predicted labels for data sampling [5], but its dependency on an external multi-class classifier for predicting component coefficients complicates AL due to the challenges in model selection and parameter tuning. Furthermore, CBM, designed primarily for MLC rather than AL, predicts distinct label clusters for each data sample without discovering global label clusters, thus limiting its effectiveness in multi-label AL [17]. Other approaches like correlationaware method for transfer learning [7] struggle with large and sparse label spaces due to their reliance on kernel functions for measuring label similarity. Compressed sensing (CS) techniques [34, 31] innovative in learning latent embeddings to capture label correlations but assume labels are drawn from a Gaussian distribution and are not efficient in AL, especially in early stages with limited training data.
