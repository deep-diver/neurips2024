It quantifies how these factors correlate with each other. For instance, it shows that data instances with a lower number of labels tend to have higher average uncertainty scores, and those containing rare labels also have significantly higher uncertainty scores.", "section": "4.1 Synthetic Data Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "n5lLSskwtu/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The relationship between average uncertainty scores, label cardinality, and rare labels", "description": "This table presents a statistical analysis of the correlation between three key aspects of the data samples: average uncertainty scores (\u0391\u03c0\u03ba(x) and A\u0177(x)), label cardinality (number of labels assigned to a sample), and the presence of rare labels (YL1 = 1 indicating the presence of a rare label, and YL1 = 0 indicating its absence).

Micro-AUC calculates the average AUC across all labels, while macro-AUC calculates the average AUC for each label and then averages these values. Higher values indicate better performance.
