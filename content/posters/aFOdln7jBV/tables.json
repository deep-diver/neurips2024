It compares their performance in terms of upper-level suboptimality (f(x)-f*) and lower-level infeasibility (g(x)-g*), achieved after k iterations, under various assumptions on the objective functions (convexity, smoothness) and the feasible set (compactness, closedness).  The table also notes if an algorithm uses a first-order or r-th order H\u00f6lderian error bound assumption (a regularity condition on the lower-level objective function), and if it requires an additional assumption related to the projection onto a sublevel set. The last column indicates the achieved convergence rate for both the upper and lower levels, highlighting that the AGM-BIO algorithm (the author's proposed method) achieves optimal complexity under specific conditions.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
