The brain's learning process, however, remains largely unclear. This paper addresses the need to explore biologically plausible mechanisms for learning in recurrent neural networks. \nThis study investigates networks pre-trained with feedback control on a motor task. Researchers found that this feedback control approximates optimal gradients, resulting in rapid movement corrections and efficient adaptation to persistent errors. A biologically plausible learning rule enhanced by feedback control improved learning accuracy and efficiency. This research suggests a promising mechanism for biological credit assignment and has implications for both neuroscience and AI.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "xavWvnJTST/podcast.wav"}
