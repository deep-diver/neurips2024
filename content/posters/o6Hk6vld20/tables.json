For hard constraints, methods like mirror/proximal Langevin Monte Carlo, projected Langevin Monte Carlo, and barrier methods are mentioned.  For soft constraints, penalized Langevin Monte Carlo is mentioned, and the paper's proposed method, Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo (PD-LMC), is highlighted.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "o6Hk6vld20/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Mean and variance estimates", "description": "This table compares the mean and variance estimates obtained from different sampling methods for two examples: 1D truncated Gaussian and 2D truncated Gaussian.  The \"True mean\" column shows the actual mean of the target distribution.  The \"Proj. LMC\", \"Mirror LMC\", and \"PD-LMC\" columns show the estimated means obtained from the Projected Langevin Monte Carlo, Mirror Langevin Monte Carlo, and Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo methods, respectively.
