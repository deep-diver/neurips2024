Existing methods, like self-supervised learning and active learning, have limitations in bridging the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning or require significant human effort, respectively.  Domain knowledge-based approaches are also limited by bias and difficulty in universal integration.\n\nIn response, this paper introduces InstructMol, a novel semi-supervised learning approach. InstructMol uses an instructor model to evaluate the reliability of predicted labels from a target molecular model on unlabeled data.  This instructor-based approach guides the target model, enhancing accuracy and avoiding knowledge transfer issues.  The research demonstrates InstructMol's superior performance on various real-world molecular datasets and OOD benchmarks, significantly advancing robust molecular property prediction.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "j7sw0nXLjZ/podcast.wav"}
