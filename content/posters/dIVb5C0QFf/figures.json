Stage 1 involves a dynamic objectives reformulation algorithm that reorganizes traditional alignment datasets to enable flexible alignment across various objectives.  Stage 2 uses a conditional weak-to-strong correction paradigm, aligning weak policy model outputs to stronger, higher-preference outputs by incorporating and combining text descriptions of various alignment objectives. This allows plug-and-play inferences on any policy model, significantly reducing training costs.
