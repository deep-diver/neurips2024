Data-driven approaches using deep learning have shown promise, but often employ complex architectures without sufficient analysis.  This hinders understanding what contributes to success and limits reproducibility.\nThis paper introduces Stormer, a straightforward transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art results.  **Key innovations include a weather-specific embedding, a randomized dynamics forecasting objective (allowing for multiple forecasts at various intervals which are combined), and a pressure-weighted loss function**.  Stormer outperforms existing methods beyond 7 days and requires significantly less training data and computing resources, demonstrating favorable scalability with increased model size and training data.", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aBP01akha9/podcast.wav"}
