This study reveals how this bias influences layer collaboration, revealing a decreasing trend in adversarial robustness and differing behaviors between narrow and wide networks during training.", "takeaways": ["Gradient descent's implicit bias affects layer collaboration in neural networks, impacting adversarial robustness.", "Increased co-correlation between layers during gradient descent correlates with decreased adversarial robustness.", "Wide neural networks exhibit more resistance to this effect than narrow networks."], "tldr": "Over-parameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent often exhibit excellent generalization. However, understanding gradient descent's implicit bias towards adversarial robustness remains a challenge. Existing research often overlooks the architectural aspects, focusing primarily on two-layer models.  This limits the generalizability of findings to more complex deep learning architectures. \nThis paper addresses this gap by exploring whether neural network layers collaborate to enhance adversarial robustness during training.  The researchers introduce 'co-correlation' to quantify inter-layer collaboration, demonstrating a monotonically increasing trend, implying a decreasing trend in robustness during gradient descent. They also observe differing behaviours between narrow and wide networks. Extensive experiments validate their findings, providing a more nuanced understanding of the implicit bias and its influence on model robustness.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science\nUniversity of Exeter", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "jV6z08u7y0/podcast.wav"}
