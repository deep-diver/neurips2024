Existing methods struggle with scalability, hindering their application to large datasets. This research tackles this challenge by proposing a new matrix factorization technique, the banded square root (BSR) method. \nBSR cleverly leverages the properties of the matrix square root to efficiently compute a factorization, dramatically reducing computational costs. The method demonstrates strong performance in both centralized and federated learning settings, achieving comparable accuracy to the best existing methods while avoiding the computational burden. The paper rigorously proves bounds on approximation quality and shows numerical experiments validating the efficiency and efficacy of BSR.
