Existing deep learning models struggle to capture the underlying dynamics of these series. This paper introduces Attraos, a novel model that addresses these issues.  \n\nAttraos incorporates chaos theory, treating real-world time series as low-dimensional observations from high-dimensional chaotic systems. The model uses phase space reconstruction and a multi-resolution dynamic memory unit to capture historical dynamical structures and attractor dynamics.  A frequency-enhanced evolution strategy further enhances prediction accuracy.  Attraos significantly outperforms existing methods on various datasets and requires far fewer parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of chaos-based modeling for LTSF.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fEYHZzN7kX/podcast.wav"}
