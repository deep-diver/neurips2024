This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel mathematical principle: Boolean variation, a new calculus for Boolean logic. This allows training deep learning models directly with Boolean weights and/or activations. \nThe proposed Boolean Logic Deep Learning (BOLD) framework introduces Boolean backpropagation and optimization, enabling native Boolean domain training.  Extensive experiments show that BOLD achieves baseline full-precision accuracy in ImageNet classification and surpasses state-of-the-art in other tasks (semantic segmentation, super-resolution, NLP), while significantly reducing energy consumption. BOLD provides a scalable and efficient algorithm for natively training deep models in binary, addressing a major open challenge in the field.", "affiliation": "Huawei Paris Research Center", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "DO9wPZOPjk/podcast.wav"}
