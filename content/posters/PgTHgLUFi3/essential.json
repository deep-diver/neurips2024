Existing methods for creating smaller sub-models often rely on heuristics, lacking strong theoretical foundations, and struggle with efficient training. Spectral model sharding, which partitions model parameters into low-rank matrices, offers a solution but needs effective sampling strategies.  This paper introduces two such strategies, one focusing on unbiased estimation and another on minimizing approximation error.  These strategies directly address the issues of client heterogeneity. \nThe proposed strategies are derived by solving specific optimization problems and offer closed-form solutions, making implementation straightforward.  Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the improved performance compared to existing heuristic methods. These contributions offer a more rigorous and practical approach to model sharding, contributing to more efficient and robust federated learning systems. The emphasis on theoretical grounding and practical applicability makes these strategies valuable for researchers seeking to improve the performance and efficiency of federated learning in resource-constrained environments.", "affiliation": "Qualcomm AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PgTHgLUFi3/podcast.wav"}
