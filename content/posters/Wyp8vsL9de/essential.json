Current methods face limitations in computational cost and accuracy, particularly for high-dimensional data.  This research addresses these challenges by focusing on generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs). \nThis paper introduces novel algorithms to solve GEPs. These algorithms leverage the symmetry inherent in many problems by using Cholesky factorization and smoothed analysis techniques.  Crucially, they provide provable forward error guarantees, meaning the computed solution is demonstrably close to the true solution. The authors demonstrate significantly reduced computational complexity, achieving nearly matrix multiplication time for PCA. This represents a notable improvement in speed and accuracy for a fundamental computational problem.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Wyp8vsL9de/podcast.wav"}
