The algorithms are evaluated based on the error and variance of the L2 loss estimate.  The results highlight the performance of the Autodiff 1-lookahead approach in this specific experimental setting.", "section": "5.2 Planning with neural network-based uncertainty quantification methods (Ensemble+)"}]
