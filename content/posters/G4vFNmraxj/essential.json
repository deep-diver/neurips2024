However, finding suitable coformer-drug combinations is challenging due to the vast chemical space and complex experimental screening processes.  This significantly hinders drug development, making efficient design methods crucial.\n\nThis research introduces GEMCODE, a novel pipeline that leverages the power of AI to address this challenge.  **GEMCODE combines deep generative models for exploring chemical space, machine learning models for predicting co-crystal properties (like tabletability), and evolutionary optimization to refine designs**. The results demonstrate GEMCODE's effectiveness in generating numerous potentially useful co-crystals, showing its potential to significantly accelerate the drug discovery process.", "affiliation": "ITMO University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "G4vFNmraxj/podcast.wav"}
