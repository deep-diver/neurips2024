Initially, the original RGB image input is transformed into the wavelet domain through a Frequency Domain Feature Encoder. Subsequently, the feature extractor extracts the frequency domain features of these input feature maps. We propose a Class-aware Frequency Domain Feature Selection to selectively utilize specific frequency domain features, which are then inputted into the classifier for subsequent classification.", "description": "This figure illustrates the workflow of the Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD) framework.  It shows how an input RGB image is first transformed into the wavelet domain using a Frequency Domain Feature Encoder (FFE).  The FFE then produces three feature maps representing low, high, and global frequency components.  These maps are then fed into a feature extractor, which also uses a Class-aware Frequency Domain Feature Selection (CFFS) component.  CFFS selectively filters the features based on class similarity, prioritizing features that balance reusability and reduce interference among tasks. Finally, the selected features are sent to a classifier for prediction.  The diagram emphasizes the role of the reservoir, which stores samples from previous tasks for rehearsal-based learning.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "XgAzCLsJAq/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The Utilization of DWT in FFE.", "description": "This figure illustrates how the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used within the Frequency Domain Feature Encoder (FFE) component of the CLFD framework.

Each row represents a class from the dataset and each column represents a frequency domain feature. The color intensity represents the activation count, with darker colors indicating higher counts.  The figure shows that certain features are more strongly activated for some classes than others.  The organization of the figure suggests that semantically similar classes (e.g., cat and dog) exhibit similar patterns of feature activation, while dissimilar classes (e.g., plane and truck) have distinct activation patterns.
