The models compared are the proposed Two-way Deconfounder (TWD) and its variants: TWD-TO (transition-only loss function), TWD-MLP (without neural tensor network), OWD-NI (One-way deconfounder without individual embedding), and OWD-NT (One-way deconfounder without time embedding).  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural tensor network and the two-way unmeasured confounding assumption in improving the accuracy of the off-policy value estimation.", "section": "5.4 Ablation study"}]
