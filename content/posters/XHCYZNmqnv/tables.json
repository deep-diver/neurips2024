The Kendall rank correlation (\u03c4) between the input margin and the logit margin is shown, indicating the level of margin consistency for each model.  AUROC, AUPR, and FPR@95 are also provided as metrics for non-robust sample detection, along with the model's accuracy and robust accuracy.  The architecture of each model is also specified.  A higher Kendall \u03c4 indicates stronger margin consistency, and better performance on the detection task is expected from models with high margin consistency. The table shows that most models exhibit a strong correlation, with the exception of a few.
