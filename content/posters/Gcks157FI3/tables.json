The comparison focuses on several key metrics: Coverage (COV), which measures the diversity of generated meshes; Minimum Matching Distance (MMD), which represents the average distance to the nearest neighbor in the reference set; 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA), indicating the quality and diversity of the generated set compared to the reference set; Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), assessing the similarity between distributions; and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID), measuring the visual similarity using rendered images.  Lower MMD, JSD, and KID scores indicate better generation quality, while a higher COV score and an 1-NNA score closer to 50% suggest better diversity.
