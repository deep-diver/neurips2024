Moreover, most traditional anomaly detection methods [4,39,60] are designed for Euclidean data, which are shown to be ineffective on non-Euclidean data like graph data [8,17,28,44,51,66]. To address this challenge, as an effective way of modeling graph data, graph neural networks (GNN) have been widely used for deep GAD [34,45]. These GNN methods typically assume that the labels of all nodes are unknown and perform anomaly detection in a fully unsupervised way by, e.g., data reconstruction [8,11], self-supervised learning [6,28,36,61], or one-class homophily modeling [44]. Although these methods achieve remarkable advances, they are not favored in real-world applications where the labels for normal nodes are easy to obtain due to their overwhelming presence in a graph. This is because their capability to utilize those labeled normal nodes is very limited due to their inherent unsupervised nature. There have been some GAD methods [12,16,26,34,49,50,52,54] designed in a semi-supervised setting, but their training relies on the availability of both labeled normal and anomaly nodes, which requires a costly annotation of a large set of anomaly nodes.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
