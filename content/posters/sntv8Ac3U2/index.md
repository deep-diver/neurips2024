### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current diffusion models struggle with prompt compliance issues like low object recall and difficulties in fine-grained editing.  These limitations hinder creative image synthesis and limit the usability of these models for complex tasks.  Manually generating fine-grained semantic maps needed for high-quality image editing is also tedious and time consuming. 

The paper proposes Factor Graph Diffusion Models (FG-DMs) to address these issues. FG-DMs model the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables via factor graph decomposition, enabling efficient prompt compliance and semi-automated editing.  An attention distillation loss further enhances the quality and consistency of generated images and conditions.  Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in object recall and image quality compared to existing methods.

> This figure compares the proposed Factor Graph Diffusion Model (FG-DM) with the traditional Stable Diffusion model for image synthesis.  The top half shows Stable Diffusion, which generates images based on a text prompt but may have low recall in generating multiple objects or difficulty meeting constraints like object location and pose.  The bottom illustrates FG-DM which models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables (semantic, sketch, depth, or normal maps), leading to improved object recall, faster synthesis (4x), better control, and increased interpretability.  Classifier-free guidance training is optional and allows for scenarios with missing conditions.

> This table presents the results of a user study comparing the qualitative performance of the FG-DM and a combination of Stable Diffusion (SD) and a Condition Extraction Model (CEM).  Ten human evaluators assessed image and condition quality, as well as prompt adherence for both methods. The FG-DM significantly outperforms SD+CEM in all four categories.





### In-depth insights


#### FG-DM Framework
The FG-DM framework presents a novel approach to image synthesis by **modeling the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables** using a factor graph. This modular design allows for **flexible incorporation of various conditioning modalities**, such as segmentation, depth, and sketch maps, leading to enhanced control and improved prompt compliance.  The framework's strength lies in its ability to handle complex scenes efficiently, **supporting creative image editing** through the manipulation of individual factors. Furthermore, **prompt compliance is improved** via a sampling-based approach, which selects the image that best meets the prompt conditions.  A key advantage is the **enhanced efficiency** gained through using low-resolution synthesis for conditions, enabling faster image synthesis compared to inference-based methods. The FG-DM's modularity also facilitates **continual learning** and allows for **training with missing data**, adding flexibility and scalability.  The attention distillation loss further enhances the fidelity and consistency of the generated images and conditions.

#### SBPC for DMs
Sampling-based prompt compliance (SBPC) offers a novel approach to enhance prompt compliance in diffusion models (DMs). Unlike traditional methods that modify loss functions during inference, **SBPC leverages the inherent randomness of DMs to generate multiple image candidates**.  An external model, like a segmentation network, then evaluates these candidates for prompt adherence, selecting the best-performing image.  **SBPC's key advantage is its scalability**. Unlike inference-based methods whose complexity grows with scene complexity, SBPC's evaluation cost remains relatively constant regardless of scene complexity.   **The modular nature of SBPC enables easy integration into existing DM pipelines**, offering a practical method to improve prompt compliance without significant architectural changes.  However, **a limitation is the increased computational cost associated with generating multiple images**. While mitigated by employing lower-resolution sampling for condition generation, this trade-off still needs careful consideration for real-time applications.  Furthermore, **the reliance on an auxiliary model for evaluation introduces additional complexity and potential failure points.** Despite these challenges, SBPC's simplicity and scalability make it a promising direction for improving the creative control and efficiency of diffusion-based image synthesis.

#### Attention Distillation
The concept of 'Attention Distillation' in the context of diffusion models is a clever technique to **improve the fidelity of synthesized conditions** like segmentation masks or depth maps. By leveraging the attention maps of a pre-trained, high-performing model (like Stable Diffusion), the method guides the training of individual factors within a Factor Graph Diffusion Model (FG-DM). This distillation process **encourages consistency** between the attention maps of different factors, ensuring that the generated conditions align well with each other and the final synthesized image.  The use of a knowledge distillation loss (like KL divergence) helps transfer the semantic understanding from the teacher model to the student factors.  This approach is particularly valuable as it **significantly reduces the need for extensive training data** for each factor within the FG-DM framework and promotes better generalization to novel inputs. The technique represents a powerful strategy for **improving efficiency** and reducing the computational burden associated with training complex generative models.

#### Adaptation of DMs
Adapting pre-trained diffusion models (DMs) presents a powerful approach to enhance image synthesis.  **This method avoids the resource-intensive process of training DMs from scratch**, significantly reducing computational costs and time. The adaptation process leverages the knowledge embedded within pre-trained models, effectively transferring this expertise to new tasks.  **Careful consideration must be given to the adaptation strategy**, such as fine-tuning or using adapters, to avoid catastrophic forgetting or suboptimal performance.  **The choice of adaptation method will depend on factors like the target task's complexity and the level of similarity to the pre-trained model's domain.** While effective, adaptation limits the ability to explore completely novel architectures or functionalities that may surpass the capabilities of existing pre-trained models.  **Successful adaptation requires careful hyperparameter tuning and a robust evaluation framework to gauge the effectiveness of the adaptation and to mitigate the risk of overfitting or underfitting.** The attention distillation loss function is a particularly important component to enhance alignment between adapted and pre-trained models.  Finally, the success of the adapted model will also depend on the quality and quantity of the data used in the adaptation process.

#### Future Work
The 'Future Work' section of a research paper on adapting diffusion models for image synthesis would naturally explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the Factor Graph Diffusion Model (FG-DM) to handle more complex scenes and a larger number of conditioning variables** is crucial for scalability and real-world applicability.  This could involve investigating more efficient inference methods or exploring hierarchical structures within the factor graph.  **Addressing the computational cost** associated with multiple conditioning variables remains a significant challenge, thus, exploring methods for parallelization or approximation techniques would be valuable.  **Improving the robustness of the attention distillation loss** and investigating alternative methods for ensuring consistency among attention maps across different factors is another key area for improvement.  Finally, **exploring the potential of the FG-DM for other generative tasks** beyond image synthesis, such as video generation or 3D model generation, presents exciting opportunities.  Further research could also focus on developing more user-friendly tools for image editing, facilitating broader adoption and usability of the proposed approach.
