Our analysis in Theorem 1 suggests that the sequence of $\\xi$ parameters provides additional freedom that can control the spectrum of eigenvalues of the linear estimator. Optimally choosing these $\\xi$ parameters can significantly reduce the variance of the estimator, leading to a factor of (up to) $d$ difference in the overall test errors of multi-step SD compared to 1-step SD.

[12], Ba and Caruana [3] proposed knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge learnt by large teacher models into smaller student models without any substantial performance drop (e.g., [30, 31, 14, 8, 33, 24, 32] and surveys in [11, 13]). Distillation also provides interpretability [23], robustness to adversarial examples [28], and defense against backdoor attacks [39, 21, 35], although stronger backdoor attacks have been proposed that bypass distillation defense [17]. Perhaps surprisingly, empirical observations show that performance improves when a teacher model is distilled into a student model with the same architecture on the same training data (self-distillation). Performance gains with one-step selfdistillation of the form Eq. (1) were first demonstrated by Li et al. [20] for AlexNet on YFCC100M. Further gains can be achieved by repeating self-distillation, as shown for the DenseNet architecture family on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 [10, Table 2]. To empirically explain such gains, Zhang and Sabuncu [44] measured prediction uncertainty on the same multi-step experiments and offered an interpretation that soft labels capture sample-level uncertainties. Yang et al. [36] also reproduced the same experiments and explained the gains as knowledge refinement on the class similarities. We will analytically study the gains that can be achieved with such repeated self-distillation. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Many variations of self-distillation have also been proposed. Snapshot Distillation [37] tries to treat previous checkpoints (snapshots) of the same model as the teacher. Zhang et al. [43] employ a group of collaborative students with no teacher. Zhang et al. [42, 41] use it for model self-improvement, and DINO [7] adopts self-distillation for self-supervised learning. Knowledge distillation is also popular for transfer learning, where the student model is trained on a different dataset than the teacher model [38, 40, 1], which is not a setting we address. With the recent scaling of data, [45], [22] are relevant works using a teacher model for either label editing or data reweighing. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Theory of distillation and self-distillation. Theoretical understanding of distillation started with Phuong and Lampert [29] studying linear student networks. Mobahi et al. [27] studied self-distillation theoretically in the restricted setting of $\\xi=1$ (i.e. only teacher supervision, no ground-truth labels), showing that in this setting, the SD process acts as a regularizer, with a few steps of SD helping, but further steps hurting model performance. We study the setting where $\\xi$ is not restricted to 1, and show a different conclusion. In particular, we observe that more steps of SD always provide an improvement, if the $\\xi$ parameters are chosen optimally. Allen-Zhu and Li [2] analyzed a stylized setting, where a different view of the data is learned by different models, and show how ensemble methods can combine the views, achieving improved test accuracy. This framework is used to show how self-distillation can also improve model accuracy by implicitly performing ensembling. Menon et al. [26] theoretically studied distillation in the classification setting, and also observed a bias-variance tradeoff underlying teacher supervision. Das and Sanghavi [9] theoretically studied one-step self-distillation for fixed design linear regression and binary classification, and showed that the student can provably achieve a lower test error than the teacher. We take inspiration from them and study the multi-step SD to characterize this performance gain, showing that the multi-step SD can outperform one-step SD by a large factor. Borup and Andersen [4] also studied multi-step SD and obtained an analytical form for the $k$ -step SD similar to ours [4, Theorem 4.1]. The crucial difference is the freedom of the $\\xi$ parameters being different at each step of self-distillation. Whereas [4, Lemma 4.2 and Theorem 4.3] assume the $\\xi$ values at each step are equal (similar to [27]), concluding that after a point, more steps of SD will result in a poorer performing model (similar to [27]); our main result (Theorem 1) is different as it says that subsequent steps of SD strictly provide more freedom, and that the best multi-step SD can outperform the best 1-step SD by an $\\Omega(r)$ factor. Similar to us, Jeong and Chung [16] also take inspiration from [9], [16] however aim to provide understanding of multi-step self-distillation in the multi-class classification setting.

Our analysis is limited by the fixed design assumption, and it would be useful to study the case of random design linear regression as well.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
