(a) When the rendered opacity \u03b1 is less than 0.5, both the front and back faces of the object coincide with each other, aligning the maximal weight with the local minimum of the distance field. (b) When \u03b1 exceeds 0.5 but less than 1, the back face, which is not rendered, is separated from the front face. The further away the back face is, the more opaque the rendered front face is. The maximum weight in this case is aligned with the position of zero distance values. (c) For a fully opaque surface, the back face is infinitely away. The scene can therefore be considered the single ray-plane intersection discussed by NeuS [4].", "description": "This figure illustrates how the signed distances and rendering weights change along a ray passing through an object with varying opacity (\u03b1).

As \u03b1 increases (0.5 < \u03b1 < 1), the back face moves further away, and the maximum weight shifts to the zero-distance point.
