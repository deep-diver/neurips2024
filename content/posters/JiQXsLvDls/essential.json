Traditional methods struggle with accuracy and computational cost in such settings, limiting their applicability in areas like deep neural network analysis and explainable AI. This makes developing accurate and efficient MI estimation techniques highly important for researchers across multiple fields.\nThis research proposes a new MI estimation method that uses normalizing flows to transform data into a simpler distribution.  This transformation preserves MI, making it easier to calculate accurately. The researchers provide theoretical guarantees and error bounds to support their approach's accuracy and consistency.  Experiments using high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that their method outperforms existing MI estimators in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. This opens up new possibilities for applying MI estimation in diverse areas, including analyzing and improving deep learning models.", "affiliation": "Skoltech", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "JiQXsLvDls/podcast.wav"}
