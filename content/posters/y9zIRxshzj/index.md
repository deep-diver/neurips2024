### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Discovering causal relationships from event sequences (e.g., stock market crashes, network outages) is crucial for understanding and predicting future events. Existing methods based on Granger causality often fail to capture delayed effects or deal effectively with noise and complex dependencies.  This leads to inaccurate causal models, limiting our ability to effectively interpret and react to events.

This paper presents CASCADE, a novel algorithm that addresses these limitations. **CASCADE uses a new causal model that incorporates dynamic delays and uncertainty in causal effects**, leveraging the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to identify the true causal direction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that **CASCADE significantly outperforms existing approaches**, particularly in scenarios with noise, multiple colliders, and delayed effects. It efficiently recovers insightful causal graphs, shedding light on complex interactions within real-world event sequences.

> This figure illustrates a simple example of cause-effect matching between two event sequences, S<sub>i</sub> and S<sub>j</sub>.  Events in S<sub>i</sub> occur at random intervals. Some of these events (with delays of 0.2 and 0.3 time units) trigger corresponding events in S<sub>j</sub>. Other events in S<sub>i</sub> do not trigger any events in S<sub>j</sub> (indicated by ‚àû). Finally, there is a noise event in S<sub>j</sub> (indicated by N<sub>j</sub>). This example demonstrates the concept of dynamic delays between cause and effect events which is a core feature of the proposed causal model.

The F1 score measures the effectiveness of the algorithm in correctly identifying the causal relationships.





### In-depth insights


#### Causal Model
The core of this research paper revolves around a novel **causal model** designed for event sequences.  This model surpasses traditional Granger causality by explicitly addressing **dynamic delays** between cause and effect events.  It tackles the inherent uncertainty in causal relationships, accounting for the possibility of events being independently generated, the chance of a cause failing to trigger an effect, and the variability of delays.  This is a significant improvement, as it offers **identifiability** for both instantaneous and delayed effects, a critical feature often missing in previous approaches.  The model's foundation lies in the **Algorithmic Markov Condition**, aiming to minimize the Kolmogorov complexity.  This is computationally intractable, so it uses the **Minimum Description Length** principle for practical implementation. The framework successfully establishes a formal connection to Hawkes processes, enhancing its theoretical robustness and practical applicability. The innovative causal model is further supported by the introduction of a novel algorithm, CASCADE, which efficiently constructs causal graphs from event sequences.

#### CASCADE Algo
The CASCADE algorithm, designed for causal discovery in event sequences, presents a novel approach built upon the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle.  **Its core innovation lies in iteratively adding and pruning edges based on a topological ordering**, ensuring that the final causal graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  This topological approach enhances efficiency and avoids cycles.  The algorithm's ability to identify true causal directions for both instantaneous and delayed effects is crucial, distinguishing it from approaches solely based on Granger causality.  **The algorithm's consistency is theoretically proven**, demonstrating its capacity to recover the true underlying causal structure under certain conditions. While the theoretical guarantees are asymptotic, the empirical results demonstrate strong performance even in noisy settings with multiple colliders, suggesting robustness beyond the theoretical limitations. The incorporation of an MDL score enables the algorithm to quantify the strength of causal relationships, providing an additional layer of interpretability.  Overall, **CASCADE is presented as a significant advance in causal inference for event data**, surpassing existing methods in certain conditions, and offering a principled and efficient pathway for uncovering cause-and-effect relationships.

#### Hawkes Processes
The section on Hawkes processes reveals a crucial comparison between the proposed causal model and existing methods using Hawkes processes for event sequence analysis.  **Hawkes processes offer an analytically convenient framework for modeling events that trigger subsequent events**, a characteristic often found in real-world scenarios like cascading network failures or stock market crashes.  The authors highlight that existing Granger causality-based approaches frequently rely on Hawkes processes, but **these methods are limited in their ability to identify true causal relationships**, particularly when dealing with instantaneous effects or complex dependencies. In contrast, the new model proposed directly addresses the limitations of Granger causality by explicitly modeling the probability of one event causing another with associated dynamic delays, making it **superior in discerning true causal directions and handling both instant and delayed effects**.  This distinction emphasizes a key advantage of the novel model, providing a more accurate representation of causal mechanisms within event sequences and offering improved identifiability of causal structures.

#### Real-World Data
The 'Real-World Data' section of a research paper is crucial for validating the model's generalizability and practical applicability.  A thoughtful analysis would assess the datasets chosen: **were they diverse and representative of the real-world scenarios the model intends to address?**  A lack of diversity could limit the inferences drawn.  The evaluation metrics employed are also key: **do they appropriately capture the performance characteristics relevant to the application context?** Simple accuracy might be insufficient; a deeper dive into precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC, coupled with domain-specific metrics, is necessary.  Finally, **a clear and detailed description of the data preprocessing steps** is needed to ensure reproducibility and evaluate the impact of any potential biases introduced during this phase.  The overall goal is to demonstrate that the model's findings are reliable and practically relevant, not just theoretically sound.

#### Future Work
The 'Future Work' section of this research paper presents exciting avenues for extending the current causal discovery model.  **Exploring 'and' relations**, instead of the current 'or' relations between causal variables, would significantly enhance the model's ability to capture complex interactions where multiple conditions must be met to trigger an effect.  This requires careful consideration of temporal proximity and ordering of events.  **Addressing the limitations of the current one-to-one event matching** is crucial, as it currently restricts modeling scenarios involving single-cause multiple-effects or multiple-causes single-effect.  Investigating techniques to handle these situations will greatly expand the applicability of the model to real-world systems.  **Further theoretical investigation into the identifiability conditions** will improve the model's robustness and reliability.  **Extending the model to incorporate counterfactual analysis** would offer powerful insights into the causal mechanisms, allowing researchers to explore hypothetical scenarios.  Finally, applying the method to a wider array of real-world datasets across diverse domains would validate its efficacy and uncover new insights into causal structures in various settings.

> This table shows the performance of four different causal discovery methods (CASCADE, CAUSE, NPHC, and THP) on a dataset where 90% of the causal effects are instantaneous.  The metrics used for evaluation include F1 score (a measure of accuracy), SHD (Structural Hamming Distance, which measures the difference in graph structure), SID (Structural Intervention Distance, which quantifies the difference in causal effects), and normalized versions of SHD and SID.  The NaN values likely indicate that a particular method did not produce a DAG (directed acyclic graph) which is needed for SID calculation. The results suggest that CASCADE outperforms the other methods in this setting.
