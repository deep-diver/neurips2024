However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in textto-image diffusion models remains to be explored. We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. We identified two main obstacles behind this issue. One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models. The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias. This allows us to integrate stateof-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly. Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework.

However, the optimization target of decoder-only LLMs focuses on predicting the next token with the highest probability based on training data distribution. As presented in Fig. 4, the pre-trained LLM provides a meaningless continuation to the given image prompt. It means that the LLM does not focus on the essential elements in the given image caption and the extracted text representation of LLM is not suitable for summarizing the semantic information of the given image, leading to a misalignment with the diffusion model\u2019s demand.

This observation is further validated through a quantitative evaluation. We attribute this issue to the causal attention mechanism of decoder-only LLMs. In the casual attention layer, each token can only attend to itself and other former tokens, while the information of the latter tokens cannot be captured.

As shown in Tab. 5, we conduct experiments on the design of linguistic token refiner. First, we compare our model with other variants with different numbers of blocks in the refiner. We observe consistent performance gains when the number of blocks in the refiner increases. However, such gain is not significant when there are 2 blocks in the linguistic token refiner. Therefore, we employ 2 blocks in the token refiner to achieve the best trade-off between complexity and performance. Besides, we also ablate the effect of the gating network in the refiner. When we remove the gating network, the performances on both benchmarks decrease. This indicates that the conditional information of time and text context contributes to better image-text alignment.

As shown in Tab. 6, we observe the model with a simple fusion technique can outperform the other counterparts with a single LLM. Besides, the collaborative refiner can further boost the performance based on this concatenation fusion. Such a result indicates that an effective representation fusion method can further enhance the capabilities of LLMs. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "6 Related Work ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Diffusion models. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [1] provides an effective manner to generate high-quality images. To train diffusion models on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, the latent diffusion models (LDMs) [4] project the images into the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders [39]. A time-conditional UNet [42] is applied to denoise from the noisy latent input. Please refer to the supplementary materials for detailed information about the optimization process. The transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in various tasks. Dit [15] is the pioneering work in adopting transformer architecture in diffusion models. Transformer models exhibit excellent scaling properties [22], which support the training of large-scale diffusion models. Recent advanced models [17, 43, 9, 25, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] in image generation and video generation mainly consider the transformer architecture as the backbone. Apart from the DDPM paradigm, Stable Diffusion 3 [9] and Lumina-T2X [25] leverage the flow matching [49] strategy to optimize diffusion models. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Text encoder for diffusion models. The CLIP text encoder [6] is popular among various textto-image generation models [34, 29, 4]. Under the image-text contrastive optimization, the CLIP text encoder can map prompts into a unified image-text space, providing valuable information for conditional image generation. Meanwhile, utilizing CLIP text encoders with larger parameters and more extensive training data [50, 51] has significantly enhanced the diffusion model\u2019s ability to comprehend prompts [29, 9]. Imagen [5] observes that large language models like T5 [7] pretrained on text-only corpora are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis. Recent works [17, 43, 52, 8, 9] usually adopt the T5 series as the prompt encoding model. Considering the excellent text comprehension capabilities of decoder-only LLMs [11, 12, 53, 32, 54, 55, 56], some works [25, 14, 13] try to introduce LLMs into the designed framework. However, systematic comparative analysis on T5 models and LLMs is still missing. LLMs with instruction fine-tuning like Vicuna [57] exhibit powerful instruction following capabilities. The multi-modal instruction fine-tuning [58, 59, 60, 37, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70] further enables LLMs to understand visual information. These models have the potential to serve as reliable text encoders.

Through experiments and analysis, we identified the core factors limiting decoder-only LLMs as effective text encoders for diffusion models are the misalignment between next token prediction training and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models, and the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with the issues, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. We further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework. LI-DiT surpasses state-ofthe-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALLE-3, and Midjourney V6.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
