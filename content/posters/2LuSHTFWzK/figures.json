The max-diam criterion measures the cohesion of a clustering by considering the maximum diameter of the clusters.  The lower the bar, the better the clustering performance according to this criterion.  The figure compares the results obtained by three different hierarchical clustering methods: single-linkage, complete-linkage, and average-linkage.

The performance metric is sepav (average separability), where higher values are better, indicating greater separation between clusters. Each dataset is represented by a group of three bars, one for each method, showing their sepav values.
