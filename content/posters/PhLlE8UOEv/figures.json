The x-axis represents the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the y-axis represents the condition number, \u03ba(A), of the measurement matrix. Each U-shaped curve represents a different combination of parameters \u03b4 (variance of the Gaussian component in the Gaussian mixture prior) and R (radius of the support of the Gaussian mixture prior). The region outside a curve indicates that the boosted posterior is strongly log-concave under those conditions, making it easier to sample from. The diagram showcases how the difficulty of posterior sampling depends on both the SNR and the condition number of A, and how the prior's properties also play a role.", "section": "5 Quantitative Conditions for Provable Sampling"}, {"figure_path": "PhLlE8UOEv/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of Langevin and boosted Langevin for Gaussian mixture prior.
