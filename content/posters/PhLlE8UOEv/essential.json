This is especially true in high-dimensional settings, where the posterior distribution can be extremely complex and difficult to sample from directly, even with prior information from denoising oracles. The limitations of existing methods are highlighted, emphasizing the need for robust and principled approaches. \nThis paper tackles this challenge by developing a novel technique called 'tilted transport'. This method cleverly transforms the original posterior sampling problem into a new one that is provably easier to sample from, leveraging the quadratic structure of the log-likelihood in linear inverse problems and the denoising oracle to perform this transformation. The authors provide theoretical conditions under which the transformed posterior is strongly log-concave, ensuring efficient sampling using standard methods. They validate their approach on both Ising models and high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models, demonstrating its effectiveness in matching or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art sampling methods.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PhLlE8UOEv/podcast.wav"}
