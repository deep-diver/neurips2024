The agents were trained using only 10 demonstrations per task.  VPDD (ours) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (PERACT and RVT) by an average factor of 1.24.  It's noteworthy that VPDD only uses RGB images as input, while the other methods also utilize depth images, highlighting its efficiency.", "section": "5.2 Results Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "Q7s8mFWqsx/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of FVD score.", "description": "This table compares the Frechet Video Distance (FVD) scores for video generation between the proposed method, VPDD, and the baseline method, UniPi [20].
