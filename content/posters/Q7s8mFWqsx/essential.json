This paper introduces a novel approach, focusing on utilizing readily available human videos to overcome this limitation.  Existing methods struggle with transferring knowledge from human videos to robots due to domain differences and noisy human data. \nThe proposed framework, termed VPDD, uses a unified discrete diffusion model to handle both human and robot videos. It first pre-trains the model on human videos to learn general dynamic patterns, and then fine-tunes it on a small set of robot videos for action learning, using predicted future videos as guidance.  **Experiments demonstrate that this method successfully predicts future videos and improves robotic action performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.**  The model achieves high fidelity video prediction and superior performance on multi-task robotic problems, even for unseen scenarios.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "Q7s8mFWqsx/podcast.wav"}
