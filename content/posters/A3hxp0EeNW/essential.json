Current graph generation techniques often produce invalid graphs, hindering their use in practical applications.  This is especially problematic when domain-specific knowledge, like planarity in digital pathology, is essential. \nConStruct is a novel framework that integrates hard structural constraints into graph diffusion models. It employs an edge-absorbing noise model and a projector operator to ensure the generated graphs consistently satisfy the specified properties.  The method shows impressive versatility across multiple constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.  Its application to real-world datasets, such as digital pathology graphs, demonstrates significant improvement in data validity.", "affiliation": "EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "A3hxp0EeNW/podcast.wav"}
