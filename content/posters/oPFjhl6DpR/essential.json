Existing methods use a fixed sample size per iteration, leading to wasted samples in simple scenarios and insufficient exploration in complex ones.  This creates a need for more efficient algorithms.\nESPO (Efficient Safe Policy Optimization) tackles this problem by dynamically adjusting the sample size based on the conflict between reward and safety gradients.  It uses three optimization modes (reward maximization, cost minimization, and balance) to adapt the sampling strategy. This approach is theoretically proven to ensure convergence and stability while drastically improving sample efficiency and achieving better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark tasks. **ESPO achieves substantial gains in sample efficiency, requiring 25-29% fewer samples and reducing training time by 21-38%.**", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "oPFjhl6DpR/podcast.wav"}
