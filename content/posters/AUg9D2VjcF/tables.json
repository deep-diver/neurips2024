[{"figure_path": "AUg9D2VjcF/tables/tables_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: A scope of \"all\" indicates that the estimator can approximate any probabilistic value, whereas \"weighted Banzhaf\" suggests that the estimator can only approximate weighted Banzhaf values. P1 refers to the property that the underlying formula does not contain any amplifying factors for all probabilistic values in its scope, while P2 means whether each sampled subset is used to update all the estimates {\u03a6i}i=1. For AME, the range of \u03b3 in \u03b3 \u00b7 U(S) could be (0, \u221e), independent of n. Originally, AME only applies to a subfamily of semi-values, but we extend it for all semi-values in Appendix D.", "description": "This table summarizes the characteristics of various one-for-all estimators for probabilistic values.  It compares their scope (whether they can estimate all probabilistic values or only specific ones), and whether they satisfy two desirable properties:  P1 (the formula has no amplifying factors) and P2 (each sampled subset is used for all estimates). This helps to understand the tradeoffs and efficiency of different estimation methods.", "section": "Motivations"}]
