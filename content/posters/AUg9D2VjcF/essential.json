However, calculating these values is computationally expensive, often requiring approximation methods. Existing methods usually focus on specific probabilistic values, leading to the need to approximate several candidates and select the best, which is inefficient.  This paper addresses the problem of approximating multiple probabilistic values simultaneously.\nThe paper proposes a novel 'One-sample-fits-all' (OFA) framework that addresses this issue.  This method leverages the concept of (\u03f5, \u03b4)-approximation, optimizing a sampling vector to achieve fast convergence rates across different probabilistic values. The study derives a key formula to determine convergence rate and uses this to optimize the sampling vector, resulting in two efficient estimators: OFA-A (one-for-all) and OFA-S (specific).  **OFA-A demonstrates state-of-the-art time complexity for all probabilistic values on average**, and **OFA-S achieves the fastest convergence rate specifically for Beta Shapley values**. The work connects probabilistic values to least square regression and shows how the OFA-A estimator can solve various datamodels simultaneously.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "AUg9D2VjcF/podcast.wav"}
