The metrics used for comparison are the Unconditional ID, MMD, COV, and 1-NNA.  Lower MMD values indicate better diversity, higher COV values indicate better coverage, and lower 1-NNA values indicate better accuracy. The results show that MIDGARD with Pl\u00fccker manifold outperforms NAP across all metrics.", "section": "4.2 Results and Discussion"}, {"figure_path": "re2jPCnzkA/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Distribution of joint categories in real data vs generated data from NAP and our approach.", "description": "This table compares the distribution of joint types (Screw, Revolute, Prismatic) in the real training data with the distributions generated by NAP and MIDGARD.  It highlights the discrepancy between NAP's generated data and the real data, showing that NAP heavily overgenerates screw joints.  In contrast, MIDGARD's generated data shows a much closer alignment with the distribution in the real data, indicating better realism and consistency.", "section": "4.2 Results and Discussion"}, {"figure_path": "re2jPCnzkA/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation of bounding-box constrained shape generation. The original SDFusion pipeline, only enhanced with bounding-box conditioning, is compared to our approach. Training on a preprocessed dataset and post-processing the generated shapes afterwards already improves the performance significantly. The best results are achieved using our bounding-box SDF prior with post-processing.", "description": "This table presents an ablation study evaluating the effectiveness of the bounding-box constrained shape generation approach. It compares the performance of the original SDFusion model with three modifications: 1) using only the bounding box constraints, 2) adding the pre-processing step of aligning dataset objects to canonical poses, and 3) using the bounding-box prior method.  The results are measured using OBBcount, OBBsum, and Chamfer distance (CD) both for generated meshes and meshes that have been post-processed by resizing.", "section": "4.1 Experiment Setup"}, {"figure_path": "re2jPCnzkA/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Shape generation results contrasting an MLP-based embedding to a GAT encoder.", "description": "This table presents the ablation study on the effectiveness of using graph attention networks (GATs) for encoding object-level information in the shape generation process. It compares the performance of using an MLP versus a GAT for generating shapes with different graph structures (a tree structure and a complete graph). The evaluation metrics used are OBBcount, OBBsum, and Chamfer distance (CD), both for the generated meshes and for the meshes scaled to fit within a bounding box.  The results show that using an MLP significantly outperforms using a GAT for this task.", "section": "4 Experiments, Results and Discussion"}]
