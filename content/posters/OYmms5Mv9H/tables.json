The Marginal score quantifies the difference between the generated samples' empirical probability density and that of the ground truth. The Classification score assesses the model's ability to generate samples indistinguishable from the real data. The Prediction score evaluates a prediction model's accuracy when trained on synthetic data and tested on real data, measuring how well the generated samples can mimic real-world patterns.", "section": "5.2 Unconditional Generation"}, {"figure_path": "OYmms5Mv9H/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 6: Ablation studies.
