It illustrates how the distance between the geometric median (GM(X)) and the true geometric median (\u03b8*) is related to the quantile radius (\u0394\u03b3n(\u03b8*)). Specifically, it demonstrates that if ||\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8*|| > \u0394\u03b3n(\u03b8*), then ||\u2207F(\u03b8; X)|| is lower bounded by a function of m and ||\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8*||, where m is the number of data points within a ball of radius \u0394\u03b3n(\u03b8*) centered at \u03b8*. This bound helps to establish a relationship between the excess error and the quantile radius.", "section": "4 Pure-DP Algorithm for Geometric Median"}, {"figure_path": "cPzjN7KABv/figures/figures_39_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance for Different Privacy Budget", "description": "The figure shows the performance comparison between the proposed algorithm (Ours) and DP-GD for different privacy budgets (\u03b5=2 and \u03b5=3).
