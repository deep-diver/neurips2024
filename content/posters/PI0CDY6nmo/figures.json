The x-axis represents 1/Amin, and the y-axis shows the pseudo-regret (up to a multiplicative constant).  Different colors represent different scenarios, where the main term of the upper bound (1/Amin or 1/Amin\u00b2) is either greater than or less than the remaining terms. The figure aims to show how the theoretical regret changes with Amin.  It reveals that OLS-UCB-C outperforms ESCB-C when Amin is very small, but ESCB-C can be better when Amin is relatively larger.", "section": "G Experimental results"}, {"figure_path": "PI0CDY6nmo/figures/figures_40_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Pseudo-regret for ESCB-C and OLS-UCB-C for randomly sampled environments (with q25 and q75 confidence intervals).", "description": "This figure compares the performance of two algorithms, ESCB-C and OLS-UCB-C, in terms of pseudo-regret on randomly sampled environments.

While ESCB-C initially performs slightly better, it shows a sharp increase in pseudo-regret towards the end of the time horizon (10<sup>5</sup> rounds). This suggests that the approximation used in ESCB-C or the impact of its 1/\u0394<sub>min</sub> term may cause a substantial increase in regret in certain scenarios.
