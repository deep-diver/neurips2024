### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vision-language models (VLMs) are powerful but often reflect societal biases from their training data. Existing debiasing methods either cause "catastrophic forgetting" (loss of accuracy after retraining) or employ a simplistic 'one-size-fits-all' approach. This paper introduces BEND-VLM, a novel test-time debiasing technique. BEND-VLM tackles these challenges by using a two-step approach. The first step uses augmented queries and a language model to find local bias directions for each input. The second step equalizes the distances of the embedding to relevant images from a reference dataset for each attribute value, resulting in a debiased representation. BEND-VLM is efficient for online use and flexible enough to handle new, unseen queries.  Experiments across different datasets and tasks show that BEND-VLM outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.

> This figure illustrates the two-step BEND-VLM debiasing process.  It starts with an initial embedding that shows bias towards males for the term 'doctor'. Step 1 (Textual Debiasing) uses gender-augmented queries ('male doctor', 'female doctor') to identify and remove bias along the gender dimension, reducing but not eliminating the bias. Step 2 (Distance Debiasing) further refines the embedding by ensuring it is equidistant to images of male and female doctors, effectively removing the remaining bias. The CCF distance metric quantifies the remaining bias at each step, demonstrating the effectiveness of the two-step approach in achieving fairness.

It compares the performance of different methods (Baseline CLIP, Orth-Proj., Orth-Cal., DebiasCLIP, and BEND-VLM) in terms of KL divergence, MaxSkew, and Worst Group AUC. These metrics assess the effectiveness of each method in reducing bias while maintaining accuracy in classifying images based on hair color, with a focus on gender.





### In-depth insights


#### Test-Time Debiasing
Test-time debiasing tackles the crucial challenge of mitigating biases in pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) **without** the need for retraining.  This is particularly important because retraining VLMs often leads to catastrophic forgetting, undermining their existing performance.  The core idea is to modify the VLM's output at inference time, effectively correcting biased representations on a per-input basis.  This approach offers significant advantages in dynamic environments where new data and classes emerge constantly.  However, challenges remain.  One key issue is the inherent complexity of disentangling biases which can be intertwined with the semantic content of data in highly non-linear ways.  Effective test-time debiasing requires sophisticated methods capable of handling such complexity and the diverse nature of data.  **Efficient algorithms** are needed to perform the necessary transformations without introducing undue computational overhead, especially for real-time or online applications.

#### Nonlinear Approach
A nonlinear approach to vision-language model (VLM) debiasing offers significant advantages over linear methods by acknowledging the **complex and multifaceted nature of bias**.  Linear approaches often assume a single, consistent bias direction across all inputs, which is a simplification of reality.  A nonlinear method can **capture nuanced interactions** between protected attributes and other features, leading to a more effective debiasing strategy. This flexibility is particularly crucial in open-set settings where the range of possible inputs is not known a priori. By tailoring the debiasing operation to each individual input, a nonlinear model avoids the limitations of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, thus improving accuracy and mitigating unintended harms.  However, the increased complexity of nonlinear models may also present challenges in terms of computational cost and interpretability.  A key focus should be on developing methods which are both effective and practically feasible for real-world applications.

#### Open-Set Debiasing
Open-set debiasing tackles the crucial challenge of mitigating biases in machine learning models **without prior knowledge of all possible classes or concepts**.  This contrasts with standard debiasing techniques that assume a fixed, closed set of categories. The open-set nature introduces significant complexity, demanding **flexible and adaptable methods** that can generalize effectively to unseen inputs.  The core difficulty lies in disentangling genuine correlations from spurious associations related to protected attributes, such as race or gender, without retraining the model.  Successful open-set debiasing requires methods that can **dynamically adapt to new inputs**,  identifying and correcting biased representations in an online and efficient manner.  **Nonlinear approaches** are especially important because bias may manifest in intricate, non-linear ways within high-dimensional embedding spaces.  Addressing these multifaceted challenges is vital for building robust and fair AI systems that can operate effectively in real-world scenarios.

#### Reference Dataset
The concept of a 'Reference Dataset' in this context is crucial for the success of the proposed debiasing method.  It serves as a **training ground** for the algorithm, allowing it to learn about the relationships between protected attributes and the visual features without actually fine-tuning the main Vision-Language Model (VLM). This is important because fine-tuning often suffers from catastrophic forgetting.  The dataset's **attributes must be labeled**, providing the necessary ground truth information for the algorithm to learn to disentangle spurious correlations.  The size of the reference dataset is a consideration; it should be large enough to offer sufficient examples of each attribute and class, but small enough to remain computationally efficient for online debiasing. A critical aspect is the **representativeness** of the reference dataset ‚Äì if it does not accurately reflect the distribution of attributes in the real-world data, the debiasing process may not generalize well. Therefore, the choice of the reference dataset is a key factor for the performance and reliability of the proposed technique, balancing size, label quality, and representativeness.

#### Bias Mitigation
The provided text focuses on mitigating biases in vision-language models (VLMs).  A core challenge is that standard debiasing techniques often suffer from **catastrophic forgetting** or rely on a simplistic "one-size-fits-all" approach that doesn't account for the complex and context-dependent nature of bias.  The paper introduces BEND-VLM, a novel test-time debiasing method that addresses these limitations. **BEND-VLM employs a two-step process**: first orthogonalizing embeddings to local attribute subspaces, thereby removing bias associated with specific attributes, then equalizing the embedding distances to relevant images for each attribute.  This method is particularly valuable for online, open-set scenarios where class labels are unknown, making it adaptable to real-world applications.  The authors show BEND-VLM consistently outperforms existing methods across various tasks including image retrieval and classification, with significantly less bias and comparable accuracy. **A key contribution is the use of local attribute subspaces**, which adapts the debiasing to each query, enhancing flexibility and mitigating issues of over-generalization.

The first step uses textual debiasing to orthogonalize the embedding, reducing the bias but not eliminating it. The second step employs distance debiasing using a reference dataset to ensure the final embedding is equidistant from relevant male and female examples, thus achieving an optimal, unbiased representation.
