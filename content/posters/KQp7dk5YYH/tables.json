Utilizing a dataset with 500 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled data points, PSPS required 1.62 seconds for linear regression and 8.27 seconds for logistic regression using 200 bootstrap resampling. The computation of one-step debiasing using summary statistics alone took 0.032 seconds for linear regression and 0.033 seconds for logistic regression. Current methods, which estimate asymptotic variance via the closed form derived by the Central Limit Theorem instead of resampling, ranged from 0.024 to 0.049 seconds for linear regression and 0.032 to 0.077 seconds for logistic regression.", "description": "This table shows the runtime comparison of different methods for linear and logistic regression using 500 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled data points. PSPS, which uses resampling, takes longer than other methods that use closed-form asymptotic variance estimation.  The debiasing step within PSPS is computationally inexpensive.", "section": "E Supplementary figures and tables"}]
