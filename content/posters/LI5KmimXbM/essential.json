Current deep learning methods focus on individual entities, neglecting the valuable information within association patterns among them. This leads to inaccurate predictions and limited understanding of underlying biological mechanisms.\n\nThe proposed method, Pattern-BERP, directly addresses this issue. It uses a novel fusion method that incorporates association patterns, improving predictive accuracy by 4-23%.  A bind-relation module enhances the representation of low-order associations. The detailed analysis of association patterns enhances the model's interpretability, thus revealing crucial biological mechanisms. This makes the model not only accurate but also helps researchers understand the underlying biology better, making it more applicable in real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "LI5KmimXbM/podcast.wav"}
