The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the number of mistakes made.  Multiple lines are shown, with dotted lines representing different baseline algorithms and solid lines representing the results of the proposed CBA algorithm using different basis functions. The variations in the solid lines demonstrate the impact of different basis choices on the algorithm's performance.", "section": "Experiments"}]
