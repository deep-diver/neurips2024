Panel (a) shows the probability density of losses for different methods. The ideal case is a Dirac delta distribution, where all losses are concentrated at zero. VFair aims to approximate this ideal distribution. Panel (b) displays the per-example losses sorted in ascending order for different methods. VFair shows a flattened loss curve compared to ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization) and worst-case fairness methods. This indicates that VFair achieves similar losses for each example, thus improving fairness.  The figure visually represents the trade-off between fairness and utility, where VFair aims to balance the two by maintaining a low average loss while minimizing variance.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "7U5MwUS3Rw/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Two situations when updating primary and secondary gradient simultaneously.", "description": "This figure illustrates two scenarios during the gradient update process in the VFair algorithm. (a) shows a situation where the gradients of the primary and secondary objectives form an obtuse angle, resulting in a detrimental component in the primary objective's direction. (b) depicts a scenario where the gradients form an acute angle, thus avoiding gradient conflicts. The figure helps explain how the dynamic coefficient \u03bb is adjusted to ensure the update direction always benefits the primary objective (minimizing loss) without hindering fairness.", "section": "3.4 Harmless fairness update"}, {"figure_path": "7U5MwUS3Rw/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Per-example losses for all compared methods sorted in ascending order on train set.", "description": "This figure shows the per-example losses for different fairness methods (ERM, DRO, ARL, VFair, FairRF) on a training dataset, sorted in ascending order.  The x-axis represents the index of the training examples, and the y-axis represents the loss value.  A vertical dashed cyan line separates the correctly classified examples (left) from incorrectly classified examples (right). A pink shaded area highlights the average loss for each method. The figure illustrates how the proposed method (VFair) achieves a more flattened loss curve compared to other methods, suggesting that VFair produces more consistent loss values across the training set.
