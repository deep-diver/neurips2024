We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution.

This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements.

Group fairness, a.k.a. statistical fairness [4], addresses this issue by explicitly encouraging the model behavior to be independent of group indicators, such as disparate impact [5], or equalized odds [6]. However, with increasing privacy concerns applied in practical situations, sensitive attributes are not accessible which raises a new challenge for fairness learning.

One branch is to employ proxy-sensitive attributes [7, 8, 9, 10]. These works assume that estimated or selected attributes are correlated with the actual sensitive attributes and thus can serve as a proxy of potential biases. The other branch follows Rawlsian fairness [11], which focuses on reducing the disparity in group utility. Unlike the former branch, the group utility here is predefined and centered, and thus it is typically not meaningful to test learned models on other group fairness metrics. Worst-case fairness methods [12, 13], belonging to Rawlsian fairness, commonly leverage a prior about the worst-off group\u2019s size to identify under-represented members and prioritize the utility of the approximate worstoff group. Such a taxonomy overlooks the differences in tasks, as the majority of aforementioned fairness approaches are designed for classification tasks. In applications where discrete outcomes (e.g. binary decisions) provide insufficient information, there is a crucial need for fair regressors. As relatively few discussions [14, 15] exist for fair regression tasks, our work bridges the gap by incorporating regression tasks into a general predictive loss under Rawlsian fairness.

The crux of the desired fairness lies in pursuing minimum group utility disparity across all groups. Since during the training phase, we are not aware of what the actual sensitive attributes are used for test data, the safest way is to ensure every possible disjoint group of training data has the same utility. To this end, we expect the training loss for each individual example to be very close, meaning that the loss variable approaches a Dirac delta distribution. As shown in Fig. 1 (a). The Dirac delta distribution essentially represents an Oracle model, where all the loss values are concentrated at zero, resulting in both a mean and variance of 0. In the distribution view, the motivation of our method which is dubbed as VFair, is to approximate this ideal by minimizing both the mean and variance of the training losses. Fig. 1 (b) also shows the comparison between VFair and other methods, using a regression task as an example. Oracle denotes models with unlimited capability that make predictions with zero error. Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) refers to models without any fairness design. Worst-case represents fairness methods that require the prior of the worst-off group (e.g., lower bound of partition ratios). Uniform model, initially introduced by [12], represents a model that performs equally poorly across all groups on classification tasks. Here, we extend it to regression. In a simplified logistic regression task that applies Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss with targets of 0 or 1, a \u201cuniform regressor\u201d predicts values close to 0.5 for each example, resulting in losses close to 0.25, as indicated by the yellow dashed line.

In alignment with the Rawlsian fairness principle, a sequence of studies has followed the Worst-case scheme, which focuses on improving the performance of the worst-off group without full demographics. DRO [13] identified the worst-off group members by a lower bound for the minimal group ratio. The behind insight is that examples yielding larger losses are more likely sampled from an underprivileged group and thus should be up-weighted, which inherits the fairness strategy for handling group imbalance [21, 22]. Similarly, [12] also considered training a fair model with a given ratio of the protected group and connected such a fairness learning setting with the subgroup robustness problem [23]. In contrast to these studies, ARL [24] introduced the concept of Computational-Identifiability to enhance the Worst-case scheme. ARL presented an adversarial re-weighting method to identify the worst-off group in the computational-identifiable region without relying on any demographic prior. This embodies the genuine essence of achieving fairness without demographics and is closest to our setting. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Harmless fairness. In utility-intensive scenarios, a fair model is meaningful only when it preserves good utility. Basically, these works engaged in discussing the extent to which fairness can be achieved without compromising model utility. Some [25, 26] searched for the so-called minimax Pareto fair optimality for off-the-shelf binary attributes and then upgraded their method to the multivalue attribute cases with only side information about group size [12]. A pre-processing method [20] accomplished cost-free fairness through re-weighting training examples based on both fairness-related measures and predictive utility on a validation set. Based on the concept of Rashomon Effect, [27] achieved fairness from good-utility models under selective labels through a constrained optimization perspective, needing a proper upper bound for the average loss. The same fairness notation also applies to regression task [15], where the prediction error of protected groups remains below some predefined threshold, and the fairness-accuracy frontier is experimentally achieved. Notably, these works more or less require direct or implicit demographic information and cannot adapt to our problem setting. A dynamic barrier gradient descent algorithm [28] was recently introduced which allows models to prioritize must-satisfactory constraints. Inspired by this, we conceptualize harmless fairness within a similar framework, enabling us to move beyond a utility-only solution and obtain a fairer model that can narrow the utility gaps among possible data partitions.

The optimization with a devised dynamic weight parameter operated at both the loss and gradient levels, ensuring the model converges at the fairest point within the optimal solution set. By capping the ${\\cal Z}_{}$ -score, our dynamic weight parameter can also prevent the model from overfocusing on outliers with larger losses. The experiments affirm that regression can be a prior-free task to Rawlsian harmless fairness because error-based metrics are more consistent with loss. Strong prior for demographics may be needed for quantized metrics like accuracy in classification tasks. As discussed in Appendix G, limitations may arise from computational costs, where VFair takes twice the time of ERM to uncover more information without access to demographic prior.

The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
