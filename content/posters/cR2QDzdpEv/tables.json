Confidence intervals are over three seeds.", "description": "This table presents the results of different preference optimization methods (SLIC-HF, IPO, Data Filtering, DPO, and R3M-DPO) on two natural language generation tasks: dialogue and summarization.  For each method and task, the table shows the win rate (percentage of times the method's generated response was preferred over the reference model) and the winning score (a normalized measure of the win rate). The confidence intervals reflect the variability across three different random seeds used during evaluation.", "section": "5.2 Natural Language Generation"}]
