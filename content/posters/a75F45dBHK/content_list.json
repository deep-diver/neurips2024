One key strategy involves sparsifying the dense attention matrix. Instead of calculating the entire matrix, Qiu et al. [2019], Parmar et al. [2018] focus on specific local blocks of the receptive fields of sequences by chunking them into fixed-size blocks. Moreover, Sparse Transformer [Child et al., 2019], Longformer [Beltagy et al., 2020] and BigBird [Zaheer et al., 2020] use strided attention patterns combined with local sliding windows to reduce computation. In contrast to using pre-determined patterns, other techniques include learning to cluster/sort tokens based on a similarity function, thereby enhancing the global view of the sequence, as seen in Reformer [Kitaev et al., 2020], Routing Transformer [Roy et al., 2020] Sparse ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Sinkhorn attention [Tay et al., 2020].

Another paradigm to reduce quadratic computation cost, is to replace the dot-product similarity between keys and query matrices of attention mechanism with a kernel function and avoid explicitly computing the attention matrix [Katharopoulos et al., 2020]. Notable examples in this family include Performers [Choromanski et al., 2020], Random Feature Attention [Peng et al., 2021] that are based on random feature approximation of the kernel function. Additionally, some models leverage a combinations of such techniques to design an efficient transformer [Zhu et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021].

The attention mechanisms calculate the input-dependent attention score matrix $A(x)$ and subsequently compute the output as $y=A(x)v$ .
