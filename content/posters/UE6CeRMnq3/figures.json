The top half shows the steps involved in the high-frequency filtering process, which includes performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the input time series, selecting high-frequency components above a threshold (F = 0.3 in this example), and performing an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to map these components back to the time domain, resulting in the high-frequency condition CH.
