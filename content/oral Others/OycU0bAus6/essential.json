This paper addresses the limited exploration of denoising models for discriminative tasks, focusing on representation learning which is crucial for improving feature discrimination in tasks like classification and object recognition.  The authors highlight the challenge of directly applying denoising techniques to discriminative models due to the differences in how they process data and extract features.  Existing methods often involve applying denoising as a separate step after feature extraction, increasing computational costs. \nThe proposed solution, DenoiseRep, innovatively treats each embedding layer in a backbone network (like ResNet or ViT) as a denoising layer. This unified approach eliminates extra computational steps because parameters from the added denoising layers are integrated with the existing embedding layers' parameters. This joint extraction and denoising process is theoretically shown to be equivalent to having separate denoising layers but without the computational overhead.  Empirical results show significant improvements on various tasks, including re-identification, image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrating DenoiseRep's effectiveness and scalability across different model architectures (ResNet and Transformer).", "affiliation": "Beijing Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "OycU0bAus6/podcast.wav"}
