Existing methods often involve complex, multi-stage training processes that hinder broader applications and may lead to suboptimal results.  A major issue is that the optimization of individual tasks in such methods can compromise overall efficiency and result in suboptimal solutions.\nThis paper introduces E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm that addresses these challenges.  **E2E-MFD streamlines the training process** by employing synchronous joint optimization across components, avoiding suboptimal solutions associated with individual tasks and using a Gradient Matrix Task Alignment (GMTA) technique to further enhance the optimization process.  Extensive testing on public datasets demonstrates that **E2E-MFD achieves significant improvements** in both image fusion and object detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "affiliation": "Xidian University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "47loYmzxep/podcast.wav"}
