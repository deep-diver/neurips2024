Techniques like CDDFuse [12] and DIDFuse [13] employ a two-step process where a MF network is trained initially, followed by training an object detection (OD) network with the results from the MF network to assess fusion effectiveness separately.

This partnership allows MF to produce richer, more informative images, enhancing OD performance, while OD contributes valuable object semantic insights to MF, aiming to accurately locate and identify objects in a scene. Typically, MFD networks adopt a cascaded design where joint optimization techniques [17] use the OD network to guide the MF network toward creating images that facilitate easier object detection.

Fusion images with good quality metrics may be suitable for human visual perception but may not be conducive to practical application tasks [16; 29]. Some research has acknowledged this issue, Yuan et al. [30] utilized various aligned modalities for improved oriented object detection [31; 32; 33; 34] to address the challenge of cross-modal weakly misalignment in aerial visible-infrared images. Liu et al. [17] proposing a joint learning method, pioneered the exploration of the MF and OD combination methods. Then the optimization of the loss function for segmentation [16] and detection [14] has been validated to be effective in guiding the generation of fused images. They consider the downstream task network as an additional constraint to assist the MF network in generating fusion results with clearer objects. Zhao et al. [18] leveraged semantic information from OD features to aid MF and perform meta-feature embedding to generate meta-features from OD features, which are then used to guide the MF network in learning pixellevel semantic information. Liu et al. [15] proposed multi-interactive feature learning architecture for image fusion and segmentation by enhancing fine-grained mapping of all the vital information between two tasks, so that the modality or semantic features can be fully mutual-interactive. However, OD considers the semantic understanding of objects, while MF and segmentation primarily focus on the pixel-level relationship between image pairs. The optimization coupling of detection and fusion tasks becomes more challenging to investigate these complementary differences, from which both fusion and detection can benefit. It is worth mentioning that these visible-infrared multimodal fusion detection methods are usually designed in a cascaded structure with tedious training steps.

In comparison with other methods, our method demonstrates high contrast and recognition of the objects. Second, our method preserves rich details from the visible images, including color and texture. Our advantages are evident in the fusion images across the M3FD dataset, such as the clear outline of the white car\u2019s rear and a man on a motorcycle.

Specifically, the largest average value on MI proves that our method transfers more considerable information from both source images. Values of EN reveal that our results contain edged details and the highest contrast between objects and the background. The large VIF shows our fusion results have high-quality visual effects and small distortion compared with the source images.
