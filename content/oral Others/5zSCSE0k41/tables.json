The comparison is performed on two benchmarks: VoxCeleb2 and OneMin-32.  The metrics used for evaluation include audio-lip synchronization (Sc\u2191 and SD\u2193), audio-pose alignment (CAPP\u2191), pose variation intensity (\u0394P), and Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance (FVD25\u2193). Higher values for Sc and CAPP indicate better performance, while lower values for SD, \u0394P, and FVD indicate better performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on both benchmarks.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "5zSCSE0k41/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: CAPP under frame shifting", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study evaluating the sensitivity of the CAPP (Contrastive Audio and Pose Pretraining) metric to temporal misalignment in audio-pose pairs.

The comparison uses several metrics to evaluate different aspects of the generated videos: audio-lip synchronization (Sc and SD), audio-pose alignment (CAPP), pose variation intensity (\u0394P), and overall video quality (FVD25).  Higher scores in Sc and CAPP indicate better synchronization, while lower scores in SD, \u0394P, and FVD25 signify better quality. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods across all metrics and benchmarks.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
