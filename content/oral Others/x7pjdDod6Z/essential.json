Existing methods either rely on dense input views or are trained on large-scale 3D datasets, limiting their generalizability and speed.  These methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes.  Some recent methods incorporate 2D diffusion models to overcome these issues but their quality is limited.\nMeshFormer addresses these challenges by leveraging a novel architecture combining transformers and 3D convolutions for explicit 3D representation.   It incorporates multi-view normal maps, along with RGB images, to provide strong geometric guidance during training.  A unified single-stage training strategy using surface rendering and SDF supervision leads to faster convergence and significantly improved mesh quality.  The results demonstrate that MeshFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while being significantly more efficient to train than existing methods.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "x7pjdDod6Z/podcast.wav"}
