Metrics are categorized into video-based (semantic-level, spatiotemporal level) and frame-based (semantic-level, pixel-level) evaluations, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy, smoothness, and consistency.  The results show NeuroClips outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across most metrics, especially in terms of structural similarity (SSIM) and spatiotemporal consistency.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "8qu52Fl1Dt/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison of NeuroClips reconstruction performance against other methods.

It assesses performance across various metrics, categorized as semantic-level (measuring the accuracy of semantic reconstruction), frame-based (evaluating the quality of individual frames using SSIM and PSNR), pixel-level (assessing visual fidelity of reconstructed frames) and video-based (evaluating overall video quality using metrics like spatiotemporal consistency).  The results are presented in terms of different evaluation metrics for a 2-way and 50-way classification, CLIP-pcc, and ST-level metrics.
