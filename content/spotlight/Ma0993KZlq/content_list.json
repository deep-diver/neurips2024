It has been used as a tool for obtaining efficient learning algorithms robust to noise [9] and as an evidence of computational difficulty of a statistical problems [20].

Similar to previous works on distribution-free learning halfspaces [9, 18, 33], our learning algorithms recursively run two subroutines over the dataset $S$ . The first subroutine is a weak learning algorithm that works under structured datasets $S^{\\prime}$ . More specifically, we assume that all points in the dataset have unit norm and for every directi\u221aon $w\\in S^{d-1}$ , there are at least $\\Omega(1/d)$ fraction of the e\u221axamples $x$ in $S^{\\prime}$ such that $|w\\cdot x|\\geq\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{d})$ . Intuitively, the regions $\\{x\\in S^{\\prime}\\mid|w\\cdot x|\\geq\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{d})\\}$ correspond to examples for which a halfspace with normal vector $w$ is more confident about the label. If $S^{\\prime}$ contains a non-trivial fraction of examples in $S$ and we can run a weak learning algorithm\u221a over $S^{\\prime}$ to learn a vector $w$ that has a classification error $\\eta+\\epsilon$ over $\\{x\\in S^{\\prime}\\mid|w\\cdot x|\\geq\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{d})\\}$ , we are able to label a non-trivial fraction of examples in $S$ with a low error. In Section 2.1, we will design such a learning algorithm that is robust to Massart noise and achieves query efficiency and computational efficiency simultaneously. However, in general, it is not always possible to find a large enough subset from $S$ that is in an approximate radially isotropic position. Forster\u2019s transform [24], a powerful preprocessing technique can be used to solve this issue. Given any set of $n$ examples in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ , we can always use Forster\u2019s transform to find a subset of $k n/d$ examples that lie in a $k$ dimensional subspace such that after a non-linear transformation, the transformed examples are in an approximate radially isotropic position.

In Section 2.2, we will show how to use Forster\u2019s transform to select a large fraction of the dataset for the weak learning algorithm and how to implement the weak learning algorithm over the transformed dataset using TSQ.

Recall that in the definition of TSQ, each $q_{i}$ answers if $\\textstyle\\sum_{x\\in S}\\phi(x,y)\\geq{\\bar{\\tau}}$ , where $\\phi(x,y)$ given every $x$ is a two-value function.

One possible way to check the answer is to let $a$ send the num ber $\\textstyle\\sum_{x\\in S_{a}}\\phi(x,y)_{.}$ to $b$ . However, if a TSQ is very complicated, communicating such a number would cost too many bits. Two arguments are made to address this problem.

Second, we show that to compare a pair of integers with bit complexity $n$ only polylog $(n)$ bits of communication are required. To see why this is true, we can expand integers $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{a}=\\sum_{x\\in S_{a}}\\phi(x,y)}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{I_{b}=\\tau-\\sum_{x\\in S_{b}}\\phi(\\bar{x_{}},y)}\\end{array}$ into binary strings.

Thus, to compare $I_{a},I_{b}$ , we only need to binary search the first index $j$ such that the partial binary strings of $I_{a},I_{b}$ are different. Since checking whether two binary strings are equal only requires $O(\\log n)$ bits of communication, we only need ${\\bar{O(}}\\mathrm{log}^{2}\\,n)$ bits of communication to compare the two integers.

Since $F_{A}$ is a bijection between $x$ and $F_{A}(x)$ and the outcome of the function $\\phi(x,y)$ for each example $x$ can be uniquely represented by two numbers, we can rewrite $\\phi(F_{A}(x),y)$ as a function of $x$ for each $F_{A}(x)$ such that for a TSQ as long as $y(F_{A}(x))=f(x)$ , the result of the query will be the same.
