We consider the online fair division setting, which introduces additional complexities as items arrive one by one and each item must be immediately and irrevocably allocated at its time of arrival. Crucially, this allocation must be done without knowledge of future items [5]. One motivating example for this setting is a food bank that receives donations for a region and then allocates these donations among many different food pantries and soup kitchens in that region. Donations are often perishable, and therefore must be immediately allocated. Furthermore, donations can be unpredictable, and hence knowledge of future items is limited. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Two standard notions of fairness are envy-freeness and proportionality. Envy-freeness implies that every player is at least as happy with their own allocation as with any other player\u2019s allocation. Intuitively, envy-freeness guarantees that no player will want to trade their allocation for that of another player. Proportionality is a slightly weaker notion, which requires only that each of the $n$ players receive at least a $1/n$ fraction of their total value for all items. Finding a solution which is envy-free or proportional is often interesting in and of itself, as can be seen from many previous results in fair division [7, 30, 12, 3]. In cases where there may exist multiple envy-free or proportional allocations, however, a natural goal is then to find the best solution among such allocations [13]. In our work, we evaluate the quality of a fair solution by its (utilitarian) social welfare, which is defined as the sum over all players of each player\u2019s value for their own allocation.

In particular, we assume that there are a finite number of item types, and each player\u2019s value for each type of item is drawn from a random distribution. In practice, these distributions would not be known in advance and must be learned as items are allocated. For example, consider again the food bank. When a new food pantry opens, the values of that food pantry for different types of products are unknown. After items have been allocated to the food pantry, however, the food bank can easily collect information on the demand for various item types at the food pantry. Therefore, we primarily consider the setting where the player distributions are unknown in advance, and a player\u2019s true value for an item is observed if and only if that player receives the item. This problem can be viewed as a variant of the multi-armed bandits problem, as the goal is to learn unknown distributions (player values) while maintaining high reward (social welfare), subject to fairness constraints; with a finite number of types of items, pulling an arm represents allocating a specific item type to a specific player.

Another crucial property is that when players have unequal values, these fairness notions can be satisfied with slack (Property 2).

Like us, they consider a setting where indivisible items arrive online and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to players. They study several models for how the values of items are determined, ranging from a model where values are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution common to all players and items to, at the other extreme, an adversarial model with worst-case values. There are two fundamental differences between their work and ours. First, Benad\u00e8 et al. [5] do not optimize social welfare; rather, they seek to either just minimize envy, or do so while (approximately) satisfying the axiomatic notion of Pareto efficiency. Second, and more crucially, they assume that the values of all players for an item are known at the time of its arrival, whereas in our model the values are unknown. It is precisely this modeling choice that induces a learning problem and underlies the connection between our setting and multi-armed bandits, which is absent in prior work in online fair division.

The other main body of literature related to our paper is multiarmed bandits with constraints. One notion of fairness in multi-armed bandits is the idea that similar individuals and/or groups should be treated similarly [9, 18, 23]. The fairness constraint of Joseph et al. [17] is that a worse arm is not pulled with higher probability than a better arm. Their definition of fairness is actually incompatible with maintaining envy-freeness (or proportionality), because maintaining envy-freeness may require allocating an item to a player with lower value to prevent envy. Another common fairness constraint in multi-armed bandits is that every arm receives a minimum fraction of pulls [10, 11, 20, 28]. This notion of fairness is also not compatible with envy-freeness because the optimal envy-free allocation may never give a player a specific item type. There also exist many other fairness notions in contextual bandits that are farther from our setting [15, 29, 32, 34]. Wei et al. [33] analyze a form of envy-freeness in contextual bandits, but their envy-freeness notion depends only on the treatment probabilities instead of the values.

Multiple works in linear bandits study \u201csafety\u201d with respect to a linear constraint that depends on the unknown true mean values [2, 8, 26]. Amani et al. [2] focus on a single constraint and specifically show that if there is positive slack in the optimal solution, then $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ regret is possible. If there is zero slack, however, their algorithm only achieves $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret. This differs from our work because envy-freeness and proportionality involve multiple constraints that can have zero slack. Note that our setting is similar but not equivalent to linear bandits, as a single arm is pulled in each step in our setting. There also exist many results for cumulative constraints in bandits [21, 22]. These are less closely related to our model as we consider constraints that must hold at every time step. Finally, there is a branch of multi-armed bandits that studies constraints in expectation at each step as in our paper. However, these works are also in the linear bandits setting and again require a safety gap that fairness constraints such as envy-freeness may not guarantee [27].

[25] apply online fair division algorithms through a partnership with a program in Indiana that redistributes rejected truckloads of food. The program, known as Food Drop, allocates $10{,}000+$ pounds of rejected food per month to food banks. In this application, the available food arrives in an online and unpredictable way, and the trucks must be allocated immediately. More generally, the specific food donations depend on what items grocery stores or restaurants have remaining at the end of the day. Therefore, donations are unpredictable, which we model through randomness.

Therefore, the organizations receive donations every 3-4 weeks on average, suggesting that donations can be largely regarded as independent.

Therefore, no equivalence class $S$ becomes smaller during the while loop. To conclude the proof, we observe that in the cycle elimination step after the while loop, the total set of allocations remains the same, which implies that the set of equivalence classes remains the same as well. \u53e3 ", "page_idx": 31}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 31}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 32}, {"type": "text", "text": "We are finally ready to prove Lemma 1 ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 32}, {"type": "text", "text": "Proof of Lemma 1.
