{"references": [{"fullname_first_author": "M. Aleksandrov", "paper_title": "Online fair division: Analysing a food bank problem", "publication_date": "2015-00-00", "reason": "This paper is among the most important because it directly inspired the online fair division setting investigated in the current paper, analyzing the practical complexities of allocating resources immediately and irrevocably without future knowledge."}, {"fullname_first_author": "S. Amani", "paper_title": "Linear stochastic bandits under safety constraints", "publication_date": "2019-00-00", "reason": "This paper is highly relevant due to its focus on linear stochastic bandits under safety constraints, providing foundational theoretical results on regret bounds and methodologies useful for analyzing the constraints related to fairness notions in online fair division."}, {"fullname_first_author": "G. Benad\u00e8", "paper_title": "Fair and efficient online allocations", "publication_date": "2024-00-00", "reason": "This is a key reference due to its close relation to the current paper's setting, also considering online fair allocation of indivisible items, and enabling comparison of results and methodologies used for achieving fairness under different assumptions."}, {"fullname_first_author": "S. J. Brams", "paper_title": "An envy-free cake division protocol", "publication_date": "1995-00-00", "reason": "This paper is fundamental to the fair division literature, introducing the envy-freeness concept, and providing insights into its properties and applications that are central to the problem considered in this paper."}, {"fullname_first_author": "Y. Yamada", "paper_title": "Learning fair division from bandit feedback", "publication_date": "2024-00-00", "reason": "This paper is crucial because it also uses bandit learning to address online fair division, enabling a comparison of methods and results while highlighting the differences in objectives and approaches, such as the use of Nash social welfare instead of constraints in this paper."}]}
