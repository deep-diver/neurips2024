However, theoretical understanding of SSL's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings remains incomplete, especially for feature selection.  Existing theoretical models often fail to demonstrate significant advantages, leading to questions about when and why SSL is beneficial.  Furthermore, computational limitations hinder practical application.\nThis paper addresses these issues by focusing on high-dimensional sparse Gaussian classification. The researchers analyze information and computational lower bounds for accurate feature selection, identifying a parameter regime where SSL is provably advantageous. They introduce a polynomial-time SSL algorithm (LSPCA) that combines labeled and unlabeled data to achieve accurate classification and feature selection. Notably, LSPCA succeeds in a regime where computationally efficient supervised and unsupervised methods would fail, demonstrating the unique power of this approach.", "affiliation": "Weizmann Institute of Science", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dlCTmEyq6y/podcast.wav"}
