Therefore, disregarding the samples for which $|x|>C_{2}{\\sqrt{d}}$ does not significantly reduce the data size. Moreover, it has minimal impact on the covariance matrix and hypercontractivity constants of the distributions. This argument easily extends to t\u221ahe batch setting. In the batch setting, we first exclude samples from batches where $\\|x\\|\\,>\\,C_{2}{\\sqrt{d}}$ . Then we remove small-sized batches with fewer than or equal to 2 samples and medium-sized batches that have been reduced by more than $10\\%$ of their original size. It is easy to show that w.h.p. the fraction of medium and small size batches that gets removed for any component is at most $10\\%$ .
