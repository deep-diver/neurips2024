### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Federated learning (FL) faces challenges with non-IID data (data heterogeneity) and high communication costs. One-shot FL (OFL) aims to reduce communication by aggregating models only once, but existing OFL methods lag behind standard FL in performance. This is due to the "isolation problem," where locally trained models fit spurious correlations instead of learning invariant features.  The paper proposes a novel method to address these issues. 

FuseFL tackles these issues by providing a causal perspective on the OFL problem and proposing FuseFL, a novel approach that decomposes neural networks into blocks, progressively training and fusing each block. This approach augments features and avoids the isolation problem without extra communication costs.  Extensive experiments demonstrate FuseFL's significant performance gains over existing OFL and ensemble methods, while showing scalability and low memory use, highlighting its practical value for diverse FL settings.

> This figure is a causal graph that illustrates the data generation process in federated learning (FL).  It highlights how spurious features (R<sup>spu</sup>) and invariant features (R<sup>inv</sup>) contribute to the data heterogeneity across different clients. Panel (a) shows the isolated training scenario in typical ensemble FL or one-shot FL, where models are trained independently and easily fit to spurious correlations, leading to poor performance. Panel (b) shows the federated fusion approach, where augmenting intermediate features from other clients helps to mitigate the spurious correlations and improve generalization.

> This table compares different federated learning (FL) algorithms based on their communication cost, storage cost, ability to handle model heterogeneity, and whether they require extra data.  It shows that FedAvg has high communication costs, while one-shot methods like FuseFL significantly reduce this cost, but with trade-offs in terms of model heterogeneity support and extra data requirements.





### In-depth insights


#### Causality in OFL
The exploration of causality within one-shot federated learning (OFL) offers a novel perspective on addressing the performance limitations of this approach.  **Traditional OFL methods often suffer from the isolation problem**, where locally trained models are unable to generalize well to unseen data due to data heterogeneity. By adopting a causal lens, researchers can identify and mitigate these spurious correlations. The core insight is that locally trained models may easily fit to spurious correlations, leading to a poor performance on unseen data. **Augmenting the training data with intermediate features from other clients serves as a crucial step to alleviate this problem.**  This intervention helps disentangle true causal relationships from spurious ones, resulting in models that generalize better and achieve enhanced robustness. Thus, exploring causality provides a potent framework for improving the performance and generalizability of OFL.

#### FuseFL Algorithm
The FuseFL algorithm is a novel one-shot federated learning approach designed to address the limitations of existing methods. It cleverly leverages the concept of **progressive model fusion**, decomposing the global model into several blocks, which are then trained and fused iteratively in a bottom-up manner. This process allows local models to learn more invariant features from other clients, thus mitigating data heterogeneity and preventing overfitting to spurious correlations.  **The bottom-up approach enables feature augmentation without incurring additional communication costs**, making FuseFL highly communication-efficient. Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates **feature adaptation techniques** to address the issue of mismatched feature distributions among different clients, ensuring smoother model fusion. By strategically splitting the model and managing the hidden dimensions, FuseFL achieves a **significant performance improvement over existing OFL and ensemble FL methods** while maintaining a low memory footprint and demonstrating excellent scalability.  The use of causality analysis in understanding the underlying issues of OFL is a key strength, providing a theoretical framework for the algorithm's design and effectiveness.  **FuseFL represents a significant advancement in one-shot federated learning**, paving the way for more efficient and robust collaborative model training in distributed settings.

#### Feature Augmentation
Feature augmentation, in the context of federated learning, addresses the critical issue of data heterogeneity.  **Locally trained models in isolated settings tend to overfit on spurious correlations specific to their limited datasets**, leading to poor generalization.  Augmenting features from other clients helps mitigate this by exposing models to broader patterns and reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts. This **enhances the robustness of one-shot federated learning**, which already faces communication cost constraints.  A key idea is to leverage intermediate representations (features) from various models rather than raw data, preserving privacy.  **Effective augmentation strategies must also consider feature alignment and semantic consistency** across clients, handling different data distributions and model architectures. The challenge lies in designing effective methods that provide a substantial performance boost without imposing additional communication or computational overheads.

#### Heterogeneous Models
The concept of "Heterogeneous Models" in federated learning (FL) refers to scenarios where participating clients train diverse model architectures.  This contrasts with homogeneous settings where all clients use identical models.  **The advantages of heterogeneous models lie in their ability to leverage the unique strengths of different architectures**.  For instance, some models might excel at feature extraction, while others are superior at classification. This diversity can enhance the robustness and overall performance of the federated system, leading to a potentially more accurate global model. However, **the heterogeneity introduces significant challenges**:  the varying model complexities and output dimensions necessitate specialized aggregation methods.  **FuseFL, presented in the paper, elegantly addresses this by progressively fusing intermediate features, rather than directly averaging model weights.** This innovative method allows it to effectively combine information from diverse architectures while maintaining efficiency.  Nonetheless, exploring further methods to efficiently and effectively aggregate diverse models remains a crucial area for future research in federated learning.

#### Future of FuseFL
The future of FuseFL looks promising, building upon its strengths in **one-shot federated learning** and **causality-driven feature augmentation**.  Further research could explore advanced feature fusion techniques beyond simple averaging or 1x1 convolutions, potentially using more sophisticated methods to handle the heterogeneity of local feature distributions.  **Integrating techniques like attention mechanisms or transformer layers** would be a natural extension, enabling FuseFL to process a broader spectrum of model architectures and data types more effectively. Investigating the application of FuseFL to **diverse model architectures, beyond CNNs** , like Transformers, would significantly broaden its reach and address the challenge of training large language models in a federated setting. Finally, incorporating robust **privacy-preserving techniques** is crucial to ensure widespread adoption, particularly in sensitive data domains.  A deeper investigation into its robustness against various adversarial attacks would also strengthen its practical applicability and establish its reliability in real-world deployments.

> This figure presents the empirical estimation of mutual information (MI) between features and inputs (I(Hk; X)) and between features and labels (I(Hk; Y)) at different layers (modules) of a model trained on non-IID data.  It shows that locally trained models tend to fit more on spurious correlations (higher I(Hk; X), lower I(Hk; Y)), while FuseFL's progressive fusion helps to learn more invariant features (lower I(Hk; X), higher I(Hk; Y)). The separability of features at each layer is also compared, with FuseFL showing improved separability, indicating better generalization ability.
