Task-wise challenges include the type of target object, the ability to perform real-time attacks, constraints on the target object, and the need for soft identification. Data-wise challenges involve the impact of human unreadability and the dependence on inter-variable correlations.  The table highlights how the proposed Multivariate Time Series Forecasting attack differs from traditional attacks by utilizing sequence patterns as target objects and addressing the unique challenges of real-time attacks, constraints on target objects, and inter-variable dependence.", "section": "2 New Backdoor Attack Setting for MTS Forecasting"}, {"figure_path": "Kl13lipxTW/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Main results of backdoor attack on MTS forecasting.
