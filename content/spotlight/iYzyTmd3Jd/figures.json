It showcases the natural and precise movements of the characters as they cooperate to carry various objects. The framework consists of three key components: individual skill learning, multi-agent transportation and cooperation, and interaction with diverse objects. The image depicts multiple agents working together to move different objects, emphasizing the framework's ability to handle tasks requiring collaboration and diverse object types.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "iYzyTmd3Jd/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Our framework employs a two-phase learning paradigm. In the first phase, depicted on the left, we train single-agent carrying skills by imitating from human motion priors. In the second phase, we transfer these single-agent skills to a cooperative context. Notably, we use the dynamics of the object as feedback information, as illustrated by the bounding box shown in the figures.", "description": "This figure illustrates the CooHOI framework's two-phase learning process.  The first phase focuses on single-agent skill learning using imitation learning from human motion data. This phase trains a policy for a single agent to carry objects naturally, incorporating object dynamics into the observation to understand how their actions affect the object's movement. The second phase shifts to multi-agent cooperation learning. It shows how the learned single-agent skills are transferred to a collaborative context. The key here is the use of object dynamics as implicit communication, allowing agents to coordinate their actions by observing changes in the object's motion caused by their teammate's actions.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "iYzyTmd3Jd/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Visualization of cooperative carrying in the multi-agent scenario.", "description": "This figure visualizes the steps involved in a cooperative object carrying task using multiple agents.
