The x-axis represents the number of guiding questions, categorized into ranges (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and \u22657). The y-axis shows the performance scores for four different pedagogical dimensions: IARA (Incorrect Answer Recognition Accuracy), CARA (Correct Answer Recognition Accuracy), SER (Successful Explanation Rate), and SRR (Successful Rejection Rate).  The bars illustrate the scores achieved by each model in each category.  This helps to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two LLMs at handling problems of varying complexity and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each model across different aspects of the teaching process.", "section": "6.2 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "qkoZgJhxsA/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Effects of dialogue scale.", "description": "This figure shows the impact of varying the scale of multi-round dialogues on the performance of SocraticLM across five pedagogical dimensions: Overall Quality, IARA, CARA, SER, and SRR.  The x-axis represents the percentage of multi-round dialogues used in training (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and 125%), while the y-axis shows the corresponding performance scores for each dimension.  The results indicate that increasing the amount of training data generally improves performance, but there may be diminishing returns beyond a certain point (around 75% in this case).  The IARA metric, specifically, shows a slight decrease at the 125% data scale, suggesting the importance of balancing different types of training data to avoid overfitting.", "section": "6.2 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "qkoZgJhxsA/figures/figures_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Effects of problem-solving data scale.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of SocraticLM on the problem-solving tasks (GSM8K and MAWPS) with different ratios of problem-solving data to dialogue data.  The x-axis represents the ratio (\u03b1) of problem-solving data, and the y-axis represents the accuracy. The results show that an optimal ratio exists, and having too much or too little problem-solving data leads to suboptimal performance.
