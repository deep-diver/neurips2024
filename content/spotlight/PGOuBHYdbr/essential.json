However, existing TS algorithms suffer from exponential regret, meaning their performance degrades rapidly as the problem size increases. This is a significant limitation, hindering their use in many real-world applications. \nThe paper introduces a novel variant of TS called Boosted Gaussian Combinatorial Thompson Sampling (BG-CTS) to overcome the exponential regret. **BG-CTS incorporates a carefully designed exploration boost that improves finite-time performance without affecting asymptotic optimality.**  The authors prove that BG-CTS achieves polynomial regret, a significant improvement over existing TS algorithms. They also demonstrate the mismatched sampling paradox, where a seemingly suboptimal sampling approach surprisingly outperforms the optimal one.", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PGOuBHYdbr/podcast.wav"}
