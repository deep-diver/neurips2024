### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) often fail to generalize well to unseen data, a problem known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper focuses on a specific aspect of OOD, called compositional generalization, and introduces a new way to evaluate it called "rule extrapolation."  Rule extrapolation studies how well LLMs can extend rules learned from training data to new, unseen situations, where some rules are broken. The study uses formal languages to create controlled test scenarios that allow for precise measurement of OOD performance.

The researchers evaluate the performance of several different types of language models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and state-space models, on a variety of formal languages.  The experiments reveal that the performance of different LLMs varies greatly depending on the specific type of language and the types of rules violated.  This research also lays the groundwork for a new theoretical framework based on algorithmic information theory to explain and predict OOD generalization behavior in LLMs.

![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/Li2rpRZWjy/tables_1_1.jpg)

> This table lists six formal languages used in the paper, categorized according to the Chomsky hierarchy (regular, context-free, context-sensitive). Each language is defined by the intersection of two rules (R1 and R2).  The table is crucial for understanding the experimental setup, as these languages are used to evaluate the models' ability to extrapolate rules in out-of-distribution scenarios.





### In-depth insights


#### Rule Extrapolation
The concept of "Rule Extrapolation" presents a novel approach to evaluating the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities of language models.  Instead of focusing on overall performance, it dissects the model's ability to extrapolate individual rules governing a formal language, even when other rules are violated. This granular analysis offers **deeper insights** into how models handle compositional generalization.  By employing formal languages with varying complexity, the research can systematically probe the influence of architecture, revealing whether certain designs exhibit inherent biases towards rule extrapolation.  The introduction of a normative theory based on algorithmic information theory provides a valuable framework for assessing not just what models *do*, but what they *should* do in such OOD scenarios. This provides a rational basis to evaluate OOD behaviour and helps explain empirically observed biases towards simpler rules.  **Formal languages** offer a controlled environment to rigorously study these behaviors, but the study highlights the need to extend research to more complex, naturalistic language scenarios.  Overall, "Rule Extrapolation" offers a significant step forward in understanding the OOD generalization phenomenon in language models.

#### Model Architectures
The effectiveness of various model architectures in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data, specifically within the context of rule extrapolation in formal languages, is a central theme.  The study compares the performance of **linear models, LSTMs, Transformers, and State Space Models (SSMs)**, each possessing distinct inductive biases.  The results reveal that no single architecture universally excels; **Transformers show strength in context-free and context-sensitive languages**, while **LSTMs and SSMs (Mamba) outperform on regular languages**.  This highlights the importance of architectural considerations when addressing OOD generalization, and suggests that the optimal architecture is heavily dependent on the complexity and structure of the underlying language or task.  Further investigation into the interplay between inductive biases and the capacity for rule extrapolation is warranted to fully understand these findings.

#### Formal Language
The concept of formal languages plays a crucial role in the paper, serving as a **controlled environment** to investigate the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities of language models.  Formal languages, with their precisely defined syntax and rules, offer a distinct advantage over natural language datasets, which are often noisy and ambiguous. By focusing on formal languages, the study isolates the impact of architectural design on the models' capacity to **extrapolate rules** beyond their training data.  This approach allows for a more systematic investigation, enabling a finer-grained analysis of model behaviors in OOD scenarios and providing valuable insights into how various language model architectures approach compositional generalization.  **The choice of formal languages of varying complexities**, ranging from regular to context-sensitive, is particularly insightful, allowing the researchers to probe the limits of different architectural designs and discern their strengths and weaknesses in handling complex grammatical structures.  This rigorous approach significantly enhances the reliability and interpretability of the study's findings.

#### Normative Theory
The paper introduces a 'Normative Theory' section to address the limitations of existing approaches to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.  Instead of merely observing model behavior, the authors aim to establish what a *rational* model *should* do. This is achieved by proposing a novel prior inspired by Solomonoff's induction, which is a framework from algorithmic information theory. **This prior assigns higher probabilities to simpler explanations consistent with training data**, reflecting Occam's razor. By conditioning this prior on training data, the authors enable the prediction of OOD prompts' completions based on the simplest consistent explanation, which offers a rational basis for rule extrapolation, a specific type of compositional generalization.  **The uncomputability of this prior is acknowledged, but its value lies in providing a normative benchmark** and explaining empirically observed model behaviors, particularly the simplicity bias of Transformers.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this rule extrapolation study are multifaceted.  **Extending the investigation beyond formal languages to encompass real-world datasets and more complex linguistic structures** is crucial to validate the generalizability of the findings and assess the practical impact of the proposed normative theory.  **A deeper analysis of the interplay between architectural choices and rule extrapolation performance across various model sizes and training regimes** is warranted.  **Investigating the efficacy of alternative training paradigms, beyond the current implementations, to optimize rule extrapolation** and potentially bridging the gap between human and model performance would prove highly insightful.  Finally, refining the normative theory by exploring computationally feasible approximations of the Solomonoff prior and integrating insights from mechanistic interpretability would strengthen the theoretical foundation of this significant area of research.  This would permit stronger links to be made between the normative theory and the empirical observations, furthering our understanding of compositional generalization in language models.

> This figure is a graphical model showing how the proposed method for out-of-distribution (OOD) prompt completion works.  The model assumes that the language model (LM) generates both in-distribution (ID) and OOD completions independently, following the same procedure. The blue connections in the graph represent this shared process.  Despite the LM assigning zero probability to the OOD prompt, a conditional probability distribution for the OOD completions is defined, allowing the model to predict a completion even in this low-probability scenario.
