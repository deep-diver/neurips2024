Existing methods, like the debiased Lasso, provide asymptotic confidence intervals that can be too narrow due to a significant bias term in finite-sample settings, leading to overconfidence in predictions. This is especially problematic in applications demanding high certainty, such as medical imaging.  This paper tackles this crucial problem by developing a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression, applicable to both classical optimization methods and neural networks. \nThe core method involves a data-driven adjustment that corrects confidence intervals for finite-sample data by estimating the bias terms from training data. This leverages high-dimensional concentration phenomena, resulting in non-asymptotic confidence intervals that are more reliable than existing asymptotic methods.  The approach extends beyond the sparse regression setting to neural networks, significantly enhancing the reliability of model-based deep learning and bridging the gap between established theory and practical applicability.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical experiments on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging data, showcasing its accuracy and improved coverage compared to existing approaches.", "affiliation": "RWTH Aachen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "RQCmMSSzvI/podcast.wav"}
