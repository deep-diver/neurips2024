However, the paper reveals a critical flaw: anchored training can lead to models learning undesirable shortcuts, reducing generalization capabilities.  This is especially problematic when using diverse reference data during training. \n\nTo overcome this, the authors introduce a novel \"reference masking\" regularizer. This technique involves masking out the reference input during a portion of training, forcing the network to focus on the residual information and preventing it from relying on shortcuts.  Empirical evaluations show that this method significantly enhances model performance in generalization, calibration, and robustness to unseen data, surpassing standard training approaches on various datasets and architectures.", "affiliation": "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "xymhWyiZOp/podcast.wav"}
