With increase in reference set size, anchoring explores more diverse combinations of reference-residual pairs with the hope of demonstrating improved generalization performance.

We propose reference masking, a simple regularization strategy for training anchored models that recovers the lost performance.", "description": "The figure shows the impact of the size of the reference set on the performance of anchored training.  Two subfigures (a) and (b) present results for CIFAR10C and CIFAR100C datasets respectively.  The x-axis represents the size of the reference set, while the y-axis shows the average accuracy.  The plots reveal that increasing the reference set size does not improve performance as expected with the standard anchored training approach. A proposed method (reference masking) is introduced which shows significant performance improvement.", "section": "2 A Closer Look into Anchored Training and Inference"}, {"figure_path": "xymhWyiZOp/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Impact of reference set size on anchored training performance.
