(a) shows the traditional window-based grouping, where voxels are grouped into fixed-size windows. (b) illustrates curve-based grouping, which uses a space-filling curve to serialize voxels into sequences, but may still result in spatial proximity loss.  (c) presents the proposed Voxel Mamba method, which employs a group-free strategy, serializing all voxels into a single sequence to maintain complete spatial proximity and avoid the complexity limitations of large groups in Transformers.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "gHYhVSCtDH/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Top: The overall architecture of our proposed Voxel Mamba with N Dual-scale SSM Blocks (DSBs). Bottom: Illustration of the DSB, including a residual connection, a forward SSM branch, and a backward SSM branch.", "description": "This figure illustrates the overall architecture of Voxel Mamba, a novel 3D object detection model based on state space models (SSMs).  The top panel shows the complete architecture, highlighting the use of multiple Dual-scale SSM Blocks (DSBs), a forward SSM branch and a backward SSM branch to process the voxel sequence. The bottom panel provides a detailed view of the DSB, showing how the forward and backward SSMs operate with downsampling and upsampling operations to integrate high and low-resolution information for improved spatial proximity. The model uses Hilbert Input Layer to serialize voxels from point clouds into a single sequence before feeding into the SSMs.", "section": "3.2 Overall Architecture"}, {"figure_path": "gHYhVSCtDH/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Detection performance (mAPH/L2) vs. speed (FPS) on Waymo.", "description": "This figure shows a comparison of different 3D object detection methods on the Waymo Open Dataset, plotting their performance (measured by mean Average Precision at level 2, mAPH/L2) against their inference speed (frames per second, FPS).  It visually compares the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for various state-of-the-art methods, including Voxel Mamba, DSVT-Voxel, LargeKernel3D, PV-RCNN++, VoxSet, SST, Part_A2, CenterPoint-Voxel, CenterPoint-Pillar, Second, and PointPillar.

Voxel Mamba's larger ERF is highlighted, showing its advantage in capturing more comprehensive local regions in 3D space compared to the other two methods.", "section": "4.5 Effective Receptive Field of Voxel Mamba"}]
