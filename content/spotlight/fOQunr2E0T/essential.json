Hybrid neurosymbolic techniques, while successful, face scalability and flexibility issues. This is because they primarily rely on symbolic computation, using neural networks only for parameterization. This paper introduces a novel unified neurosymbolic system where transformations are interpreted as both symbolic and neural computations. \nThe proposed approach uses Sparse Coordinate Trees (SCT) to represent trees efficiently in vector space, significantly improving model efficiency and extending applicability beyond tree-to-tree problems to the more general sequence-to-sequence tasks. The improved Sparse Differentiable Tree Machine (sDTM) maintains strong generalization capabilities while avoiding the pitfalls of purely symbolic approaches.  The experiments demonstrate sDTM's superior performance compared to fully neural and other neurosymbolic methods across a variety of out-of-distribution shifts.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Machine Translation"}, "podcast_path": "fOQunr2E0T/podcast.wav"}
