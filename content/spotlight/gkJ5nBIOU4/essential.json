However, communication between devices and a central server is often a bottleneck due to the large size of models and network limitations. This paper focuses on improving communication efficiency by reducing the amount of data transferred. Current methods often struggle to minimize server-to-worker communication costs, especially in nonconvex settings (where the optimization problem is more difficult). \nThis research introduces two novel algorithms, MARINA-P and M3, designed to efficiently compress data sent from the server to the worker nodes. MARINA-P uses a technique called correlated compressors to reduce downlink communication, demonstrating theoretical improvements that are confirmed by experiments. M3 goes further by incorporating both uplink and downlink compression, further boosting efficiency and showcasing that communication complexity can improve with more worker nodes.  The algorithms show that carefully designed compression can significantly improve communication efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy.  These findings are particularly important for applications with limited bandwidth or a large number of worker nodes, like federated learning.", "affiliation": "KAUST", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gkJ5nBIOU4/podcast.wav"}
