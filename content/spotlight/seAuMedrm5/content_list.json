This new phenomenon enables a simpler and more efficient model, the \u201cAligner-Encoder\u201d.

It appears in several widespread applications including machine translation and automatic speech recognition (ASR). In ASR, which is the focus of this paper, the two sequences lie in completely different modalities, and the audio input representation is typically much longer than the output text. Thus, in addition to identifying and converting speech sounds, the model must find an \u201calignment\u201d that moves information from wherever it appears in the input sequence to wherever it belongs in the output. Among other issues, the many possible variations in the pace of pronunciation make transduction a challenging problem. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "More than a decade ago, and almost a decade apart, two powerful algorithms relying on dynamic programming were developed to perform the sequence transduction task with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The motivation behind these algorithms was that RNNs require training every output frame in the sequence\u2014with one output per input frame, they needed to be trained with alignments already prepared. The new algorithms allowed training without prepared alignments by computing the probability of the label marginalized over all possible alignments as the optimization objective. The differences in sequence length are accommodated by learning to output \u201cblank\u201d symbols in between true labels and post-processing them out at inference time. The first algorithm, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) [1], models the output frames as conditionally independent, and this limitation was overcome in the follow-on work RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) [2], which introduced auto-regressive decoding to achieve better performance.

It uses a learned mechanism to account for alignments [3\u20136]; the encoder is followed by a recurrent decoder that cross-attends at every step between its RNN state and the entire encoder embedding sequence to produce its next state. The cross-entropy loss is applied straightforwardly between the plain label sequence and the leading output frames, with no blank symbol and no dynamic programming required. The resulting model produces its output auto-regressively until an end-of-sentence $(<\\tt E O S>)$ token halts decoding.

Beyond that, RNN-T training requires computing potentially unwieldy tensor quantities to do with cross-pairing every frame of input with every token of output. Both models suffer inefficiencies in decoding. RNN-T processes all frames recurrently while producing a typically much shorter output sequence.

Our main contribution is to show that it is now possible to train neural network speech recognizers with light-weight decoders in the style of RNN-T, but with the simple frame-wise cross-entropy loss of AED. The resulting networks provide accuracy remarkably close to state-ofthe-art models while being more efficient at training and decoding than any previous model. No explicit dynamic programming is employed; instead, the encoder learns to perform the alignment internally during the forward pass.

For several years now, however, ASR systems have benefited from the adoption of more powerful transformer encoders, but without changing their role. Our Aligner-Encoders are different in that, simultaneous to encoding, they perform the additional task of moving the relevant information to the beginning of the embedding sequence into a label-aligned position. As it is performed solely through the self-attention mechanism within the forward pass of the encoder, one might call this a \u201cself-transducer\u201d.

In Monotonic RNN-T [28], the loss and decoder are modified to step forward every frame, preventing multiple token emissions per label and speeding up the decoder complexity to $O(T)$ . More recently, [12] proposed a method to reduce memory usage of the RNN-T loss, especially for cases with large vocabulary size such as Chinese character-based, by using a linearized joint network first to identify a relevant sub-region of the lattice likely to contain the true alignment. They only compute the full joint network on that sub-region and still train successfully. Another issue with RNN-T systems arises when trying to treat the prediction network as a language model, which can be improved through text-only training, because its language modeling function is polluted by having to predict blanks. To ameliorate this, multiple works [29\u201331] have introduced a separate network component for predicting blanks, and re-formulated the overall prediction model accordingly, resulting in much greater receptiveness to language training. One aim of our design was to avoid the use of blank tokens entirely, although in the present work we do not pursue additional text training.

It steps forwards through the encoder frames one at a time, accumulating weighted information from the embedding until an activation threshold is reached, upon which a token is emitted. CTC and attention-based systems have previously been combined [36, 37] resulting in improved learning and decoding, and it is not uncommon to train AED models with a CTC auxiliary loss. We did not pursue the analogous combination of non-AR and AR decoders for Aligners, although it would be simple to implement. Another interesting, concurrent line of work is the Bayes-CTC [38] and Bayes-Transducer [39] models, which add a modulating factor to the respective losses in order to encourage earlier token emission in decoding; however, only our simpler model achieves full text alignment with no blank embedding frames between tokens.

In RNN-T it reduces the number of decoder steps, which scale with $T$ , and can in some circumstances be carried out to an extreme, packing multiple labels per frame [41].

A key design point of our model is to keep the benefti of auto-regressive modeling while removing as much computation as possible from the auto-regressive loop. Desirable extensions to our model for ASR that would require further study include: use in streaming recognition, ability for multilingual recognition, and incorporation of traditional pretrained encoders, to name a few. Fusion with an external language model [24] could be simplified relative to RNN-T owing to the absence of blank tokens, and for the same reason our model may be more receptive to training on other losses such as from text-only data. Looking beyond ASR, application to machine (text) translation would require some modification to permit output sequences longer than the input, although speech translation would not.
