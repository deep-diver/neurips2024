[{"figure_path": "u6XxyuD3Ro/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The RESET algorithm with 8 trials. Left: The generation of the base actions and mixing weights. Purple numbers denote levels and black numbers denote trials. Each segment (rectangle) in the figure runs an instance of the base algorithm (generating the base actions). The mixing weights for each segment in the figure reset at the start of each segment. Mixing weight updates are dependent on the segment length. Right: The computation of the action xt on trial t. Purple numbers denote levels. Blue balls denote base actions, red balls denote mixing weights, and black balls denote propagating actions. The final black arrow is the output xt.", "description": "The figure illustrates the RESET algorithm with 8 trials. The left panel shows how the base actions and mixing weights are generated for each level and trial. Each level runs an instance of the base algorithm, and the mixing weights are reset at the start of each segment (whose length determines how the mixing weights update). The right panel shows how the algorithm computes the action xt on trial t using a combination of base actions, mixing weights, and propagating actions.", "section": "3 The Algorithm"}]
