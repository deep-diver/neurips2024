In contrast, TetSphere, with its volumetric representation, maintains the most integral structure. 2) Both MeshLRM and TripoSR generally produce more physically stable 3D objects, as indicated by Mean Stress and Standability (Standable.) metrics. However, they tend to diverge under gravity, as shown by the Matching Loss metric (Img. Loss), compared to TetSphere. 3) Notably, our method consistently enhances the physical compatibility performance across all baselines. The improvement is particularly significant for Wonder3D and MeshLRM. Wonder3D typically generates multi-view images before reconstructing the 3D shape, which can lead to thin structures due to inconsistencies across the views.

Unlike existing methods that often ignore one or more dimensions, our framework holistically considers all three factors, allowing for diverse rest-shape geometries from the same input image by varying object stiffness and external forces. We formulate physical compatibility optimization as a constrained optimization problem by integrating static equilibrium as a hard constraint. Our approach produces physical objects that match the geometry depicted in the input image under external forces and remain stable under gravity. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated improvements in physical compatibility over existing baselines. Our method\u2019s versatility is evident through its integration with various single-view reconstruction methods and its practical applications in dynamic simulations and 3D printing.

Although this provides controllability of the final optimized rest-shape geometry, automating the extraction of these parameters from a single image presents a potential avenue for future work. Moreover, our method relies on the use of a tetrahedral mesh, which is derived by tetrahedralizing the output geometry produced by baseline methods. A natural extension of our work is the development of a differentiable converter that can transform any geometric representation into a tetrahedral mesh. This would enable future research where our physical compatibility optimization could be integrated into a pre-trained large reconstruction model, which could then be fine-tuned to directly produce physically compatible 3D objects. Lastly, our current methodology focuses solely on physical objects in a state of static equilibrium. Exploring the reconstruction of 3D objects undergoing dynamics captured from video is an intriguing prospect for future research.
