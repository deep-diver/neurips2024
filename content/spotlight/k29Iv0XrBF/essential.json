This significantly limits their applicability in various fields requiring physically accurate models, such as robotics, animation and manufacturing.  Addressing these limitations is crucial for broadening the applications of single-image 3D modeling. \nThis research introduces a novel computational framework that incorporates physical compatibility into the 3D reconstruction process. By explicitly decomposing a physical object's visual representation into its mechanical properties, external forces, and rest-shape geometry, and linking them through static equilibrium, the framework generates physically accurate 3D models that closely match input images and behave realistically under real-world forces. The method is rigorously evaluated and demonstrates significant improvements in physical realism compared to existing techniques.  The resulting models are shown to be suitable for dynamic simulations and 3D printing, showcasing the framework's practical utility.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "k29Iv0XrBF/podcast.wav"}
