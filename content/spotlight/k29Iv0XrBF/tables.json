[{"figure_path": "k29Iv0XrBF/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results on four metrics evaluating physical compatibility. We apply our pipeline to five single-image reconstruction techniques and assess our metrics on both the initial shapes from these methods (Baseline) and the optimized shapes from the integration of our framework with each baseline (Ours). Our method demonstrates quantitative improvements in mean stress, stability rate, and image fidelity across all benchmarks. Among all methods, TetSphere integrated with our framework achieves superior performance across all evaluation metrics. This can be attributed to the explicit volumetric representation used in TetSphere. The mean and standard deviation are calculated across all examples for each method. A higher deviation in Mean Stress suggests a larger variance in structural thickness and curvature, while a higher deviation in Img. Loss indicates a larger variance in static shape deformation.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of physical compatibility metrics between baseline single-image 3D reconstruction methods and those methods enhanced by the proposed physical compatibility optimization.  Four metrics are used: the number of connected components (#CC), mean stress (kPa), standability percentage, and image loss. Lower #CC and mean stress, as well as higher standability percentage and lower image loss indicate better physical compatibility. The results show consistent improvement across all methods when the optimization is applied, with TetSphere exhibiting the most significant gains.", "section": "4.2 Quantitative Results"}]
