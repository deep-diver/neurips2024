Consequently, we position LLMs as a central pivot and strive to compel LLMs per se to develop visual perception while preserving original linguistic proficiency. The process is not a light breeze.

On the contrary, we transmit visual signals almost losslessly into encoder-free VLMs. This operation can allow VLMs to autonomously acquire the necessary visual-semantic information. By aligning with patch features captured from vision backbones and text labels predicted by encoder-based VLMs, we implicitly embed visual encoders with input-restricted patterns into encoder-free VLMs for comprehensive visual perception and cognition.

Commercial VLMs extend the capabilities of their proprietary LLM to incorporate images, texts, audio, and videos, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude-3V series [1], StepFun\u2019s Step-1V [68], xAI\u2019s Grok-1.5V [79], Apple\u2019s MM1 [58], Google\u2019s Gemini series [74], and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4V [83].

However, limited by pre-trained resolution, vision encoders are compelled to partition images into multiple slices or explore a dual-path architecture for low-resolution and high-resolution images respectively, resulting in significant image distortion, fragmented relationship between image slices, and additional computational consumption. For model deployment, some popular open-source libraries, e.g., SGLang [91] or vLLM [39] already support inference acceleration for auto-regressive prediction of encoder-based VLMs. However, as the capacity of vision encoders scales up, the deployment efficiency of vision models would increasingly become a bottleneck for encoder-based VLMs. Meanwhile, how to match the capacities and capabilities between LVMs and LLMs for encoder-based VLMs remains a highly debatable problem with no definitive conclusion. Some studies [49, 51] highlight the notable benefits via substituting CLIP-ViT-B with stronger CLIP-ViT-L-336px in enhancing multimodal models alongside Vicuna-7B [10]. Conversely, other findings [65] indicate that larger vision encoders may not be necessary, as features of multi-scale smaller ones can approximate their performance. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art approaches [9, 70] exhibit significant performance improvements by introducing extremely LVMs. Based on these observations, we attempt to explore a pure decoder-only VLM excluding vision encoders and integrate vision-language understanding and reasoning capabilities into one unified architecture.

In response, we explore a practical and promising direction toward developing pure VLMs and breaking the obstacles between encoder-based and encoder-free VLMs. We reveal two crucial lessons: (1) Before scaling up pre-trained data, it is essential to prioritize vision-language pre-alignment from an LLM-centric perspective.

In Table 5, we display the influence of our training strategies, including pre-training and supervised fine-tuning stages. We discover that (1) without LLM-guided pre-aligning between vision and language in Stage 1, the entire pre-training process becomes unstable and suffers from sudden collapse. This results in an unusual situation where performance rapidly decreases as data volume increases beyond a certain point, as shown in Figure 5. We assume that the randomly initialized PEL introduces significant noise and negative interference into network optimization for severely turning LLM into VLM, exacerbated by accumulation problems. Hence, Stage 1 stabilizes the training process and seamlessly transitions into Stage 2, emphasizing its indispensable role in efficient training to construct an encoder-free VLM. This stage prevents collapses and expedites convergence, guaranteeing a smooth and robust training route. (2) Increasing image resolutions and incorporating diverse instruction data in Stage 3 bring extreme performance gains after obtaining a well-aligned state across modalities in Stage 1-2. The high-resolution property greatly enhances fine-grained visual recognition, particularly for charts, tables, OCR information, and high-definition samples. Moreover, due to the extensive pre-training data, there is a pressing need for more supervised fine-tuning data to improve inherent linguistic proficiency, commonsense knowledge, and instruction-following patterns forgotten by EVE.

Our findings solidify the superiority of multi-layer aggregation over singularly relying on the last layer output. That is because a competitive interplay unfolds within the dynamic mapping space between vision and text, resulting in projection coupling and mutual interference within the last layer of LLM.

(2) EVE shows consistent performance gains with scaled-up data, gradually approaching the encoder-based model\u2019s performance. This may be because encoding and aligning vision and text in a unified network is more challenging and requires more training data, making encoder-free models less prone to overfitting compared to encoder-based ones.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
