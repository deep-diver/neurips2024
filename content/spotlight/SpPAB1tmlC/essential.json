Training pure decoder-only VLMs without encoders has been challenging due to slow convergence and performance gaps. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel training recipe for encoder-free VLMs.\nThe proposed method introduces two key strategies: bridging vision-language representations within a unified decoder and enhancing visual recognition using extra supervision. These strategies enabled the development of EVE, an encoder-free VLM that rivals encoder-based models while using significantly less data (only 35M publicly accessible samples). EVE achieves superior performance across multiple vision-language benchmarks, outperforming counterparts with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. This demonstrates a transparent and efficient route for developing decoder-only architectures.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "SpPAB1tmlC/podcast.wav"}
