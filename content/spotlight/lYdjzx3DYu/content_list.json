In this paper, we rethink and analyze the existing model merging paradigm. We discover that using a single model\u2019s weights can hardly simulate all the models\u2019 performance. To tackle this issue, we propose ELECT, MASK & RESCALEMERGING (EMR-MERGING).

EMR-MERGING is tuning-free, thus requiring no data availability or any additional training while showing impressive performance.

Finetuning models on downstream tasks from a pre-trained model has become a standard paradigm in both NLP and vision fields [20, 51, 19, 22, 5, 87], which usually leads to improved performance with less labeled data. With the development of open-source repositories such as Huggingface [79], timm [77], and torchvision [44], the number of pre-trained and finetuned checkpoints exponentially rise. However, applying individual models to different tasks results in high storage and deployment costs. Multi-task learning (MTL) partially solves this problem by jointly training a model using multiple datasets [70, 93, 95], but it suffers from (i) high computational costs and (ii) data unavailability due to privacy [33].

They use pre-computed Fisher information matrices [23] and inner-product matrices [33] to tune the coefficients for weighted averaging. (ii) Task vector-based methods that add task vectors together instead of model weights, include Task Arithmetic [30], Ties-Merging [84], and AdaMerging [85].

Fisher-Merging [46] and RegMean [33] use fisher information matrices [23] and inner-product matrices [33] to calculate the merging coefficients for weighted merging.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
