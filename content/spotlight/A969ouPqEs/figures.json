Each lane has an entrance and an exit. There are 4 phases that control the traffic flow, which are labeled A, B, C, and D. Each phase controls a specific set of movements that do not conflict with each other. The red and green circles represent the vehicles at the different phases.  The figure helps to visualize the traffic flow and how the signal phases coordinate the movement of traffic.", "section": "2.2 Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data"}, {"figure_path": "A969ouPqEs/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An overview of DiffLight.

It shows how the model integrates various components to address the challenges of missing data and spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic networks. The process begins with sensors collecting traffic data (rewards and observations). Missing data is masked, and the observed data is fed into the Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model with a Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STFormer) architecture. The STFormer captures spatial-temporal dependencies using Communication Cross-Attention, Spatial Self-Attention, and Temporal Self-Attention modules.  A Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) propagates generated observations among intersections to improve performance in the presence of missing data. Finally, an inverse dynamics model generates actions based on the processed observations to control the traffic signals.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "A969ouPqEs/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An overview of DiffLight.

In random missing (a), data from any intersection may be missing at random.  In kriging missing (b), the absence of data is spatially correlated; if data from one intersection is missing, it's more likely that data from its neighbors will also be missing. The yellow rectangles represent intersections, and the gray circles represent the traffic flow within those intersections. The striped and hatched rectangles show the masked traffic data representing the missing values in the random missing and kriging missing scenarios, respectively.", "section": "C.2 Missing Pattern"}]
