### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Selective Classification (SC) systems, which can reject low-confidence predictions, are crucial for real-world applications. However, current SC evaluation methods rely on pre-defined rejection thresholds, limiting a comprehensive performance assessment. This paper identifies 5 key requirements for improved metrics and shows how existing metrics fall short. 



The authors propose the Area Under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve (AUGRC) as a new metric for SC evaluation. AUGRC meets all requirements, is directly interpretable as the average risk of undetected failures, and significantly alters metric rankings compared to existing methods. Empirical validation across six datasets and thirteen confidence scoring functions confirms the metric's relevance and effectiveness in improving SC evaluation.

> This figure illustrates the proposed AUGRC metric and compares it to existing metrics for selective classification.  Panel (a) shows the different evaluation approaches for selective classification: working-point evaluation versus multi-threshold evaluation.  It highlights how the existing Area Under the Risk Coverage (AURC) curve uses the 'Selective Risk', which is not suitable for multi-threshold evaluation.  Instead, the authors propose using the 'Generalized Risk' which leads to the new Area Under the Generalized Risk Coverage Curve (AUGRC) metric.  Panel (b) summarizes five key requirements for multi-threshold metrics in selective classification.  It then shows how the AUGRC metric satisfies these requirements, while existing metrics (AURC, e-AURC, AUROC, and Brier Score) do not.

### In-depth insights


#### Selective Class. Eval
Selective classification evaluation presents unique challenges compared to standard classification.  **Traditional metrics often focus on fixed thresholds**, which fail to capture the overall performance across various rejection levels.  A key insight is the need for **multi-threshold metrics** that comprehensively assess risk and coverage trade-offs. The paper emphasizes the importance of metrics that are **task-aligned, interpretable, and flexible** with respect to confidence scoring functions and error metrics.  It critiques existing metrics like AURC and e-AURC for their shortcomings in meeting these criteria, particularly their failure to adequately reflect the holistic risk of undetected failures (silent failures).  The proposed AUGRC metric offers a compelling alternative by directly addressing these issues and providing a more **meaningful and interpretable evaluation** of selective classification systems.

#### AUGRC Metric
The AUGRC (Area Under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve) metric is a proposed solution to overcome limitations in evaluating selective classification (SC) systems.  Current methods often rely on fixed thresholds, providing an incomplete performance picture. **AUGRC addresses this by integrating performance across all possible rejection thresholds**, offering a more holistic assessment.  The metric is designed with key requirements in mind: task alignment (jointly evaluating classification and confidence scoring function quality), interpretability (directly interpretable as average risk of undetected failures), flexibility (adaptable to various confidence functions and error metrics), and monotonicity (improved metric value with improved factors).  **Empirical validation demonstrates AUGRC's superiority over existing metrics**, notably by changing metric rankings across multiple datasets and confidence scoring functions.  This highlights AUGRC's potential as a robust evaluation tool to drive methodological progress in the field of SC.

#### Empirical Study
An empirical study section in a research paper provides crucial validation for the theoretical claims. It involves conducting experiments using real-world data and comparing the performance of different methods using suitable metrics. In this context, **a robust empirical study should involve a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple datasets and various conditions.** The study should also rigorously test the proposed method against existing state-of-the-art approaches and include statistical analysis to ensure the reliability of the findings.  **The results should be presented clearly and comprehensively,** including visualizations and statistical significance tests. The detailed description of the experimental setup, including data preprocessing and parameter tuning, is vital for reproducibility.  Moreover, **an in-depth discussion of the findings is needed,** emphasizing the implications of the results and how they relate to the theoretical claims.  A thoughtful analysis of the limitations of the study and suggestions for future work should also be included.

#### AURC Shortcomings
The analysis of AURC shortcomings reveals its **inability to holistically assess selective classification (SC) systems** due to its reliance on selective risk, which focuses only on accepted predictions.  This leads to an **excessive weighting of high-confidence failures**, distorting the overall performance assessment and violating monotonicity and interpretability requirements. The **AURC's limitations are further amplified by its insensitivity to different error functions**, hindering its general applicability beyond accuracy-based evaluations.  **Empirical evidence demonstrates that the AURC produces misleading rankings of SC methods**, highlighting its inadequacy for benchmarking and driving methodological progress in the field.  A superior metric is needed that addresses these flaws to enable a more reliable evaluation of SC systems.

#### Future Directions
Future research should explore extending the AUGRC's applicability beyond binary classification tasks. **Investigating its performance with multi-class problems and different loss functions would significantly broaden its utility.**  Another crucial area is refining the AUGRC's behavior under various data distributions and tackling imbalanced datasets. A **deeper theoretical analysis of AUGRC's relationship to existing metrics**, like AUROC and AURC, is also warranted. This could reveal potential synergies or limitations and inform the design of even more comprehensive SC evaluation methods.  Furthermore, **developing efficient computational approaches** for AUGRC calculation is important, especially when dealing with massive datasets. **Exploring AUGRC's integration with uncertainty quantification techniques** would enhance its ability to reliably assess the performance of SC systems in high-stakes settings.
