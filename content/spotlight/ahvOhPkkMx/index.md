### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many machine learning methods lack interpretability, making it hard to assess their performance. Researchers often compare models using a predictiveness criterion, but this approach suffers from a 'degeneracy' issue: even when two models perform equally, the test statistics may not have a standard distribution, leading to unreliable conclusions. This is especially problematic for black-box models such as deep learning and random forests. 

This paper introduces 'Zipper', a new method to address this degeneracy.  Zipper strategically overlaps testing data splits, creating a 'slider' parameter to control the overlap amount. This clever technique produces a test statistic with a standard distribution even when models perform equally well, while maintaining high power to detect differences. Through simulations and real-world examples, the authors show that Zipper provides reliable and more powerful results than other existing methods.

> The figure illustrates how the Zipper device works on the kth fold of testing data. The data fold Dk is divided into two splits, Dk,A and Dk,B, with an overlapping part Dk,o.  The parameter œÑ controls the proportion of the overlap.  The predictiveness criteria C are evaluated on Dk,o, Dk,a (Dk,A \ Dk,o), and Dk,b (Dk,B \ Dk,o). When œÑ = 0, there is no overlap, representing the standard sample splitting approach.  When œÑ = 1, there is complete overlap, which is known to cause degeneracy. The Zipper mechanism uses the slider parameter œÑ to control the amount of overlap and thus mitigate the degeneracy issue.

The results are shown for both normal and binomial response models, and for low-dimensional (p=5) and high-dimensional (p=1000) settings. Standard deviations are included to show the variability of the estimates.





### In-depth insights


#### Degeneracy in GoF
The concept of 'degeneracy in Goodness-of-Fit (GoF)' testing arises when the test statistic, designed to measure the difference in predictive power between models, fails to follow a well-behaved distribution under the null hypothesis (i.e., both models are equally good). This **leads to unreliable inference**, making it difficult to distinguish between truly different models and those that simply appear different due to random chance.  The paper highlights that this problem emerges due to the estimation procedures used (cross-fitting, sample-splitting), where **the estimated predictiveness often collapses to zero** under the null. This degeneracy issue is particularly concerning in algorithm-agnostic GoF settings, where the nature of the underlying algorithm adds further complexity to the analysis.  To overcome degeneracy, methods that employ additional data splitting or noise perturbation are proposed. However, these approaches often come with reduced statistical power or a reliance on ad-hoc choices. **The proposed 'Zipper' method tackles this issue by strategically encouraging overlap** between data splits, which improves statistical power while maintaining the asymptotic normality needed for reliable inference.  This is accomplished by introducing a 'slider' parameter to control the extent of this overlap, offering a flexible approach to achieve optimal results.

#### Zipper's Mechanism
The core of Zipper's mechanism lies in its innovative approach to data splitting. Unlike traditional methods that use independent test sets, **Zipper cleverly introduces an overlapping region between two data splits**. This overlapping region, controlled by a slider parameter, allows for more efficient data utilization. By carefully weighting the overlapping and non-overlapping portions, Zipper effectively combines information from both splits. This strategy is crucial for addressing the degeneracy problem often encountered in algorithm-agnostic inference, where standard test statistics fail to converge to a non-degenerate distribution under the null hypothesis.  The key advantage is improved power without sacrificing the test's ability to control type I error. **The slider parameter provides flexibility**, allowing researchers to balance the trade-off between power and the risk of degeneracy.  In essence, Zipper's mechanism provides a robust and efficient way to extract predictive information from the data.

#### Asymptotic Linearity
The section on Asymptotic Linearity is crucial because it establishes the foundation for the statistical validity of the proposed Zipper test.  It demonstrates that under certain conditions, the test statistic's behavior is asymptotically linear, meaning its large-sample distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution. **This is essential for constructing valid hypothesis tests and confidence intervals**, enabling reliable inferences about predictive capability differences. The asymptotic linearity result hinges on specific conditions relating to the estimator's convergence rate, smoothness of the predictiveness measure, and the properties of the prediction function classes.  **The proof likely relies on sophisticated techniques from empirical process theory** to handle the complexity of algorithm-agnostic prediction methods and data splitting. This rigorous mathematical justification is vital for ensuring the Zipper test maintains its type I error control and possesses adequate power for detecting real differences, which is a **key advantage over existing methods that suffer from degeneracy issues** under the null hypothesis.

#### Power & Efficiency
The power and efficiency of a statistical method are crucial considerations.  **Power** refers to the method's ability to correctly reject a false null hypothesis, while **efficiency** relates to how much data is needed to achieve a certain level of power.  In hypothesis testing, a high-power method is desirable because it minimizes the probability of Type II errors (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). However, achieving high power often requires larger sample sizes, which can be costly and time-consuming.  **Efficiency** becomes important when balancing the need for power with resource constraints.  A highly efficient method can achieve the same power with smaller sample sizes compared to a less efficient method, making it a more practical choice.  The interplay between power and efficiency is a key factor in selecting appropriate statistical methods for specific research questions, and careful consideration of both is essential for sound data analysis.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Extending Zipper to handle more complex data structures** such as time series or network data would significantly broaden its applicability.  Investigating the **optimal selection of the slider parameter** 






œÑ  through theoretical analysis or adaptive methods could further improve performance.  A deeper understanding of the **relationship between Zipper and other variable importance measures**, such as Shapley values, would enrich the framework and provide valuable insights into its strengths and limitations.  Finally, **exploring alternative predictiveness criteria** and investigating the robustness of Zipper under various distributional assumptions would enhance its generality and reliability.

> This table presents the empirical sizes and powers of four different testing procedures (Zipper, WGSC-3, DSP-Split, and WGSC-2) for a model specification test. The empirical size represents the percentage of times the null hypothesis (Ho) is rejected when it is actually true, while the empirical power represents the percentage of times the alternative hypothesis (H1) is correctly rejected.  Three different scenarios (i), (ii), and (iii) are considered, each corresponding to a different configuration of the model parameters. The results are shown for both low-dimensional (p=5) and high-dimensional (p=1000) settings.
