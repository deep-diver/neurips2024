The data fold Dk is divided into two splits, Dk,A and Dk,B, with an overlapping part Dk,o.  The parameter \u03c4 controls the proportion of the overlap.  The predictiveness criteria C are evaluated on Dk,o, Dk,a (Dk,A \\ Dk,o), and Dk,b (Dk,B \\ Dk,o). When \u03c4 = 0, there is no overlap, representing the standard sample splitting approach.  When \u03c4 = 1, there is complete overlap, which is known to cause degeneracy. The Zipper mechanism uses the slider parameter \u03c4 to control the amount of overlap and thus mitigate the degeneracy issue.", "section": "2 Our Remedy"}, {"figure_path": "ahvOhPkkMx/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Empirical power of various testing methods as a function of the magnitude \u03b4 representing variable relevance, when n = 500 and p \u2208 {5, 1000}.

The x-axis represents the magnitude of variable relevance (\u03b4), and the y-axis represents the empirical power of each method.

The x-axis represents the slider parameter (\u03c4) in the Zipper method, which controls the overlap between two data splits. The y-axis represents the rejection rate (power).  Different lines represent different values of \u03b4 which reflects the magnitude of variable importance in the model.  The dot-dashed horizontal line indicates the significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05).
