[30] proposed a scaling law predicting that the optimal ratio of tokens to parameters decays as a power of $C$ . This scaling law was influential in determining the size of GPT-3 and several subsequent models [12, 51, 43, 32, 47, 62, 52]. However, Hoffmann et al. [25] challenged its validity, arguing instead that the optimal token-to-parameter ratio should be approximately independent of $C$ , and that contemporary models had too many parameters relative to their number of training tokens.

In this work, we uncover three factors contributing to the discrepancy, and disprove Hoffman et al.\u2019s hypothesis about the role of learning rate decay; Figure 1 illustrates our main results. We begin by reproducing the Kaplan et al. scaling law in a Llama-derived pretraining setup using the OpenLM library [21] and the RefinedWeb dataset [41] (Figure 1a). Our first observation is that accounting for the computational cost of the decoding layer (as done in Hoffmann et al. [25] but not in Kaplan et al. [30]) shifts compute-optimal scaling toward a more constant token-to-parameter ratio (Figure 1b). Second, we note that the constant-length warmup period of Kaplan et al. [30] is too long for smaller models, inflating the optimal number of tokens at lower compute budgets; scaling the warmup period with the model size further shifts the scaling in the Hoffmann et al. direction (Figure 1c). Next, we match the learning rate decay to the token budget of each configuration we test (as Hoffmann et al. [25] conjecture to be essential) but observe little effect on the computeoptimal scaling law (Figure 1d). Finally, we set the learning rate, batch size, and the AdamW $\\beta_{2}$ parameters individually for each model size, leading to compute-optimal scaling that agrees closely with Hoffmann et al. (Figure 1e). Notably, the latter configuration uses a constant learning rate schedule, showing that learning rate decay is not essential for the Hoffmann et al. scaling law to emerge.

[26] find that, for their models, optimal scaling favors larger token-toparameter ratios than in Hoffmann et al. [25] and in our results. They attribute this difference to modeling improvements since [25] and argue the same holds for Llama 2 [56]. However, our setup incorporates most of the advances in Llama 2 and still produces power laws very close to Hoffmann et al. [25]. Like us, DeepSeek [15] perform hyperparameter tuning and use isoFLOP analysis to determine compute-optimal model sizes on multiple datasets. While they arrive at an exponent on the order of Hoffmann et al. [25] for the main dataset they study, they report a higher exponent $a=0.578$ for OpenWebText2 (i.e., predicting lower token-parameter-ratio at scale), which they attribute to the superior quality of the dataset. We also study this dataset but arrive much closer to the Hoffmann et al. scaling law. We conjecture the larger exponent might be due to repeating training data, which likely occurred in their experiment given the dataset\u2019s limited size and their compute budget.

Gadre et al. [17] directly predict the loss and downstream performance for models trained past the point of compute optimality, and Muennighoff et al. [37] model joint compute-data bottlenecks.

That work shares the methodological issues described in the top row of Figure 1 (FLOP count and long warmup), but performs hyperparameter tuning for smaller scale models; in Appendix H we reach similar results when doing the same.

The first is the importance of hyperparameter tuning: several works [30, 27, 17, 15] make the case that smooth, predictable scaling laws emerge when models on all scales are properly tuned. Our work (and particularly Section 4.1) provides another example of this principle and agrees with previous observations that tuning is particularly important at smaller scales. Second, previous studies [59, 8, 15, 26] as well as the concurrent work [22], propose alternative learning rate schedules that address a key shortcoming of cosine decay: the need to commit to a step budget in advance. We consider a constant learning rate that requires no commitment at all. We show this simple choice suffices to reproduce the Hoffmann et al. law and quantify the computational savings compared to a cosine schedule. However, Section 4.1 (and also [25], among others) show that in terms of loss, the constant schedule clearly underperforms the cosine schedule.

Pearce and Song [40] also study the discrepency between the Kaplan et al. and Hoffmann et al. scaling laws. By re-analyzing data extracted from the Hoffmann et al. [25] experiments by Besiroglu et al. [9], they identify the last layer FLOP count as a cause for the discrepancy. Moreover, they report on a small-scale experimental study (with model sizes up to 5M and training tokens number up to 530M) in which they observe that a non-decaying learning rate schedule is sufficient for reproducing the Hoffmann et al. exponent and that learning rate tuning is necessary. These results independently corroborate part of our observations in Sections 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5. Pearce and Song [40] do not identify the warmup duration issue we describe in Section 3.3. As a consequence, when reproducing the Kaplan et al. exponent they reach a value close to 0.73 rather than the \u2018raw\u2019 value 0.88 reported in Kaplan et al. [30] (see discussion in Section 3.1, Section 3.5, and Appendix H). In addition, our experiments roughly match the Kaplan et al.

Scaling may effectively mitigate each of the issues we identify: with scale, the contribution of the model head becomes negligible, any (fixed) warmup period eventually becomes reasonably long, and hyperparameter sensitivity decreases, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 15. Nevertheless, we believe that experimental protocols that induce correct scaling behavior at low computational budgets are crucial for developing the empirical science of machine learning, particularly in academic settings.

This raises the concern that the hyperparameters we chose unfairly favor models trained for that particular token-to-parameter ratio, and rerunning our experiment with perfect tuning for each model size and each token-to-parameter ratio would have yielded different results. We believe this is unlikely: at small scales (where hyperparameter tuning is crucial) our original set of hyperparameters favored higher token-to-parameter ratios because they still had a sufficient number of steps to train for, and therefore choosing hyperparameters specifically for them is not likely to result in significant gains. In Appendix G.4 we analyze our existing tuning results to estimate the potential gains from perfect tuning, and find that they are likely to have small impact on our conclusions.

Here again, scale is an issue: most zero-shot and in-context capabilities do not emerge at the scales we consider here, and predicting them from small-scale proxies is an important open problem [48, 17]. Instead, it is possible to study downstream performance via fine-tuning, though this may cause the clean scaling patterns seen in pretraining to break down [54], potentially because the fine-tuning procedure is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters [27].

For smaller models or $\\rho$ values, the potential loss reduction from ideal tuning is greater, as is also evident in the top-right panel of the figure. Nevertheless, the top-right panel also shows that the compute-optimal model size (marked by stars on the IsoFLOP curves) do not move much due to the loss reduction. The bottom panel further reveals that for most FLOP values the difference between compute-optimal model sizes is within their estimated standard deviations. It also shows that approximating ideal hyperparameter tuning moves the estimate of the compute-optimal exponent by less than 0.032, bringing further away from the Kaplan et al. exponent. Furthermore, since learning rate and batch size sensitivities decrease with model size, we expect ideal tuning to have an even smaller effect at larger compute budgets, so we are likely to see even better agreement in $a$ if we introduce larger models to our ideal tuning estimate (which would require extending the hyperparameter sweep to larger models as well). Indeed, dropping the two smallest FLOP values from the power law fit (that is, using FLOP values $\\{2^{k}\\cdot1.25\\mathrm{e}\\bar{1}\\bar{6}\\}_{k=2}^{7})$ yields exponent $a=0.489$ for the original observations and exponent $a=0.5$ for ideal tuning.
