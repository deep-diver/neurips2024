REMA consistently provides improvements on multiple datasets. Compared to TSD [79], it achieves a $1.3\\%$ improvement on three pixel-level corruption datasets and a $3.1\\%$ improvement on three challenging cross-domain datasets. Compared to the SOTA, REMA has three major advantages: (1) Tent [75] or SHOT [47] based on entropy minimization has limitations, as they can overcome distribution shifts caused by pixel corruption but fail to handle cross-domain test data, even leading to performance degradation. However, REMA can handle both types of OOD data. (2) T3A [29] and TAST [31] based on pseudo-labels have performance limitations, and the pros and cons of pseudo-labels significantly impact the adaptation, which can be observed in their ceilings on two types of datasets. REMA enhances resistance to noisy labels by capturing higher-order semantic dependencies. (3) REMA converts dense pixels into sparse slots, accurately capturing domain-invariant features, which will not be affected by pixel corruption and domain shift. Implementing consistent optimization during test time makes REMA more robust, resulting in a $5.1\\%$ accuracy improvement across all benchmarks, i.e., ERM vs. REMA.

The aim of OOD Generalization is to train a model using data from the source distribution so that it can perform well on an unknown target distribution. A series of works can be divided into three categories: (1) Minimizing distribution differences [42, 45, 68, 90]: using meta-learning to simulate distribution shift [40, 18], or learning an invariant transformation based on adversarial learning [42, 45, 89, 94, 93]. (2) Domain-invariant representation learning: by analyzing the feature learning process of deep neural networks [16, 66, 27, 63, 12, 13], it is inferred how ID data can be generalized to OOD data [6, 65]. By understanding the interactions between ERM and generalization, domain-invariant features are learned. (3) More generic OOD generalization: many studies focus on generalization under a relaxed assumption, such as open environments with unknown classes [8], semi-supervised settings in the testing environment [86], adapting foundation models [91], and OOD data synthesis [60, 59, 22], aiming to identify generalizable features from sophisticated test distributions. However, previous studies have only focused on the instances themselves and have not explored the inherent high-order semantic dependencies in ID and OOD data, overlooking the topological homogeneity between distributions.

The goal of TTA [46] is to adjust the source trained model using test data without ground truth during the testing phase [47, 58, 10, 87, 79, 29]. Most of the existing methods directly perform gradient optimization on the test samples, with optimization objectives including prediction entropy [75], self-training and stochastic restoring [77], or based on normalization [54], etc., making the model adapt to the dynamic target environment at each step. Recently works further consider the scenario of noisy outlier samples [24, 70] appearing in the test stream. However, previous studies have simply optimized the test instances based on self-training, ignoring the topological relationship between samples and the high-order semantic dependencies within the test data steam, leading to suboptimal adaptation.

To achieve this goal, we propose a new framework REMA to first obtain a set of sparse and discrete representations from dense pixels and then model the high-order topological relations and dependencies via hypergraph (a generalized form of graph). Our experimental results reveal that REMA achieves superior performance on standard OOD generalization and test-time adaptation benchmarks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
