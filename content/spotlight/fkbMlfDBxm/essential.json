Existing methods mainly focus on pairwise invariances, ignoring the data's intrinsic structure.  Humans, in contrast, recognize objects by decomposing them into parts and understanding their relations. \nThis paper introduces Reconstruct and Match (REMA), a novel framework that captures the topological homogeneity of objects.  REMA uses a selective slot-based reconstruction module to identify main components and a hypergraph-based relational reasoning module to model their high-order dependencies.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that REMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various OOD benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in both OOD generalization and test-time adaptation settings.", "affiliation": "Shenzhen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fkbMlfDBxm/podcast.wav"}
