Existing positional encoding techniques are often ad-hoc and lack theoretical grounding, hindering their generalizability and interpretability. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a new framework called Algebraic Positional Encodings (APE).  APE leverages group theory to map algebraic specifications of different data structures (sequences, trees, grids) to orthogonal operators, preserving the algebraic characteristics of the source domain.\n\nThe APE method is shown to significantly improve performance across various tasks, including sequence transduction, tree transduction, and image recognition. Unlike existing methods, APE achieves this without task-specific hyperparameter optimization, showcasing its adaptability and robustness. The results demonstrate that APE's group theoretic foundation leads to more interpretable and generalizable models, providing insights into the role of structural biases in Transformer architectures.  The code for APE is also publicly available.", "affiliation": "Aalto University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Machine Translation"}, "podcast_path": "PfOeAKxx6i/podcast.wav"}
