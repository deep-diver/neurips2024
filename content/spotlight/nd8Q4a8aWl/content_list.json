Estimating this quantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural networks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and AI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an opportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on generative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single pre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best available deep generative models: diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show that the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide an LID estimator which addresses the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator, called FLIPD, is easy to implement and compatible with all popular DMs. Applying FLIPD to synthetic LID estimation benchmarks, we find that DMs implemented as fully-connected networks are highly effective LID estimators that outperform existing baselines. We also apply FLIPD to natural images where the true LID is unknown. Despite being sensitive to the choice of network architecture, FLIPD estimates remain a useful measure of relative complexity; compared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits a consistently higher correlation with image PNG compression rate and better aligns with qualitative assessments of complexity.

We compare against the NB and LIDL estimators described in Section 2.2, as well as two of the most performant model-free baselines: LPCA [22, 12] and ESS [30]. For the NB baseline, we use the exact same DM backbone as for FLIPD (since NB was designed for variance-exploding DMs, we use the adaptation to variance-preserving DMs used in [32], which produces extremely similar results), and for LIDL we use 8 neural spline flows. In terms of MAE, we find that FLIPD tends to be the best model-based estimator, particularly as dimension increases. Although model-free baselines perform well in simplistic scenarios, they produce unreliable results as LID increases or more non-linearity is introduced in the data manifold. In terms of concordance index, FLIPD achieves perfect scores in all scenarios, meaning that even when its estimates are off, it always provides correct LID rankings. We include additional results in the appendices: in Appendix D.5 we ablate FLIPD, finding that using kneedle indeed helps, and that FLIPD also outperforms the efficient implementation of LIDL with DMs described in Section 3.2 that uses an ODE solver. We notice that NB with the setting proposed in [59] consistently produces estimates that are almost equal to the ambient dimension; thus, in Appendix D.6 we also show how NB can be significantly improved upon by using kneedle, although it is still outperformed by FLIPD in many scenarios. In addition, in Table 7 and Table 8 we compare against other model-free baselines such as MLE [38, 43] and FIS [1].

In Figure 10, the FLIPD curves with MLPs have clearly discernible knees at which the estimated LID averages around a positive number, as expected. When changing the architecture of the DMs from MLPs to UNets, however, the curves either lack knees or obtain them at negative values of LID. This makes it harder to set $t_{0}$ automatically with kneedle when using UNets, and thus makes the estimator non-robust to the choice of architecture.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
