We depict two manifolds of MNIST digits, corresponding to 1s and 8s, as 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional submanifolds of R\u00b3, respectively. The relatively simpler manifold of 1s exhibits a single factor of variation (\u201ctilt\u201d), whereas 8s have an additional factor of variation (\u201cdisproportionality\u201d). (Right) The 4 lowest- and highest-LID datapoints from a subsample of LAION-Aesthetics, as measured by our method, FLIPD, applied to Stable Diffusion v1.5. FLIPD scales efficiently to large models on high-dimensional data, and aligns closely with subjective complexity.", "description": "The left panel uses a cartoon to illustrate how LID can be understood as a measure of complexity. It shows two manifolds of MNIST digits, representing '1's and '8's. The manifold of '1's is 1-dimensional (a single factor of variation, 'tilt'), while the manifold of '8's is 2-dimensional (two factors, 'tilt' and 'disproportionality'). The right panel shows four of the lowest and highest LID datapoints from a subset of LAION-Aesthetics dataset, determined using FLIPD on Stable Diffusion v1.5, demonstrating FLIPD's effectiveness in high-dimensional data and its alignment with visual complexity assessments.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
