These approximations prioritize global model accuracy over effective data acquisition, slowing optimization progress.  This is a significant problem for applications requiring many function evaluations.\nThis paper introduces Approximation-Aware Bayesian Optimization (AABO), a novel approach that directly tackles this issue.  AABO uses utility-calibrated variational inference, unifying GP approximation and data acquisition within a joint optimization framework. This ensures optimal decisions under computational constraints.  The authors demonstrate that AABO, when coupled with common acquisition functions (EI and KG) and trust region methods (TuRBO), significantly outperforms traditional methods on high-dimensional benchmark tasks.  This improvement results from the superior informed data acquisition strategy in AABO.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "t7euV5dl5M/podcast.wav"}
