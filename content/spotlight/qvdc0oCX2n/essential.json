These methods significantly enhance model performance.", "takeaways": ["negCLIPLoss, a novel data quality metric, significantly outperforms traditional methods.", "NormSim, a new norm-based metric, leverages downstream task knowledge for improved data selection.", "Combined use of negCLIPLoss and NormSim achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset."], "tldr": "Large-scale visual-language models like CLIP struggle with noisy web-sourced data, hindering their performance. Current data selection methods either rely on external models or train new embedding models, both resource intensive. This paper focuses on developing better metrics and selection strategies applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring special model properties.\nThe paper proposes two novel methods: negCLIPLoss, a refined quality metric inspired by CLIP's training loss, and NormSim, a norm-based metric that measures similarity between pretraining data and target data for known downstream tasks. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements (5.3% on ImageNet-1k and 2.8% on average across 38 downstream tasks) compared to baselines using only the original CLIP model.  Furthermore, the methods are shown to be compatible with existing techniques, achieving a new state-of-the-art.
