{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in reinforcement learning, particularly those working with decision transformers. It addresses a significant gap in the current literature by focusing on **online finetuning** of these models. The findings demonstrate a practical approach for enhancing performance, particularly when dealing with low-reward offline data. This is highly relevant to current research trends focusing on **data efficiency and offline-to-online RL**. The work opens up new avenues for improving decision transformers by integrating RL gradients and suggests further exploration into the theoretical aspects of online finetuning.", "summary": "Boost online finetuning of Decision Transformers by adding TD3 gradients, especially when pretrained with low-reward data.", "takeaways": ["Adding TD3 gradients improves the online finetuning of Decision Transformers.", "High target RTG hampers online finetuning, while TD3 gradients effectively address this issue.", "The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks."], "tldr": "Decision Transformers (DTs) are a promising paradigm in offline reinforcement learning, but their online finetuning remains under-explored. Existing methods like Online Decision Transformer (ODT) struggle with low-reward offline data. This paper theoretically analyzes the limitations of ODT's online finetuning process, attributing the issues to the use of Return-To-Go (RTG) far from the expected return.\nThe paper proposes a novel method that integrates TD3 gradients into the ODT's online finetuning process. This simple yet effective approach significantly enhances ODT's performance, particularly when pretrained on low-reward data. Experiments across multiple environments confirm the effectiveness of adding TD3 gradients, demonstrating improvements in online performance compared to the baseline ODT and other offline RL algorithms.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "5l5bhYexYO/podcast.wav"}
