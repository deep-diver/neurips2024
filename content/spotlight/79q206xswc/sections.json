Instead of relying on simple 3D bounding boxes, which can be inaccurate and ignore occlusion, **M-SOG leverages semantic occupancy grids**, incorporating detailed geometric and semantic information.  This allows for a more nuanced understanding of how well different LiDAR configurations capture the scene's structure and content.  By utilizing the entropy of the probabilistic semantic occupancy grid, **M-SOG quantifies the uncertainty reduction achieved by a specific LiDAR placement**.

This includes dealing with **corrupted data** due to weather (fog, snow, rain), sensor failures (incomplete echoes, crosstalk), and external disturbances (motion blur).  A key aspect is developing algorithms that are not overly sensitive to these imperfections, and techniques such as data augmentation and robust loss functions are relevant.  The evaluation of adverse robustness involves testing on datasets that include these challenging scenarios, and designing metrics to quantify performance degradation.  **Surrogate metrics** might be necessary for efficient evaluation, as full training on a large multi-conditional dataset is costly.  Optimizing sensor placement (LiDAR configuration) plays a significant role; optimal placements can improve the robustness to adverse conditions."}}]
