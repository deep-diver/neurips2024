Transformers, known for their impressive ICL capabilities, utilize self-attention mechanisms. However, the role of the activation function, especially softmax, in enabling ICL remains unclear.  Prior theoretical analysis often oversimplifies this by using linear attention, missing the key insights of softmax. \nThis paper focuses on understanding the mechanism behind the success of softmax attention in ICL for regression tasks. The authors show that softmax attention, during pretraining, learns to adapt its attention window size and direction. The attention window narrows for smoother functions (higher Lipschitzness) and widens with increased noise or for functions that only change in specific directions.  This adaptive behavior is absent in linear attention, confirming the significance of the softmax activation function for efficient ICL.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lfxIASyLxB/podcast.wav"}
