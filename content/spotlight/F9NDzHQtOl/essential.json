Existing methods struggle with polynomial time complexity for high-dimensional data which limits their application.  This is due to sequential sampling iterations and the computational cost of evaluating the score function. This paper addresses the limitation by reducing the inference time complexity.\nThe proposed algorithms, PIADM-SDE/ODE, divide sampling into independent blocks, enabling parallel processing of Picard iterations.  This clever approach leads to a significant improvement in time complexity to poly-logarithmic (\u00d5(poly log d)), the first of its kind with provable sub-linear complexity. The method is compatible with both stochastic differential equation (SDE) and probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) implementations, with PIADM-ODE improving space complexity. This breakthrough opens up applications for high-dimensional data analysis.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "F9NDzHQtOl/podcast.wav"}
