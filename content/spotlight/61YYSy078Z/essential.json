These existing methods often involve solving large-scale matrix verification problems, hindering their applicability to larger and deeper networks. This poses a significant challenge for certifying the robustness of increasingly complex models.\nThe paper introduces ECLipsE, a compositional approach to efficiently estimate Lipschitz constants.  It leverages a sequential Cholesky decomposition to break down the large problem into smaller subproblems. Two algorithms are developed: ECLipsE solves small semidefinite programs, while ECLipsE-Fast provides a closed-form solution for extremely fast estimation.  **Experiments demonstrate significant speedups (up to several thousand times) over state-of-the-art methods**, while achieving similar or even better accuracy in Lipschitz bound estimation.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "61YYSy078Z/podcast.wav"}
