{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in image quality assessment (IQA) and large multimodal models (LMMs). It **bridges the gap between qualitative comparative judgments and quantitative quality scores**, a long-standing challenge in the field. By introducing a novel training method and inference strategy, the research provides a significant step forward in developing more robust and accurate IQA systems.  This approach is widely applicable beyond IQA, demonstrating its **potential for broader applications within the LMM and computer vision communities.** Its findings also open doors for further investigations into zero-shot learning in LMMs.", "summary": "Compare2Score: A novel IQA model teaches large multimodal models to translate comparative image quality judgments into continuous quality scores, significantly outperforming existing methods.", "takeaways": ["Compare2Score effectively bridges text-defined comparative levels during training with converted single image quality scores for inference.", "The probability-matrix-based inference conversion improves rating accuracy and enables zero-shot generalization.", "Compare2Score outperforms state-of-the-art IQA models across various scenarios, demonstrating significant advancements in the field."], "tldr": "Current image quality assessment (IQA) models struggle with translating relative quality comparisons into continuous scores, especially when dealing with diverse datasets.  Different datasets employ varying subjective testing methodologies, leading to inconsistent quality ratings. Existing IQA models also often lack cross-dataset generalizability.\nCompare2Score tackles this by using large multimodal models (LMMs) trained with comparative instructions generated by comparing images from the same dataset. This innovative approach enables flexible dataset integration.  The model employs a soft comparison method to translate discrete comparative levels into continuous quality scores and leverages maximum a posteriori estimation for optimization.  Extensive experiments show Compare2Score surpasses state-of-the-art models, highlighting the effectiveness of its approach.", "affiliation": "City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "mHtOyh5taj/podcast.wav"}
