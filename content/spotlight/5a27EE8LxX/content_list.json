We extracted their corresponding weights in SLR and calculated their ranks (see Table S4 in the Appendix). The rank $r$ of a weight $w$ is calculated by $r(w)=\\left|\\left\\{v\\in W|v>w\\right\\}\\right|/\\left|W\\right|$ , where $W$ is the set of all weight values. A rank value near 0 (resp. 1) suggests the corresponding token is associated with benign (resp. toxic) prompts, and more useful tokens for detection have ranks closer to 0 or 1. Note that since the SLR is sparsely regularized, weights with ranks between $0.15-0.85$ are usually very close to zero. Refusal tokens generally seem more useful for toxicity detection than affirmative tokens, as suggested by the frequent observations of ranks as low as 0.01 for the refusal tokens in Table S4.

MULI\u2019s ability to detect toxic prompts was shown to be correlated with the strength of alignment of base LLMs, so we expect it will work poorly with weakly-aligned or unaligned LLMs. MULI has also not been tested under scenarios where a malicious user fine-tunes an LLM to remove the safety alignment or launches adversarial attacks. In such scenarios, running MULI based on a separate LLM may be required, which could incur an additional inference cost. Moreover, we didn\u2019t evaluate whether MULI remains equally effective across demographic subgroups [11, 8], which could be a topic for future work. Training MULI requires a one-time training cost, to run the base LLM on the prompts in the training set, so while MULI is free at inference time, it does require some upfront cost to train.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
