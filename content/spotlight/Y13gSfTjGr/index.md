### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language model (LLM) training is computationally expensive, and current research relies heavily on the cosine learning rate schedule, which is suboptimal because it requires training models for different lengths.  This creates needless complexity in scaling experiments and makes scaling research less accessible and more expensive.  This paper addresses these issues.  The paper proposes a simpler alternative: a constant learning rate with a cooldown period at the end of training.  This approach removes the need to train multiple models for different durations and makes scaling experiments much cheaper.  It also shows that stochastic weight averaging (SWA) improves model performance without added costs. 

The authors conducted extensive experiments using this novel method and compared the results with cosine. They found that the constant learning rate with cooldown produced similar performance to cosine but at a drastically reduced computational cost.  The incorporation of SWA further improved performance. Their findings demonstrate that large-scale scaling experiments can be performed much more cheaply with fewer training runs. The authors release their code to promote wider adoption and replication, further driving research and development in the field of LLM training.  **This has significant implications for researchers** with limited resources and for advancing the field as a whole by making large-scale research more accessible and affordable.

> This figure shows that to achieve optimal performance with a cosine learning rate schedule, the total training duration must match the cycle length.  The left panel shows that for different training lengths, the optimal perplexity is only achieved when the cycle length of the cosine schedule matches the training duration. The right panel shows the corresponding learning rate schedules used for each of these training durations.  This limitation of the cosine schedule motivates the exploration of alternative scheduling techniques presented in Section 3 of the paper.

> This table lists the configurations of the different transformer models used in the scaling experiments. For each model size (33M, 53M, ..., 360M), it shows the values of several hyperparameters: the embedding dimension (d_model), the number of layers (n_layers), the feed-forward network size (ffw_size), the key/value vector size (kv_size), and the number of attention heads (n_heads). These hyperparameters directly impact the model's capacity and computational cost.





### In-depth insights


#### Cosine Schedule Revisited
The section 'Cosine Schedule Revisited' would delve into the widely used cosine learning rate schedule in large language model (LLM) training.  It would likely begin by highlighting the schedule's **popularity and prevalent use**, acknowledging its role in achieving state-of-the-art results in prominent LLMs.  However, the analysis would then critically examine the **limitations of this approach**, possibly focusing on its dependence on pre-defining the training length to match the cosine cycle for optimal performance. This constraint is problematic for scaling experiments and flexible training.  The section might present **alternative scheduling strategies** that overcome this limitation, perhaps by exploring methods that allow training for various durations without compromising performance.  This could involve comparing constant learning rates with cooldown phases against cosine schedules, evaluating both their performance and computational efficiency. Ultimately, the section should offer a nuanced perspective, highlighting the strengths of cosine schedules while emphasizing the advantages of more flexible alternatives, thereby contributing to improved LLM training practices.

#### Cooldown Training
The concept of "cooldown training" in the context of large language model (LLM) training offers a compelling alternative to traditional cosine annealing schedules.  **Instead of gradually decreasing the learning rate throughout the entire training process**, cooldown training maintains a constant learning rate for a significant portion, followed by a sharp decrease in a relatively short final phase. This approach simplifies the training process, eliminating the need to pre-define the total training duration, as **the cooldown can be initiated at any time**.  Furthermore, this method appears to scale predictably and reliably across different model sizes. The authors' experiments indicate that using a constant learning rate with a strategically-placed cooldown phase results in similar or better model performance as cosine scheduling, while enabling **substantial computational savings**. The study highlights the advantages of this approach in the context of scaling law experiments, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective model evaluations.

#### SWA: An Alternative
The concept of using Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) as an alternative training approach in large language models (LLMs) presents a compelling avenue for improvement.  **SWA offers a way to potentially enhance model generalization without the need for explicit learning rate decay schedules like cosine annealing.**  The authors explore SWA as a replacement for the cooldown phase, showing that it boosts performance, particularly when combined with a constant learning rate. While SWA doesn't fully close the performance gap compared to models trained with explicit cooldown phases, **it provides a significant benefit by improving generalization with minimal computational overhead.**  This makes it an attractive alternative for researchers seeking more efficient and reliable LLM training, especially when considering the practical challenges of tuning complex learning rate schedules.  **The absence of a need for meticulously tuned LR decay makes SWA particularly attractive for large-scale experiments and scaling law research.**  By utilizing SWA, researchers could significantly reduce the computational resources needed for these experiments, as training from scratch for multiple schedules is not required.  Further research is needed to fully understand its capabilities and limitations within different LLM architectures and training regimes.

#### Scaling Law Efficiency
Scaling laws in large language models (LLMs) reveal crucial relationships between model size, dataset size, and performance.  However, empirically deriving these laws is computationally expensive, requiring numerous training runs across different scales.  This paper significantly improves the **efficiency** of scaling law experiments by proposing a novel training schedule.  Instead of using the conventional cosine learning rate schedule, which necessitates separate runs for each desired training duration, the authors introduce a **constant learning rate with cooldown** approach.  This dramatically reduces the need for repeated training runs because the cooldown phase can be initiated retrospectively at any point, providing reliable performance estimates without retraining from scratch.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments, resulting in considerable **compute and GPU hour savings**. This improved efficiency not only accelerates scaling law research but also makes it more accessible by significantly lowering the computational barrier to entry.  **Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)** further enhances the approach's practicality, boosting generalization and yielding better results.  The proposed methods offer a significant advancement in LLM research, empowering more frequent and in-depth exploration of scaling properties.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore **more sophisticated cooldown schedules**, potentially incorporating adaptive methods that dynamically adjust the decay rate based on model performance.  Investigating the interaction between **different cooldown functions and various optimizers** beyond AdamW would also be valuable, potentially revealing new combinations that further enhance training efficiency.  A thorough analysis of the **generalizability of findings across diverse model architectures and datasets** is crucial, as is extending the scaling law experiments to even larger models.  Finally, **research focusing on the interplay between cooldown strategies and techniques like stochastic weight averaging (SWA)** promises to unlock further improvements in model performance and reduce computational costs.

> The figure compares different learning rate schedules used in training large language models.  It shows the cosine schedule, which gradually reduces the learning rate over a long period, and two alternative schedules that use a constant learning rate followed by a sharp cooldown (linear and square root). The plot illustrates the different shapes of these schedules and how they vary over a certain number of training steps.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/Y13gSfTjGr/figures_3_1.jpg)

> This figure compares the performance of the cosine learning rate schedule with a constant learning rate schedule that incorporates a cooldown phase. The left panel shows the loss curves for both schedules, demonstrating that the cooldown schedule achieves a similar sharp decrease in loss as the cosine schedule. The right panel shows the learning rate sensitivity for both schedules, indicating that the cooldown schedule is less sensitive to variations in the learning rate.  The optimal learning rate for the cooldown schedule is slightly lower than the optimal learning rate for the cosine schedule.

> This figure compares the performance of different cooldown schedules (linear and 1 - sqrt) against the cosine schedule for long training durations.  The results show that a square root decay function (1-sqrt) consistently outperforms the linear decay function, and both outperform the cosine schedule, especially for longer training runs.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/Y13gSfTjGr/figures_4_1.jpg)

> This figure shows the relationship between the cooldown length (as a fraction of total training steps) and the final loss (perplexity) achieved for a 124M parameter model.  The left panel shows that increasing the cooldown length to 10-20% of the total training steps significantly improves the model's performance, surpassing the cosine schedule's performance.  However, increasing the cooldown beyond this point does not result in further improvement. The right panel demonstrates the robustness of this finding by showing similar results across different learning rates.

> This figure shows the results of a long training run (200k steps) comparing the performance of a constant learning rate with a short cooldown (10k steps, which is 5% of the total steps) against the cosine learning rate schedule.  The results show that a short cooldown is sufficient to match the performance of the cosine schedule for long training runs, confirming the findings from previous figures (5 and 20) that the needed cooldown duration shrinks with longer training durations.

The left panel shows that the cooldown schedule achieves a sharp decrease in loss similar to the cosine schedule, while maintaining similar perplexity. The right panel demonstrates that the optimal learning rate for both schedules is comparable, with the cooldown schedule exhibiting slightly lower sensitivity to changes in the learning rate.

Two learning rate schedules are compared: a cosine schedule and a 1-sqrt cooldown schedule (where the cooldown constitutes 20% of the total training steps). The results demonstrate that the 1-sqrt cooldown schedule achieves a comparable final training perplexity to the cosine schedule, even for this much larger model size. This finding supports the authors' claim that the 1-sqrt cooldown is a reliable alternative to the cosine schedule for training large language models, regardless of model size.

The left panel demonstrates that applying SWA to a constant learning rate schedule significantly improves the model's performance, though it doesn't fully close the gap to the performance achieved with the explicit cooldown.  The right panel shows that SWA also improves the performance of a cosine learning rate schedule, with the SWA checkpoints closely tracking the optimal loss trajectory of shorter cosine training runs. This suggests that SWA acts as a form of implicit learning rate decay.

The graph plots perplexity against training steps, showing that, regardless of the momentum setting, the linear cooldown always yields lower perplexity (better performance) than the SFO.

It compares the aggregated scores and individual benchmark results (MMLU, ARC, OpenBookQA, PIQA, HellaSwag, CommonSenseQA, SIQA, Winogrande) for different cooldown lengths (5%, 10%, 20%) and a cosine schedule (decay to 0).
