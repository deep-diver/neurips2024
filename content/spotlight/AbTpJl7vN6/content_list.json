To adapt to change, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow process involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage distribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and associate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly by selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task abstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the weights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks encountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the appropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast adapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge, while weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our findings to a nonlinear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work offers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network architecture.

After learning multiple tasks, low-dimensional task representations emerge that are abstract (represent the computation carried invariant to the current sensory content) [Bernardi et al., 2020] and compositional [Tafazoli et al., 2024].

One way to limit this forgetting is through task abstractions, either provided to the models [Hummos et al., 2024] or discovered from data [Hummos, 2023]. In addition, adapting a model entirely by updating its weights is data-intensive due to high dimensionality. Task abstractions simplify this process by allowing updates to a low-dimensional set of parameters, which can be switched rapidly between known tasks, and recomposed for new ones. However, despite the advantages of task abstractions, simple algorithms for segmenting tasks from a stream of data in neural systems remain an open challenge.

We jointly optimize the weight layer and gating layer through gradient descent, but impose faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity on the gating layer units making those parameters closer conceptually to neurons. We find two discrete learning regimes for such networks based on hyperparameters, a flexible learning regime in which knowledge is preserved and task structure is integrated flexibly, and a forgetful learning regime in which knowledge is overwritten in each successive task. In the flexible regime, the gating layer units align to represent tasks and subtasks encountered while the weights separate into modules that align with the computations required. Later on, gradient descent dynamics in the gating layer neurons can retrieve or combine existing representations to switch between previous tasks or solve new ones. Such flexible gating-based adaptation offers a parsimonious mechanism for continual learning and compositional generalization [Butz et al., 2019, Hummos, 2023, Qihong Lu et al., 2024, Schug et al., 2024].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
