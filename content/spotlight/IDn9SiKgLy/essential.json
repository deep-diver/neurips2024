This eliminates the need for user-defined functions found in existing approaches.", "Empirical results across various synthetic and real-world battery design tasks demonstrate COBOL's superior performance, highlighting both fast convergence and resilience to inaccurate labels."], "tldr": "Many real-world applications of Bayesian Optimization (BO) involve human experts who provide feedback to guide the search. However, existing methods often struggle with noisy or unreliable expert advice and lack theoretical guarantees about their performance. This paper introduces COBOL, a new algorithm that addresses these limitations.\nCOBOL uses a principled approach where experts provide binary accept/reject recommendations on proposed query points. The algorithm incorporates a data-driven trust mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weight assigned to expert feedback, ensuring that even if the expert's advice is unreliable or adversarial, the algorithm's performance is never worse than a standard BO algorithm without expert input. The authors prove two key guarantees: a 'handover guarantee', meaning that the number of expert labels required asymptotically converges to zero, and a 'no-harm guarantee', meaning that the convergence rate is never worse than when not using expert advice. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world (battery design) tasks demonstrate that COBOL outperforms existing baselines and maintains robustness even under noisy or adversarial labeling.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "IDn9SiKgLy/podcast.wav"}
