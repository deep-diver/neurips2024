### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Many real-world applications of Bayesian Optimization (BO) involve human experts who provide feedback to guide the search. However, existing methods often struggle with noisy or unreliable expert advice and lack theoretical guarantees about their performance. This paper introduces COBOL, a new algorithm that addresses these limitations.

COBOL uses a principled approach where experts provide binary accept/reject recommendations on proposed query points. The algorithm incorporates a data-driven trust mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weight assigned to expert feedback, ensuring that even if the expert's advice is unreliable or adversarial, the algorithm's performance is never worse than a standard BO algorithm without expert input. The authors prove two key guarantees: a 'handover guarantee', meaning that the number of expert labels required asymptotically converges to zero, and a 'no-harm guarantee', meaning that the convergence rate is never worse than when not using expert advice. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world (battery design) tasks demonstrate that COBOL outperforms existing baselines and maintains robustness even under noisy or adversarial labeling.

> This figure illustrates the framework for collaboration between a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm and human experts.  The BO algorithm proposes a candidate point. The expert then provides a binary label ('accept' or 'reject'). If the expert is 'uncertain', the algorithm performs a cross-check of the expert's reliability; if 'confident', it proceeds directly.  This process allows the BO algorithm to efficiently incorporate expert knowledge while maintaining robustness against potentially unreliable expert advice.

> This table presents the theoretical upper bounds on cumulative regret (R<sub>Q<sup>f</sup></sub>) and cumulative number of expert queries (Q<sup>g</sup><sub>T</sub>) for different kernel functions used in the Bayesian Optimization algorithm.  The bounds depend on the kernel type (Linear, Squared Exponential, Mat√©rn), the dimension (d) of the problem, and the number of iterations (T).  The Mat√©rn kernel bound additionally depends on the smoothness parameter (v). The table shows how the theoretical convergence rates vary based on the kernel choice, highlighting the trade-offs involved.





### In-depth insights


#### Human-AI Collab BO
The field of Human-AI Collaborative Bayesian Optimization (BO) explores the synergy between human expertise and algorithmic optimization.  **A core challenge lies in effectively integrating human feedback**, which can be qualitative, costly, and potentially unreliable.  Early approaches often assumed near-oracle human knowledge, leading to algorithms vulnerable to inaccurate advice.  More recent methods, like the one described in this paper, tackle this by introducing novel theoretical guarantees:  **no-harm guarantees** ensure performance is never worse than using BO alone, even with adversarial advice, while **handover guarantees** ensure that human involvement asymptotically decreases as the optimization progresses.  The **design of the human interaction method** is also critical; minimizing interaction is desirable, but eliciting sufficiently informative and reliable data is a key challenge.  **Data-driven trust level adjustments** rather than relying on user-defined functions provide more robustness. The study's empirical evaluations, particularly on real-world battery design, highlight the practical benefits and resilience of this principled approach, showcasing potential for fast convergence even with less reliable human input.

#### Handover Guarantee
The concept of a 'Handover Guarantee' in the context of human-in-the-loop Bayesian Optimization is crucial for efficient collaboration.  It speaks to the algorithm's ability to **gradually reduce reliance on human expert input** as the optimization progresses.  Initially, the algorithm heavily leverages expert feedback, likely requiring multiple labels per query point. However, as the algorithm gathers more data and its confidence in the surrogate model increases, the frequency of requesting expert labels decreases asymptotically. This is extremely important because expert labels are often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. The 'handover guarantee' ensures that the algorithm doesn't become overly reliant on potentially unreliable expert advice, gracefully transitioning to autonomous operation as it becomes more certain about the search space.  **A sublinear bound on the cumulative number of expert labels** provides a formal guarantee on this efficient handover, which is a significant theoretical contribution.

#### No-Harm Guarantee
The "No-Harm Guarantee" in this research paper is a crucial theoretical contribution, ensuring that incorporating human expert advice into the Bayesian Optimization (BO) process **never performs worse than standard BO without expert input**, even if the expert advice is completely unreliable or even adversarial. This robust guarantee is achieved through a data-driven trust level adjustment mechanism, unlike existing methods relying on hand-tuned parameters.  The method dynamically adjusts its reliance on expert labels based on observed data, preventing over-reliance on potentially erroneous advice.  This **adaptive trust** is key to maintaining performance consistency, making the algorithm suitable for real-world scenarios where expert knowledge may be incomplete, inconsistent, or simply wrong. The guarantee's significance is highlighted by its applicability to scientific applications where expert guidance is vital yet often uncertain; it fosters trust in human-AI collaborations within BO by providing a safety net for potentially unreliable human input.  The no-harm guarantee, therefore, represents a significant advancement, enhancing the robustness and reliability of expert-augmented BO, making it a more practical tool for real-world problem-solving.

#### Real-World Robustness
The concept of "Real-World Robustness" in the context of a research paper likely explores the algorithm's performance and reliability when applied to real-world scenarios, which are inherently noisy and complex.  A key aspect would be evaluating its resilience to **erroneous or incomplete data**, which is common in real-world applications where human experts might provide subjective or unreliable input.  The analysis would likely examine how the algorithm adapts and maintains accuracy when the input data deviates from idealized assumptions.  This may involve testing it under various conditions such as **noisy labels, adversarial input**, or missing information to demonstrate how well it generalizes beyond laboratory settings.  Demonstrating real-world robustness is crucial for establishing practical viability and trustworthiness, particularly when human-in-the-loop optimization is involved. The findings should highlight the algorithm's ability to converge on accurate solutions despite the presence of real-world imperfections.

#### Future Extensions
The "Future Extensions" section of this research paper presents exciting avenues for enhancing the human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization framework.  **Addressing the time-varying nature of human expertise** is crucial, suggesting dynamic models that adapt to evolving knowledge and potentially incorporating techniques like windowing to manage outdated information.  Further investigation into **alternative feedback mechanisms** beyond binary labels, including pairwise comparisons, ranking, or belief functions, could broaden applicability and better align with human preferences.  **Exploring adaptive trust mechanisms** that automatically adjust the level of confidence placed in expert advice based on data-driven evidence is a significant area for development.  Finally, the paper suggests extensions to handle **high-dimensional problems** and **multiple expert scenarios**, improving scalability and leveraging the collective wisdom of multiple experts.  These proposed extensions are not only theoretically intriguing but also practically relevant, aiming to further optimize the collaborative human-AI optimization process.

> This figure compares the vanilla Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) and the expert-augmented LCB acquisition functions.  The vanilla LCB selects a point (xu) that is far from the global minimum (x*).  The expert-augmented LCB, however, incorporates expert feedback (Di) to guide the selection of a point (xf) closer to the global minimum by combining the surrogate objective function (ft) and the expert belief function (gt) using a primal-dual approach with a weighting factor (Œªt).  This demonstrates how the integration of expert knowledge improves the efficiency of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) process.

> This figure compares the performance of the proposed algorithm using three different forms of human feedback: primal-dual, pinpoint, and MVN belief model.  The primal-dual approach uses the algorithm's acquisition policy, while the pinpoint approach has the human expert directly select the next query point. The MVN belief model represents the human belief function as a multivariate normal distribution. The plots show simple regret versus the number of function evaluations for each feedback method. The results demonstrate that the primal-dual approach generally outperforms the other two methods, especially in later iterations. The pinpoint approach initially performs relatively well but eventually lags behind the primal-dual method. The MVN belief model's performance varies greatly depending on the strength of the belief provided by the human expert.
