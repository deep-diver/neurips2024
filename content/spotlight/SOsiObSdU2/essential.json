Existing DTs struggle with generalization in data-scarce settings, a key limitation.  Hybrid Digital Twins (HDTs), combining mechanistic and neural models, address this. However, automatically designing effective HDTs is challenging due to the complex search space. \nThis paper introduces HDTwinGen, an evolutionary algorithm using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design HDTs. LLMs propose model specifications, offline tools optimize parameters, and feedback guides model evolution.  HDTwinGen significantly improves DT generalization, sample efficiency, and evolvability.  This automated approach significantly advances DTs' efficacy in diverse real-world applications.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "SOsiObSdU2/podcast.wav"}
