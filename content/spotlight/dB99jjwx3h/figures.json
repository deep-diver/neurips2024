Node 'j' is surrounded by node 'i' (i \u2208 surg(j)) if 'i' is a parent of 'j', and all children of 'j' are also children of 'i'.  The dashed ellipse highlights the children of node 'j', demonstrating that they are a subset of the children of node 'i'. This concept is crucial to understanding the intrinsic ambiguities in causal representation learning discussed in the paper.", "section": "3 The surrounding set and a notion of identifiability"}, {"figure_path": "dB99jjwx3h/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2.

The top two rows present box plots illustrating the SNA error and graph recovery accuracy. The bottom row displays an example causal graph used in the experiments along with the error metrics produced by the algorithm for each node in that graph. The results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to accurately recover causal relationships, especially at larger sample sizes.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "dB99jjwx3h/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2.

The y-axis shows both the SNA error (on a logarithmic scale) and the graph recovery accuracy (on a linear scale).  The x-axis represents the different values of t1 tested.  The box plots show the distribution of the performance metric for multiple trials.  The figure demonstrates that the algorithm achieves its best performance when t1 is set to 0.15, indicating an optimal balance between robustness to noise and accurate identification of the causal structure.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
