The top two rows present box plots illustrating the SNA (Surrounded-Node Ambiguity) error and graph recovery accuracy at various sample sizes, for different graph sizes (d) and numbers of environments (K). The bottom row provides a specific example causal graph, along with the SNA error and true error for each node, illustrating the algorithm's performance at different scales.", "section": "6 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "dB99jjwx3h/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: First two rows: plots of SNA Error and graph recovery accuracy achieved by LiNGCREL as functions of sample size (per environment) for different choices of graph size d and number of environments K.
