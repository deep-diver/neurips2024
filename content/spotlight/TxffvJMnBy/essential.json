", "The analysis introduces new analytical techniques with broader implications for control theory and related fields."], "tldr": "Online convex optimization (OCO) is a common framework for many online decision-making problems.  A more challenging variant is constrained online convex optimization (COCO), where constraints are revealed after each decision and the algorithm must balance minimizing cost and constraint violations.  Previous works had suboptimal solutions or restrictive assumptions. \nThis paper presents a novel first-order policy that simultaneously achieves optimal regret and constraint violation bounds in COCO under mild assumptions.  The policy effectively combines adaptive OCO policies with Lyapunov optimization, resulting in a simple and elegant solution with improved performance guarantees.  The approach is also extended to the Online Constraint Satisfaction (OCS) problem where only constraints are considered, obtaining sub-linear bounds under relaxed assumptions.", "affiliation": "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "TxffvJMnBy/podcast.wav"}
