This limits their ability to track scene elements consistently across time, especially in videos with motion.  This is a major limitation when it comes to many downstream tasks, such as object tracking and action recognition, which require observing how objects change their configuration over time regardless of their location in the image. \nTo address these limitations, the paper introduces Moving Off-the-Grid (MooG), a self-supervised video representation model.  MooG uses a combination of cross-attention and positional embeddings to allow tokens to move freely and track scene elements consistently over time.  This approach outperforms \"on-the-grid\" baselines and achieves competitive results with domain-specific methods on tasks such as point tracking, depth estimation, and object tracking. **MooG provides a strong foundation for various vision tasks by decoupling the representation structure from the image structure and enabling consistent tracking of scene elements.**", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "rjSPDVdUaw/podcast.wav"}
