It shows the Pearson correlation of predicted vs. observed neuronal responses, and the normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) for four key tuning properties: cross-orientation inhibition, phase invariance, orientation tuning, and surround suppression. Higher correlation indicates better predictive performance, while lower NMAE signifies greater consistency across model fits. The table allows for a quantitative comparison of the models' ability to reproduce both response patterns and known neuronal tuning characteristics.", "section": "Discussion"}, {"figure_path": "VXxj3XZ1X8/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Consistency of model predictions and tuning properties across model fits.
