### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current transcriptome foundation models (TFMs) treat single cells independently, ignoring valuable taxonomic relationships between cell types.  This limitation hinders the models' ability to capture biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns and generalize across diverse datasets.  Effectively leveraging cell ontology information during TFM pre-training is crucial for overcoming this limitation. 



To address this, the researchers developed scCello, a novel cell ontology-guided TFM. scCello incorporates cell-type coherence and ontology alignment losses into the pre-training process.  This innovative approach enables scCello to learn biologically meaningful patterns while maintaining its general-purpose nature.  **The model demonstrated superior performance in various downstream tasks, including novel cell type classification, marker gene prediction, and cancer drug response prediction**, surpassing existing TFMs in accuracy and generalizability.

### In-depth insights


#### Cell Ontology's Role
The integration of cell ontology significantly enhances the capabilities of transcriptome foundation models (TFMs).  **Cell ontology provides a structured representation of cell types and their hierarchical relationships**, which TFMs can leverage to learn biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns. By incorporating this information, TFMs are no longer limited to treating cells as independent samples. Instead, they can learn cell representations that reflect both the cell type and its relationships with other cell types. This allows the model to better understand the biological context of gene expression.  The benefits of using cell ontology are demonstrated by improvements in downstream tasks such as cell-type identification, novel cell-type classification, and marker gene prediction.  **The integration of cell ontology improves the generalizability and transferability of TFMs** making them more robust and applicable to diverse datasets.

#### scCello Pre-training
scCello's pre-training integrates cell ontology information to enhance cell representation learning.  **Three levels of objectives** guide this process: masked gene prediction to learn gene co-expression patterns; intra-cellular ontology coherence loss to encourage similar cell types to cluster together; and inter-cellular relational alignment to ensure cell embeddings align with their ontology relationships, leveraging Personalized PageRank scores.  **Cell-type coherence** and **ontology alignment losses**, combined with the standard masked gene prediction loss, are crucial for scCello's superior performance. This multifaceted approach is key to learning biologically meaningful representations and shows the value of incorporating prior biological knowledge into foundation model training. The approach demonstrably improves scCello's generalization and transferability compared to other transcriptome foundation models.

#### Downstream Tasks
The 'Downstream Tasks' section of a research paper would detail the various applications and analyses performed using the model developed in the study.  Given the context of a transcriptome foundation model (TFM) like scCello, **these tasks would likely focus on leveraging the model's learned representations of cells and genes for biological discovery**.  Examples of downstream tasks could include **cell type identification** (classifying cells into known or novel types), **marker gene prediction** (identifying genes specific to certain cell types), **drug response prediction** (predicting how cells will respond to specific drugs), and **batch effect correction** (removing technical variation between datasets). The success of these tasks would demonstrate the **generalizability and transferability** of the TFM, highlighting its ability to perform well on data not seen during training.  Furthermore, the section might include a discussion on how the TFM's performance on these downstream tasks compares to other existing methods, **quantifying the improvements achieved through the integration of cell ontology information** during the model's pre-training phase.  Overall, this section would serve as crucial validation of the model's utility and biological relevance.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In this context, an ablation study on a cell ontology guided transcriptome foundation model (TFM) would likely involve removing one of the loss functions (masked gene prediction, intra-cellular ontology coherence, or inter-cellular relational alignment) during pre-training.  By comparing the performance of the full model against these ablated versions on downstream tasks (like cell type classification or marker gene prediction), researchers can quantify the impact of each component. **The results would reveal which components are crucial for the model's success and highlight the effectiveness of the cell ontology integration.**  Such findings could guide future model development by informing design choices and resource allocation. **A key insight might concern the relative importance of gene co-expression pattern learning versus cell ontology knowledge in achieving high performance**. This could involve finding whether one loss is more crucial than others or if synergistic interactions exist between loss functions.

#### Future Work
The authors acknowledge several avenues for future investigation.  **Improving the efficiency of scCello's fine-tuning process** is crucial, ideally enabling continual learning to adapt to the ever-evolving cell ontology.  **Scaling up scCello's model size** is another key area, potentially unlocking greater expressiveness and capacity for more complex biological tasks.  Addressing limitations in the zero-shot marker gene prediction, such as the identification of essential genes, requires further investigation.  Finally, the **high computational cost of pre-training** necessitates exploration of more efficient training strategies and approaches to mitigate the environmental impact.  Addressing these points will significantly enhance scCello's capabilities and broader applicability.

> This figure compares the distributions of the Personalized PageRank (PPR) scores and the transformed structural similarity scores.  The PPR scores, representing the probability of a random walk starting from a target node and ending at another node in the cell ontology graph, show a skewed distribution concentrated at lower magnitudes.  The transformation applied to the PPR scores (shown in Equation 3 of the paper) results in a less-skewed distribution of structural similarity scores, making it easier to distinguish between similar and dissimilar cell types and facilitating the incorporation of ontology relationships into the TFM pre-training process. The transformation helps mitigate the effects of noise and uneven magnitudes in the raw PPR scores.

> This figure compares the distributions of Personalized PageRank (PPR) scores and the transformed structural similarity scores (sim).  The PPR scores are obtained directly from the PPR algorithm applied to the cell ontology graph.  The sim scores are derived from the PPR scores through a transformation process (described in the paper) to mitigate numerical noise, skewed distributions, and enhance the differences between similar and dissimilar cell types. This transformation is crucial for using the similarity information effectively in the scCello model training. The figure shows that the transformed structural similarity sim(¬∑) has a more balanced distribution and avoids overemphasizing small differences.


![](https://ai-paper-reviewer.com/aeYNVtTo7o/figures_16_1.jpg)

> This figure compares the distributions of PPR scores and structural similarity scores before and after a transformation.  The PPR scores, obtained from the Personalized PageRank algorithm, represent the structural similarity between cell types in the cell ontology graph. The original PPR scores show a skewed distribution, concentrated around lower values. However, after applying a transformation (described in Eqn. 3 of the paper) this distribution becomes less skewed and more clearly discretized.  This transformation improves the algorithm's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar cell types, making it more suitable for use in the pre-training of the transcriptome foundation model (TFM). The transformation involves applying a logarithmic scaling and discretization to the raw PPR scores to reduce the effects of noise and skewed magnitudes. This processed structural similarity is then used in the relational alignment loss of the model.

The transformed structural similarity, sim(¬∑), is shown to have a less skewed distribution, making it more suitable for use in the scCello pre-training framework, especially in the relational alignment loss calculation.  The plot highlights the effect of the transformation on improving the clarity and usability of the structural similarity measure for downstream tasks.
