### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Deep neural network (DNN) training dynamics are complex and varied, hindering our understanding of DNN generalization and efficiency.  Current methods for comparing DNN training dynamics rely on coarse-grained metrics like loss, which are insufficient to capture the nuances of DNN behavior. Identifying equivalent dynamics across different architectures is challenging due to the lack of precise mathematical definitions and computational tools. 

This research introduces a novel framework that addresses these limitations by utilizing Koopman operator theory. This framework enables the identification of topological conjugacies between DNN training dynamics, offering a precise definition of dynamical equivalence. The researchers validated this framework by correctly identifying known equivalences, and they used it to uncover both conjugate and non-conjugate dynamics across various architectures, including fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and transformers. The findings highlight the potential of this framework to improve our understanding of DNN training and to inspire the development of more efficient and robust training algorithms.

### In-depth insights


#### Equiv Dynamics ID
Identifying equivalent training dynamics in deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial for understanding their behavior and improving training efficiency.  **Topological conjugacy**, a concept from dynamical systems theory, provides a rigorous definition of dynamical equivalence, allowing researchers to identify when different DNN models exhibit similar training trajectories despite varying architectures or hyperparameters.  This method goes beyond simple loss comparisons, which can be misleading due to factors like initialization or architectural differences. The challenge lies in computing topological conjugacies, which are traditionally difficult for complex nonlinear systems like DNNs. The authors leverage advances in Koopman operator theory to develop a framework for identifying such equivalences. This is **a significant methodological advancement** because it enables the identification of dynamically equivalent DNNs from data, without requiring explicit knowledge of the governing equations, which are generally unknown for modern DNN architectures.  The framework's utility is demonstrated through validation against known equivalences and identification of novel conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics across several architectures and training regimes.

#### Koopman Spectrum
The Koopman spectrum, derived from Koopman operator theory, offers a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical systems.  It represents the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator, which governs the evolution of observables over time.  **Crucially, the Koopman spectrum is invariant to coordinate transformations**, making it an ideal tool for comparing the dynamics of different systems, even when their underlying equations differ. In the context of deep neural network (DNN) training, where the parameter space is high-dimensional and non-linear, the Koopman spectrum provides a **robust and computationally efficient way to quantify and compare training dynamics**. By analyzing the distribution and properties of the eigenvalues, one can reveal rich information about the nature of the training process.  For instance, **similar Koopman spectra can indicate that DNNs exhibit equivalent training dynamics**, suggesting that differences in architecture or hyperparameters may not necessarily lead to significantly different learning behaviors. Conversely, **distinct Koopman spectra highlight fundamental differences** in the training dynamics, revealing crucial insights into the impact of architectural or hyperparameter choices on DNN learning.

#### DNN Training
Deep neural network (DNN) training is a complex process involving the optimization of a vast number of parameters to minimize a loss function.  The paper explores the **nonlinear dynamics** of this process, revealing regimes of distinct dynamical behavior and demonstrating how topological conjugacy, a concept from dynamical systems theory, can be used to identify equivalent training dynamics.  The authors leverage advances in Koopman operator theory to develop a framework capable of distinguishing between conjugate and non-conjugate dynamics across various architectures, including fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers.  **Key findings** highlight the impact of network width on training dynamics, reveal dynamical transitions during the early phase of convolutional network training, and uncover distinct dynamics in transformers exhibiting grokking versus those that do not.  This work provides a novel framework to understand training, allowing for more precise comparisons and the potential for optimization improvements.

#### Grokking Dynamics
The phenomenon of "grokking" in deep learning, where models suddenly achieve high accuracy after a prolonged period of seemingly poor performance, presents a fascinating area of study.  Analyzing "grokking dynamics" requires investigating the underlying changes in the model's parameter space and activation patterns.  **Koopman operator theory offers a powerful tool for this analysis**, as it provides a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems. By applying KMD to the model's weight trajectories during training, we can identify the critical transitions associated with the onset of grokking. This might reveal **characteristic patterns in Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctions**, signifying the shift from a less successful, potentially chaotic, regime to a highly performant one. Comparing the dynamics of models that exhibit grokking with those that do not allows for distinguishing crucial features associated with successful generalization.  Furthermore, the analysis can uncover the role of factors like network architecture, optimization algorithm, and data characteristics in shaping grokking dynamics.  Ultimately, a deeper understanding of these dynamics could lead to **improved training strategies** that reliably induce such rapid leaps in performance and facilitate a more robust and efficient training process.

#### Future Works
Future research directions stemming from this work on identifying equivalent training dynamics in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are rich and multifaceted.  **Extending the Koopman operator framework to handle chaotic dynamics** is crucial, as this would unlock its application to a broader range of DNN training scenarios.  **Investigating the relationship between Koopman spectrum characteristics and generalization ability** would yield valuable insights for model design and optimization.  **Applying this framework to more complex architectures like transformers and recurrent neural networks** to fully explore the range of its applicability and to further investigate the dynamical transitions during training is needed.   **Developing a more robust metric for comparing Koopman spectra** that accounts for noise and finite sampling effects would enhance the reliability of topological conjugacy identification.  Finally, **integrating this dynamical systems perspective with existing DNN theoretical frameworks** to potentially refine existing theories of generalization and optimization algorithms may lead to a more complete understanding of DNN training.

It demonstrates that narrow and wide networks exhibit non-conjugate training dynamics, meaning their dynamics are not equivalent, while intermediate-width networks show more similarity to the wide networks. This is assessed by analyzing training loss, weight trajectories, Koopman eigenvalues (which indicate the timescales of the system), and the Wasserstein distance between the Koopman eigenvalues.

The figure shows how the Wasserstein distance between Koopman eigenvalues changes over the course of training.  The results suggest that CNN training dynamics undergo transitions, with similar patterns observed for both LeNet and ResNet-20, although the specific dynamics are architecture-specific.
