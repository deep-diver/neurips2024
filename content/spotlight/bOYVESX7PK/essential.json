Current methods for comparing DNN training dynamics rely on coarse-grained metrics like loss, which are insufficient to capture the nuances of DNN behavior. Identifying equivalent dynamics across different architectures is challenging due to the lack of precise mathematical definitions and computational tools. \nThis research introduces a novel framework that addresses these limitations by utilizing Koopman operator theory. This framework enables the identification of topological conjugacies between DNN training dynamics, offering a precise definition of dynamical equivalence. The researchers validated this framework by correctly identifying known equivalences, and they used it to uncover both conjugate and non-conjugate dynamics across various architectures, including fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and transformers. The findings highlight the potential of this framework to improve our understanding of DNN training and to inspire the development of more efficient and robust training algorithms.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "bOYVESX7PK/podcast.wav"}
