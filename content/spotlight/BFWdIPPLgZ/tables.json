It compares positional and semantic initializations using the Adam and SGD optimizers. The table presents the accuracy achieved by each initialization, along with the Euclidean distance between the initial and final weights, providing insight into the convergence behavior of different training approaches.", "section": "A The Histogram Task: An algorithmic toy example with a positional and semantic solution"}]
