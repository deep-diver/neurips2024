[{"figure_path": "jd3msHMtTL/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Results for the uniform dataset.", "description": "This figure shows the results of an experiment comparing different coreset construction methods on a uniform dataset.  Panel (a) displays a scatter plot of the uniform dataset with an overlaid sample from an orthogonal polynomial ensemble (OPE) based DPP.  Panel (b) presents a log-log plot illustrating the 0.90-quantile of the supremum relative error (a measure of coreset quality) against the coreset size (m) for various methods: uniform sampling, sensitivity-based sampling, OPE, Vdm-DPP, G-mDPP (with varying bandwidths h), and stratified sampling.  Panel (c) is another log-log plot showing the same error metric (0.90-quantile of supremum relative error) versus the coreset size, focusing on the performance of G-mDPP across different bandwidths (h). The results demonstrate the superior performance of DPP-based methods, especially OPE and Vdm-DPP, compared to independent sampling methods (uniform and sensitivity) for achieving high accuracy coresets with fewer data points.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "jd3msHMtTL/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Results on other datasets.", "description": "This figure presents the results of experiments on two different datasets: a trimodal dataset and the MNIST dataset after PCA dimensionality reduction. The leftmost subplot shows a scatter plot of the trimodal dataset with an OPE sample overlaid, while the other two subplots display log-log plots of the 0.90-quantile of the supremum relative error (Qs(0.9)) versus coreset size (m) for various coreset construction methods: uniform, sensitivity, OPE, Vdm-DPP, and G-mDPP. The plots illustrate the performance of different sampling methods for coreset construction and highlight the faster decay achieved by DPP-based methods on datasets with non-uniform distributions.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
