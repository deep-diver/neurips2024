Existing methods often struggle with issues related to non-convexity, multiple inner-level solutions, and sensitivity to parameterization, especially when using neural networks.\nThis research introduces a novel functional approach to address these issues. Instead of optimizing over the parameters of the inner-level function, they propose to optimize directly over the function space, ensuring a unique solution. This approach allows the use of over-parameterized models like neural networks without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.  They propose scalable algorithms for this functional perspective and demonstrate the benefits of their approach on instrumental regression and reinforcement learning tasks.", "affiliation": "Univ.
