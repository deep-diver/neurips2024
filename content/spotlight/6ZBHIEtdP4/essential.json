Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA aim to reduce this cost, but often suffer from slow convergence.  This is because LoRA initializes adapter matrices randomly, leading to inefficient early training. \n\nPiSSA addresses this by initializing adapter matrices using the principal components obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD) of the original model weights.  By updating principal components while freezing residual parts, PiSSA achieves significantly faster convergence and better performance compared to LoRA across various models and tasks.  PiSSA also demonstrates reduced quantization error when combined with quantization techniques.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "6ZBHIEtdP4/podcast.wav"}
