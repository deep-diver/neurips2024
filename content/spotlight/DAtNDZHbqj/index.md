### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with delayed observations, commonly addressed by state augmentation. However, this leads to increased state space dimensionality, hindering learning efficiency. Existing solutions using Temporal Difference (TD) learning still face this challenge. 



Variational Delayed Policy Optimization (VDPO) offers a novel approach by framing delayed RL as a variational inference problem.  It tackles the issue through a two-step iterative process: first, TD learning on a delay-free smaller state space environment to create a reference policy.  Second, behaviour cloning efficiently imitates this policy in the delayed environment.  **VDPO demonstrates superior sample efficiency (approximately 50% less samples) compared to state-of-the-art methods in MuJoCo benchmark tasks without compromising performance.**

### In-depth insights


#### Delayed RL Problem
The core challenge in delayed reinforcement learning (RL) stems from the **broken Markovian property** induced by the delay.  Standard RL algorithms assume that the current state encapsulates all necessary information for optimal decision-making. However, when observations are delayed, the agent lacks access to the most recent states, leading to significant learning difficulties. This necessitates innovative solutions to either restore the Markovian property or develop algorithms robust to non-Markovian dynamics. **State augmentation**, a common approach, involves adding past actions and observations to the state, effectively creating a larger, more complex state space. However, this approach also suffers from increased computational cost and sample complexity.  **Variational methods** offer a promising alternative by casting delayed RL as a variational inference problem, which enables the use of optimization tools that may be less sensitive to the high-dimensionality problem of state augmentation.  Ultimately, effective solutions require careful consideration of the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, and exploring new theoretical frameworks remains an active area of research.

#### Variational Approach
A variational approach to delayed reinforcement learning offers a powerful alternative to traditional methods. By framing the problem as variational inference, it elegantly addresses the challenge of sample inefficiency inherent in delayed MDPs.  **The core idea is to decouple the learning process into two steps**: First, a reference policy is learned in a delay-free environment, simplifying the state space and making learning efficient. Second, behavior cloning efficiently adapts this policy to the delayed setting. This two-step approach leverages the strengths of both TD learning and imitation learning, achieving significant sample efficiency gains while maintaining strong performance.  **The theoretical analysis further supports the method's effectiveness**, demonstrating reduced sample complexity compared to TD-only approaches.  **However, limitations exist**, particularly in handling stochastic delays, which suggests further investigation is needed.  Overall, the variational approach represents a significant advancement in addressing the complexities of delayed reinforcement learning.

#### Sample Efficiency
The concept of sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial, especially when dealing with complex environments.  **Reducing the number of samples needed to achieve a desired performance level translates directly to reduced training time and computational costs.** The paper focuses on improving sample efficiency in delayed reinforcement learning scenarios, which are inherently more challenging due to the non-Markovian nature of the problem.  The authors introduce a novel framework, VDPO, that leverages variational inference to reformulate the problem, leading to a significant enhancement in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art techniques. This is achieved by using a two-step optimization approach: TD learning in a simplified delay-free environment, followed by behaviour cloning in the delayed setting.  **The theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate a substantial improvement, achieving comparable performance with approximately 50% fewer samples.** This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the sample complexity challenges frequently encountered in delayed RL.  However, the analysis is limited to specific benchmarks and delay settings, raising questions about its generalizability.  **Future work should focus on broader evaluations and extensions to stochastic delay scenarios** to fully validate the robustness and practical applicability of VDPO.

#### VDPO Algorithm
The Variational Delayed Policy Optimization (VDPO) algorithm presents a novel approach to address the challenges of reinforcement learning in environments with delayed observations.  **VDPO cleverly reframes the delayed RL problem as a variational inference task**, thereby leveraging the power of variational methods for efficient optimization.  This reformulation leads to a two-step iterative process: first, a reference policy is learned in a delay-free environment using traditional TD learning methods, capitalizing on the smaller state space for enhanced efficiency. Second, behavior cloning is employed to adapt this reference policy to the delayed setting, significantly reducing the computational burden typically associated with TD learning in high-dimensional augmented state spaces.  **The theoretical analysis supports VDPO's enhanced sample efficiency** by demonstrating that it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while requiring substantially fewer samples. The empirical results further validate this claim, showcasing significant improvements in sample efficiency across various MuJoCo benchmark tasks.  **The algorithm's inherent flexibility in choosing the delay-free RL method** adds another layer of appeal, allowing researchers to tailor the approach to specific problem needs.

#### Future Works
The paper's discussion of future work highlights several promising avenues.  **Extending the VDPO framework to handle stochastic delays** is crucial for real-world applicability, as constant delays are rarely encountered in practice.  This requires a more robust theoretical analysis and potentially algorithmic modifications to the core VDPO approach.  **Investigating different neural network architectures** beyond the transformer-based approach used in this study could further enhance sample efficiency and overall performance.  **Comparing VDPO's performance against a broader set of baselines**, particularly those designed for stochastic delays, would strengthen the conclusions. Finally, **exploring applications in more complex, high-dimensional environments** would demonstrate the scalability and generalizability of VDPO and its ability to handle more realistic scenarios.
