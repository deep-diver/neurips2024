> This figure illustrates the workflow of the proposed method for computing gradients of functions of large matrices. It starts with a parameter Œ∏ that is used to compute a large matrix-vector product via Arnoldi or Lanczos iterations. These iterations are then used to obtain a small factorization, which is subsequently used to compute the function of the large matrix. Finally, the loss is calculated based on the function of the large matrix. The gradients are computed using the adjoint method, propagating the gradient backward through the entire process, making the matrix-free implementation of matrix decompositions differentiable.

### In-depth insights


#### Matrix Calculus
Matrix calculus extends the rules of single-variable calculus to matrices, enabling the differentiation of functions involving matrices and vectors.  **This is crucial for optimizing machine learning models**, where many functions are defined in terms of matrix operations.  The paper's approach to matrix calculus is particularly notable because it leverages adjoint methods, avoiding the explicit computation of the Jacobian matrix, which would be computationally infeasible for large matrices.  **The adjoint method's efficiency stems from its ability to implicitly compute gradient information without forming the potentially immense Jacobian**.  The application to large-scale machine learning models‚Äîparticularly those involving Gaussian processes, partial differential equations, and Bayesian neural networks‚Äîhighlights the practical significance of their efficient approach to matrix calculus. **The derivation of adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations is a key theoretical contribution**, enabling automatic differentiation for functions that are traditionally difficult to handle.  This allows for the development of matrix-free algorithms, where gradients are computed without explicitly forming the large matrices, making large-scale optimization tractable.

#### Adjoint Methods
Adjoint methods, in the context of this research paper, are presented as **efficient techniques for differentiating matrix functions** commonly used in machine learning models.  The core idea is to avoid explicitly computing the often massive Jacobian matrix, instead leveraging the adjoint system to calculate gradients implicitly.  This approach is particularly crucial when dealing with large matrices that are accessed only via matrix-vector products, as is common in various model types. **The paper focuses on deriving the adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations**, which are widely used for matrix decompositions in situations where a full matrix factorization is computationally prohibitive.  This derivation enables the automatic differentiation of functions of large matrices, leading to efficient gradient computations and facilitating optimization of models with large numbers of parameters. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically demonstrated through case studies involving Gaussian processes, PDEs, and Bayesian neural networks, highlighting its practical advantages over conventional methods.

#### Lanczos Adjoints
The concept of "Lanczos Adjoints" revolves around efficiently computing gradients of functions involving large matrices, a common challenge in machine learning and scientific computing.  The Lanczos algorithm, a powerful technique for approximating matrix functions, is typically used in a matrix-free manner to avoid storing the full Jacobian matrix.  **The key innovation is the derivation of adjoint systems for the Lanczos iteration.** This allows the computation of gradients via reverse-mode automatic differentiation without ever explicitly forming or storing the large matrix, maintaining computational efficiency.  **The adjoint method avoids the inefficiency of direct backpropagation through the Lanczos algorithm** which would be prohibitively expensive for large matrices.  This approach enables the application of gradient-based optimization methods to problems previously intractable due to computational limitations. The presented adjoint systems provide a practical and computationally efficient mechanism for extending the applicability of Lanczos-based matrix computations to broader gradient-based optimization problems in machine learning and scientific computing.

#### GP & PDEs
The fusion of Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) presents a powerful paradigm for scientific machine learning. **GPs excel at modeling uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge**, while **PDEs capture the underlying physical laws and relationships**.  By combining them, we can leverage the strengths of both to create models capable of handling complex, high-dimensional data with inherent uncertainty, typical of many scientific applications.  **A key challenge lies in efficient computation**, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex PDEs.  The research likely explores novel methods for addressing this computational bottleneck, perhaps focusing on matrix-free techniques or leveraging the structure of the PDE to accelerate inference.  The approach might involve approximating the solution to the PDE and using this approximation to construct a GP model, or it could involve incorporating the PDE directly into the GP prior.  Another crucial aspect would be the **evaluation of model accuracy and uncertainty**, ensuring that the model's predictive power is reliable and that the uncertainty estimates accurately reflect the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the data and the model.  Therefore, **a comprehensive comparison with traditional methods**, both for accuracy and efficiency, would be important to demonstrate the efficacy of this combined approach.  Overall, the study likely offers a compelling blend of theoretical and practical contributions, addressing a significant need in diverse fields such as materials science, fluid dynamics, and climate modeling.

#### BNN Calibration
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) offer a principled approach to uncertainty quantification, but calibrating their predictive probabilities is crucial for reliable decision-making.  **BNN calibration focuses on aligning the network's reported confidence with its actual accuracy.**  Poor calibration leads to overconfident predictions, undermining the BNN's practical value.  Methods for BNN calibration often involve techniques to better approximate the posterior distribution of the network's weights, for example, through Laplace approximations. However, **exact computation of the posterior is often intractable for large BNNs**, necessitating approximations such as stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or variational inference.  **The choice of calibration method significantly impacts the BNN's predictive performance and computational cost.**  Furthermore, the effectiveness of calibration may depend on the network architecture, the dataset, and the hyperparameters. **Recent research emphasizes matrix-free methods for efficient gradient computations**, particularly relevant for large models where constructing and manipulating full Hessian or covariance matrices is prohibitive.  This allows for the calibration of models with a large number of parameters, otherwise computationally infeasible.

> The figure shows a comparison of the performance of three methods for computing gradients of matrix functions. The methods considered are backpropagation, the adjoint method, and the authors' new method. The x-axis represents the depth of the Krylov subspace used, and the y-axis represents wall-clock time in seconds. The figure shows that the authors' method is significantly faster than backpropagation, while maintaining the same linear runtime and memory complexity. The speedup provided by the new algorithm is due to the way gradients of matrix functions are computed. In standard backpropagation, gradients are obtained by backpropagating through the entire computation graph. The authors' method, on the other hand, computes gradients using the adjoint method, which is computationally more efficient and scalable. For small Krylov subspace depths, the computational time is approximately equal for all methods; however, as the Krylov subspace depth increases, backpropagation becomes significantly slower.

The forward pass serves as a baseline.

This highlights that while the proposed method is efficient for smaller matrices, high-performance libraries like KeOps still offer significant advantages for truly large-scale problems.
