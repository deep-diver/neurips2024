This has resulted in many recent jailbreaking attacks, where an adversary modifies a prompt manually to circumvent alignment training and induce harmful behavior. These attacks can be created manually by humans [Liu et al., 2023b, Wei et al., 2023, Zeng et al., 2024], refined with another LLM [Chao et al., 2023, Mehrotra et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023a, Jin et al., 2024, Paulus et al., 2024], or generated with discrete optimization [Zou et al., 2023, Lapid et al., 2023, Zhu et al., 2023b, Sadasivan et al., 2024].

Additional defenses have recently been proposed with the discovery of additional failure modes, such as jailbreaking, on aligned LLMs. For instance, [Jain et al., 2023] examines simple defenses such as rephrasing the input and finds that the GCG attack [Zou et al., 2023] can be defended with a perplexity filter.

We find perplexity filtering is highly effective on GCG but is not effective on the natural language jailbreak prompts in PAIR and JBC. SmoothLLM is more effective across multiple attacks due to not relying on the perplexity heuristic. Still, it cannot defend against a significant proportion of prompts from PAIR, the strongest attack. Rephrasing is surprisingly effective, especially on JBC for Vicuna, outperforming the other defenses. We observe RPO is more effective than all baseline defenses on PAIR for all models, reducing ASR by $66\\%$ on Vicuna and $44\\%$ on GPT-4 and improving on the state-of-the-art defense SmoothLLM by $31\\%$ and $19\\%$ . This also shows that RPO suffixes transfer across models, as the suffix was optimized using Llama-2 but can transfer to Vicuna and even closed-source GPT models. Notably, RPO reduces GCG ASR to $0\\%$ for all models, fully defending against the attack. Using RPO with Llama-2 makes the model robust to all three attacks, the first time a model is fully robust on JailbreakBench. The only setting where RPO is not the strongest defense is JBC on Vicuna, where other defenses are more effective. This may be due to the lack of safety training on the older Vicuna model, making it less responsive to our defense.

HarmBench marks a difficult distribution shift from the optimization setup of RPO as it contains many attacks RPO was not optimized on and has a broader inclusion of behaviors, such as copyright infringement and contextual behaviors referencing user context. These categories are not covered in the instructions we optimize RPO on, forcing the defense to generalize. Despite this, in Tab. 2 we observe RPO transfers to all attacks in HarmBench for all models, generalizing to difficult attacks such as TAP and AutoDAN. Notably, RPO reduces ASR by an average of $18\\%$ , $6.6\\%$ , $8.7\\%$ , and $3.5\\%$ for Vicuna, Llama-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, respectively. This suggests RPO is universally effective as a defense for harmful queries, irrespective of the attack.

SmoothLLM and the rephrasing defense are not straightforward to attack in this setting, so we use the generic adversary. For RPO, we consider an adversary that can optimize an attack on top of the RPO suffix. We find in Tab. 3 that RPO retains state-of-the-art performance on JailbreakBench even under this more challenging threat model. We observe a small $4\\%$ ASR increase on PAIR and a $1\\%$ ASR increase on GCG for Vicuna. Notably, Llama-2 retains full robustness to both PAIR and GCG.

As LLMs become increasingly deployed in real-world contexts, it is imperative for defenses to be practical, cheap, and not greatly affect benign use. In Tab. 4, we evaluate models with RPO on MT-Bench [Zheng et al., 2023], which evaluates multiturn interaction and Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [Hendrycks et al., 2021], which evaluates domain knowledge. We observe that MMLU performance is largely unaffected, but we observe a small performance reduction on MT-Bench. Surprisingly, we find that using RPO on benign prompts will not cause unnecessary rejection even when optimizing the suffix on only harmful instructions. This may be due to the implicit tendency of models to reject these instructions, suggesting RPO only strengthens this inclination rather than introducing a new refusal mechanism. The responses also do not appear qualitatively different, except in some cases where the model explicitly mentions the suffix in its response. This failure case occurs mainly with shorter instructions. An example of this is provided in Sec. C in the Appendix. To minimize this effect for production, we suggest only applying RPO to longer queries, as stronger attacks also increase input length. This could also be mitigated by optimizing semantically meaningful suffixes, which we leave to future work. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Additionally, RPO has a small inference cost of 20 additional tokens. This is generally much lower than baselines such as SmoothLLM, which involve at least twice as many additional full inference calls as normal usage. Finally, while RPO suffixes can be expensive to optimize, this can be offset by the ease of transferability to other models compared to other defenses with high computational costs, such as adversarial training, which is local to the base model. In practice, we find that optimizing an RPO suffix is around 8x cheaper than a GCG suffix and only takes a few hours, due to the natural tendency of LLMs to already refuse harmful instructions. The lower optimization cost also suggests RPO suffixes improve robustness by enhancing refusal mechanisms, allowing transfer to different LLMs and attacks.

By formalizing an optimization-based objective that directly incorporates the threat model, RPO generates transferable and lightweight defensive suffixes that are robust to a wide range of attacks, including unseen ones. Our experiments on JailbreakBench and HarmBench demonstrate RPO\u2019s superior performance compared to existing defenses, reducing attack success rates significantly across different models while incurring only minor effects on benign usage. This suggests text-based jailbreaking may be an easier problem to address than adversarial attacks in vision. However, RPO does not currently cover multimodal models, LLM agents, or other failure modes such as deception and malicious code generation. Proposing our defense may also lead to the development of stronger attacks, including those that can break RPO. Indeed, while we observe high transferability to new attacks, using RPO does not typically result in full robustness. Future directions include optimizing defenses on a greater variety of attacks, combining various defenses into comprehensive guardrails, and stronger red teaming strategies to discover new security risks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
