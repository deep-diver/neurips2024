Existing defenses often fail against new attacks or have high computational costs.  This paper addresses these issues.\nThe paper proposes Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO), an algorithm that optimizes a short, transferable suffix added to the input prompt.  RPO directly incorporates the adversary into its optimization objective, improving the model's resilience to worst-case attacks. Experiments show that RPO significantly reduces attack success rates on various LLMs, setting a new state-of-the-art in defense against jailbreaking attacks.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "jXs6Cvpe7k/podcast.wav"}
