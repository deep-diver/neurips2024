### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current video understanding methods struggle with the complexity of videos and noisy web video-text data, requiring extensive pre-training on large-scale video data. This is computationally expensive and limits accessibility for researchers.  This paper introduces a novel approach, TOPA, which tackles these challenges. 



TOPA uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate "textual videos" with corresponding annotations, simulating real video-text pairs.  It then uses these simulated pairs for pre-alignment with the video modality via CLIP model. This method successfully extends LLMs to video understanding without pre-training on real video data and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging video benchmarks like EgoSchema.

### In-depth insights


#### TOPA: LLM Video Alignment
The concept of "TOPA: LLM Video Alignment" presents a novel approach to bridging the gap between large language models (LLMs) and video understanding.  Instead of relying on traditional video-text pre-training with real video data, **TOPA leverages an LLM to generate synthetic "Textual Videos," sequences of textual descriptions mimicking real video frames.** This allows for efficient pre-alignment of the LLM to video modalities without the need for extensive video data. **A key strength is the use of CLIP for feature extraction**, aligning textual and visual representations.  **The effectiveness of TOPA is demonstrated through impressive zero-shot and fine-tuning results on challenging video understanding benchmarks**, highlighting its potential as a cost-effective and efficient method for video-LLM alignment. However, **limitations exist, including the modality gap between textual and visual CLIP features and challenges in capturing fine-grained visual details.** Future work could explore methods to mitigate these limitations, such as incorporating video instruction tuning.

#### Textual Video Dataset
A textual video dataset is a novel approach to video understanding that sidesteps the complexities of directly using real video data.  Instead of relying on video frames, **it leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate sequences of textual descriptions, simulating the temporal dynamics of a video**.  This approach bypasses challenges associated with visual-textual misalignment and inefficient language supervision in web-collected video-text datasets.  The dataset's effectiveness hinges on the LLM's ability to create rich and accurate textual representations, effectively capturing video content. **High-quality annotations, including dense descriptions and question-answer pairs, are crucial for successful pre-alignment of LLMs with the video modality.** The dataset provides a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional video-text datasets, potentially addressing data scarcity limitations inherent in current video understanding research. The generation process itself is also significant, highlighting the capabilities of LLMs in creating synthetic yet realistic multimodal data. The quality of this synthetic data will directly influence the effectiveness of any downstream task.

#### Zero-Shot Video Tasks
Zero-shot video task evaluation is crucial for assessing the generalization capabilities of video understanding models.  It reveals how well a model can perform on unseen video categories or tasks without any prior training data for those specific categories.  **Strong zero-shot performance demonstrates a model's robust learning of underlying visual and semantic concepts**, transferring knowledge effectively across different domains. However, **the inherent complexity and variability of videos pose significant challenges for zero-shot learning**.  Success often relies on the model's ability to leverage pre-training on large, diverse video-text datasets.  Furthermore, the design of appropriate zero-shot evaluation metrics that accurately capture model understanding is critical.  **Careful consideration of dataset bias and the definition of task success are needed** to ensure meaningful and fair evaluation.  Future research directions include improving the robustness of zero-shot methods against domain shift and noise, developing more comprehensive benchmarks that capture varied aspects of visual understanding, and investigating novel training strategies that specifically target zero-shot generalization.

#### TOPA Limitations
The TOPA framework, while demonstrating promising results in video-language understanding, is not without limitations.  A crucial limitation stems from the inherent **modality gap between CLIP's image and text encoders**.  TOPA's reliance on CLIP for feature extraction introduces a discrepancy between training (textual videos) and inference (real videos), hindering performance.  The reliance on textual video representations also means TOPA may struggle with tasks needing fine-grained temporal understanding or fine-grained visual details that textual descriptions often miss.  **The inability to capture the nuanced visual dynamics of real videos** is another key limitation, impacting performance on tasks requiring precise visual analysis.   While TOPA mitigates the modality gap through a projection technique, this approach inherently limits its capability to handle highly detailed or subtle visual aspects.  Therefore, while a significant advancement, TOPA's performance is dependent on the quality of the textual video representation and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world video understanding.

#### Future Research
Future research directions stemming from this TOPA framework could explore several promising avenues. **Firstly, enhancing the model's ability to handle fine-grained visual details** is crucial, perhaps through integrating more advanced visual feature extractors or incorporating mechanisms for explicit temporal modeling. **Secondly, investigating different LLMs** beyond Llama 2 could reveal the extent of TOPA's generalizability and potential for even greater performance gains.  **Thirdly, expanding the TextVid dataset** to encompass a wider range of video styles and complexities will further enhance the robustness of the pre-alignment process.  Finally,  **combining TOPA with video instruction tuning** could unlock the next level of video understanding, bridging the gap between textual and visual representations in a more powerful way.  This fusion of techniques holds significant potential for advancing video-language capabilities.

> This table presents the zero-shot video captioning results on MSR-VTT and VATEX benchmarks, using CIDEr scores as the evaluation metric.  It compares the performance of various models, categorized into those pre-trained on web video-text data and those using a text-only pre-training approach (TOPA). The table highlights the performance improvement achieved by TOPA compared to other text-only methods and even some video-text pre-training methods.

> This table presents the results of a blind test conducted on the EgoSchema benchmark.  The 'Blind' setting means that the model only received the questions and choices, but not the actual video. This tests the model's ability to answer questions based solely on its pre-existing knowledge and linguistic understanding.  The table compares the performance of several LLMs (Large Language Models) under this blind condition. The performance of TOPA models (TOPA-Llama2-7B and TOPA-Llama2-13B) is also shown, demonstrating their ability to perform well even without access to the video.

> This table presents the ablation study on the number of video frames used as input to the TOPA model for the NeXT-QA and EgoSchema benchmarks.  It shows the performance of Llama2-7B and Llama2-13B models with 1, 5, and 10 frames, demonstrating how the accuracy increases with the number of frames, indicating the model's ability to capture temporal dynamics from more video information.

> This table compares the performance of various methods on the EgoSchema benchmark's subset and full set for multi-choice video QA.  The 'Gap' column shows the difference in accuracy between the subset and full set, highlighting the challenge of generalizing to more complex and diverse video data. The methods include those using similarity-based approaches, LLM logits, and LLM selection. TOPA is shown with and without multi-choice training to demonstrate the impact of this type of training. This table demonstrates the impact of using different evaluation methods (LLM Logits vs LLM Selection) on the performance gap between the subset and full set of the EgoSchema dataset.

> This table presents the ablation study of the modality projection (Equation 2) in the TOPA framework. It shows the results on the EgoSchema full set for two different models, TOPA-LLama2-7B and TOPA-LLama2-13B, with and without the modality projection. The modality projection aims to bridge the gap between CLIP text features used in pre-training and CLIP image features used in inference, improving the model's performance.

> This table presents the zero-shot results on the EgoSchema benchmark.  It compares various video understanding approaches, categorized by their method (web video pre-training, adapting image MLLMs, LLM-based video agents, and the proposed TOPA method).  The results are shown as accuracy at Top-1 (Acc@1), highlighting the performance of each method on the full EgoSchema dataset and, in some cases, a subset.  The table also notes which methods use closed-source LLMs and those trained on in-domain egocentric videos.

> This table presents the vocabulary size of textual videos (Tideos) generated using different prompts.  The prompts are based on four different datasets: Howto100m, Ego4D, WebVid, and WordNet.  To ensure a fair comparison, a random sample of 20,000 global captions was selected from each dataset's generated Tideos, and the resulting vocabulary size was then calculated and displayed in the table. This analysis helps to understand the diversity of the language used across different sources and their impact on the generated Tideos.

> This table details the hyperparameters used for training the various models in the paper. It includes information about the model, training dataset, number of epochs, effective batch size, base learning rate, and the optimizer used.  The table differentiates between the pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase for the TOPA models, and also shows hyperparameters for the baseline models for comparison.
