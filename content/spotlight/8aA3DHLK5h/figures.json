It shows how the regret vector Rt is updated iteratively. The vector gt represents the instantaneous loss at iteration t, which is projected onto the simplex (\u2206\u00b2) to obtain the next strategy xt. The algorithm maintains a running sum of regrets (Rt), and the strategy xt at each step is obtained by normalizing this sum.  The stepsize \u03b7 is implicitly present in the update rule; the algorithm is stepsize invariant because only the direction, and not the magnitude, of Rt matters for determining xt.", "section": "Treeplex Blackwell approachability"}, {"figure_path": "8aA3DHLK5h/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Convergence to a Nash equilibrium for PTB+, CFR\u207a, PCFR\u207a and SC-POMD.
