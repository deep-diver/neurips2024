Specifically, it compares the performance of three variants of UM2N: UM2N-coord (using coordinate loss), UM2N-sol (using PDE solutions as input), and the original UM2N (using element volume loss and monitor functions). The performance is measured by the PDE error reduction ratio (ER) for three different PDE types: Helmholtz, Swirl, and Cylinder. The results show that the original UM2N outperforms the other variants, highlighting the effectiveness of the chosen design choices.", "section": "5.4 Ablation study"}, {"figure_path": "lcALCNF2qe/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results across mesh movement methods.
