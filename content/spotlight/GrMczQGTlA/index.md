### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Real-world humanoid robot control is a challenging problem because of the high dimensionality and complexity of the interactions involved, as well as the difficulty of collecting large amounts of training data. Existing approaches like reinforcement learning often rely on extensive trial-and-error learning in simulations before being transferred to the real world. This paper addresses these issues.  The proposed approach trains a transformer model to predict the next state and action in sensorimotor sequences using a novel autoregressive next token prediction method. This method significantly reduces the amount of data required for training, allowing for more efficient learning and generalization to new environments.

### In-depth insights


#### Next Token Prediction
The concept of "Next Token Prediction" offers a novel framework for approaching humanoid locomotion control.  By framing the problem as predicting the next element (token) in a sequence of sensorimotor data, the approach cleverly leverages the power of transformer models. This is a **significant departure** from traditional methods, moving away from explicit control designs and instead learning from large datasets of various modalities, including robot sensor data, motion capture, and even YouTube videos of humans.  This data diversity is **crucial** for robustness and generalizability.  The **modality-aligned prediction** is particularly ingenious, allowing the model to handle missing data points and learn from incomplete sensorimotor sequences. This ability to learn from various sources allows for efficient data utilization and a powerful zero-shot transfer to real-world scenarios. The **generative modeling** aspect is key, as it allows learning of the joint sensorimotor distribution, moving beyond simply conditioning actions on observations. Ultimately, this paradigm shift towards prediction demonstrates a promising path towards building more robust and adaptable humanoid robots.

#### Multimodal Learning
Multimodal learning, in the context of a research paper on humanoid locomotion, would explore how to effectively combine different data sources such as visual, proprioceptive, and motor control signals to improve robot control and learning.  A key aspect would be how to represent and fuse these diverse modalities, **potentially using transformer-based architectures** to learn rich, integrated representations of sensorimotor data. The effectiveness would be evaluated through metrics like **zero-shot generalization to new environments and improved robustness**.  Challenges in multimodal learning, such as **handling missing modalities** (e.g., videos without corresponding motor commands), and **managing the high dimensionality** of multimodal data, would also be discussed.  The discussion would highlight the potential advantages of a multimodal approach over unimodal methods, showing how combining diverse sensory information leads to more robust and adaptable humanoid locomotion.  Finally, **the impact of different data sources (simulated vs. real-world)**, and the scalability of the proposed approach to larger datasets would be analyzed.

#### Zero-Shot Transfer
Zero-shot transfer, in the context of robotics, signifies a model's capacity to generalize to unseen environments or tasks without any explicit retraining or fine-tuning on those specific scenarios.  This capability is particularly valuable because it significantly reduces the time and resources traditionally needed to adapt robots to new situations. The success of a zero-shot transfer largely depends on the richness and diversity of the training data,  **ensuring the model learns generalizable representations rather than just memorizing specific instances**.  A model achieving robust zero-shot transfer often leverages a strong underlying representation learning mechanism that captures underlying principles of locomotion and control, thus enabling generalization to novel contexts. This approach is crucial for creating more adaptable and robust robots that can effectively function in dynamic and complex real-world environments. **The key challenge remains balancing generalizability with avoiding overgeneralization**, ensuring that the model maintains sufficient performance across various scenarios while also avoiding catastrophic failures in unexpected situations.  **Effective zero-shot transfer, therefore, requires not just sophisticated algorithms but also meticulous data curation and model design** that prioritize learning robust and generalizable representations of sensorimotor dynamics.

#### Data Efficiency
The concept of data efficiency is central to evaluating the success of machine learning models, especially in resource-constrained domains like robotics.  This paper tackles the challenge by demonstrating that **a generative modeling approach, using a transformer network to predict sensorimotor sequences, significantly improves data efficiency** compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods. The model's ability to learn from incomplete data (e.g., videos without motor commands) is a crucial aspect of its efficiency, allowing it to leverage diverse and readily available data sources.  **The model's performance scales favorably with dataset size, context length, and model capacity**, indicating the potential to further enhance data efficiency by increasing the volume and richness of the training data.  **Zero-shot generalization to unseen environments and commands highlights the robustness and adaptability of this learned representation**, further contributing to its overall data efficiency.  The findings strongly suggest that generative modeling presents a promising pathway for developing data-efficient control strategies in robotics and other complex real-world applications.

#### Real-world Locomotion
The successful transition of humanoid locomotion from simulation to real-world environments is a significant achievement.  The paper highlights the **zero-shot generalization** capabilities of the model, enabling the robot to navigate diverse terrains like walkways, asphalt, and even uneven city streets in San Francisco. This demonstrates the robustness and adaptability of the learned control policy.  A key aspect is the **generative modeling** approach.  Instead of solely relying on reinforcement learning, the model is trained to predict sensorimotor sequences, incorporating data from multiple sources and handling missing modalities.  This **data-driven approach** allows for a more generalized and robust solution compared to traditional methods that often struggle with real-world complexities and noisy data. The **ability to train with incomplete data** such as human videos, further improves the model's generalization capacity.  However, challenges remain. While impressive, the performance is not without limitations. Future work should focus on addressing robustness issues to handle unexpected events or terrain variations in real-world settings.

It starts by showing the various data sources used for training: neural network policies, model-based controllers, motion capture data, and videos from YouTube. All of this data is fed into a transformer model for training via autoregressive prediction. The trained model is then deployed on a real humanoid robot to perform zero-shot locomotion in various locations in San Francisco.

The scatter plot displays the position tracking error (y-axis) against the prediction loss (x-axis) for fourteen different models trained with varied training methods, architectures, and data sizes. The strong positive correlation (r=0.87) indicates that models with lower prediction errors generally exhibit better position tracking accuracy.
