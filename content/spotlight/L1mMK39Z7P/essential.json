However, automating this creative process remains a challenge, particularly in the context of programming puzzles, where the objective quality of generated problems needs to be measured against various solver models.  Existing methods often fall short, failing to consistently produce a range of solvable yet difficult puzzles.\n\nThe proposed solution is Autotelic Code Search (ACES). ACES leverages LLMs to generate and label problems based on a set of programming skills, measuring difficulty as the inverse of solver success rates. By iteratively prompting the LLM with diverse examples, ACES generates a wider range of problems than existing baselines, significantly outperforming benchmarks across 11 state-of-the-art code LLMs.  This approach establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLM code generation capabilities.
