The left panel depicts the scenario without property rights, demonstrating inefficient outcomes due to the externality, while the right panel shows the efficient outcome achieved when property rights are established and bargaining is possible. The plots illustrate the convergence of the system towards the social welfare optimum when property rights are enforced.", "section": "Experiments"}]
