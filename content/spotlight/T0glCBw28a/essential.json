{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers seeking cost-effective and efficient data annotation methods.  It introduces a novel approach that significantly reduces annotation costs while maintaining or even improving accuracy, impacting various fields relying on labeled datasets.  The open-source code and extension to non-text modalities further enhance its impact, opening doors for diverse applications and future research. This will be highly beneficial for researchers that lack big budget.", "summary": "Alchemist, a novel automated labeling system, reduces data annotation costs by 500x compared to LLMs while improving accuracy by an average of 12.9%.", "takeaways": ["Alchemist drastically cuts data annotation costs while achieving comparable or better accuracy than large language models.", "The system's methodology of generating programs for labeling is adaptable to various data types, including non-text modalities.", "Incorporating supplementary information into prompts improves labeling accuracy."], "tldr": "High annotation costs and limitations of existing large language model (LLM)-based approaches are major hurdles in many machine learning projects.  LLM-based methods often involve expensive API calls and the resulting datasets are challenging to adapt or audit. This research addresses these limitations.  The proposed approach generates code (programs) that act as data labelers, thereby drastically reducing the reliance on expensive API calls and making auditing easier.\nThe system, called Alchemist, achieves comparable or better performance in various tasks at a fraction of the cost. The core innovation is the use of **program synthesis** instead of directly querying LLMs for labels.   The generated programs are locally executable, enabling cost-effective and easily adaptable labeling pipelines.  Alchemist demonstrates its capabilities across multiple datasets and extends beyond text modalities to images via a simple multimodal extension, offering a versatile solution for researchers.
