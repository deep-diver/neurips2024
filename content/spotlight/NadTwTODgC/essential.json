This simplification can lead to a loss of crucial information, especially visual details, which are vital for effective reinforcement learning.  The limited expressiveness of such models restricts the applications of world models in various fields. \nTo address these issues, this paper introduces DIAMOND, a reinforcement learning agent that uses a diffusion model as its world model.  This approach allows the agent to capture fine-grained visual information, resulting in significantly improved performance compared to existing state-of-the-art world models on the Atari 100k benchmark.  Furthermore, the diffusion model is shown to be effective as an independent interactive game engine, opening doors to new applications and research.", "affiliation": "University of Geneva", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "NadTwTODgC/podcast.wav"}
