### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Real-world image denoising is hampered by complex, signal-dependent noise, which current methods struggle to model accurately.  Existing diffusion-based approaches either simplify noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting effectiveness.  This restricts their use in scenarios with structured or signal-dependent noise.

This paper introduces a novel approach that uses adaptive likelihood estimation and maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference during reverse diffusion. By combining a non-identically distributed likelihood with noise precision, it dynamically infers precision posterior using variational Bayes and refines the likelihood.  A local Gaussian convolution further rectifies estimated noise variance, leading to improved denoising.  The use of low-resolution diffusion models directly handles high-resolution images, enhancing efficiency. Experiments show that this method outperforms existing techniques on various real-world datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### Diffusion Priors
Diffusion models, known for their exceptional generative capabilities, have recently emerged as powerful priors for image restoration tasks.  **Leveraging diffusion priors involves integrating the degraded image into the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model**, effectively guiding the model towards a clean reconstruction.  This approach offers several advantages over traditional methods: it avoids the need for large paired datasets and can handle complex, real-world noise patterns more effectively. However, challenges remain.  Many existing methods based on diffusion priors oversimplify the noise model (e.g., assuming simple Gaussian noise), limiting their applicability to complex real-world scenarios. Others rely on approximate posterior inference, potentially sacrificing accuracy for computational efficiency.  **Future research should focus on improving the accuracy of likelihood modeling**, handling structured and signal-dependent noise, and developing more efficient inference techniques.  **The integration of variational Bayes offers a promising avenue for addressing the limitations of approximate inference**, allowing for adaptive likelihood estimation and more accurate posterior inference during the reverse diffusion process. This, combined with clever techniques such as employing local diffusion priors from low-resolution models, represents a significant advancement in real-world image denoising.

#### Variational Bayes
Variational Bayes (VB) is a crucial technique in Bayesian inference, particularly useful when dealing with intractable posterior distributions.  **Its core idea is to approximate a complex, true posterior distribution with a simpler, tractable variational distribution.** This approximation is optimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true and variational posteriors.  In the context of the research paper, VB likely plays a vital role in **estimating the precision (inverse variance) of the noise model.** This is particularly challenging in real-world image denoising due to the complex, non-independent nature of noise.  By using VB, the algorithm can effectively approximate the posterior distribution of the precision parameter without resorting to computationally expensive methods. **The dynamic inference of this precision throughout the reverse diffusion process allows the algorithm to adapt to the spatial variability of real-world noise, increasing its robustness.**  The choice of a tractable variational distribution (e.g., Gamma distribution for precision) is also critical for the computational efficiency and scalability of VB within the overall framework.

#### MAP Inference
Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference is a crucial Bayesian method for estimating the most probable value of a parameter given observed data.  In the context of image denoising, MAP inference aims to find the **clean image** that maximizes the posterior probability, considering both the **likelihood** of observing the noisy image given the clean image and the **prior probability** of the clean image itself.  This prior encodes assumptions about the nature of clean images, often leveraging learned representations from deep generative models. The effectiveness of MAP inference hinges on **accurately modeling the noise**, which can be complex and signal-dependent in real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, efficient inference algorithms are essential, especially when dealing with high-dimensional image data. The challenges often involve balancing the fidelity to the noisy observation with the regularization provided by the prior. **Variational methods** can provide tractable approximations to complex posterior distributions, enabling more efficient MAP estimation in these challenging situations.

#### Real-world Noise
Real-world noise in image data presents a significant challenge for computer vision tasks.  Unlike idealized Gaussian noise, real-world noise is **complex**, exhibiting characteristics such as **signal dependency** and **spatial correlation**.  This means the noise level and patterns often change depending on the underlying image content, and noise in adjacent pixels is not independent. Standard denoising techniques often struggle with such intricate noise structures.  **Methods relying on assumptions of simple noise models may yield suboptimal results**, failing to accurately capture the nuances of real-world image degradation. Effective denoising in real-world settings necessitates **advanced modeling techniques that can adapt to the unique characteristics** of each image and its associated noise. This might include incorporating statistical priors or using complex deep learning models that are capable of learning non-linear relationships between the image and the noise itself.  Successfully addressing real-world noise is **critical for improving the accuracy and robustness of various computer vision applications**.

#### Local Diffusion
The concept of 'Local Diffusion' in the context of image restoration using diffusion models is a significant advancement.  It leverages the observation that **low-resolution (LR) diffusion models, when used to generate high-resolution (HR) images, exhibit a localized behavior**. This means that the generated texture and details primarily focus on smaller regions rather than globally impacting the entire image. This localized effect serves as a powerful advantage in denoising HR images because it avoids the computational burden and potential information loss associated with patch-based or resizing techniques that are frequently employed with HR images and pre-trained LR models.  **This locality inherent in LR models can be seen as a form of implicit spatial regularization**, simplifying the denoising process significantly and making it more efficient.  By directly applying this LR diffusion prior to HR noisy images, the method bypasses the need for complex pre-processing steps and directly handles the high-resolution data.  This approach is both efficient and preserves image details effectively, thus highlighting the potential of exploiting localized properties within diffusion models for improved image restoration.
