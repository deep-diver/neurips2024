Meanwhile, we contribute a new dataset for the training and evaluation of MECD by collecting long-form videos involving multiple events and manually annotating real causal relations between events for them.

The main idea is that temporal causality can be effectively estimated by predictive ability. Specifically, applied to videos, if Event A occurs prior to Event B, we consider A to be a cause of B only if A could facilitate the prediction of B. We term this criterion the Event Causality Test. However, compared to simple low-dimensional data, the inputs of MECD involve much more complex modalities, including both visual and textual content, which may introduce bias in the estimation of causality using such a predictive paradigm.

However, the bridge event can only occur if \"taking the test\" happens first.

As for illusory existence causality, it occurs when some objects in early events may serve as necessary existence conditions of a later event. For instance (Fig. 1(e)), consider determining the causal relation between \"a large brown dog enters the room\" (at the start of the video) and \"the dog runs towards the camera.\" (at the end of the video).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
