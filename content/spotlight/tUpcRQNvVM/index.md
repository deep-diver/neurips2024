### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Submodular functions, useful for various applications, often lack practical learning methods.  Separately, learning from graded pairwise preferences is underexplored. This paper tackles both, introducing Deep Submodular Peripteral Networks (DSPNs). DSPNs address the challenge of learning submodular functions effectively from limited oracle-based information.



DSPNs use a novel GPC-style loss function to learn from numerically graded pairwise preferences.  This contrasts with existing binary-outcome contrastive learning, offering more nuanced information. The paper demonstrates DSPNs' efficacy and superior performance compared to Deep Sets, SetTransformers and other techniques in experimental design and online streaming applications.  Their results show that the graded comparisons and the novel architecture combine to improve the performance substantially.

> This figure illustrates the architecture of a Deep Submodular Peripteral Network (DSPN) and its training process.  Two DSPNs, one for set E and one for set M, share the same parameters (w).  Each DSPN consists of five peripteral pillars (input layer), a submodular-preserving permutation-invariant aggregator, and a roof (output layer). The E and M sets are input to their respective DSPNs.  The output from each DSPN, fw(E) and fw(M), is used with the oracle/target function Œî(E|M) to calculate the peripteral loss. Gradient-based optimization adjusts the shared parameters (w) to minimize this loss. Submodular optimization feedback mechanisms are used for the sampling of E-M pairs, to guide the training process and ensure that information from the oracle/target is effectively transferred to the learner.

### In-depth insights


#### Submodular Function Learning
Submodular function learning is a significant challenge in machine learning due to the complex nature of submodular functions and the computational difficulty in optimizing them.  Many real-world applications benefit from submodularity, but acquiring a suitable submodular function for a given task remains a hurdle. This area is crucial because directly optimizing submodular functions is often computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.  **Existing methods often rely on assumptions about the function's structure**, limiting their applicability and scalability. Consequently, research focuses on efficient learning strategies that leverage data to directly estimate or approximate a submodular function or indirectly learn a function that satisfies submodularity properties. Recent advancements include using deep learning architectures combined with loss functions tailored to submodular properties, exploring graded pairwise comparisons and learning scalings from oracles, and investigating the use of active learning to reduce the cost of obtaining data. **Developing scalable and generalizable learning methods for submodular functions is an active area of research** as it has the potential to unlock new possibilities across various domains, including machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

#### Deep Submodular Nets
Deep Submodular Nets represent a significant advancement in the field of machine learning, addressing the challenge of learning submodular functions efficiently and effectively.  **The core innovation lies in combining deep learning architectures with the properties of submodularity.** This approach offers several key advantages. First, it leverages the power of deep learning to learn complex representations from data, effectively capturing intricate relationships between elements. Second, the submodularity constraint ensures that the learned function exhibits the desirable property of diminishing returns, leading to theoretically sound and practically efficient optimization algorithms. Third, the combination of deep learning and submodularity allows for the creation of highly scalable and expressive submodular functions applicable to large-scale real-world problems.  **Deep Submodular Nets show promise across various machine learning tasks where submodularity is beneficial, including summarization, active learning, and experimental design.**  The ability to learn such functions from data, rather than relying on handcrafted ones, is a major step forward.  However, **further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities of Deep Submodular Nets and their limitations.**  Areas for future investigation include improving the efficiency of training, exploring different architectural designs, and addressing the potential computational cost for very large datasets.

#### GPC-Style Loss
The proposed GPC-style loss function is a novel approach to training deep submodular peripteral networks (DSPNs).  It leverages numerically graded pairwise comparisons, moving beyond binary preferences to incorporate the degree of preference between sets. This offers a significant advantage over traditional contrastive learning methods, as it captures more nuanced information. **The key innovation lies in using a ratio of the learner's score to the oracle's score, resulting in a positive quantity for aligned preferences and a negative value otherwise.** This ratio is then incorporated into a loss function that emphasizes large differences between learner and oracle preferences. This loss function is carefully designed to be numerically stable and handles cases of indifference efficiently, which is a notable improvement over methods solely relying on binary comparisons.  The use of GPC-style feedback is **crucial for efficient knowledge transfer** from expensive oracles to the parametric learner, enabling the training of a powerful and scalable submodular function model.  Finally, the methodology has broader applications beyond submodular function learning, such as in preference learning and RLHF.

#### Active Set Sampling
Active Set Sampling strategies in machine learning aim to intelligently select subsets of data for model training or other tasks, unlike passive methods that sample randomly or systematically.  **The core idea is to leverage feedback from the model or a target function to guide the selection process**, focusing on subsets deemed most informative or beneficial.  This often involves an iterative procedure where sets are evaluated, feedback is obtained (e.g., model performance, function value, human preferences), and then subsequent sets are chosen to maximize information gain or reduce uncertainty.  **Submodularity is often used to guide the selection process, thanks to its diminishing returns property, which makes it well-suited for efficiently optimizing subset selection.**  Different feedback mechanisms can be employed, including model predictions, function evaluations, or human annotations, depending on the problem and available resources.  Active Set Sampling can be particularly useful in situations with high data costs or limitations, enabling efficient utilization of limited resources. The strategies **must consider the balance between exploration (exploring diverse regions of the data space) and exploitation (focusing on promising areas identified via previous evaluations).** Active sampling strategies enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning workflows in various applications.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section presents exciting avenues for extending deep submodular peripteral networks (DSPNs).  **Scaling DSPNs to massive datasets** is crucial, potentially leveraging techniques like coresets to manage computational cost and improve efficiency. Exploring the use of **more sophisticated sampling strategies**, beyond the heuristics and active learning techniques presented, could enhance performance and model generalization.  A significant opportunity lies in applying DSPNs to diverse domains, such as **online streaming applications, where real-time summarization or active learning is critical**. Investigating **alternative oracle queries and loss functions** would broaden the applicability of the DSPNs framework, going beyond the graded pairwise comparisons to potentially more efficient or more informative alternatives.  Further theoretical research, addressing the **representational capacity of DSPNs**, and investigating the conditions under which DSPNs can express all monotone non-decreasing submodular functions, is crucial to establish the fundamental limits and capabilities of this novel architecture.  Finally, integrating DSPNs with **other machine learning techniques** for tasks like multi-modal learning or reinforcement learning could reveal new synergies and open up new avenues of research.
