In the RCN model, $\\eta(\\mathbf{x})$ in Definition 1 is restricted to be $\\eta$ pointwise, i.e., the noise level is uniform; polynomial-time PAC learning has long since known to be tractable under RCN [Byl94, BFKV98]. On the other hand, in the agnostic model (where learning is computationally intractable under well-studied conjectures [GR06, FGKP06, Dan16]), an adversary is allowed to arbitrarily modify an $\\eta$ fraction of labels. As observed by [Slo88], the Massart noise model of Definition 1 is equivalent to allowing an oblivious adversary control an $\\eta$ fraction of labels, where the $\\eta$ fraction is crucially sampled independently at random.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
