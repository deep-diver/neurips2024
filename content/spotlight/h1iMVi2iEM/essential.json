A major issue is \"dual drift,\" where inactive clients' outdated dual variables cause instability and hinder training efficiency when reactivated. This is especially pronounced under partial client participation, a common strategy in FL to manage bandwidth limitations.\n\nTo overcome this, the authors propose A-FedPD. This method cleverly constructs virtual dual updates for inactive clients, effectively aligning their dual variables with the global consensus. This maintains up-to-date dual information even for long-dormant clients.  The comprehensive analysis demonstrates A-FedPD's superior convergence rate and generalization performance in smooth non-convex objectives, validated by experiments on various FL setups.  **A-FedPD significantly improves the efficiency and stability of federated primal-dual learning**", "affiliation": "University of Sydney", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "h1iMVi2iEM/podcast.wav"}
