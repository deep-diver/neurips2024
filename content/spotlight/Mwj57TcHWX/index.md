### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Model-based reinforcement learning often suffers from 'objective mismatch', where models optimized for training accuracy may not perform well during actual control.  Existing policy representations like feedforward networks, energy-based models, and diffusion models also have limitations in high-dimensional settings.  This paper addresses these shortcomings.



The researchers introduce DiffTORI, which uses differentiable trajectory optimization to generate actions. This allows for direct optimization of the task performance through the trajectory optimization process, eliminating objective mismatch.  Experiments across model-based RL and imitation learning benchmarks show DiffTORI outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, especially in high-dimensional scenarios, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

> This figure compares the model-based reinforcement learning approaches of TD-MPC and DiffTORI.  TD-MPC uses a non-differentiable Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) to generate actions.  DiffTORI, in contrast, uses differentiable trajectory optimization.  The key difference is that DiffTORI computes the policy gradient loss on the generated actions and backpropagates this loss to optimize not only the encoder but also the latent reward predictor and latent dynamics function.  This end-to-end optimization aims to maximize task performance.

### In-depth insights


#### DiffTORI Overview
DiffTORI presents a novel approach to deep reinforcement and imitation learning by leveraging differentiable trajectory optimization.  **Instead of using traditional neural network policies, DiffTORI employs trajectory optimization as its policy representation**, where the policy's parameters directly define the cost and dynamics functions within the optimization process. This allows for end-to-end learning, enabling the model to directly learn cost and dynamics functions that maximize task performance.  **The differentiability of the optimization process is crucial**, allowing for the computation of gradients of the loss function with respect to the policy parameters, thus enabling efficient backpropagation and optimization.  **This addresses the 'objective mismatch' problem**, frequently observed in model-based RL, where training performance does not directly translate to task performance.  By optimizing the cost and dynamics functions to directly improve task performance, DiffTORI shows promise in high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both reinforcement learning and imitation learning settings.

#### Model-Based RL
Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) approaches **learn a model of the environment's dynamics** to make predictions about future states given current actions. This learned model is then used to **plan optimal actions** via methods like tree search, or trajectory optimization.  A key advantage is **improved sample efficiency** compared to model-free RL, since the model allows for simulated experience, reducing the need for costly real-world interactions.  However, **model accuracy is crucial**, and inaccuracies in the learned model can lead to suboptimal or even unsafe behavior.  **Objective mismatch**, where the model optimizes a different objective than the true reward, is a common problem.  Model-based RL also introduces **additional complexity** in designing, training and debugging the model itself.  Addressing these challenges, including methods to improve model accuracy and address objective mismatch, are active areas of research and crucial for achieving robust and efficient RL systems.

#### Imitation Learning
The provided text focuses on DiffTORI's application in imitation learning, highlighting its capacity to learn cost functions directly through differentiable trajectory optimization.  **This approach contrasts sharply with prior methods which often use explicit or implicit policies, sometimes suffering from training instabilities.** DiffTORI's test-time optimization, using the learned cost function, proves effective. The paper showcases DiffTORI's superior performance on various robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those with high-dimensional sensory inputs. **The use of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) is particularly notable, enabling DiffTORI to handle multimodal action distributions effectively.**  This is a significant improvement, especially considering the challenges posed by training instability frequently seen in alternative approaches. The results demonstrate the efficacy of combining differentiable trajectory optimization and deep model-based RL techniques for enhanced imitation learning capabilities.  Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising technique that addresses key challenges in imitation learning and achieves state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks.

#### High-Dim. Sensory Input
The ability to effectively process high-dimensional sensory input, such as images and point clouds, is a crucial challenge in robotics and AI.  This paper's focus on "High-Dim. Sensory Input" is significant because it directly addresses this challenge, demonstrating the scalability of differentiable trajectory optimization (DTO) methods.  **The success in handling high-dimensional data is a key contribution**, showing that DTO is not limited to low-dimensional state spaces. By using encoders to effectively project high-dimensional observations into lower dimensional latent spaces, the method avoids the curse of dimensionality.  This approach allows the model to learn complex relationships within the high-dimensional data while maintaining computational tractability.  **The results on multiple robotic manipulation benchmarks showcase this capability**, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art model-based RL and imitation learning algorithms. The robustness of DTO when applied to such diverse data types suggests **significant potential for real-world applications** where high-fidelity sensors are prevalent.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on DiffTORI could explore several promising avenues. **Extending DiffTORI to handle more complex robotic tasks** involving intricate manipulation, multi-agent interactions, or long-horizon planning would significantly broaden its applicability and demonstrate its robustness in real-world scenarios.  **Improving the computational efficiency** of the differentiable trajectory optimization process is crucial for real-time applications.  Investigating alternative optimization algorithms or hardware acceleration techniques could significantly speed up the process.  **Investigating the theoretical properties** of DiffTORI, such as convergence guarantees and sample complexity under different assumptions, would strengthen the understanding of its capabilities and limitations.  A deeper dive into the **relationship between the learned cost function and the task reward** is also warranted. This could involve exploring methods for automatically shaping rewards or learning cost functions directly from human demonstrations.  Finally, **applying DiffTORI to other domains** beyond robotics and control, such as autonomous driving, video game playing, or even protein folding, could uncover its wider potential and highlight its versatility as a general-purpose policy representation.

Implicit policies, like EBMs, learn an energy function; actions are obtained by minimizing this function at test time.
