### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating inaccurate information, and effectively measuring uncertainty in long-form text remains a challenge.  Current methods often lack granularity, hindering precise assessment of individual claims' reliability.  This limits the ability to build trust in LLM outputs and safely deploy them in real-world applications.

This paper introduces Graph Uncertainty, a novel framework that models the relationship between LLM generations and claims as a bipartite graph.  By employing graph centrality metrics (like closeness centrality), it provides more nuanced uncertainty estimations at the claim level.  Further, an uncertainty-aware decoding technique uses these estimates to filter out unreliable claims, resulting in more factual and informative responses. Experiments show significant performance gains in factuality and overall accuracy, exceeding existing techniques.

> This figure illustrates the Graph Uncertainty framework for claim-level uncertainty estimation.  It begins with sampling multiple responses from a large language model (LLM) given a prompt (a). Each response is then decomposed into individual claims (b).  A bipartite graph is constructed, linking claims to the responses that support them (c). Finally, graph centrality metrics (degree, eigenvalue, PageRank, closeness, etc.) are used to estimate the uncertainty of each claim (d). Claims with high uncertainty are marked with an 'X', while those with low uncertainty are marked with a checkmark.  This framework provides a more granular way to assess uncertainty compared to methods that only focus on overall response uncertainty.

### In-depth insights


#### Graph Uncertainty
The concept of 'Graph Uncertainty' presents a novel approach to quantifying uncertainty in large language model (LLM) outputs, particularly within long-form text generation.  Instead of relying solely on traditional methods like self-consistency which utilize degree centrality, **this framework leverages the power of graph theory** to represent the relationships between LLM generations and the claims made within them as a bipartite graph.  This allows for a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty, moving beyond a simple aggregate score. By employing graph centrality metrics such as closeness centrality, **a more sophisticated measure of claim importance is obtained**, providing consistent improvements in claim-level uncertainty estimation. This granular approach enables a better understanding of which claims are reliable versus unreliable within the LLM-generated text.  Furthermore, **the integration of graph-based uncertainty metrics into uncertainty-aware decoding techniques provides a significant boost to the factuality of generated text**, while simultaneously preserving informativeness. This novel approach marks a significant advancement in dealing with the inherent challenges of factual accuracy and uncertainty in LLM outputs.

#### Centrality Metrics
Centrality metrics, in the context of graph-based uncertainty analysis for large language models (LLMs), offer a powerful lens for understanding the reliability of individual claims within LLM-generated text.  By representing the relationships between LLM generations and claims as a bipartite graph, **centrality metrics quantify the 'importance' of each claim node**, essentially measuring its influence or connectivity within the network.  Different centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, PageRank) offer unique perspectives on this importance, revealing different facets of claim reliability.  **The choice of centrality metric significantly impacts the accuracy of uncertainty estimation.**  While simpler metrics like degree centrality mirror existing self-consistency methods, more sophisticated metrics like closeness centrality can provide more granular, informative uncertainty estimations, revealing consistent improvements in metrics such as AUPRC. This framework provides a significant advance over previous methods by moving beyond simple counts and leveraging the rich structure and relationships inherent in the claim-response graph for a more nuanced and precise uncertainty assessment.

#### Decoding Methods
Decoding methods in large language models (LLMs) are crucial for generating coherent and high-quality text.  The choice of decoding method significantly impacts the final output's fluency, accuracy, and overall quality.  **Greedy decoding**, a simple approach, selects the word with the highest probability at each step, often leading to repetitive or unnatural text.  **Beam search** improves upon greedy decoding by considering multiple candidate sequences simultaneously, broadening the search space for better results but increasing computational cost.  **Sampling-based methods**, such as top-k or nucleus sampling, introduce randomness by selecting from a subset of the most probable words, fostering creativity but potentially sacrificing coherence.  **Uncertainty-aware decoding** represents a sophisticated approach that incorporates uncertainty estimates into the decoding process, allowing the model to preferentially select more reliable words or claims, thereby enhancing the overall factuality and reducing hallucinations.  This approach, however, requires accurate uncertainty estimation methods. The effectiveness of each decoding strategy depends on the specific application and desired trade-off between fluency, creativity, and accuracy.  **Advanced methods** may integrate reinforcement learning or external knowledge sources to further refine the generation process.

#### Factuality Gains
Analyzing factuality gains in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for assessing their reliability and trustworthiness.  **Significant factuality gains** often result from enhanced uncertainty estimation methods, allowing the model to distinguish between reliable and unreliable claims within its generated text.  This improved discrimination empowers uncertainty-aware decoding techniques, which selectively retain high-confidence claims, thus bolstering the factual accuracy of the overall output.  **Graph-based approaches**, which represent the relationship between generated claims and supporting evidence as a graph, show particular promise in achieving substantial factuality gains. These methods leverage graph centrality measures to identify the most reliable claims, offering a more nuanced approach compared to simpler self-consistency techniques.  **Specific centrality metrics**, such as closeness centrality, appear particularly effective, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods across various evaluation datasets.  The achieved factuality gains, expressed as percentages, reflect the extent to which these advanced techniques mitigate the problem of hallucinations in LLMs, ultimately advancing the goal of producing more reliable and informative responses.

#### Future Work
The research paper's 'Future Work' section could explore several promising avenues.  **Improving the efficiency of the graph construction process** is crucial, as it currently increases inference time and computational overhead.  This could involve exploring more efficient graph algorithms or alternative methods for representing the relationship between claims and responses.  Further research could also investigate how to **handle scenarios with dependent claims more effectively**, as the current claim decomposition method assumes claims are independent.  The system's robustness under different LLMs and prompts should also be assessed more comprehensively.  Additionally, exploring different graph centrality metrics beyond those already tested would be valuable, particularly those designed to be more robust to noisy data.  Finally, **extending the framework to incorporate uncertainty estimation from different sources** and investigating the integration of this framework with other factuality-enhancing techniques, such as retrieval-augmented generation, will significantly enhance the system's capabilities. Addressing these points would strengthen the paper's impact and establish the method's viability in real-world applications.

> This figure illustrates the uncertainty-aware decoding framework.  It takes as input a set of claims with associated uncertainty scores (obtained from the graph uncertainty method shown in Figure 1). Claims with uncertainty scores below a threshold are selected.  An LLM then synthesizes these selected claims into a coherent paragraph. The threshold parameter controls the trade-off between factuality (fewer false claims) and informativeness (more claims included in the final output).

> The figure shows the precision of claims (y-axis) plotted against the number of true claims (x-axis) for different methods including greedy decoding, CoVe, and several variants of Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD).  Different UAD variants use different uncertainty estimation methods to filter claims before generating the response.  The graph illustrates the trade-off between factuality (precision of claims) and informativeness (number of true claims).  UAD methods, particularly those employing the closeness centrality metric, show a better trade-off compared to non-UAD baselines. The shaded regions represent confidence intervals.
