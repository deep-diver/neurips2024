### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms often struggle with real-world constraints, such as requiring specific starting materials.  Existing methods assume the availability of arbitrary building blocks, limiting their practicality. This necessitates more sophisticated algorithms that can effectively navigate the search space while adhering to these constraints.  This research addresses these limitations.



The proposed solution, Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP), leverages a bidirectional graph search that interleaves expansions from both the target molecule and the goal starting materials.  This ensures constraint satisfaction and improved efficiency. DESP incorporates a goal-conditioned cost network to guide the search, further enhancing its performance.  Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate DESP's superiority over existing approaches, especially in constrained scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field of CASP.

(a) shows a typical single-ended search where the algorithm explores from the target molecule to arbitrary building blocks until the termination criteria is met. (b) shows the double-ended search used by the DESP algorithm where the search is conducted bidirectionally from both the target molecule and the specified starting material, interleaving expansions to ensure constraint satisfiability, resulting in fewer node expansions.

### In-depth insights


#### Bidirectional CASP
Bidirectional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) represents a significant advancement in retrosynthetic analysis.  **Traditional CASP approaches often employ a unidirectional search**, starting from the target molecule and working backward.  A bidirectional approach, however, **simultaneously explores pathways from both the target and potential starting materials**. This strategy offers several key advantages. First, it can drastically reduce the search space, leading to **faster computation times and higher success rates**. Second, a bidirectional approach can be particularly beneficial when specific starting materials are preferred, a scenario common in industrial synthesis.  By incorporating constraints and incorporating both forward and reverse reactions, **bidirectional CASP algorithms are better equipped to navigate the complexity of real-world synthesis**.  This improvement in efficiency and feasibility makes bidirectional CASP a promising methodology for accelerating drug discovery, materials science and other chemical synthesis applications.  **The core challenge in implementing bidirectional CASP lies in efficiently integrating forward and backward synthesis models** in a way that leverages the strengths of each approach, while effectively managing computational costs and memory constraints.

#### Goal-Conditioned Cost
The concept of a 'Goal-Conditioned Cost' network within the context of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is a significant advancement.  It addresses limitations of traditional CASP methods by **incorporating expert knowledge** and **biasing the search process towards desirable starting materials**.  Instead of solely relying on generic cost functions evaluating molecule synthesizability from readily available building blocks, this approach introduces a cost function specifically trained to estimate the cost (or distance) between molecules conditioned on a specific goal. This **goal-conditioning allows the algorithm to prioritize pathways that leverage expert-specified starting points**, improving efficiency and the likelihood of discovering preferred synthetic routes.  **The network's learning process likely involves supervised learning**, using expert-designed synthetic pathways as training data. This approach presents a powerful way to integrate domain expertise into algorithmic synthesis planning, opening the door to more efficient and effective solutions for complex molecular synthesis problems. The offline training nature offers scalability, making it applicable to large chemical reaction databases and various goal molecules, while maintaining the speed and efficiency of the search.

#### DESP Algorithm
The Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP) algorithm is a novel approach to computer-aided synthesis planning that addresses the limitations of traditional methods by incorporating starting material constraints.  **DESP employs a bidirectional search strategy**, interleaving expansions from both the target molecule and the specified starting material(s). This bidirectional approach ensures constraint satisfiability and improves efficiency by guiding the search toward feasible solutions.  **A crucial component of DESP is the goal-conditioned cost network**, which learns to estimate the synthetic distance between molecules, biasing the search toward expert goals.  The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated by its improved solve rates and reduced search expansions compared to single-ended methods on multiple benchmark datasets.  **DESP's flexibility is showcased by its compatibility with existing one-step retrosynthesis models**, leveraging their advances to enhance its performance. The algorithm's two variations, F2E and F2F, explore different strategies for interleaving search directions, each exhibiting strengths and weaknesses in terms of solution length and computational efficiency.

#### Benchmark Datasets
The selection and characteristics of benchmark datasets are crucial for evaluating the performance of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms.  **The USPTO-190 dataset**, while widely used, suffers from redundancies and out-of-distribution reactions, limiting its effectiveness for rigorous evaluation.  The authors address this limitation by introducing **two new datasets, Pistachio Reachable and Pistachio Hard**, derived from the Pistachio database. These datasets offer advantages by including reactions that are more representative of real-world synthesis scenarios and exhibiting a larger proportion of unique reactions compared to USPTO-190.  This improved dataset composition allows for a more robust and reliable assessment of CASP algorithm performance, particularly in the context of starting material constraints, which is the primary focus of the proposed DESP algorithm.  The authors' thoughtful creation of these datasets serves as a significant contribution, setting a new standard for CASP benchmarking and enabling fairer comparisons of future algorithms.

#### Future Directions
Future research could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the accuracy and efficiency of the one-step retrosynthesis models** is crucial, as DESP's performance directly depends on them.  Investigating alternative bidirectional search algorithms or incorporating reinforcement learning could enhance DESP's ability to find optimal synthesis routes.  **Extending DESP to handle more complex reaction types** (e.g., organometallic reactions, photochemical reactions) would expand its applicability.  **A deeper exploration of F2E vs. F2F search strategies**, and their applicability to various problem instances, would provide valuable insights into algorithm design. Finally, **applying DESP to specific domains** such as sustainable chemistry or the synthesis of complex natural products, could showcase the algorithm's versatility and impact.
