This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et al., 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound.

To analyze the long-term behavior of these Markovian models, estimating the rate of convergence to equilibrium is critical. When designing reliable real-world systems (e.g. cloud platforms and manufacturing lines), the faster the convergence, the faster the recovery after disturbances. When designing efficient sample-based algorithms (e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants and MCMC), the faster the convergence, the faster the goal attainment. The rate of convergence also appears in MDP-related sample complexity results under the name \"mixing time\". Although convergence rate estimation is critically important, estimating the convergence rate of even a mildly complex chain can be extremely difficult. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Over the last three decades, significant efforts have been made to bound the convergence of general state-space Markov chains. Most of these works utilize a pair of drift and minorization conditions (D&M) to bound the convergence in terms of the total variation (TV) distance (Meyn et al., 1994; Rosenthal, 1995; Jarner and Roberts, 2002; Douc et al., 2004; Baxendale, 2005; Andrieu et al., 2015). The drift condition forces the chain to move towards a selected region. On such a region, the minorization condition allows the chain to regenerate or to couple with a stationary version of the chain. This analysis tends to produce overly conservative TV bounds, especially in high-dimensional settings; see (Qin and Hobert, 2021) for a discussion. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Wasserstein distance, as a measure of convergence to equilibrium, can exhibit better dimension dependence (Qin and Hobert, 2022b). In addition, many Markov chains of interest (e.g. constant step-size SGD minimizing convex loss on finite datasets) converge in Wasserstein distance but not in TV distance. Consequently, bounding convergence in Wasserstein distance has steadily gained popularity over the years (Gibbs, 2004; Hairer et al., 2011; Butkovsky, 2014; Durmus and Moulines, 2015; Durmus et al., 2016; Qin and Hobert, 2022a). Most of these works replace the minorization condition with a contraction condition (D&M becomes D&C). After returning to a selected region, two copies of the chain tend to become closer to each other. Both D&M and D&C enforce two conditions in two respective regions. However, partitioning the state space into two distinct regions often leads to suboptimal rates.

A special case of CD dates back to (Steinsaltz, 1999). By verifying CD, (Qu et al., 2023) establish parametrically sharp convergence bounds for stylized Markov chains arising from queueing theory and stochastic optimization (e.g. revealing how step-size, heavy-tailed gradient noise, growth rate and local curvature of objectives affect the convergence of stylized SGD). Although CD may generate better bounds than D&M and D&C for stylized chains (e.g. SGD with iid gradient noise), these methods are generally intended as theoretical tools that can provide closed-form convergence bounds for structured models. For more realistic, less structured chains, computational rather than analytical methods are needed. However, despite of the rapid development of computational power in the past decade, the convergence analysis of general state-space Markov chains is still in the pen-and-paper age.

This paper introduces the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC) is the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of general state-space Markov chains. There are two key ideas we develop. The first is to observe that CD, an inequality by definition, is actually an equality by nature (if the inequality has a solution, then the corresponding equality also has a solution). Thus, we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), an integral equation the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. For the second part, inspired by the success of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving PDEs (Sirignano and Spiliopoulos, 2018; Raissi et al., 2019), we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. By combining these two components, DCDC solves CDEs by training neural networks and converts solutions into explicit convergence bounds. DCDC demonstrates the potential of computer-assisted convergence analysis and bridges the gap between deep learning and a traditionally challenging area of mathematical analysis. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In high-dimensional spaces, PINNs minimize the integrated residual of a PDE via SGD to find a continuously differentiable function that approximately satisfies the PDE. When applying this idea to solve a CDE, an integral equation, the solving procedure becomes more natural in the following two ways. First, we only assume that the CDE solution is Lipschitz continuous, and neural networks are inherently Lipschitz continuous. Second, as SGD is already used to handle the integrated residual, we can simultaneously use it to handle the integral in the CDE. After approximately solving the CDE, DCDC needs to convert the solution into a convergence bound, which requires that the solution is uniformly accurate with high probability. This is different from PINNs in the PDE literature since the accuracy is mainly measured in the $L_{2}$ sense.

For deterministic dynamical systems, traditional Lyapunov functions play central roles in establishing stability; see (Pukdeboon, 2011) for a review. There is a substantial literature on computing traditional Lyapunov functions via neural networks; see (Liu et al., 2023) and references therein. As pointed out in (Dawson et al., 2023), a survey on certificate learning, learned (traditional) Lyapunov functions provide safety certificates for learned control policies (on deterministic dynamical systems). For the control of random dynamical systems, DCDC not only generates safety certificates (CDE solutions) but also quantifies safety levels (convergence rates). Control and performance evaluation of random dynamical systems have become a staple in contemporary data-driven decision making systems, thus underscoring the importance of DCDC.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
