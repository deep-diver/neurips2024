Current methods addressing this often involve complex approximations or introduce high memory overhead.  This paper tackles this problem by proposing a new perspective: viewing neural networks not as single, monolithic entities but as an ensemble of individual classifiers. This simple reformulation leads to a new understanding of network dynamics. \nThe paper introduces the Neural Tangent Ensemble (NTE), a novel approach that interprets a neural network as an ensemble of classifiers. Using Bayesian methods, the NTE derives a posterior update rule for these classifiers, showing it to be remarkably similar to stochastic gradient descent. This result provides a powerful new interpretation of network optimization, offering a foundational understanding of why standard optimization techniques lead to forgetting. The method does not require replay, task boundaries, or extra memory. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces forgetting, particularly in the lazy learning regime where classifiers are fixed.", "affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "qOSFiJdVkZ/podcast.wav"}
