Spike cameras, which capture high-temporal resolution data, offer a promising solution but existing spike-based methods also rely on supervised learning paradigms. This leads to significant performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios due to data distribution discrepancies.\nThe paper introduces SpikeReveal (S-SDM), a novel self-supervised framework that leverages the theoretical relationship between blurry images, spike streams and their corresponding sharp images. It consists of a spike-guided deblurring model, a cascaded framework to handle spike noise and resolution mismatches, and a lightweight deblurring network trained using knowledge distillation. Experiments on both synthetic and a new real-world dataset (RSB) show the superior generalization and performance of the proposed self-supervised framework compared to existing supervised methods.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "9FYat8HPpv/podcast.wav"}
