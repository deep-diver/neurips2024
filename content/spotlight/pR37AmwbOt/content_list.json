Secondly, if the safety model\u2019s understanding of harmful data is significantly different from the actual harmful data distribution, malicious fine-tuning will become a new task for the safety model and it will be difficult to generate harmful images even after malicious fine-tuning. In safety-aligned fine-tuning, we strive to keep the distribution of clean data unchanged to maintain the quality of clean image generation. Since there is some overlap between the distributions of clean data and harmful data, we can use the distribution of clean data as a benchmark to increase the distance between clean data and harmful data understood by the safety model to replace the distance between harmful data and the harmful data understood by the safety model, which makes malicious fine-tuning a difficult task for the safety model. The key to inducing catastrophic forgetting lies in increasing the distance between the clean data distribution and the harmful data distribution.

POSI [49] fine-tunes LLaMA [46] to be an optimizer that can revise prompts automatically to avoid inappropriate image generation. However, these types of black-box methods do not fundamentally make the model non-toxic and heavily rely on external components, making the pipeline very bloated. SLD [42] is proposed to reduce the inappropriate degeneration of DMs using safe guidance. Unfortunately, malicious humans will not use safe guidance when DMs are open-source. Hence, some white-box methods have been proposed [42, 8], which primarily unlearn harmful content by fine-tuning pre-trained DMs [9, 8, 23].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
