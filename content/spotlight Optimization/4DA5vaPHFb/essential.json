Existing NOT methods often suffer from instability in finding a precise approximation of the conjugate operator (c-transform) requiring extensive fine-tuning. This process is computationally intensive and may not converge to an optimal solution.\nThe paper proposes ENOT, a novel method employing expectile regularization to address these issues. **Expectile regularization provides a stable upper bound estimation for the distribution of possible conjugate potentials, eliminating the need for extra fine-tuning.**  ENOT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, offering substantial improvements in terms of quality and training time.  The method's efficiency and effectiveness are further demonstrated through its application to image generation tasks.", "affiliation": "AIRI", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "4DA5vaPHFb/podcast.wav"}
