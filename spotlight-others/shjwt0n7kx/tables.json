For MCMC methods, we compare different state definitions of A, B: 'CV' uses \u03c6, \u03c8 angles. 'Exact' uses a very small threshold of aligned root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) around reference states A, B (as in Ours). 'Relaxed' uses a larger threshold of RMSD around A, B. The method marked with a * only samples 100 paths due to computational limitations, while others sample 1,000. Fields with N/A are intractable as a single trajectory requires more than 1 billion potential evaluations.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the proposed method against MCMC-based two-way shooting on the alanine dipeptide system.  Different state definitions (using dihedral angles or a relaxed RMSD threshold) and numbers of sampled trajectories are considered.  The table highlights the number of potential energy evaluations required by each method, as well as the maximum and minimum energies observed across all sampled paths.  The results demonstrate the sample efficiency of the proposed method, requiring significantly fewer evaluations compared to MCMC, particularly when strict state definitions are used.
