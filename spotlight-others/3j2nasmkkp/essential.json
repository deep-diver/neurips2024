This limitation hinders performance in many graph-level tasks.  The methods also frequently rely on fixed graph coarsening routines, further restricting their flexibility and adaptability.\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces Cluster-wise Graph Transformer (Cluster-GT), which views graphs as networks of interconnected node sets, avoiding the need to compress each cluster. Cluster-GT employs a novel Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) mechanism which incorporates multiple kernel learning to capture information at both node and cluster levels efficiently.  **The resulting architecture achieves linear time complexity** and exhibits superior performance on various graph-level tasks, demonstrating the benefits of capturing dual-granularity information effectively.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3j2nasmKkP/podcast.wav"}
