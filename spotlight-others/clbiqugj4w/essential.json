Existing deep learning models often struggle with efficiency and accuracy in LTSF, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.  This is where CycleNet comes in.\nCycleNet tackles these issues by introducing the Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) technique. RCF explicitly models periodic patterns using learnable recurrent cycles and then predicts the residual components. Combined with a simple Linear or MLP backbone, CycleNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in various domains (electricity, weather, and energy), while being significantly more efficient than other advanced models. This demonstrates that directly modeling periodicity can be highly effective for LTSF tasks.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "clBiQUgj4w/podcast.wav"}
