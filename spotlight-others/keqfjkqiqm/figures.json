[{"figure_path": "kEQFjKqiqM/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Visualization of the Non-Markovian Graph Random Walk. The diagram illustrates the walker's decision-making process during the walk. After waiting for a random duration n\u2206\u03c4, the walker may either remain on the current node or proceed to a neighborhood node. This reflects the flexible, memory-influenced dynamics of the walker's movement.", "description": "This figure visualizes the non-Markovian graph random walk process.  It shows a walker moving across a graph over time. At each time step, the walker has a random waiting time before deciding to either stay at its current node or move to a neighboring node. The waiting times follow a power law distribution,  and the walker's decision incorporates past movements, showcasing the process's memory effect and non-Markovian nature.", "section": "3.2 Non-Markovian Graph Random Walk with Flexible Memory"}, {"figure_path": "kEQFjKqiqM/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Variation of test accuracy with fractional order \u03b1 in the FROND model", "description": "This figure shows how the test accuracy of the FROND model varies with different fractional orders (\u03b1) across three different datasets: Cora, Airport, and Amazon.  The x-axis represents the fractional order \u03b1, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. The y-axis represents the test accuracy. Each line represents a different dataset, showing how its accuracy changes as the fractional order \u03b1 is varied. This illustrates the sensitivity of the model's performance to the choice of \u03b1 and the need for careful tuning or a more flexible approach such as the DRAGON framework.", "section": "B Caputo Fractional Derivative"}]
