The intrinsic dimension is estimated separately for each digit class (0-9) within each dataset. The table shows that the estimated intrinsic dimension varies significantly across classes within the same dataset, suggesting a heterogeneous nature of the data manifolds.  The table also shows the effect of data resolution on the intrinsic dimension, with higher resolution images having higher estimated intrinsic dimensions. This information is crucial to the paper's analysis, helping to assess the heterogeneity of real-world data manifolds and the feasibility of making assumptions based on global geometric properties.", "section": "4.2 Empirical study of geometry of data manifolds"}, {"figure_path": "dkkgKzMni7/tables/tables_27_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Estimated intrinsic dimension for the hypersphere.", "description": "This table presents the results of estimating the intrinsic dimension of hyperspheres embedded in higher dimensional ambient spaces.  The true intrinsic dimension and the estimated intrinsic dimension are compared for various combinations of ambient and intrinsic dimensions.

The intrinsic dimension is estimated separately for each of the ten classes within each dataset.  Two different image resolutions are considered for each dataset: 12x12 and 28x28 pixels. The table shows the mean and standard deviation of the estimated intrinsic dimension for each class and resolution. These results highlight the heterogeneity of the intrinsic dimension across different classes in each dataset.", "section": "4.2 Empirical study of geometry of data manifolds"}]
