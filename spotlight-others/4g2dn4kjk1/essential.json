Addressing the challenges of non-isotropic and heavy-tailed input distributions, this work broadens the applicability of linear regression techniques and **encourages exploration of alternative gradient-based algorithms**.", "summary": "New algorithm efficiently solves linear regression with heterogeneous data batches, handling diverse input distributions and achieving high accuracy with fewer samples.", "takeaways": ["Improved linear regression algorithm for heterogeneous data batches.", "Handles non-isotropic and heavy-tailed input distributions.", "Significant performance gains over existing methods with fewer samples and batches."], "tldr": "Many machine learning applications deal with data from multiple sources, each providing small batches of samples insufficient for individual model training.  A common approach assumes these sources belong to several subgroups, each with its own characteristics. This approach is problematic when dealing with long-tailed distributions common in applications like federated learning and recommendation systems, as many sources provide very little data.  Prior work requires strict assumptions like isotropic Gaussian distributions for all subgroups, limiting practical applicability.  The problem is further complicated by limited labeled samples in most batches. \nThis paper introduces a novel gradient-based algorithm that overcomes these limitations.  The algorithm allows for different, unknown, and heavy-tailed input distributions across subgroups, and it recovers subgroups even with a large number of sources. It improves sample and batch size requirements and relaxes the need for separation between regression vectors. The algorithm's effectiveness is validated through theoretical guarantees and empirical results showing significant improvements over previous methods, highlighting its potential to improve personalization and accuracy in various applications.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4G2DN4Kjk1/podcast.wav"}
