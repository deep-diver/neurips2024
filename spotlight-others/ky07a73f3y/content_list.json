This is particularly evident in tasks where text specification is not required and where training and test environments are congruent, minimizing the need for semantic generalization. In contrast, tasks like referring expressions grounding demonstrate the necessity of direct access to text embeddings for accurate object localization, even when representations are modulated to considerable success. For the OVMM task, we identified a scenario where multimodal alignment is essential and proposed a method to explicitly utilize the latent knowledge of the Stable Diffusion model through text-aligned attention maps, which is not straightforward to do for other multimodal models. Future research could design methods to derive precise text-associated attribution maps for other models.

The former only requires image-text samples for the conditional generation objective, whereas the latter requires a sophisticated negative label sampling pipeline along with large batch sizes to prevent the model from collapsing to a degenerate solution [33]. We demonstrate this phenomenon empirically on the Franka-Kitchen environment by fine-tuning CLIP similarly to SCR-FT in Appendix D.1.

We showed that using representations extracted from text-to-image diffusion models for policy learning can improve generalization across a wide range of tasks including manipulation, image-goal and object-goal based navigation, grasp point prediction, and referring expressions grounding. We also demonstrated the interpretability benefits of incorporating attention maps extracted from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which we showed can improve performance and help identify downstream failures of the policy during development. Finally, we discussed ways in which the insights presented in this paper, for example, regarding feature aggregation and fine-tuning, may be applicable to other foundation models used for control. We hope that Stable Control Representations will help advance data-efficient control and enable open-vocabulary generalization in challenging control domains as the capabilities of diffusion models continue to improve.
