VAP extends the chain-of-thought approach by incorporating visual information, using an image synthesized from the input text, to enhance the model's reasoning process and ultimately arrive at a better answer.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "NGuGVT7ar2/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: An example of solving the same Geometry Intersection Counting problem using different types of input.
