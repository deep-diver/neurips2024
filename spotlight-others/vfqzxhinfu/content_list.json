In this paper, we propose a simple but effective self-attention mechanism, termed Consistent Self-Attention, that boosts the consistency between the generated images. It can be used to augment pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-image models in a zero-shot manner. Based on the images with consistent content, we further show that our method can be extended to longrange video generation by introducing a semantic space temporal motion prediction module, named Semantic Motion Predictor. It is trained to estimate the motion conditions between two provided images in the semantic spaces. This module converts the generated sequence of images into videos with smooth transitions and consistent subjects that are more stable than the modules based on latent spaces only, especially in the context of long video generation. By merging these two novel components, our framework, referred to as StoryDiffusion, can describe a text-based story with consistent images or videos encompassing a rich variety of contents. The proposed StoryDiffusion encompasses pioneering explorations in visual story generation with the presentation of images and videos, which we hope could inspire more research from the aspect of architectural modifications.

The commonly used IP-Adapter [55] taking an image as a reference could be used to guide the diffusion process to generate images similar to it. However, due to the strong guidance, the controllability over the generated content of the text prompts is reduced. On the other hand, recent state-of-the-art identity preservation methods, such as InstantID [47] and PhotoMaker [26], focus on identity controllability but the consistency of the attires and the scenarios cannot be guaranteed.

As the self-attention weights are input-dependent, model training or fine-tuning might not be required.

As shown in Fig. 1, the generated images using Consistent Self-Attention successfully preserve the consistency in both identity and attire, which is vital for storytelling.

Our Consistent Self-Attention approach samples tokens from other images within a batch, incorporating them into keys and values during self-attention. The original intent of random sampling is to maintain consistency while avoiding excessive structural information, thereby preventing the weakening of text control and maintaining diversity in poses. We conducted an ablation study to find the optimal sampling rate (results in Fig. 7). A sampling rate of 0.3 does not maintain subject consistency, as seen in the third column of images on the left in Fig. 7, whereas higher rates do. Quantitatively, higher sampling rates can over-correlate images and reduce text control, while lower rates weaken character consistency. We also added a quantitative comparison with the grid sampling method (Tab. 3). While grid sampling better preserves character consistency, it sacrifices text prompt controllability, making our adjustable sampling ratio ideal for balancing both factors. In practice, we set the sampling rate to 0.5, balancing consistency with minimal diffusion process impact.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
