Our StoryDiffusion achieves better text similarity and subject similarity even without any training.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of consistent image generation methods, including IP-Adapter, Photo Maker, and the proposed StoryDiffusion.  The metrics used are Text-Image Similarity and Character Similarity, both measured using CLIP scores.  The results show that StoryDiffusion achieves higher scores in both metrics compared to the other two methods, indicating better performance in generating images that are both consistent with the text prompt and consistent in terms of character identity and appearance.  Importantly, StoryDiffusion achieves this superior performance without requiring any training.", "section": "4.2 Comparisons of consistent image generation"}, {"figure_path": "VFqzxhINFU/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art transition video generation models.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed StoryDiffusion model against two state-of-the-art transition video generation models, SEINE and SparseCtrl.  The comparison uses six metrics: LPIPS-f, LPIPS-a, CLIPSIM-f, CLIPSIM-a, FVD, and FID. Lower values are better for LPIPS-f, LPIPS-a, FVD, and FID, while higher values are better for CLIPSIM-f and CLIPSIM-a.  The results show that StoryDiffusion outperforms the other methods across all metrics, indicating superior performance in generating transition videos.", "section": "4.3 Comparisons of transition videos generation"}, {"figure_path": "VFqzxhINFU/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation study on different random sampling ratios for both random sampling and grid sampling.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study conducted to determine the optimal random sampling rate for the Consistent Self-Attention module.  Two sampling methods were compared: random sampling and grid sampling, each tested at different rates (0.3, 0.5, 0.7 for random; 0.5 for grid). The table shows the impact of different sampling rates on character similarity and CLIP score, which are used to evaluate image consistency and quality. The results indicate an optimal sampling rate that balances character consistency and CLIP score, suggesting a trade-off between these two measures.", "section": "4.4 Ablation study"}, {"figure_path": "VFqzxhINFU/tables/tables_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: User study on subject-consistent image generation and transition video generation.", "description": "This table presents the results of a user study comparing the performance of StoryDiffusion against other methods in generating subject-consistent images and transition videos.
