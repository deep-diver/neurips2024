Insufficient data and negative transfer (where sharing information hurts performance) further complicate matters. This limits the practical application of multi-task learning, particularly in complex scenarios like multivariate time series forecasting.\nThis research tackles these issues head-on.  It introduces a novel theoretical framework based on random matrix theory, providing precise performance estimations.  The authors derive a closed-form solution for a multi-task optimization problem, linking performance to model statistics and data properties.  This solution offers a robust method for hyperparameter optimization.  Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show significant performance improvements over existing methods, especially in multivariate time series forecasting.", "affiliation": "Huawei Noah's Ark Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "FFW6rPz48Z/podcast.wav"}
