Existing latent space optimization (LSO) methods often decouple generation and optimization, leading to suboptimal performance and high computational costs.  **These methods also require additional inference models**, increasing complexity.\n\nThe Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT) addresses these issues by **integrating molecule generation and property optimization within a single framework**.  LPT uses a latent vector to decouple molecule generation and property prediction, allowing for efficient optimization in the latent space.  **LPT's online learning algorithm progressively shifts the model distribution towards regions of desired properties, showcasing strong sample efficiency**. The model's effectiveness is validated across single/multi-objective, and structure-constrained optimization tasks, demonstrating its potential in drug discovery and material science.", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dg3tI3c2B1/podcast.wav"}
