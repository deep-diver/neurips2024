This includes the residue type, frame orientation, and sidechain torsion angles for the protein residues and atom positions and types for the ligand.  Figure 1(b) illustrates the PocketFlow forward process.  It starts with an initialized pocket and iteratively refines it through multiple steps.  Each step involves both unconditional updates (blue lines) and updates guided by the binding affinity predictor (red lines) and interaction geometry constraints (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking). The goal is to produce a final designed pocket (t=1) with improved binding affinity and structural validity.", "section": "3 Preliminaries"}, {"figure_path": "WyVTj77KEV/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Case studies of small-molecule-binding protein pocket design.
