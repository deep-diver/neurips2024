Existing transductive approaches, designed to leverage unlabeled data for improved accuracy, have had limited success when applied to VLMs.  This paper addresses this gap by highlighting the limitations of existing transductive few-shot methods for VLMs and proposing TransCLIP.\nTransCLIP is a novel, computationally efficient transductive approach that enhances VLMs. It works as a plug-and-play module to improve zero- and few-shot models, optimizing a new objective function that incorporates a KL divergence penalty integrating text-encoder knowledge. This approach ensures guaranteed convergence and decoupled updates, leading to efficient transduction even with large datasets.  Experimental results show that TransCLIP significantly outperforms standard approaches, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities.", "affiliation": "UCLouvain", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "go4zzXBWVs/podcast.wav"}
