It shows the impact of different hyperparameters, including the number of traversals, feature dimension, feature resolution, and feature backbone, on the IoU (Intersection over Union) score, which is a measure of the accuracy of the segmentation.  The table is structured to systematically vary each of these hyperparameters while holding others constant, enabling analysis of their individual contributions to the overall performance of EmerSeg. The runtime column indicates the time taken for training with each configuration.  The results reveal the optimal settings for achieving high-performance segmentation using EmerSeg.", "section": "5.1.2 Ablation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "6qr3932RWe/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Mean IoU of unsupervised vs. five supervised methods in Mapverse-Ithaca365. * indicates the model without training on our dataset.", "description": "This table compares the Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of the proposed unsupervised method, EmerSeg, against five state-of-the-art supervised semantic segmentation methods (PSPNet, SegViT, InternImage, Mask2Former, and SegFormer) on the Mapverse-Ithaca365 dataset.
