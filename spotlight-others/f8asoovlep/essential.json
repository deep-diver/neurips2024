This limitation hinders the development of AI systems capable of comprehensive video understanding from a causal perspective.  The lack of a suitable task and benchmark further exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to evaluate and compare the performance of different causal reasoning models. \nThis paper introduces a new task and dataset called Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD) to address this issue.  **MECD aims to uncover causal relationships between multiple events distributed chronologically across long videos**.  To accomplish this, the paper proposes a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, employing an efficient mask-based event prediction model and integrating advanced causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to handle confounding and illusory causality.  Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving improved accuracy in identifying causal associations within multi-event videos.  **The introduction of MECD and the proposed framework will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in video causal reasoning.**", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "F8aSOovlEP/podcast.wav"}
