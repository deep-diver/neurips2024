This paper revisits the feature selection problem, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive analysis given recent advancements in diffusion model architectures. The early studies had performed large-scale comparisons but missed many potential activation candidates.\nThis study addresses these issues by taking a new approach. Instead of exhaustive quantitative comparisons, the researchers focused on identifying and analyzing universal properties inherent to diffusion models' activations. They found three such properties that allow for efficient qualitative filtering of inferior activations. This streamlined the process leading to a greatly improved quantitative comparison.  The final feature selection solutions outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on various discriminative tasks.
