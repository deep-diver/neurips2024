The results indicate that Cutout tends to misclassify data with lower C-scores compared to ERM, while CutMix exhibits even lower C-scores.", "description": "This table presents the mean and quantiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) of C-scores for misclassified data points by three different training methods: ERM, Cutout, and CutMix.  The C-score measures how structurally regular the data is, with lower scores indicating more difficult-to-classify examples.  The results show that CutMix misclassifies data with consistently lower C-scores, suggesting it learns even the most challenging features.  Cutout outperforms ERM, also indicating an improvement in feature learning compared to the baseline.", "section": "Additional Experimental Results"}]
