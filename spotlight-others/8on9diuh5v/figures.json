Each panel displays the output of the feature obtained by three different training methods: ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization), Cutout, and CutMix.  The results visually confirm the theoretical findings, that is, ERM can only learn common features, Cutout can learn common and rare features, but not extremely rare features, and CutMix can learn all types of features. The non-monotonic behavior of the common features trained by CutMix is also noticeable.  This non-monotonic behavior is a key observation motivating the novel proof techniques introduced in the paper.", "section": "Experiments"}]
