Previous work for stereotype mitigation mainly concentrated on mitigating stereotypes engendered with individual objects within images, which failed to address stereotypes engendered by the association of multiple objects, referred to as Association-Engendered Stereotypes. For example, mentioning \u201cblack people\u201d and \u201chouses\u201d separately in prompts may not exhibit stereotypes. Nevertheless, when these two objects are associated in prompts, the association of \u201cblack people\u201d with \u201cpoorer houses\u201d becomes more pronounced. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework, MAS, to Mitigate Associationengendered Stereotypes. This framework models the stereotype problem as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. The MAS framework primarily consists of the Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP (PIS CLIP) and Sensitive Transformer. The PIS CLIP learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can establish the mapping of prompts to stereotypes. The Sensitive Transformer produces the sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution.

Although the current image quality and capabilities generated by T2I are gradually approaching maturity, it is worth noting that various biases and stereotypes may still arise from neutral prompt words (Zhou et al.

These biases can manifest in multiple aspects, such as occupations (Bianchi et al. [2023], Cho et al. [2023], Luccioni et al. [2023]), objects (Mannering [2023]) and adjectives (Luccioni et al. [2023], Naik and Nushi [2023]). Additionally, T2I diffusion models may exhibit gender bias when depicting interactions between two or more people. Based on the above findings, previous researchers proposed stereotype detection frameworks such as Language Agent (Wang et al. [2023a]) and T2IAT detection (Wang et al. [2023b]). These research results provide practical tools for identifying stereotypes and lay a solid foundation for further mitigating stereotypes.

Existing approaches to mitigate stereotypes in T2I diffusion models have effectively mitigated some of the stereotypes but still have some limitations. Friedrich et al. [2023] randomly introduced additional text clues by identifying known occupations in the prompts to ensure a fair distribution of the generated images. However, this approach may ineffectively address biases related to occupations that are not predefined. Kim et al. [2023] developed a destereotyping loss function and adjusted specific parameters of the soft prompts to balance the sensitive attributes of the generated images but only achieved de-stereotyping in the T2I model containing occupational prompts. Chuang et al. [2023] proposed a technique that involves projecting biased directions in text embeddings and debiasing by utilizing text data with a calibrated projection matrix.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
