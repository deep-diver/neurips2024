Existing methods primarily focus on optimizing for specific downstream tasks, sometimes sacrificing the broader knowledge acquired during pre-training.  This issue is exacerbated by the fact that naive alignment strategies do not guarantee gradient reduction and can even lead to gradient explosion.\n\nThe proposed PACE method addresses these issues by combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with consistency regularization.  By introducing multiplicative noise and ensuring model consistency across perturbations, PACE implicitly regularizes gradients and aligns the fine-tuned model with its pre-trained counterpart.  This approach leads to enhanced generalization and superior performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing existing PEFT methods.  Theoretical analysis validates PACE's effectiveness in achieving both implicit gradient regularization and model alignment.", "affiliation": "Australian National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cOuLbPhOT1/podcast.wav"}
