These issues severely hinder the investigation of brain dynamics underlying complex tasks, especially those requiring long time horizons. Existing optimization methods like Adam often struggle with these issues, leading to slow convergence or failure to find a solution. \nThis research introduces SOFO, a novel second-order optimization method that addresses these limitations. SOFO leverages batched forward-mode differentiation, resulting in constant memory usage over time, unlike backpropagation.  Its efficient use of GPU parallelism makes it faster than many other second-order optimizers, while achieving vastly superior performance than Adam in various RNN tasks, including double-reaching motor tasks and adaptive Kalman filter learning over long horizons. The results indicate that SOFO is a promising technique for tackling complex RNN training problems, facilitating progress in computational neuroscience and beyond.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Pox8jNQOo5/podcast.wav"}
