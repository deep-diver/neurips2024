A key challenge in applying end-to-end learning to optimization problems is efficiently computing gradients during backpropagation.  **KKT reformulation addresses this by transforming the computationally expensive process of implicit differentiation of the KKT system into a more tractable form**.  This might involve simplifying the KKT matrix structure, for instance, by leveraging sparsity or exploiting problem-specific characteristics. The goal is to create a **simplified quadratic programming (QP) problem or a similar structured optimization problem whose solution efficiently yields the gradients needed for backpropagation**. This reformulation is crucial for enabling efficient end-to-end training, significantly speeding up the learning process and allowing the method to scale to larger problems which was not previously possible."}}, {"heading_title": "Efficient QP Solver", "details": {"summary": "An efficient QP (Quadratic Programming) solver is crucial for the effectiveness of the proposed differentiable convex optimization framework.
