The comparison is based on the average error rate (%) achieved on three image corruption benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C).  A lower error rate indicates better performance. All methods used a ResNet-50 backbone for fair comparison.

It shows the impact of using the Selective Slot-based Reconstruction (SSR) and High-Order Relational Reasoning (HORR) modules individually and together on the performance of the model across three benchmark datasets: VLCS, PACS, and Office-Home. The results demonstrate that both modules contribute to improved generalization performance, and that combining them yields the best overall results.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Studies"}]
