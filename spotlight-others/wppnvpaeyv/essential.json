{"importance": "This paper is important because **it introduces a novel, controllable paradigm for long-tailed learning**, addressing the limitations of existing methods.  It offers **flexible control over the trade-off between head and tail classes**, allowing adaptation to diverse real-world scenarios and user preferences. This work opens up **new avenues for research in handling distribution shifts and personalized long-tailed learning**, with significant implications for various applications.", "summary": "Controllable long-tailed learning achieved via hypernetwork-generated diverse experts, adapting to user preferences and distribution shifts.", "takeaways": ["A new controllable long-tailed learning paradigm that accommodates user preferences for trade-offs between head and tail classes.", "Hypernetwork-generated diverse experts effectively handle distribution shifts in real-world scenarios.", "Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance and controllable adjustments according to user preferences."], "tldr": "Long-tailed learning struggles with imbalanced datasets, where some classes have many examples while others have few. Existing methods often fail to adapt to different test data distributions and cannot handle user preferences for head vs. tail class trade-offs. This creates challenges for applications requiring flexible adaptation.\n\nThis paper proposes PRL, a paradigm that generates diverse expert models using hypernetworks. These experts cover various distribution scenarios, allowing the system to adapt to any test distribution and output a user-preference-matched model solution. **PRL achieves higher performance ceilings and effectively overcomes distribution shifts while allowing controllable adjustments according to user preferences**.  This offers a new, interpretable, and controllable approach to long-tailed learning, significantly expanding its applicability.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "WpPNVPAEyv/podcast.wav"}
