Except for the first row, all results are for the agnostic noise model.", "description": "This table summarizes the runtime complexities of the proposed algorithms for PQ learning and tolerant TDS learning.  It shows the runtime for different concept classes (halfspaces, intersections of halfspaces, decision trees, and formulas) under various training distributions (Gaussian, uniform). The first row represents the realizable setting, while the remaining rows consider the agnostic noise model, meaning the training labels can be arbitrarily noisy. The table highlights that the algorithms achieve dimension-efficient runtimes for PQ learning and tolerate moderate distribution shift for TDS learning.", "section": "1.1 Our results"}]
