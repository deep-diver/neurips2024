The basis functions in the table are not normalized, but they can be rescaled so that their squares integrate to one.", "description": "This table presents examples of orthogonal function expansions in one dimension.  It shows four different families of orthogonal functions (Legendre polynomials, Fourier basis, weighted Laguerre polynomials, and weighted Hermite polynomials), each suitable for approximating functions over a specific support ([-1,1], the unit circle S\u00b9, [0, \u221e), and R, respectively). The table lists the support for each function family and their corresponding basis functions.", "section": "2.1 Orthogonal function expansions"}, {"figure_path": "thUf6ZBlPp/tables/tables_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Table E.1: Summary of posteriordb models", "description": "This table lists eight hierarchical Bayesian models from the posteriordb benchmark suite, along with their dimensionality and a brief description.
