{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in Bayesian deep learning because it addresses a critical limitation of current approximate posteriors: **lack of reparameterization invariance**.  This work provides a new geometric understanding of this problem, leading to improved posterior sampling methods and potentially more accurate uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks.  It opens avenues for developing more robust and reliable Bayesian deep learning models, which is a significant challenge in the field.", "summary": "Bayesian neural networks often underfit due to their lack of reparameterization invariance; this paper introduces a Riemannian diffusion process to improve posterior sampling and enhance predictive performance.", "takeaways": ["Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks lack reparameterization invariance, assigning different densities to different parametrizations of identical functions.", "The paper introduces a Riemannian diffusion process for improved posterior sampling, addressing the limitations of the Laplace approximation.", "Empirical results demonstrate improved posterior fit and predictive performance using this new method compared to existing approaches."], "tldr": "Bayesian deep learning struggles to match the success of standard deep learning due to the high computational cost of estimating full posteriors and the limitations of approximate methods like Laplace approximation.  A key issue identified is the **lack of reparameterization invariance**, where models assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of the same function. This undermines Bayesian principles and hinders accurate uncertainty quantification.\nThis research tackles this problem by developing a novel geometric view of reparameterizations.  They show that the popular linearized Laplace approximation implicitly handles infinitesimal invariance, and extend this property to the original neural network using a **Riemannian diffusion process**. This provides a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling that empirically demonstrates improved posterior fit and predictive performance compared to standard Laplace approximations, significantly mitigating the underfitting issue.
