[{"figure_path": "PQt6Vg2X5u/figures/figures_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Decomposition of a discrete random variable into a superposition of binary random variables. The figure illustrates a decomposition of a discrete random variable Z with domain of four values b0 < b1 < b2 < b3 into a superposition of three binary random variables, Z = b0 + \u03a3K=1 \u03b1jZj. A way to think about the decomposition is to compare it to a progress bar. In the illustration Z takes value b2, and so the random variables Z|1 and Z|2 corresponding to the first two segments \u201clight up\u201d (take value 1), whereas the random variable Z|3 corresponding to the last segment remains \u201cturned off\u201d (takes value 0). The value of Z equals the sum of the lengths \u03b1j of the \"lighted up\" segments.", "description": "This figure illustrates how a discrete random variable Z can be decomposed into a sum of binary random variables. The decomposition is analogous to a progress bar, where each segment represents a binary variable indicating whether the value is above a certain threshold. The sum of these binary variables weighted by the length of each segment equals the value of the discrete random variable. This decomposition is useful for deriving tighter concentration inequalities.", "section": "3 Split-kl and PAC-Bayes-split-kl inequalities for discrete random variables"}]
