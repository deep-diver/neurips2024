It shows a comparison of storage size and rendering speed between LightGaussian and other state-of-the-art methods (3D-GS, Mip-NeRF 360, INGP, VQ-NeRF, Plenoxels).

Next, SH coefficients are distilled into a compact format using synthesized pseudo-views. Finally, vector quantization, including codebook initialization and assignment, reduces model bandwidth.", "description": "This figure illustrates the pipeline of the LightGaussian method. It starts with multi-view images and Structure from Motion (SfM) points to generate 3D Gaussians.  Then, a Gaussian pruning and recovery step removes less significant Gaussians.

Finally, vector quantization compresses the remaining attributes.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "6AeIDnrTN2/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Zero-shot Opacity-based Pruning. A significant number of Gaussians exhibit small opacity values (top). Simply utilizing Gaussian opacity as an indicator for pruning the least important Gaussians results in the rendered image losing intricate details (bottom), with the PSNR dropping from 27.2 to 25.3. This has inspired us to find better criteria to measure global significance in terms of rendering quality. The accumulated Probability Density Function(PDF) is equal to 1.", "description": "This figure shows the limitations of using opacity alone for pruning Gaussians. The top graph shows the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Gaussian opacity, revealing that many Gaussians have low opacity.  The bottom part shows that simply pruning Gaussians with low opacity leads to loss of detail in the rendered image, as shown by the lower PSNR (25.3 vs 27.2).  This motivates the authors to develop a more sophisticated metric for global significance.", "section": "3.2 Gaussian Pruning & Recovery"}, {"figure_path": "6AeIDnrTN2/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Visual Comparisons.
