We introduce a model that reconstructs a multimodal distribution of shapes from a single shading image, which aligns with the human experience of multistable perception.

Despite its relatively small parameter count and predominantly bottom-up structure, we show that multistable shape explanations emerge from this model for ambiguous test images that humans experience as being multistable. At the same time, the model produces veridical shape estimates for object-like images that include distinctive occluding contours and appear less ambiguous.

At the level of a quadratic surface patch, when lighting is unknown, there is a discrete four-way ambiguity corresponding to convex, concave, and saddle shapes [54, 29].

Our method also leverages patch diffusion, but it departs from these work in two key ways. Unlike [3, 32], we do not generate patches auto-regressively or require an anchor patch. Instead, we simultaneously guide all patches (e.g., 100 patches for a $160\\times160$ image) toward a coherent output using spatial consistency guidance. A second distinction is that we do not provide a global condition such as text to each individual patch. Instead, each patch is conditioned only on the corresponding crop of the input grayscale image, which is why we call it a bottom-up architecture. It shares the same spirit as previous work on inverse lighting [14], which also uses a bottom-up architecture to produce a variety of explanations that can then be integrated with top-down information.

[52] introduced a patch-based diffusion training framework that incorporates patch coordinates to reduce training time and storage cost. Patch-based diffusion has also been used for other tasks. Ozdenizci et al. [42] use overlapping patch diffusion to restore images in adverse weather, and Ding et al. [11] use it to synthesize images in higher resolution. All of these works use fairly large patches (e.g., $64\\times64$ ) and some of their components, such as feature-averaging or noise-averaging, are not appropriate for our shape from shading problem because of its inherent multi-modality. A convex sample and a concave sample cannot simply be averaged to improve the output. These challenges motivate the novel features of our model, including global consistency guidance and multiscale sampling.

It learns exclusively from observations of everyday objects, and then it produces perceptually-aligned multimodal shape distributions for images that are different from its training set and that appear ambiguous to human observers. A critical component of our model is a sampling scheme that operates across multiple scales. Our model also provides compositional control: global lighting consistency can be turned on or off, thereby controlling whether regional bumps/dents can each undergo concave/convex filps independently. Our findings motivate the exploration of other multiscale stochastic architectures, for a variety of computer vision tasks. They may also help improve the understanding and modeling of human shape perception. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations A key limitation is our restriction to textureless and shadowless Lambertian shading. While this restriction is common in theoretical work [29, 54, 20] and useful for creating ambiguous images, it is well-known that many ambiguities disappear in the presence of other cues such as glossy highlights, cast shadows, and repetitive texture. Also, since our model is predominantly bottom-up, it suffers when large regions of an image are covered by cast shadows (e.g., the shoulder region in Fig. 8). These types of regions often require non-local context like object recognition in order to be accurately completed. Incorporating more diverse materials (e.g., as in [14]) and top-down signals into our model are important directions for future research.

It scales linearly with the number of resolutions, which is likely to be improved by optimization or parallelization that increases runtime efficiency. Also, since our multiscale approach is training free, it requires a manual search to identify a good schedule. Similar to previous work that restarts the sampling process from intermediate timesteps [55], ours also require choosing the timestep at which to resume sampling. Overall, further analysis is needed to better understand the structure of our model\u2019s latent space, and to discover more efficient and general approaches to multiscale generation.
