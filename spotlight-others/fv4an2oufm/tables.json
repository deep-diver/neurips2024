The comparison is made for different numbers of basis functions/landmarks (8, 16, 32). The results show the trade-off between accuracy (RMSE), computational cost (Time), and training time (Epochs).", "section": "6.1 Brownian Motion"}, {"figure_path": "FV4an2OuFM/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Training configurations for learning scores with different numbers of bases", "description": "This table shows different training configurations used for learning scores with varying numbers of Fourier bases.  It details the input and output dimensions, time embedding dimensions, downsampling and upsampling dimensions, and the activation function used for each configuration.  These configurations were likely experimented with to find optimal settings for different levels of complexity.", "section": "B Score Learning"}]
