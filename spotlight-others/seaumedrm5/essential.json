RNN-T uses dynamic programming for alignment, while AED uses cross-attention during decoding. These methods demand significant computational resources and complex training procedures.\nThis paper introduces the \"Aligner-Encoder\" model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of transformer-based encoders to perform alignment internally.  This simplifies the model architecture and training process, eliminating the need for dynamic programming or extensive cross-attention. The model achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art systems but with significantly reduced inference time \u2013 twice as fast as RNN-T and sixteen times faster than AED. The authors also show that the audio-text alignment is clearly visible in the self-attention weights of a certain layer, demonstrating a novel \"self-transduction\" mechanism within the encoder.", "affiliation": "Google", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Speech Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "seAuMedrm5/podcast.wav"}
