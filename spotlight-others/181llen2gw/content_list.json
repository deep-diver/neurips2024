On the other hand, while some debiasing strategies are originally designed for mitigating bias in the image or text encoder\u2019s output for retrieval task, like DeAR [34] and CLIPclip [38], they offer potential for broader application across various modalities and tasks. For instance, DeAR can extend the use of adversarial training to neutralize biases in the decoder\u2019s intermediate representations by aligning them near the decision boundary for sensitive attribute by deceiving the attribute classifier. Yet, this method\u2019s effectiveness is hampered by the intrinsic complexities and sensitivities of adversarial training techniques, which are highly dependent on precise hyperparameter tuning. Similarly, CLIP-clip could potentially adapt to various tasks by pruning features in the frozen representation that exhibit high mutual information with sensitive attributes. However, this approach does not consider dependencies between feature columns. Furthermore, the process of zeroing out pruned features might inadvertently distort the semantic meaning of embeddings, leading to a loss in the quality and relevance of the output.

In details, by utilizing feature selection techniques such as RandomForest [8] to identify gender-specific (or race) biases within the frozen representation, SFID prunes and subsequently replace bias-causing features with bias-free representation obtained from ambiguous samples identified by RandomForest, thereby maintaining the semantic content while effectively reducing bias.

Additionally, SFID does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning or costly retraining, making it cost-efficient. By training a debiasing dataset separate from the test query set, SFID demonstrates its transferability and maintains zero-shot capability. Furthermore, SFID\u2019s ability to generalize across different VLM components, such as encoders and decoders, highlights its versatility in diverse multimodal contexts. Experimental results show that SFID outperforms existing debiasing methods, making it a versatile and efficient solution. This advancement paves the way for fairer and more reliable applications of VLMs in diverse multimodal scenarios, promoting both fairness and practicality in real-world applications.
