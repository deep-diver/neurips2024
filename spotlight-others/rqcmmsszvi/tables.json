The table shows the settings used (feature dimension, undersampling, sparsity, relative noise) and the results obtained by various methods, including the asymptotic method, Gaussian adjustment, and the data-driven adjustment proposed in the paper.  The metrics used for evaluating performance are the ratio of remainder to Gaussian terms (both l2 and l-infinity norms), average radius for asymptotic and adjusted confidence intervals, and finally the hit rates for both overall and on support (non-zero pixels).", "section": "5.1 UQ for Sparse Model-Based Regression"}, {"figure_path": "RQCmMSSzvI/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Experiments for sparse regression for Gaussian and Fourier matrix.

The table shows the impact of different experimental settings (dimensionality, undersampling rate, sparsity, noise level) on the performance of the debiased Lasso and the proposed methods for uncertainty quantification.  It compares several metrics such as the ratio of remainder term to Gaussian term (both L2 and L-infinity norms), the average radius of asymptotic and adjusted confidence intervals, and various hit rates (coverage rates of the confidence intervals, both overall and on the support). The results demonstrate that in a high-dimensional setting the bias term is often too significant to disregard. ", "section": "5.1 UQ for Sparse Model-Based Regression"}]
