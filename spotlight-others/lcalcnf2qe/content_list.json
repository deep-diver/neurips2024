The quality of this mesh significantly impacts the balance between a numerical solution\u2019s accuracy and the computational cost required to obtain it. To maintain high-resolution everywhere in the domain is computationally expensive. Many systems modeled by PDEs however are multi-resolution in nature. For example, a small part of the system may be highly dynamic, while other regions are quasi-stationary; alternatively, some locations may be more important while others less important to the question being considered by the calculation [1\u20134].

In contrast, $r$ -adaptation (or mesh movement) relocates or moves mesh nodes, keeping the mesh topology and thus the number of elements and vertices in the mesh unchanged [9].

In this scenario, the initial tracer field takes a narrow ring shape and is advected within a swirling velocity field, see Eq. (A3) and (A4) in Appx. C. The velocity swirling direction is anti-clockwise in the first half of the simulation and clockwise for the second half. Given this setting, as the advection process is reversible, the final state should be consistent with the initial state. This constitutes a problem of significant multi-resolution complexity, as the extremely narrow ring requires a high resolution to accurately resolve the dynamics at the sharply defined interfaces of both inner and outer sides.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
