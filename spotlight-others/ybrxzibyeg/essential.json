This leads to fused images with noise, color bias, and poor exposure, weakening the salience of objects of interest.  The limitations of existing methods highlight the need for a more robust and user-friendly approach. \nText-DiFuse addresses these issues by introducing a novel interactive framework that uses a text-modulated diffusion model. It integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing for adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal fusion.  The text-controlled fusion strategy lets users customize the fusion process via text input, enhancing the salience of foreground objects. This framework demonstrates state-of-the-art results across various scenarios, showcasing improvements in both visual quality and semantic segmentation, marking a significant advance in the field.", "affiliation": "Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "yBrxziByeG/podcast.wav"}
