Existing gradient-based MU methods often struggle with efficiency and retained performance.  This paper addresses these limitations. \nThe paper proposes a unified gradient-based MU approach that decomposes the unlearning process into three components.  It then introduces a novel fast-slow parameter update strategy to efficiently embed unlearning updates into a manifold defined by the remaining data geometry, implicitly approximating the Hessian. This innovative approach improves unlearning efficacy and efficiency across various CV tasks.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "dheDf5EpBT/podcast.wav"}
