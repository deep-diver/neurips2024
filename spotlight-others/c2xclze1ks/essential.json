This is inefficient and motivates research for faster alternatives.  The core issue is the imbalance in the complexity of subproblems within these methods; simple subproblems require many steps, while more complex ones could potentially achieve faster convergence with fewer steps.\nThis paper introduces the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework to address this.  RTK allows a more balanced decomposition of the process into fewer, strongly log-concave subproblems. It then leverages efficient sampling algorithms (Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Underdamped Langevin Dynamics) to solve these subproblems. This results in RTK-MALA and RTK-ULD, algorithms that significantly improve the convergence rate for diffusion inference, backed by theoretical guarantees.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "C2xCLze1kS/podcast.wav"}
