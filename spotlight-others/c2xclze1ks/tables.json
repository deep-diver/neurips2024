[{"figure_path": "C2xCLze1kS/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison with prior works for RTK-based methods. The complexity denotes the number of calls for the score estimation to achieve TV (p\u03ba\u03b7, p*) \u2264 \u00d5(\u20ac). d and e mean the dimension and error tolerance. Compared with the state-of-the-art result, RTK-ULD achieves the best dependence for both d and e. Though RTK-MALA requires slightly stricter assumptions and worse dimension dependence, a linear convergence w.r.t. e makes it suit high-accuracy sampling tasks.", "description": "The table compares the proposed RTK-MALA and RTK-ULD algorithms with existing state-of-the-art methods for diffusion inference in terms of their computational complexity and theoretical guarantees.  The comparison highlights the improved complexity and convergence rates achieved by the proposed methods under different assumptions on the score function and energy function estimation.", "section": "4 Results"}]
