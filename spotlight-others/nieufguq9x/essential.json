Existing methods often lack reliability measures.  This creates a significant challenge, as inaccurate estimations can have serious consequences in safety-critical applications.\n\nDiffSF tackles this issue by ingeniously integrating transformer-based scene flow estimation with denoising diffusion models. This approach not only improves accuracy and robustness, but also provides uncertainty estimates through multiple hypotheses generation. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on various benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of the approach in handling noisy data and occlusions. The uncertainty estimates further enhance the reliability of predictions, making DiffSF a highly promising solution for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Link\u00f6ping University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Scene Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "nIeufGuQ9x/podcast.wav"}
