This paper addresses this by proposing a novel architecture called Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). The core idea is to use models of different sizes to process different image resolutions; high-resolution images are handled by smaller models, while lower resolution images are handled by larger models. This approach balances computational efficiency and performance. \nPIIP also incorporates a feature interaction mechanism to effectively combine features from different scales.  Extensive experiments show that PIIP significantly outperforms existing methods in object detection, segmentation, and classification tasks while drastically reducing computational costs.  The approach's effectiveness is further validated when applied to a large-scale vision foundation model, where it achieved a performance boost with substantial computational savings. This demonstrates the technique's potential for improving future vision computing tasks.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "NKzLqRgG45/podcast.wav"}
