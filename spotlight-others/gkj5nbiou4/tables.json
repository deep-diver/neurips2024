It contrasts the complexities of Gradient Descent (GD), other compressed methods (those using various compression techniques), CORE (a method proposed by Yue et al., 2023), MARINA-P (a new method with different compressor types), and M3 (a bidirectional compression method). The table separates server-to-worker (s2w) communication complexities from the total communication complexities (s2w + w2s). The results highlight that MARINA-P and M3 can achieve better complexities in certain regimes (specifically, when 'n' (the number of workers) is large and the problem is close-to-homogeneous).", "section": "4.5 The Convergence Theory of MARINA-P with PermK"}, {"figure_path": "gkJ5nBIOU4/tables/tables_60_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The worst case communication complexities to find an \u025b-stationary point.

The table shows both server-to-worker (s2w) and total (s2w + w2s) communication complexities for Gradient Descent (GD), other compressed methods (e.g., EF21-P, dist-EF-SGD, DORE, MCM, and EF21-BC), CORE, MARINA-P with independent RandK and PermK, and M3 with PermK and RandK.
