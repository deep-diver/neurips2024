(a) shows how existing methods typically process each driving scene in isolation, ignoring the temporal relationships between scenes. (b) illustrates RealMotion's approach of continuously accumulating historical information across scenes, allowing it to capture temporal interactions and relationships between scene elements.

It shows how a single, independent scene (a) is transformed into a sequence of continuous sub-scenes (c). This is done by dividing the trajectories into shorter segments (b) and including surrounding elements at each segment's start point. The resulting continuous sub-scenes mimic real-world driving scenarios and provide historical and temporal context for more effective motion forecasting.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "4mxzxYhMuN/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Overview of our RealMotion architecture. RealMotion adopts an encoder-decoder structure with two intermediate streams designed to capture interactive relationships within each scene and across the continuous scenes. The (a) Scene context stream and (b) Agent trajectory stream iteratively accumulate information for the scene context and rectify the prediction, respectively. The (c) context referencing and (d) trajectory relaying modules are specially-designed cross-attention mechanism for each stream.", "description": "The figure shows the architecture of the RealMotion model, which consists of an encoder, decoder, scene context stream, and agent trajectory stream. The scene context stream progressively accumulates historical scene information to capture temporal interactions, while the agent trajectory stream optimizes current forecasting by sequentially relaying past predictions. Both streams utilize cross-attention mechanisms to process information and generate predictions.", "section": "3.2 RealMotion for continuous forecasting"}, {"figure_path": "4mxzxYhMuN/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Qualitative results on the Argoverse 2 validation set.
