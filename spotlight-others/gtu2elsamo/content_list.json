However, as an indirect measure of neuronal activity, the BOLD signal has a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is influenced by a mixture of factors and distorted by non-neuronal fluctuations [20]. Filling every bit of the fMRI time series as in brainLM can hinder the model\u2019s ability to distinguish between noise and actual signals. This can result in either amplifying noise or missing critical subtle variations in brain activity. Unlike natural images, which have high information density with structures such as edges and colors, fMRI data has spatiotemporally sparser signals distributed across brain volumes without clear boundaries, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct signal of masked regions of interest (ROIs). Furthermore, it has been widely shown that masked pretraining in generative architectures such as MAE leads to suboptimal performance in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) [21]. Because of that, BrainLM requires computationally intensive end-to-end finetuning, with a three-layer MLP attached to the pretrained encoder, to achieve optimal performance.

This would enable more nuanced and complex spatiotemporal interpretations. 4) Multi-modal integration: Brain-JEPA sets a potential foundation for integrating multimodal brain activity data such as MEG and EEG or even brain structure data like T1-weighted MRI. The integration could enhance our understanding of brain structure, function, and their links to human behavior and mental disorders. Please refer to Appendix D for the broader impact of Brain-JEPA.
