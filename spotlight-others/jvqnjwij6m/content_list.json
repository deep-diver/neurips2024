In the self-supervised literature, researchers aim to exploit the internal characteristics of data and leverage pretext tasks to train a model. Recently, an unsupervised framework that learns effective views with data augmentation was proposed by Tian et al. [7] to reduce the mutual information between views. CMC [8] introduced a multi-view contrastive learning framework with any number of views to learn view-agnostic representations. Another pretext task of solving jigsaw puzzles was developed in PIRL [9] to improve the semantic quality of learned image representations, achieving better object detection results than supervised pre-training. More recently, Masked image modeling (MIM) has been explored in many previous works [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] to reconstruct the masked image patch given the unmasked counterpart as clues. Some MIM approaches [10, 11, 12, 15, 16] designed customized masking strategies (i.e., random, block-wise) as pre-text tasks during pre-training. For example, block-wise masking was introduced in BEiT [10] to learn transferrable visual representations by recovering discrete tokens of masked image patches. Given features extracted from the $25\\%$ unmasked patches, the seminal work, MAE [12] directly reconstructed missing pixels of $75\\%$ masked patches. SimMIM [14] randomly masked the input image with a large square patch size (i.e., 32) and used a one-layer prediction layer after the encoder to predict RGB values of raw pixels. Other researchers [15, 16, 17, 18] started to leverage a teacher network like CLIP [19] or adversarial learning to generate the mask and supervision target. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Contrastive Learning. In the past years, contrastive learning has shown its effectiveness in selfsupervised learning, where various instance-wise contrastive learning frameworks [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 4] and prototype-level contrastive methods [28, 29, 30, 31] were proposed. The general idea of the instance-wise contrastive learning is to close the distance of the embedding of different views from the same instance while pushing embeddings of views from different instances away. One common way is to use a large batch size to accumulate positive and negative pairs in the same batch. For instance, Chen et al. [20] proposed a simple framework with a learnable nonlinear projection head and a large batch size to improve the quality of the pre-trained representations. To make the best use of a large amount of unlabelled data, they present a bigger unsupervised pre-training network and introduce distillation with unlabeled data in SimCLR v2 [21] to improve the performance in downstream tasks. Without involving negative instances, BOYL [22] trains the online network from an augmented view of an image to predict the target network representation of the same image under a different augmented view (positive instance). Another broadly-used approach [23] in the ICL literature is to apply a momentum encoder to update negative instances from a large and consistent dictionary on the fly. The dynamic dictionary was used with a moving-averaged encoder in MoCo series [24, 23] to build a dynamic dictionary to update negative instances in a queue of considerable size. The Variance-Invariance-Covariance (VICReg) [6] regularization strategy has been proposed to address shortcomings in self-supervised learning by enforcing stability through variance and covariance constraints.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
