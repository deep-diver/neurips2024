However, JEPA faces limitations: its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) struggles to prevent model collapse, and its prediction mechanism isn't accurate in learning patch representation means.  These issues hinder performance and broader applicability.\nThis paper introduces C-JEPA, a novel framework that addresses these limitations.  C-JEPA integrates JEPA with the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) strategy to effectively learn variance/covariance, preventing collapse and ensuring mean invariance across augmented views. Empirical and theoretical analyses show that C-JEPA significantly improves the stability and quality of visual representation learning, demonstrating rapid and improved convergence in various downstream tasks.
