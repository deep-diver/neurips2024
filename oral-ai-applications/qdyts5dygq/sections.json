A key advantage of SDFs is their ability to **quickly compute distances** between objects, avoiding the computational bottleneck of traditional mesh-based collision detection methods which scale poorly with the number of objects.  The authors likely describe how they use **learned SDFs**, possibly trained from images or meshes, to represent object shapes implicitly.  This implicit representation allows for **constant-time distance queries**, regardless of object complexity.  The discussion might then explore the specific algorithmic approach used to detect and resolve collisions using these SDFs, perhaps detailing how they create and use a graph network to model interactions, or highlighting any techniques used to optimize performance and scalability.  **Efficiency** is paramount, given the aim to handle large-scale scenes with numerous objects.
