Amongst them, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) produces one-step generators that match their teacher in distribution, i.e., the distillation process does not enforce a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, to ensure stable training in practice, DMD requires an additional regression loss computed using a large set of noise\u2013image pairs, generated by the teacher with many steps of a deterministic sampler. This is not only computationally expensive for large-scale text-to-image synthesis, but it also limits the student\u2019s quality, tying it too closely to the teacher\u2019s original sampling paths. We introduce DMD2, a set of techniques that lift this limitation and improve DMD training. First, we eliminate the regression loss and the need for expensive dataset construction. We show that the resulting instability is due to the \u201cfake\u201d critic not estimating the distribution of generated samples with sufficient accuracy and propose a two time-scale update rule as a remedy. Second, we integrate a GAN loss into the distillation procedure, discriminating between generated samples and real images. This lets us train the student model on real data, thus mitigating the imperfect \u201creal\u201d score estimation from the teacher model, and thereby enhancing quality. Third, we introduce a new training procedure that enables multi-step sampling in the student, and addresses the training\u2013inference input mismatch of previous work, by simulating inference-time generator samples during training. Taken together, our improvements set new benchmarks in onestep image generation, with FID scores of 1.28 on ImageNet- $64\\!\\times\\!64$ and 8.35 on zero-shot COCO 2014, surpassing the original teacher despite a $500\\times$ reduction in inference cost.

Recent diffusion acceleration techniques have focused on speeding up the generation process through distillation [9, 10, 13\u201320, 22, 23, 30]. They typically train a generator to approximate the ordinary differential equation (ODE) sampling trajectory of a teacher model, in fewer sampling steps. Notably, Luhman et al. [16] precompute a dataset of noise and images pairs, generated by the teacher using an ODE sampler, and use it to train the student to regress the mapping in a single network evaluation. Follow-up works like Progressive Distillation [10,13] eliminate the need to precompute this paired dataset offline. They iteratively train a sequence of student models, each halving the number of sampling steps of its predecessor. A complementary technique, Instaflow [11] straightens the ODE trajectories, so they are easier to approximate with a one-step student. Consistency Distillation [9,12,19,26,31,32], and TRACT [33], train student models so their outputs are self-consistent at any timesteps along the ODE trajectory, and thus consistent with the teacher.

In ADD [23], the generator, initialized with weights from a diffusion model, is trained using a projected GAN objective with an image-space classifier [34]. Building on this, LADD [24] utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model as the discriminator and operates in latent space, thus improving scalability and enabling higher-resolution synthesis. Inspired by DiffusionGAN [28,29], UFOGen [25] introduces noise injection prior to the real vs. fake classification in the discriminator, to smooth out the distributions, which stabilizes the training dynamics. However, purely GANbased methods often struggle to integrate classifier-free guidance directly. For instance, LADD uses diffusion-generated images with classifier-free guidance as real data in its GAN discriminator. Other approaches combine adversarial objectives with a distillation loss to preserve the original guided sampling trajectory. For instance, SDXL-Lightning [27] integrates a DiffusionGAN loss [25] with a progressive distillation objective [10,13], while the Consistency Trajectory Model [26] combines a GAN [35] with an improved consistency distillation [9].

We use a subset of 128 prompts from PartiPrompts [70] following LADD [24]. For each comparison, we ask a random set of five evaluators to choose the image that is more visually appealing, as well as the one that better represents the text prompt. Details about the human evaluation are included in Appendix K. As shown in Figure 5, our model achieves much higher user preferences than baseline approaches. Notably, our model outperforms its teacher in image quality for $24\\%$ of samples and achieves comparable prompt alignment, while requiring $25\\times$ fewer forward passes (4 vs 100). Qualitative comparisons are shown in Figure 6. Results for SDv1.5 are provided in Table 5 in Appendix D. Similarly, one-step model trained using DMD2 outperforms all previous diffusion acceleration approaches, achieving a FID score of 8.35, representing a significant 3.14-point improvement over the original DMD method [22]. Our results also surpass the teacher models that uses a 50-step PNDM sampler [50].

Adding our GAN loss achieves a further 1.1- point improvement in FID.

Qualitative results are shown in Appendix Figure. 7. In the absence of the GAN loss, our baseline model produces oversaturated and oversmoothed images (Appendix Fig. 7 third column). Similarly, eliminating distribution matching objective (Eq. 2) reduces our approach to a pure GAN-based method, which struggles with training stability [71, 72]. Moreover, pure GAN-based methods also lack a natural way to incorporate classifier-free guidance [73], essential for high-quality text-to-image synthesis [1,2]. Consequently, while GAN-based methods achieve the lowest FID by closely matching the real distribution, they significantly underperform in text alignment and aesthetic quality (Appendix Fig. 7 second column). Likewise, omitting the backward simulation leads to worse image quality, as indicated by the degraded patch FID score.

Specifically, we generate four images per prompt and calculate the average pairwise LPIPS distance [54]. For this evaluation, we use the LADD [24] subset of PartiPrompts [70]. We also report the FID and CLIP score measured on 10K prompts from COCO 2014 on the side. Table 6 summarizes the results. Table 7 provides further comparisons using image reward [87] and aesthetic score metrics [59]. Our model achieves the best image quality, indicated by the lowest FID and Patch FID scores. We also achieve text alignment comparable to SDXL-Turbo while attaining a better diversity score. While SDXL-Lightning [27] exhibits a higher diversity score than our approach, it suffers from considerably worse text alignment, as reflected by the lower CLIP score and human evaluation (Fig. 5). This suggests that the improved diversity is partially due to random outputs lacking prompt coherence. We note that it is possible to increase the diversity of our model by raising the weights for the GAN objective, which aligns with the more diverse unguided distribution.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
