The standard approach to learn on DTDGs [41, 54] involves using two separate spatial and temporal models. The spatial model is responsible for encoding the structure of the current graph snapshot, while the temporal model updates the dynamic either of the graph representations [39, 40, 59, 30, 28] or the graph model parameters [34, 15]. Recently, ROLAND [59] introduced a generic framework to use any static graph model for spatial encoding coupled with a recurrent-based (LSTM [17], RNN, GRU) or attention-based temporal model. These above methods mainly use a MP-GNN as spatial model [23, 46, 58]. However, MP-GNNs are known to present critical limitations: they struggle to distinguish simple structures like triangles or cycles [33, 4], and fail to capture long-range dependencies due to oversquashing [1, 42]. To overcome these limitations, some works have adopted a fully-connected GT as spatial model, benefiting from its global attention mechanism [6, 50, 61]. In [39], the local structure is preserved by computing the attention on direct neighbors. In contrast to these works, SLATE uses a unique spatio-temporal graph transformer model, greatly simplifying the learning process. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Graph Transformer.

GTs [51, 37, 22, 57] enable direct connections between all nodes, using the graph\u2019s structure as a soft inductive bias, thus resolving the oversquashing issue. The expressiveness of GTs heavily depends on positional or structural encoding [11, 32, 12, 3]. In [11], the authors use the eigenvectors associated with the $k$ -lowest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, which allows GTs to distinguish structures that MP-GNNs are unable to differentiate. Following the success of Laplacian positional encoding on static graphs, SLATE uses the eigenvectors of the supra-Laplacian of a multi-layer graph representation of DTDGs as spatio-temporal encoding. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Dynamic Graph Transformers. To avoid separately modelling structural and temporal information as dynamic Graph Neural Networks usually do on DTDGs, recent papers have adopted a unified model based on spatio-temporal attention [31, 18]. This novel approach make those models close to transformer-based methods classically employed to learn on Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDG) [52, 47, 49]. Among them, some preserve the local structure by computing attention only on direct neighbors [52, 39], while others sample local spatio-temporal structures around nodes [47, 31, 56, 18] and perform fully-connected attention. However, their spatio-temporal encoding is still built by concatenating a spatial and a temporal encoding that are computed independently. The spatial encoding is either based on a graph-based distance [47, 18] or on a diffusion-based measure [31]. The temporal encoding is usually sinus-based [52, 49, 2] as in the original transformer paper [45]. Another drawback of these methods [31, 47, 18, 49] is that they use only sub-graphs to represent the local structure around a given node. Therefore, their representations of the nodes are computed on different graphs and thus fail to capture global and long-range interactions. Contrary to those approaches, our SLATE model uses the same graph to compute node representations in a fully-connected GT between all nodes within temporal windows. It features a unified spatio-temporal encoding based on the supra-Laplacian matrix. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Dynamic Link Prediction methods. For dynamic link prediction, many methods are based only on node representations and use MLPs or cosine similarity to predict the existence of a link [39, 40, 38]. Recent approaches complement node representations by incorporating pairwise information. Techniques like co-occurrence neighbors matching [60, 48] or cross-attention on historical sub-graphs [47] are employed. However, these methods often overlook the global graph structure by focusing on sampled spatio-temporal substructures. For instance, CAW-N [48] uses anonymous random walks around a pair of nodes and matches their neighborhoods, while DyGformer [60] applies transformers to one-hop neighborhoods and calculates co-occurrences. These localized approaches fail to capture the broader graph context. TCL [47] is the closest to SLATE, using cross-attention between spatiotemporal representations of node pairs. TCL samples historical sub-graphs using BFS and employs contrastive learning for node representation. However, it still relies on sub-graph sampling, missing the full extent of the global graph information. In contrast, SLATE leverages the entire graph\u2019s spectral properties through the supra-Laplacian, incorporating the global structure directly into the spatio-temporal encoding.

For a DTDG, this provides valuable information about the graph\u2019s dynamics over time. We verified this property experimentally by generating a DTDG containing 3 snapshots of a random Erdo\u02dds-R\u00e9nyi graph [13] with 10 nodes each and connecting them temporally according to Eq. (7) (see illustration on Figure 1).
