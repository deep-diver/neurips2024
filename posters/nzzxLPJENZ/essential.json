By conceptualizing the evaluation process as a decision tree, and incorporating a data sampling method that generates supervised data and preference pairs, this method significantly reduces evaluation costs and dependency on labeled data while demonstrating strong performance across various evaluation scenarios.", "takeaways": ["A novel tree-based data sampling method for generating evaluation data is proposed.", "Branching preference learning based on the DPO algorithm is introduced, showing a 90% reduction in inference costs compared to exhaustive tree search.", "Strong performance is demonstrated across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and transfer evaluation settings."], "tldr": "Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial but expensive and unreliable. Current methods often struggle with complex dialogue scenarios and limited high-quality data. This paper proposes a novel tree-based approach to enhance LLM evaluation efficiency. The core idea is to model the evaluation process as a decision tree, where each node represents an evaluation action.  This allows for more efficient searches in the tree space instead of an exhaustive evaluation of all possible paths. \nThe proposed method leverages a data sampling technique to create training data and preference pairs from the evaluation tree.  It then utilizes preference learning with the DPO algorithm to optimize the evaluation process. This approach significantly reduces reliance on labeled data and achieves cost reductions of up to 90% compared to existing methods while improving evaluation accuracy and consistency. Experimental results show superior performance across various evaluation settings: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and transfer.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Dialogue Systems"}, "podcast_path": "nzzxLPJENZ/podcast.wav"}
