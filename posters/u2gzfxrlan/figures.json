Transformations are sampled from T\u2081: the set of all permutations. Right plot is for learning f\u2082, a majority-of-subparities function in dimension 21, with a train set size of 5000. Transformations are sampled from T\u2082: permutations on which f\u2082 is invariant. In each case, the test set size is 1000.", "description": "This figure shows the results of two experiments on learning Boolean functions using two different training algorithms. The left plot shows the results for learning the full parity function (f\u2081) with 18 dimensions, using a training set of 7000 samples and a test set of 1000 samples. Transformations were randomly sampled from the set of all possible permutations (T\u2081). The right plot shows results for learning a majority-of-subparities function (f\u2082) with 21 dimensions, using a training set of 5000 samples and a test set of 1000 samples. Transformations were sampled from the set of permutations that leave f\u2082 invariant (T\u2082). Both plots compare a baseline algorithm (standard mini-batch SGD) against an algorithm that incorporates data augmentation using the selected transformations.", "section": "Basic Experiment"}]
