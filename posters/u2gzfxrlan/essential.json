Existing approaches often rely on measuring distances between distributions, which may not effectively capture complex distribution shifts. This paper proposes a novel approach to tackling the problem by representing OOD generalization as learning under data transformations.  The core issue is to understand how the shifts of distribution can affect learning, and if we can learn predictors that are invariant to these shifts.\nThe paper introduces a theoretical framework where training and testing distributions are related through a set of transformations, which can be either known or unknown. The authors propose learning rules that aim to minimize the worst-case error across all possible transformations.  These rules are supported by theoretical guarantees on sample complexity in terms of the VC dimension of predictors and transformations.  Furthermore, the paper addresses the scenario where the transformation class is unknown, proposing algorithmic reductions to ERM that solve the problem using only an ERM oracle. The proposed algorithms offer a game-theoretic interpretation, where the learner seeks predictors that minimize losses, while an adversary selects transformations that maximize losses.  The results provide insights into the sample complexity of transformation-invariant learning and highlight the importance of considering both predictors and transformations when designing robust learning algorithms.", "affiliation": "Yale University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "u2gzfXRLaN/podcast.wav"}
