The layers with strong attention on query and reasoning steps and those where high cosine similarity value vectors cluster do not align, providing insight into the possible mechanism behind the emergence of internal inconsistency. This finding is consistent with Figure 2 and Figure 6, suggesting that the model may make correct predictions in the middle layers but fails to fully utilize them in the later layers. To further understand the specific concepts these high-similarity value vectors represent and verify their importance in determining the final prediction, we project them onto the vocabulary space (nostalgebraist, 2020).

These works aim to provide an internal view of mechanisms to ensure safety and fairness (Burns et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024) and to further improve model inference (Schuster et al., 2022; Raposo et al., 2024). Some studies also examine CoT reasoning from an internal perspective and propose methods to teach models to perform implicit CoT (Deng et al., 2023). Unlike these approaches, which require additional training for interpretation, our internal consistency measure offers an off-the-shelf solution to calibrate CoT reasoning, providing a practical and efficient tool for enhancing model reliability.

In the context of LLMs, previous works apply trained parameterized models to the logits at the final layer (Zhao et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2024).

These studies primarily focus on the alignment between a model\u2019s verbalized reasoning and its outcomes, without delving into the model\u2019s internal reasoning processes.

To mitigate this, we introduce internal consistency as a confidence measure, which evaluates the alignment of latent predictions from intermediate layers. Our extensive empirical studies across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency is a robust indicator of correct reasoning paths, which we show can be further used for enhancing CoT reasoning by prioritizing paths with high internal consistency.

Second, our analysis focuses on vanilla CoT prompting as the simplest approach for reasoning, whereas many other prompting techniques have been proposed (Gao et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
