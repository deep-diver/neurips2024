Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) provide detailed insights but rely on handcrafted features that might not capture the nuances of actual cognitive functioning. \nThis paper introduces AE-NMCF, an autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization method.  **AE-NMCF integrates monotonicity, a fundamental psychometric theory, into a co-factorization framework** using an encoder-decoder learning pipeline.  This improves the accuracy of knowledge proficiency estimation.  A projected gradient method is developed with guaranteed convergence, and experiments show improved accuracy and ability in estimating knowledge over existing models, improving both prediction and diagnosis simultaneously.", "affiliation": "College of Computer and Cyber Security, Fujian Normal University, China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Education"}, "podcast_path": "8UqyWNsnyA/podcast.wav"}
