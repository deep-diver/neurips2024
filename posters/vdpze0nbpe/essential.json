Previous research suggested fundamental limitations of Prod-family algorithms, a class of simple arithmetic update rules, in MAB settings, favoring more complex methods like online mirror descent (OMD).  These complex methods often require solving computationally expensive optimization problems.\nThis research challenges the established view. By leveraging the interpretation of Prod as a first-order OMD approximation, it presents modified Prod variants that achieve optimal regret guarantees in adversarial MAB problems.  Furthermore, it introduces a surprisingly simple, importance-weighting-free version that maintains optimal performance.  **The work offers a significant improvement over prior state-of-the-art, specifically in incentive-compatible bandit settings where the experts' incentives must be carefully managed.**", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "VDPZe0NbpE/podcast.wav"}
