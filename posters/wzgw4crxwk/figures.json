The principal commits to a payment scheme based on the quality of the generated text and sends a prompt to the agent. The agent then selects a text generator, generates a response, and incurs a cost. Finally, the principal evaluates the quality of the response and pays the agent according to the predetermined scheme.", "section": "Problem Setting: Contract Design for Text Generation"}, {"figure_path": "wZgw4CrxwK/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Empirical evaluation results.
