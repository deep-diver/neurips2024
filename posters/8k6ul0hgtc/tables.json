The Gram matrix is a key component in the convergence analysis of the gradient flow. Each block represents interactions between different parts of the loss function: residuals of the PDE, boundary conditions, and gradient matching terms.  The number of nonzero elements reflects the complexity of these interactions, which is directly related to the convergence behavior of the PINNs.", "section": "A Mathematical Notations"}, {"figure_path": "8K6ul0hgtC/tables/tables_51_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Computation costs with width=1000 for experiments on the paper.", "description": "This table presents the GPU memory usage, running time per epoch, and the number of model parameters for different PINN models (standard PINN and VS-PINNs with different splitting levels) used in the experiments of the paper.
