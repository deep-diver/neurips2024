Recent methods use prompts (learnable parameters encoding task knowledge) to guide a pre-trained model, but existing approaches suffer from sub-optimal prompt selection because the prompt selection process is not directly optimized with task loss.  This leads to inadequate feature adaptation for new tasks.\nVQ-Prompt solves this by incorporating vector quantization (VQ). VQ allows the optimization of a discrete set of prompts end-to-end with task loss, effectively improving knowledge abstraction for each task.  Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VQ-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods in class-incremental settings.", "affiliation": "Communication University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Continual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ACCqGLviig/podcast.wav"}
