It highlights the key steps: query generation, prompt key similarity calculation, weighted prompt aggregation, vector quantization, gradient estimation for differentiability, and the use of representation statistics for stable learning. The overall process aims to optimize prompt selection and feature generation for continual learning tasks.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "ACCqGLviig/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: VQ-Prompt framework.
