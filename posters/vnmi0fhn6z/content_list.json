To provide theoretical insight, we build a nonlinear canonical circuit model consisting of recurrently connected E neurons and two types of I neurons including Parvalbumin (PV) and Somatostatin (SOM) neurons.

One obvious distinction is previous Bayesian circuit models haven\u2019t considered the rich diversity of neuronal types in the cortex, especially inhibitory interneurons. The canonical cortical microcircuit contains three major types of inhibitory (I) interneurons [20\u201324], including Parvalbumin (PV), Somatostatin (SOM), and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) neurons (Fig. 1A). These interneurons have different electrical properties, stimulus-tuning profiles, distinct connectivity, and synaptic modulations with other neurons. For example, PV neurons are weakly tuned to stimulus [20], and multiplicatively modulate E neurons in a way called divisive normalization by sending axons to E neurons\u2019 cell body [21, 22, 25, 26]. In contrast, SOM neurons are tuned to the stimulus, and module E neurons in an additive way via sending axons to the distal dendrites of E neurons [22, 25, 26]. Another gap comes from the nonlinearity of cortical circuit dynamics, which impedes the analytical understanding of circuits\u2019 Bayesian inference algorithms. Most earlier studies relied on numerical methods to analyze the algorithm in nonlinear circuits (e.g., [15\u201317, 19]), or considered linear neural dynamics to obtain analytical solutions (e.g., [12, 18, 27, 28]).

The E neurons receive internal Poisson-like variability mimicking stochastic spike generation, which provides a variability source to drive sampling [18]. For simplicity, the PV neurons in the model are not tuned to the stimulus as a limiting case of their weak tuning found in experiments [20], and provides global inhibition to E neurons via divisive normalization to ensure stability [21, 25]. In contrast, the SOM neurons have stimulus tunings and provide locally tuned inhibitory feedback to E neurons in an additive way [20, 29].

The computational mechanism of accelerated sampling by SOM neurons is similar to previous studies considering structured inhibitory feedback to E neurons (e.g., [14, 17, 53, 55]), while some notable differences exist. Earlier studies considered the sampling in neural response space where the posterior dimension is the same as the number of neurons [14, 17], whereas the current circuit samples in the stimulus feature manifold (subspace) in the neural response space. On the other hand, although other previous studies considered sampling in the stimulus feature manifold similar to the current model [53, 55], their structured inhibitory feedback comes from the biophysical mechanism within single neurons, e.g., spike frequency adaptation [53], and potassium channels [55]. From a neurobiology perspective, SOM neurons can be modulated by VIP neurons (Fig. 1A), whereas intracellular mechanisms are hardly modulated [53, 55], suggesting accelerated sampling from SOM neurons might be more flexible than single neuron mechanism in reality. Moreover, the proposed circuit model is similar to a recent one [18] in terms of utilizing internal Possion variability to draw samples. However, the current circuit model is nonlinear while the other study considered a linear circuit model [18].

Based on our current conclusion, it is likely that VIP neurons act as a \u201cknob\u201d to modulate the sampling speed, depending on task needs, by changing the activation level (\u201cgain\u201d) of SOM neurons. Moreover, we find the proposed canonical circuit stores a uniform stimulus prior, due to the homogeneity of neurons distributing on the stimulus manifold. The homogeneous neuron simplification has been widely used in neural coding and continuous attractor networks (e.g., [31, 34, 35, 56]), which simplifies the math analysis without altering results substantially. Nevertheless, the circuit has to break the neuronal homogeneity to store a non-uniform prior [57], and certainly, cortical neurons are heterogeneous. The neuronal heterogeneity can be realized by manipulating the translation-invariant recurrent connection matrix (Eq. 2), e.g., introducing randomness (zero mean with certain variance) on recurrent weight which has also been widely used in (chaotic) Excitation and Inhibition (E/I) balanced networks ([38\u201340, 58]). A potential function of heterogeneity from random recurrent weights is that this puts the spiking networks into the chaotic regime where the network internally generates Poisson variability, which is statistically equivalent to the injected multiplicative variability in our rate-based network (Eq. 1, last term). Moreover, the proposed circuit model only infers a static stimulus, and we will extend to infer a dynamic stimulus described by a hidden Markov model in the future.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
