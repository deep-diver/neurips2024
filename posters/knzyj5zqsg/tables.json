It shows the model used, the reference paper, whether the method provides an exact or approximate solution, the type of loss function and regularizer employed, whether it incorporates constraints, and the structure of the solution path.  The table demonstrates that existing methods are either tailored to specific models or rely on approximate solutions. The authors' proposed method is highlighted as a more general and exact approach with a piecewise smooth solution path.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "KNZYJ5zQsG/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Numerical results for average empirical coverage, average length of the conformal prediction set, and the total number of kinks observed. One standard error is given in the parenthesis following the average number.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of different methods for conformal prediction on several datasets.  The metrics shown are average empirical coverage (how often the true value falls within the predicted interval), average length of the prediction interval, and the number of kinks (points of non-smoothness) in the solution path of the method. Standard errors are provided to indicate the uncertainty of the estimates.  The methods compared include Grid1, Grid2, SCP (Split Conformal Prediction), and the authors' proposed 'Exact' method.", "section": "Numerical experiments"}]
