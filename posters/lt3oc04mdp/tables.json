It compares different configurations of the adapter, including variations in the inclusion of Layer Normalization (LN) layers, the attention mechanism, the Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and the linear layer. Each configuration is evaluated for its speedup ratio on the Spec-Bench benchmark, which measures the overall improvement in decoding speed.
