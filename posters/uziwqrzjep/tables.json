The table compares the performance of two approaches: using only a one-shot model (OS Only) and integrating an edit network with one-shot models (OS + Edit). The results show that the OS + Edit approach outperforms OS Only in all three domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating the edit network.", "section": "4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "uzIWqRzjEP/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study comparing our method against alternative formulations.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study conducted to evaluate the design choices of the proposed system.
