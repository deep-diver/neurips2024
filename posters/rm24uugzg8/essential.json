This is caused by distorted query-key embedding spaces where queries and keys are mapped into completely different spaces.  This paper analyzes this issue and highlights the significant performance limitations resulting from this problem.\nTo address this issue, the authors propose an auxiliary loss to align query and key spaces, promoting interaction between them. They also replace the undertrained learnable positional encoding with a fixed sinusoidal positional encoding. These methods effectively resolve the self-attention collapse problem, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency of camera pose estimation on various datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art models.", "affiliation": "Sungkyunkwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "rM24UUgZg8/podcast.wav"}
