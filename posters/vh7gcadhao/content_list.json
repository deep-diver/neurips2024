While an additional image (assuming co-visible sufficiently exciting textures across both images) allows one to triangulate unique points in space, a scale ambiguity exists with the absence of camera calibration, measurements from an additional sensor (e.g., range, initial), or a strong prior (e.g. a supervised training set). One may argue that, such additional information should already be available during data collection. Still, modern large-scale training [44, 67] often utilizes data from diverse sources with drastically diverse setups, making resolving the scale ambiguity issue crucial.

Hence, we hypothesize that language, in the form of text captions or descriptions, can be used to infer the scale of the 3D scene and to transform relative depth to metric depth. The choice of language also has practical value in that it does not require costly data acquisition with an additional synchronized and calibrated sensor (e.g., lidar, time-of-flight). With publicly available pre-trained panoptic segmentation or object detection models, image captioners, and vision-language models, one can automate the data acquisition, training, and inference process.

To this end, we assume access to a pre-trained scaleless monocular depth estimation model; aside from a set of images, we also assume text captions describing them.

Metric depth models learn to infer pixel-wise depth in metric scale (i.e. meters) by minimizing loss between depth predictions and ground-truth depth maps [2, 12, 26, 35, 55, 71, 79]. Each model typically applies to only one data domain in which it is trained, with similar camera parameters and object scales. Specifically, DORN [12] leverages a spacing-increasing discretization technique. AdaBins [2] partitions depth ranges into adaptive bins. NeWCRFs [71] uses neural window fully-connected CRFs to compute energy. When ground-truth depth is not available, self-supervised approaches [4, 11, 23, 27, 30, 38, 41, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61, 70, 74, 80, 81, 84, 86] rely on geometric constraints, where scale is attributed through lidar [10, 37, 40, 57, 56, 58, 63, 68], radar [47], binocular images [14, 17, 16], or inertials [20, 54].

However, due to the scale-ambiguity of multi-view photometric objective, such models are normally evaluated by aligning predictions to ground-truth at test time (typically median-scaling [16, 17, 86]), at the expense of practicality since ground-truth might not be feasible during real-world application. To enable generalization across different scenes, some (semi-) supervised depth models trained with single images adopt image-level normalization techniques to generate affine-invariant depth representations (i.e. relative depth) [24, 43, 44, 67, 73].

We present the first study exploring whether language, as an additional input modality, can resolve the scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation, an issue particularly relevant in the context of the recent trend towards large-scale mixed dataset training. We propose a framework, RSA, which learns to convert a scaleless (relative) depth map to metric depth using language descriptions as input. RSA utilizes the pre-trained CLIP encoder, and maps a language description of the image to scale and shift factors that transform the relative depth to metric depth. RSA is validated through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and three pre-trained relative depth models, demonstrating significant promise by drastically closing the gap between depth estimation accuracy and its upper bound (that relies on ground truth), validating the hypothesis that language carries valuable scale information that could be used to enhance depth estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate that a unified model trained on both indoor and outdoor datasets with diverse scene compositions generalizes across both scenarios, highlighting the robustness of language information in inferring scale. Finally, a zero-shot transfer experiment shows that the minimal domain gap of language description across scenes further generalizes to unseen data domains, without additional training. The generalizability of RSA stems of our choice of modality, language, which is invariant to nuisance variability that are present in images from lighting conditions and occlusions to specular reflectance and object deformations. Our results demonstrate that RSA is a viable choice to support relative to metric scale alignment for general-purpose monocular depth estimators. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and future work. We assume that the estimated 3D scene is up to an unknown scale. Although a simple global scale has proven effective, it may not always be sufficiently expressive for converting relative depth to absolute depth, especially when the relative depth is inaccurate. In such cases, global scaling may not adequately recover a high-fidelity metric-scaled depth map due to the presence of outliers. To address this, one may need to refine the relative depth outputted by general-purpose monocular depth estimators. Future research may include extending RSA to handle finer adjustments to also refine depth estimates and investigate the potential of inferring region-wise or even pixel-wise scales using language input. Lastly, while language boasts high ease of use, RSA is also vulnerable to malicious users who may choose captions to steer predictions incorrectly.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
