After an initial fragment vocabulary is constructed from an existing molecule library, two types of fragments are retrieved during generation.

After the generation, the molecule population and fragment vocabulary are updated with the newly generated molecule and its fragments, respectively. The exploration is further enhanced with genetic fragment modification, which also updates the fragment vocabulary and molecule population.", "description": "This figure illustrates the f-RAG framework.  It starts with an initial fragment vocabulary built from an existing molecule library.  During molecule generation, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: hard fragments (explicitly included in the new molecule) and soft fragments (implicitly guide the generation of new fragments).  A pre-trained molecular language model (SAFE-GPT) uses the hard fragments as input, with the soft fragment embeddings injected via a fragment injection module.  After generation, the model iteratively refines its fragment vocabulary and molecule population using the newly generated molecule and fragments, further enhanced by post-hoc genetic fragment modification.", "section": "Method"}, {"figure_path": "56Q0qggDlp/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Hard fragment retrieval of f-RAG.
