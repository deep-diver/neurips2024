Existing theoretical analyses rely on simplified assumptions about data distribution and model architecture, failing to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios where models are trained on finite datasets. This paper investigates the hidden properties of the learned score functions in diffusion models to gain insights into their generalizability. \nThe researchers employed a linear distillation approach to approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers with linear models.  They found that in the generalization regime, diffusion models exhibit an inductive bias towards learning Gaussian structures (characterized by empirical mean and covariance of training data). This bias is more pronounced when model capacity is relatively small compared to the dataset size and emerges in early training even in overparameterized models.  The study connects this Gaussian bias to the phenomenon of \"strong generalization\", where models trained on distinct datasets generate similar outputs.  **The findings challenge existing theoretical understandings and offer crucial insights for designing more efficient and generalizable diffusion models.**", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Sk2duBGvrK/podcast.wav"}
