Supervised methods plateau after processing a certain volume of data, while reinforcement learning (RL) methods require paired \"winner\" and \"loser\" images, often unavailable in real-world datasets. This creates limitations in aligning the model with human preferences and achieving optimal performance.\nThis paper introduces SPIN-Diffusion, a self-play fine-tuning technique. Unlike traditional methods, SPIN-Diffusion iteratively improves a model by competing against its previous versions. This self-competitive training process avoids the need for human preference data or paired images, enhancing both model performance and alignment. Experiments show SPIN-Diffusion outperforms existing supervised fine-tuning and RLHF-based approaches in human preference alignment and visual appeal, particularly with limited datasets. **The superior data-efficiency and performance make SPIN-Diffusion a valuable contribution to the field of generative AI.**", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "q3XavKPorV/podcast.wav"}
