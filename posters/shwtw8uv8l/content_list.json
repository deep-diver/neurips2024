The main reasons come from the lack of concern on the feature correlation during interaction, and the limited receptive field. To remedy these deficiencies, this paper presents a Dual-Stream Interactive Transformer (DSIT) design. Specifically, we devise a dual-attention interactive structure that embraces a dual-stream self-attention and a layer-aware dual-stream cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously capture intra-layer and inter-layer feature correlations. Meanwhile, the introduction of attention mechanisms can also mitigate the receptive field limitation. We modulate single-stream pre-trained Transformer embeddings with dual-stream convolutional features through cross-architecture interactions to provide richer semantic priors, thereby further relieving the ill-posedness of the problem.

Therefore, successfully separating the superimposed layers can, on the one hand, enhance the capability of models to serve downstream applications.

In the literature, two main routes of approaches have been delivered. One tendency (single-stream) is to treat the reflection layer as noise/degradation, merely modeling the transmission layer. Alternatively, the other rising trend (dual-stream) pays attention to the reconstruction quality of both the transmission and reflection layers. This work follows the latter principle because the reflection layer may also contain valuable information [43] and imposing constraints from both perspectives can better regularize the decomposition [22, 23].

Particularly, YTMT and DSRNet advocated dual-stream feature interactions to facilitate the information flow between the streams and finally reconstruct the decoupled layers. Though being effective, the interaction mechanisms used in these two methods do NOT explicitly assess the correlation between dual-stream features during interactions, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). More concretely, assuming we have dual-stream features at a certain stage in the networks, previous interaction strategies directly pass the undesired information at the current stage (may be required again at subsequent stages) from one branch to the other without checking if the passed information is needed by the sibling. Actually, in intermediate blocks, some information is very likely delivered back and forth, making the separation process ineffective and inefficient. In contrast, the attention mechanisms in Transformers assign small weights to token pairs with low similarities, which are further suppressed by the Softmax function. In other words, employing a cross-attention mechanism seems to have the potential for improving dual-stream interaction. Furthermore, due to the presence of correlated scenes in reflection superposition phenomena across entire images, the task demands a keen perception of global information in both streams. Motivated by the above analysis, we propose a strategy, called dual-attention interaction, consisting of a dual-stream self-attention and a dual-stream cross-attention, as depicted in Fig. 1 (c), to extract both the intra-layer and inter-layer feature correlations explicitly.

In this work, we argue that Transformers, thanks to their generalization and selective attention characteristics, should be more powerful to the target task. However, pre-trained Transformer models typically have trouble in dense prediction due to the lack of inductive biases [8]. To make Transformers suitable, we develop a Dual-Architecture Interactive Encoder (DAIE), which enables the interaction between semantically rich features extracted by a pre-trained Transformer and local dual-stream features extracted by a CNN. By this means, the Cross-Architecture Interactions (CAI) can balance the global and local perspectives and combine high-semantic priors with the low-semantic demands of the reflection separation.

Swin Transformer [35] introduced the shifted window attention mechanism, which reduced the computational cost of attention while incorporating inductive biases for images, inspiring a series of subsequent works. SwinIR [33] equipped residual-in-residual structures [46, 61] with the Swin Transformer block, exploring its capability in low-level vision tasks. ELAN [59] performed multiple window attentions of varying sizes in parallel and fused them, using grouped four-directional offset convolution layers for local feature extraction and cross-window association. Chen et al. [7] introduced an overlapping attention mechanism in their HAT model to establish cross-window connections and employed same-task pre-training for better performance. Zhang et al. proposed ART [58], which utilized a sparse window attention mechanism akin to dilated convolution, alternating it with window attention, thereby replacing the shifted window mechanism. UFormer [47] embedded window attention modules into a U-shaped network, which captured crosswindow associations beyond the current scale. Moreover, Restormer [55] introduced a transposed attention mechanism, resembling channel attention. While faster, this approach somewhat neglected spatial correlations. Retinexformer [5] employed this design for low-light image enhancement. DAT [9] alternated between window self-attention and window transposed self-attention to address spatial correlation deficiencies.

Although multiple-image solutions [37, 1, 16, 39, 30, 18, 38, 51, 53, 19] have shown satisfactory performance facing weaker ill-posedness, these methods typically rely on sequences of images captured with rotating polarizers or moving cameras, which limits their applicability.

ERRNet [48] aimed to expand the receptive field and utilized non-aligned images for data augmentation.

To harness high-quality priors from pre-trained Transformer models, we developed a dual-architecture interactive encoder, which can effectively fuse multi-source information with adaptive emphases. Additionally, we introduced a novel dual-attention interactive block that utilizes both an effective dual-stream self-attention mechanism and a layer-aware dualstream cross-attention module to separate the entangled features. Comprehensive experiments together with ablations have been conducted to verify the advances of our method. Looking forward, several interesting points deserve future exploration. For instance, larger vision foundation models can provide more substantial priors for low-level vision tasks. A relative position bias design tailored for a specific vision task will be also beneficial. Furthermore, our RefMix technique is likely to extend its beneftis to other data-hungry visual tasks. These considerations may inspire future research on low-level Transformer designs.

Among them, \u201cGPE-ResNet101\u201d, \u201cGPE-PVTv2-b4\u201d, and \u201cGPE-FocalNet-L\u201d show the effects of selecting different GPE models. ResNet101 provides limited global priors, thus exhibiting trivial performance. DSIT with PVTv2- b4 tends to concentrate on the wrong components during the layer decomposition due to a lack of inductive biases, producing unpleasant results. FocalNet-L replaces explicit query-key-value interactions with a focal modulation module. Although it shows merits over the former two settings, the lack of explicit information assessment limits its usability in our framework. The settings of \u201cCAIAdd\u201d and \u201cCAI-CrossAttn\u201d fail to effectively integrate global and local priors, resulting in inferior performance and misguided attention. \u201cDAIB-MLP FFN\u201d replaces the DSLP Block with MLP FFN, which also cannot separate the reflection successfully due to insufficient inductive biases. Moreover, we can observe that removing either attention mechanism in our dual-attention interaction design leads to appreciable performance degradation. Layered Relative Position Bias (LRPB) provides layer-aware attention initialization, while \u201cw/p LRPB\u201d loses the ability to separate reflections in some areas. As shown by \u201cw/o RefMix\u201d, specific reflection patterns can be hard to separate after eliminating the reflection mixup augmentation.
