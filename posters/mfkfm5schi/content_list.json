If the Pareto set or its approximation is small, it can be presented to a human decision maker or used in some other post-processing step. For many multi-criteria optimization problems, algorithms for computing the Pareto set have been developed (e.g., for the multi-criteria shortest path problem [19] and the bi-criteria network flow problem [48]) The running time of these algorithms is usually polynomial in the output size, i.e., they are efficient if the Pareto set is small. A drawback of this is that Pareto sets can often be of exponential size in the worst case. To obtain more efficient algorithms and to reduce the size of the output, approximate Pareto sets have been studied extensively. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis showed that there always exist approximate Pareto sets of polynomial size and they showed that an $\\alpha$ -approximate Pareto set [49] for a problem can be computed efficiently if and only if a certain variant of the problem, called the gap problem, can be solved efficiently.

However, for this to work we need to adapt the algorithm to cope with clusters instead of points. Similar to the adaption of the algorithm by Hochbaum and Shmoys the input now consists of clusters, and this needs to be taken into account when trying to cover them with balls.

We consider solutions that appear relatively early in the Pareto front because the geographic radius increases to 300 or even 350 kilometers relatively early on the Pareto front. Clusterings with such a large radius are not interesting because the air-line distance between Kiel (which lies in the north of Germany) and Munich (which lies in the south) is less than 700 kilometers, meaning that the solutions appearing later in the Pareto front cluster together districts that are far apart. In Subfigure 19b the 10-th Pareto solution is depicted. On the left the clusters are colored by the average income of the respective districts and on the right in colors that are easier to distinguish but have no intrinsic meaning. One can see that multiple clusters are next to each other that barely differ in their income which is not surprising because if the algorithm would cluster them together the geographic distance between the different parts of the cluster would get too large. At the same time we have some regions where two or more clusters basically cover the same geographic region and split up the districts depending on the respective median income in these districts. Despite all of this, the left image gives us a very good idea how the incomes differ in different regions of Germany. This is also interesting because the geographic radius of this clustering is roughly 196 kilometers and the maximum income difference between a district and its respective center is $463\\epsilon$ per month.

As expected for the income-based clustering the clusters are split up over the entirety of Germany. If one depicts them in the colors corresponding to the median income of the districts in the cluster, one basically ends up with a modified version of Figure 15 where the income levels have been discretized to 16 different levels. On the other hand, in the geography-based clustering districts with very different median income have been clustered together.

However at the same time, the clusters are a lot less compact often being split up into multiple regions or having holes in which the contained districts are part of another cluster.
