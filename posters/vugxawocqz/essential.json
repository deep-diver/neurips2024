Existing IRL methods often struggle with continuous state and action spaces, lacking theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.  This work addresses these limitations, particularly the challenge of infinite-dimensional linear programs that arise in continuous settings. \nThe paper tackles this by using linear function approximators and a randomized (scenario) approach.  This allows for deriving approximate solutions and providing probabilistic guarantees on the approximation error.  The authors also address the more realistic case with finite samples, providing error bounds for situations where only limited expert demonstrations and generative models are available.  The work significantly advances the theoretical foundations and practical capabilities of IRL in continuous spaces.", "affiliation": "EPFL, Switzerland", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VUgXAWOCQz/podcast.wav"}
