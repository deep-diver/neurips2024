Our evaluations highlighted the spatiotemporal decoding model's superior performance, evidenced by high feature correlations with deep layers of pre-trained AlexNet. Spatial and spatiotemporal occlusion analyses provided insights into the contributions of different brain regions and time windows, affirming the hierarchical nature of visual processing. The end-to-end inverse retinotopic mapping facilitated accurate estimation of receptive fields, aligning with neurophysiological findings and enhancing model transparency.
