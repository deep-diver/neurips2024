The 'H-M' column indicates the number of harmful shifts detected by the mean detector, while the 'H-Q' column represents the number detected by the quantile detector. The data shows that the quantile detector identifies a considerably larger number of harmful shifts than the mean detector across all datasets.", "section": "5.2 Synthetic Shifts on Tabular Datasets"}, {"figure_path": "jps9KkuSD3/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of detection methods on Folktables data.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the performance of quantile and mean detection methods on the Folktables dataset.  It shows the power (the probability of correctly identifying a harmful shift), the false discovery proportion (FDP, the rate of false positives), and the mean detection time (the average time it takes to detect a harmful shift) for each method. The results demonstrate that the quantile detector outperforms the mean detector in terms of power and FDP while maintaining a reasonable mean detection time.", "section": "5.3 Natural Shifts on a Tabular Dataset"}, {"figure_path": "jps9KkuSD3/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison of Power and FDP metrics for Detectron and SHSD across different OOD sizes.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the performance of Detectron and the proposed SHSD method in detecting harmful distribution shifts, across different sizes of out-of-distribution (OOD) data.  The comparison is made using two key metrics: Power (the ability to correctly detect a shift when it occurs) and FDP (False Discovery Proportion, the rate of incorrectly flagging a shift when none is present).  The results show that for smaller OOD sizes, Detectron exhibits high FDP while the SHSD method shows no detection ability. However, as the OOD size increases, SHSD method demonstrates superior performance in detecting shifts, maintaining a low FDP while showing increasingly high Power,  outperforming Detectron which shows high power at the cost of also having high FDP.", "section": "F Evaluations in Batch Setting"}]
