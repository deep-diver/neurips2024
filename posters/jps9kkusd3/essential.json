Existing methods for detecting these harmful shifts often require access to labeled data, which is usually unavailable in production settings, thus making them impractical.  This creates a significant challenge for ensuring the reliability and safety of deployed AI systems.\nThis paper presents a novel approach to tackle this problem. It introduces a label-free method that uses a proxy for true model error (derived from a secondary error estimation model) and a sequential statistical test to monitor changes in the error rate over time. The method effectively balances the detection power and false alarm rate while not needing to explicitly access labels in production, a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art solutions.  The experimental findings demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various types of distribution shifts and diverse datasets.", "affiliation": "J.P.
