Existing methods for generating virtual MSAs have limitations in capturing intricate co-evolutionary patterns or require guidance from external models. This leads to compromised prediction accuracy, particularly for proteins with insufficient homologous sequences. \nThe paper introduces MSAGPT, a novel approach that uses generative pre-training to generate virtual MSAs for prompting protein structure predictions. MSAGPT incorporates a 2D evolutionary positional encoding scheme and a 1D MSA decoding framework, facilitating zero- or few-shot learning.  **Furthermore, it leverages feedback from AlphaFold2 to enhance the model's capacity and reduce hallucinations.**  Extensive experiments demonstrate MSAGPT's ability to generate faithful virtual MSAs, improving structure prediction accuracy significantly, especially in low-MSA scenarios.  **The transfer learning capabilities showcased highlight its potential for various protein-related tasks.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "pPeXYByHNd/podcast.wav"}
