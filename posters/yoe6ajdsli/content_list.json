Existing AUC maximization methods usually assume that training and test distributions are identical. However, this assumption is often violated in practice due to a positive distribution shift, where the negative-conditional density does not change but the positive-conditional density can vary. This shift often occurs in imbalanced classification since positive data are often more diverse or time-varying than negative data. To deal with this shift, we theoretically show that the AUC on the test distribution can be expressed by using the positive and marginal training densities and the marginal test density. Based on this result, we can maximize the AUC on the test distribution by using positive and unlabeled data in the training distribution and unlabeled data in the test distribution. The proposed method requires only positive labels in the training distribution as supervision. Moreover, the derived AUC has a simple form and thus is easy to implement.

In this case, classification accuracy, which is the standard performance measure for ordinary binary classification, is not a suitable measure [54, 61]. Instead, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is commonly used [4, 19]. The AUC is the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly drawn positive instance higher than a randomly drawn negative one [61]. Due to the nature of the ranking, the AUC can adequately measure the performance of the classifier even with imbalanced data. By maximizing the AUC, we can obtain accurate classifiers even from imbalanced data [5, 61, 64, 32, 65].

However, in real-world applications, this assumption is often violated due to distribution shifts. This paper considers a positive distribution shift [16], i.e., the negative-conditional density does not change but the positive-conditional density can vary, because this shift often occurs in imbalanced problems. For example, in intrusion detection, malicious adversaries rapidly change their attacks (positive data) to bypass detection systems while the benign class\u2019s data (negative data) do not change much [9, 16, 67]. In medical diagnosis, the distribution of disease data (positive data) can change due to the disease progression or emergence of new pathogens, but the distribution of data of healthy people is generally stable. In visual inspection, the types of anomalous products (positive data) are diverse but normal ones (negative data) have some degree of stationarity.

One representative approach is to learn domain-invariant feature representations by minimizing the discrepancy of the features in both domains [33, 53, 52, 13, 27, 11, 48]. Although this approach is promising, it often deteriorates the performance since it minimizes only the feature discrepancy without considering the relationship between features and labels [70]. Another representative approach is to explicitly minimize the loss on the test distribution by assuming the types of the distribution change, such as covariate shift [50, 3, 23, 69, 35] and class-prior shift [68, 51, 1]. The proposed method belongs to this approach. By assuming the shift type, this approach can adapt to the shift in a theoretically guaranteed manner. The existing methods aim to minimize the classification risk (or negative classification accuracy), which is an inappropriate metric for imbalanced data (e.g., if the imbalanced data ratio is $1:99$ , a naive classifier that classifies \u2018every\u2019 instance as negative has $99\\%$ accuracy, but it is definitely not a good classifier). One domain adaptation method tries to maximize the AUC by learning domain-invariant feature representations [62]. However, this method is not designed for the positive distribution shift.

Although they are effective, they cannot maximize the AUC.

Due to the pairwise formulation of the AUC, their methods that use ordinary instance-wise loss functions such as the cross-entropy loss cannot be applied to the AUC. In addition, the method for the positive distribution shift [16] requires the class-prior on the test distribution, which is generally difficult to know with unlabeled data in the test distribution.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
