In this paper, we take a step forward to close the gap between the linear and Softmax attention with novel theoretical analyses, which demystify the core factors behind the performance deviations. Specifically, we present two key perspectives to understand and alleviate the limitations of linear attention: the injective property and the local modeling ability.

Larger window sizes lead to larger receptive fields, typically associated with improved performance. However, the results show that the model performance does not improve with increasing window sizes. We believe this can be attributed to the insufficient local modeling capability: a small window size restricts the receptive field but introduces strong local bias, enhancing local modeling, while a large window size enlarges the receptive field but further diminishes local modeling ability. To validate this, we apply InLine attention with local residual and present the results in the right table. Significant improvements can be observed upon the introduction of the local residual term.

On the contrary, InLine-Swin-T with linear complexity even exhibits higher speed with larger windows. This may be due to the reduction in the latency caused by the window partition.

Guidelines: ", "page_idx": 22}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n\u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.   \n\u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.   \n\u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
