We mainly attribute the efficiency of DEPICT to its removal of the FFN block, which plays no role in our interpretations. Such a redundancy has been observed empirically in the field of NLP [31]. but our ablation study in Appendix C shows that naively adopting MSSA while removing the FFN from Segmenter results in worse performance. Moreover, [14] proves that pure attention causes the rank of tokens to decrease rapidly with depth, which is desirable for us to construct an ideal principal subspace. In particular, according to [35], both a finer segmentation granularity and a more performant backbone can significantly boost segmentation performance, partly explaining the inferiority of DEPICT compared to MaskFormer. In Table 2, we find that PICT performs slightly worse than Segmenter. We believe that this is due to the limited size of the dataset; the training set sizes of ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal Context are about 20K, 3K and 5K, respectively.

Furthermore, we measure the robustness of DEPICT under four types of parameter perturbations and find that DEPICT is surprisingly robust whereas Segmenter collapses, as shown in Table 4. We attribute the robustness of DEPICT to its awareness of and modeling for low-dimensional subspaces, which are not significantly altered under the parameter perturbations. Actually, the seminal work [36] has already noticed that it is the subspace, rather than individual units, that contains the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks.

To this end, we extended the objectives of PCA to construct an ideal principal subspace and to find a low-rank approximation of image embeddings as classifiers. By unrolling the optimization procedure of these objectives, we derived a family of fully attentional white-box decoders, called DEPICT, providing theoretical interpretations for the empirical designs of the Transformer decoders. Experiments conducted on ADE20K have shown that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, using significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs.

There are four parameter matrices in MHSA. Nevertheless, due to parameter sharing, our MSSA has only one parameter matrix, $_{P}$ , and a learnable scalar, $\\alpha$ , as the step size. The original MSSA, however, adopts an additional learnable parameter matrix for simplicity of implementation [42]. For image classification, MSSA-based models lag slightly behind MHSA [42, 40], whereas our work demonstrates its superiority for Transformer-based semantic segmentation. Following the idea of $\\mathbf{MCR^{2}}$ , despite decoupling its heads from classes, the original MSSA still models a homogeneous subspace in each head; in other words, these heads still correspond to some more basic or finer-grained concepts than classes. However, each head of our MSSA models a heterogeneous subspace, since its bases are likely related to several different classes.

This couples each class with merely one principal direction within an image. However, an image typically contains a small part of all predefined classes and each class allows rich intra-class variance, thus requiring more than one principal directions to represent itself. Therefore, it is rather natural to generalize to mask classification on the basis of our interpretations. Moreover, it is desirable to segment images at a finer granularity than patches\u2014down to the pixel level\u2014by similarly adopting a pixel decoder. However, this requires interactions among features at different scales, whereas our current work is limited to non-hierarchical features.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
