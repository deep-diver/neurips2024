Existing methods often rely on gradient tracking, neglecting other techniques, and use identical strategies for upper and lower levels. These limitations lead to slow convergence and suboptimal performance.\nSPARKLE, a novel framework, addresses these issues by offering flexibility in choosing heterogeneity-correction strategies (e.g., EXTRA, Exact Diffusion) and update strategies for different optimization levels.  It presents a unified convergence analysis, proving state-of-the-art convergence rates. Experiments demonstrate SPARKLE's superior performance over existing methods, particularly with EXTRA and Exact Diffusion, highlighting the benefits of mixed strategies.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "g5DyqerUpX/podcast.wav"}
