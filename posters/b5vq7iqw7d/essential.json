Existing CL approaches struggle to balance both effectively.  This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel perspective focusing on model parameter sensitivity.  Excessive sensitivity causes significant forgetting and overfitting. \nThis paper proposes Model Sensitivity Aware Continual Learning (MACL), which addresses CL by optimizing model performance considering the worst-case parameter distribution within a neighborhood.  This innovative approach mitigates drastic prediction changes under small parameter updates, thus reducing forgetting.  Simultaneously, it enhances new task performance by preventing overfitting.  Empirical results show MACL achieves superior performance in retaining old knowledge and learning new tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art CL methods, demonstrating its effectiveness, efficiency, and versatility.", "affiliation": "University of Maryland College Park", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Continual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "B5vQ7IQW7d/podcast.wav"}
