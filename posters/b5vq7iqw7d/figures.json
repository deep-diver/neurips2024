Four methods are compared: DER++, DER++ with the proposed MACL method, GPM, and GPM with MACL.  The x-axis represents the task sequence (1-10), and the y-axis represents the new task test accuracy (%). The plot shows how the new task accuracy changes as new tasks are introduced during continual learning for each method.  The results indicate that integrating MACL with existing methods (DER++ and GPM) significantly improves the new task performance.", "section": "5.2 Results"}]
