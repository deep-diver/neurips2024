Existing domain adaptation methods require extensive interactions with real environments and are thus impractical in safety-critical applications. Offline domain calibration provides a more promising approach but suffers from low sample efficiency due to reliance on evolutionary algorithms. \nThis paper introduces Madoc, a multi-agent domain calibration framework. Madoc formulates domain calibration as a cooperative multi-agent RL problem, leveraging a variational autoencoder to cluster similar parameters and a bandit RL objective to match target trajectory distributions.  Experiments on locomotion tasks demonstrate Madoc's superior performance, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness over other offline and hybrid online-offline approaches.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hkBhX5ABjk/podcast.wav"}
