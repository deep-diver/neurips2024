Existing active learning methods typically assume access to the entire domain, making them impractical for many real-world tasks. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing **transductive active learning**, where data collection is limited to a sample space while prediction targets reside in a potentially larger target space. This approach is more realistic for settings with constraints and limitations on data acquisition.\nThis paper presents a novel theoretical framework for transductive active learning, demonstrating its effectiveness through mathematical proofs.  It shows that the proposed method, **under general regularity assumptions**, converges to the smallest attainable uncertainty.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of transductive active learning is validated through experiments on active fine-tuning of large neural networks and safe Bayesian optimization, showcasing **state-of-the-art performance** in both applications.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "tZtepJBtHg/podcast.wav"}
