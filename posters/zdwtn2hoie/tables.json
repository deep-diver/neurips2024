It categorizes these methods by problem type (e.g., Shapley value attribution, data valuation), context and output domains (representing input and output spaces), and computational approach (analytic, per-example optimization, regression-based amortization, or objective-based amortization). The table highlights the prevalence of amortization in addressing computationally expensive tasks within XML and reveals opportunities for new applications.", "section": "A Extended Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "ZdWTN2HOie/tables/tables_41_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of amortized methods in XML.", "description": "This table summarizes various amortized methods used in Explainable Machine Learning (XML).
