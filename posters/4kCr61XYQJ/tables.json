Two metrics are used to evaluate the models: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Relative Error (MRE). Each metric is evaluated for both data smoothing and forecasting tasks. The results are presented as the mean and standard deviation across multiple runs of the Gibbs sampling algorithm.  The models compared are GP-DPFA, GMC-RATE, GMC-HIER, BGAR, PGDS, and three variants of NS-PGDS, each using a different Dirichlet Markov chain construction.", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
