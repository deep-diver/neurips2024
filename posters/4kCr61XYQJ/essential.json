Traditional Poisson-Gamma Dynamical Systems (PGDS) struggle with such data because they assume these relationships are constant. This limits their ability to accurately model and predict real-world events.\nThis paper introduces Non-stationary Poisson-Gamma Dynamical Systems (NS-PGDS), a new model that overcomes this limitation.  **NS-PGDS uses a flexible method called Dirichlet Markov chains to allow the relationships between variables to change over time.**  The authors develop an efficient algorithm to estimate the model parameters.  Their experiments show that NS-PGDS significantly improves predictive performance compared to existing methods on several real-world datasets.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4kCr61XYQJ/podcast.wav"}
