This often results in suboptimal performance due to data scarcity in a single modality and lack of synergy between different visual data types.  Moreover, existing joint image-video tokenizers often train separate models for each modality, failing to capture the true synergy between them. \nOmniTokenizer tackles these issues with a transformer-based architecture that integrates window and causal attention for spatial-temporal modeling, enabling joint image-video tokenization.  **A progressive training strategy** is introduced where the tokenizer is first pre-trained on images before joint training with video data, capitalizing on the complementary nature of both modalities.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction performance** across various image and video datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  **Integration with language model-based and diffusion models further reveals superior visual synthesis capabilities**, highlighting the versatility of OmniTokenizer.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Key Lab of Intell.
