OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by $13\\%$ and $26\\%$ , respectively.

In recent years, visual generation approaches have emerged as two dominant paradigms: language model-based methods [54, 12, 66, 48] and diffusion models [17, 45]. The former exploits the superior sequence modeling capability of language models (LMs) [36, 37, 52] for visual generation by formulating it as a next-token prediction process, while the latter gradually transforms noise into coherent visual structures through a carefully crafted reverse diffusion process.

Although MAGVITv2 [67] have explored causal 3D convolution to process both modalities, they still have to train separate models for the image and video data, without achieving the synergy between them. This work highlights the critical need for a joint image-video tokenizer with two primary considerations: firstly, a joint image-video tokenizer enables joint learning from image and video data [59], which mitigates the scarcity of data in a single modality (particularly video data) and facilitates the tokenizer to learn more general representations. In addition, a unified tokenization framework inherently enjoys better versatility and scalability. For instance, its performance can be improved by incorporating the data from either modality for training.

Complementing the model design, we introduce a progressive training strategy that begins with image pretraining on a fixed resolution to establish a fundamental understanding of static visual information.

We conduct experiments on both image and video reconstruction using different attention variants to fully analyze its effect. As can be seen in Table 8, window attention outperforms plain attention for image reconstruction (ImageNet) since it incorporates the local modeling. While for video reconstruction (K600), using causal or not has little influence on the performance (Table 9), but causal attention is necessary since we train the following image or video generation transformer in an autoregressive manner.
