Classical algorithms for solving such problems are computationally expensive, especially when the function is stochastic (meaning that it involves randomness). This paper focuses on a specific type of minimum called the (\u03b4,\u03b5)-Goldstein stationary point. Finding such points efficiently is challenging, especially in high dimensions (d). \nThis research proposes novel quantum algorithms to address these challenges. These algorithms use quantum computation to estimate the gradient of a smoothed version of the objective function and then use these estimates to find the (\u03b4,\u03b5)-Goldstein stationary point. The main contribution lies in **achieving improved query complexity**, meaning that the algorithms need to make fewer queries to the function value oracle compared to classical methods.  The improved complexity is particularly significant in the dependence on the accuracy parameter (\u03b5).  **The quantum algorithms outperform classical methods** by a significant factor in the dependence on \u03b5, demonstrating the clear advantages of using quantum techniques for non-convex, non-smooth optimization.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "wsGzvhnoaX/podcast.wav"}
