This is a significant departure from traditional smooth optimization techniques, **requiring specialized algorithms** to handle points where the gradient is undefined or discontinuous. The difficulty stems from the inherent complexity of such functions, as standard gradient-based methods fail to converge reliably.  **Key areas of focus** often include subdifferential calculus (generalizing the gradient concept), smoothing techniques (approximating non-smooth functions with smooth ones), and specialized iterative schemes that leverage proximal operators or cutting plane methods.  **Applications span various fields**, encompassing machine learning (e.g., robust regression), image processing, and control theory, where real-world problems often exhibit non-smooth characteristics due to noise, constraints, or discontinuities in the data or model."}}, {"heading_title": "Quantum Algorithm", "details": {"summary": "The research paper explores the development of quantum algorithms for tackling non-smooth, non-convex optimization problems.
