Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR\u2019s performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR\u2019s state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.

Furthermore, it bolsters downstream vision tasks like object detection, recognition, and tracking [74, 60].

The input image is treated as a regular grid of pixels in the Euclidean space for CNNs (Fig. 1(a)) or a sequence of patches for MLPs and ViTs (Fig. 1(b)). However, degraded inputs usually contain irregular and complex objects. While these choices perform admirably in scenarios with regular or well-organized object boundaries, they have limitations when applied to degraded images with more flexible and complex geometrical contexts. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Additionally, CNNs struggle to model long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive field (Fig. 1(a)). In contrast, MLPs and ViTs can capture long-range relations effectively, although at the cost of losing inductive bias and incurring a heavy computational burden, i.e., quadratic complexity increases with higher input resolution[82, 84, 20, 70]. To address these limitations, recent IR methods have explored strategies for complexity reduction. A common approach is to implement MSA within local image regions [53, 50]. For example, SwinIR [50] and GRL [48] employ full MSA or regionfixed anchored stripe MSA, but they still struggle with irregular object connections. Furthermore, prior research [111] highlights that smooth image content is more prevalent than complex image details, underscoring the need for distinct treatment based on semantic content. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, SemanIR, to address the limitations above. Specifically, within each transformer stage, we first construct a key-semantic dictionary, which stores only the top-k semantically related relations for each given degraded patch with the $\\mathrm{k\\cdot}$ -nearest neighbors (i.e., KNN) algorithm. Then, the attention operation within each transformer layer occurs only among the top-k patches. This design brings two main advantages, i.e., 1) Each degraded patch benefits from its semantically similar patches, typically containing comparable contextual or textural information, while excluding the side effects from other patches that contain entirely unrelated information. 2) Compared to the conventional window-wise attention, which built a dense connection between all the patches (Fig. 1(c)) that leads to highly computationally demanding, or a sparse but position-fixed manner (Fig. 1(d)) which introduces irrelevant semantics. Our key-semantic connection (Fig. 1(e)) leads to a sparse yet more meaningful attention operation, which allows our method to achieve the same receptive field as previous ViTs-based methods while maintaining lower computational costs. This is not like previous token merging or pruning methods [6, 91, 69] that may merge unrelated information or prune some semantically related information. In addition, to make the proposed method more efficient, instead of creating a key-semantic dictionary for each transformer layer, we create it just once at the beginning of each transformer stage and then share it with all the following transformer layers within the same stage. This not only largely reduced the computation burden but also made our methods different from other token pruning and merging methods [106, 89, 107], which include dynamic patch skipping/selection within each attention layer or involve an additional offset generation network. Meanwhile, merging or pruning tokens will lead to a loss of information in corresponding patches, which is not preferred in image restoration [85]. In addition, such a sharing strategy allows each degraded patch to be continuously optimized by its semantically related patches within each stage.

Initially, IR was addressed through model-based solutions, involving the search for solutions to specific formulations. However, learning-based approaches have gained much attention with the significant advancements in deep neural networks. Numerous approaches have been developed, including regression-based [51, 41, 50, 48, 104] and generative model-based pipelines [25, 87, 56, 92]. In this paper, we propose a regression-based method for image restoration. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Non-Local Priors Modeling in IR. Tradition model-based IR methods reconstruct the image by regularizing the results (e.g., Tikhonov regularization [27]) with formulaic prior knowledge of natural image distribution. However, it is challenging for these methods to recover realistic detailed results with hand-designed priors. Besides, some other classic method finds that self-similarity is an effective prior, which leads to an impressive performance [7, 17]. Apart from traditional methods, the non-local prior has also been utilized in modern deep learning networks [86, 48, 109], typically captured by the self-attention mechanism. More recently, the overwhelming success of transformers [84] in the natural language processing domain [35] and the classic vision community [20, 8, 81, 90, 10] has led to the development of numerous ViT-based IR methods. These methods aim to enhance the learning ability for modeling non-local priors [50, 93, 48, 14, 15, 98] and consequently archives better performance. Meanwhile, this raises a question: are all non-local priors essential for IR? ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Key-Semantic Non-local Prior Exploration for IR. To answer the question, we found many methods demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling key semantics within ViTs. For example, KiT [43] proposed increasing the non-local connectivity between patches at different positions through KNN matching. This approach aims to better capture the non-local relations between the base patch and other patches in each attention calculation. However, it results in significant additional computational costs due to the KNN matching. DRSformer [13] proposed a top- $\\cdot\\mathbf{k}$ selection strategy that chooses the most relevant tokens to model the non-local priors for draining after each self-attention calculation without reducing the computation complexity, since after each attention calculation, the DRSFormer utilized (mask, top-k, scatter) operations at each transformer layer. Consequently, this inevitably increases the computation cost. Similar conclusions can be also drawn from the graph perspective solutions [28, 73, 61, 32] for various IR tasks, like facial expression restoration [54], image denoising [77], and artifact reduction [61]. [32] construct the graph with transformer-based architecture where each patch is connected to all other patches. All these methods suggest that if the semantically related information can be addressed, the degraded image can be restored with better performance. However, the efficiency issue, which is extremely unignorable, remains untouched within the aforementioned methods. It is particularly crucial for ViTs-based image restoration methods, which often need to address high-resolution degraded input images. LaViT [107] reduces computational costs by storing attention scores from a few initial layers and reusing them in subsequent layers. However, this approach does not change the computation cost of attention itself; it merely reuses previously computed scores. In this paper, we propose sharing key semantics within each transformer stage, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness through experimental and theoretical analysis. Our method, SemanIR, reduces computation in both training and inference by using a semantic dictionary to fliter out irrelevant patches during training and optimizing attention operations with Triton kernels during inference.

(3) The randomly sampled strategy has a very stable and better performance compared to the fixed top- $\\cdot\\mathbf{k}$ manner especially when the inference $k$ is fixed to a small number (i.e., 64, 128, 256). We conclude that a random sampled strategy is more general and stable. It can also make the inference process more flexible regarding different computation resources. Meanwhile, we set a query region in the input and provided a detailed comparison from the attention-based activation map together with the input query region in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) shows the query region input. Fig. 4(b) displays the activation map generated using standard attention mechanisms. Fig. 4(c-f) illustrate activation maps using our key-semantic dictionary with different $k$ values ([8, 16, 64, 256]) during inference. The comparisons indicate that increasing $k$ allows for connections to more semantically related regions. However, when $k$ is set too high (e.g., $k=256$ as shown in Fig. 4(f)), the activation map may include some semantically unrelated regions. This aligns with the findings and the results depicted in Fig 3, where increasing the $k$ beyond a certain point (e.g., from 396 to 512) does not further improve PSNR. More ablation results can be found in our Appx. D about the effect of the noise level and quality factor for denoising and JPEG CAR.

With the increase of the window size, the semantic relevant information for each token is increased, thus leading to a PSNR gain for different IR tasks. For gray image denoising, larger window sizes lead to improved PSNR performance, consistently yielding higher PSNR values across different datasets. Similarly, in color image denoising, larger window sizes also result in better outcomes. For example, in the McMaster dataset, the PSNR increases from $33.20\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ with a window size of 8 to 33.38 dB with a window size of 32.

Specifically, to capture the key semantics, we propose to construct a semantic dictionary (i.e., naively by self-similarity is enough) for storing only the most related $k$ semantic information and then use it as a reference for guiding the attention operation for making the attention operation pay more attention only to these key semantics. Furthermore, we share the key-semantic dictionary with all the upcoming transformer layers within the same stage since each stage of the transformer is typically at the same semantic level. This strategy significantly reduces the computational cost for IR and functions as loop optimization, continuously restoring degraded patches with their most semantically related patches, which share similar texture or structural information. Extensive experiments on 6 IR tasks validated the effectiveness of SemanIR, demonstrating that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

It constrains the utility of the trained networks. A potential future enhancement involves developing a mechanism enabling a network to handle diverse image degradation types and levels. Another challenge is the substantial parameter requirement of the proposed SemanIR, which operates within a tens-of-millions parameter budget.
