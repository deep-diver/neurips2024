Content editing is facilitated by modifying the first frame, while the trajectory-based motion control offers an intuitive user interaction experience.

Based on these base models, extensive works explore how to transfer their generation capabilities to video editing. Early works based on text-to-image diffusion models implement video editing through zero-shot strategies (e.g., Fate-Zero [36], Flatten [11]) or one-shot tuning (e.g., Tune-A-Video [51]). However, these methods are limited by excessive manual design and a lack of video generation priors. Moreover, text prompt only provide coarse condition, limiting the editing accuracy. Compared to text, more recent methods adopt image conditions which can provide more accurate editing guidance. For instance, VideoComposer [47] generates style-transformed videos by providing spatial attributes (e.g., edge, depth) of the target video and a style reference. DreamVideo [49] and Make-a-protagonist [62] can modify a specific object in the video by providing a reference object. However, these methods still struggle with local editing and introducing new elements, such as adding new objects to a video. Recent work EVE [42] proposes a diffusion distillation strategy to achieve video editing while keeping unedited content unchanged. Nevertheless, the editing region and target are controlled by text, which is challenging in complex scenarios. AnyV2V [26] edit a video by modifying the first frame, enabling accurate customization of local content. Pika [1] can regenerate a specific area in the video by selecting an editing region.

In the community of image generation, some notable works, such as Stable Diffusion [39], Imagen [40], and DALL-E2 [38], utilize text as the generation condition. To achieve accurate generation control, some methods, e.g., ControlNet [58] and T2I-Adapter [34], propose adding control modules on pre-trained diffusion models. Similarly, initial efforts in controllable video generation concentrate on the text condition, such as Video LDM [5], Imagen Video [18], VideoCrafter [8], and AnimateDiff [17]. Recognizing the limitations of text prompts in capturing complex scenarios, some recent works [4, 54, 59, 13] leverage image conditions for a more direct approach. External control modules on pre-trained foundation models are also popular in controllable video generation. Such as video ControlNet [9, 60] extends the ControlNet [58] in image generation to video generation conditioned on a sequence of control signals, like edge maps and depth maps. In addition to spatial structure control, precise temporal motion control is also important in controllable video generation. This process is similar to the drag-based image editing [35, 32, 33]. Several recent works study this topic, such as video generation with trajectory-based motion guidance (e.g., DragNUWA [57], MotionCtrl [48], Motion-I2V [41], DragAnything [52]) and generation with box-based motion guidance (e.g., TrailBlazer [29], Boximator [44], [20]).

For instance, the prior work Tune-AVideo [51] overftis some diffusion model parameters to a specific video. Then, it uses the overftiting parameters to produce the editing result conditioned on the target prompt. To enable a cohesive global appearance among edited frames, many methods extend the attention module of Stable Diffusion [39] to encompass multiple frames and conduct cross-frame attention. For instance, Pix2Video [7] edits the first frame and performs cross-frame attention of each frame on the first frame to preserve appearance consistency. TokenFlow [15] and Fairy [50] jointly edit a few key frames at each denoising step and propagate them throughout the video based on the nearest-neighbor field extracted from the original video. Inspired by the initial zero-shot image editing method SDEdit [31], the recent video foundation model SORA [6] achieves video editing by adding noise to the input video and then denoising it under the target description.

The text alignment is obtained by calculating the average CLIP cosine similarity between each frame and editing description. Temporal consistency is computed by average CLIP cosine similarity between every pair of consecutive frames. We employ PSNR [43] to measure the reconstruction quality of unedited content. The human evaluation considers two aspects, i.e., overall video quality, and whether the editing target is achieved.

Therefore, we optimize a part of the parameters to maintain the prior of local motion control. Experiments show that fine-tuning spatial layers still triggers the ignoring of motion control.

In this new task, We find a coupling problem between unedited content and motion customization. Directly training these two control conditions on the video generation model will cause the ignoring of motion control. To address this issue, we develop a three-stage training strategy to combine these two conditions coarse to fine. In addition, we design a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module to further decouple unedited content and motion-customized content in different diffusion sampling steps and spatial locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReVideo has promising performance on several accurate video editing applications, i.e., (1) locally changing video content while keeping the motion constant, (2) keeping content unchanged and customizing new motion trajectories, (3) modifying both content and motion trajectories.
