Specifically, we use this tiny Lever-LM to configure effective in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences to improve the In-Context Learinng (ICL) performance of LVLMs. Previous studies show that diverse ICD configurations like the selection and ordering of the demonstrations heavily affect the ICL performance, highlighting the significance of configuring effective ICD sequences. Motivated by this and by re-considering the the process of configuring ICD sequence, we find this is a mirror process of human sentence composition and further assume that effective ICD configurations may contain internal statistical patterns that can be captured by LeverLM. Then a dataset with effective ICD sequences is constructed to train Lever-LM. After training, given novel queries, new ICD sequences are configured by the trained Lever-LM to solve vision-language tasks through ICL. Experiments show that these ICD sequences can improve the ICL performance of two LVLMs compared with some strong baselines in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, validating that Lever-LM can really capture the statistical patterns for levering LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ForJadeForest/Lever-LM.

This achievement in NLP has inspired researchers to similarly enhance Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with ICL capabilities [13, 14]. However, just as in NLP, the effectiveness of ICL in LVLMs is significantly influenced by the configurations of ICDs, such as their selection and ordering [15\u201323].

While these methods have shown improvements, their application remains largely confined to NLP and is less explored in the vision-language domain. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the independent operations of retrieval and reordering often result in sub-optimal outcomes. A critical reconsideration of the ICD sequence generation reveals that configuring an optimal ICD sequence should be a coherent process. Instead of independently selecting and re-ordering, each ICD should be chosen conditionally based on the previous ICDs. This mirrors the sequential nature of human sentence composition, where each word is sequentially selected to ensure overall fluency. Such fluency can be characterized by temporal statistical patterns, which allows the design of statistical learning methods to model and learn from data, where Language Model is one typical technique that demonstrates the effectiveness. This analogy supports the hypothesis that optimal ICD sequences may contain inherent temporal statistical patterns.

This is because recently proposed LVLMs [13, 14, 33] use continuous image patches rather than the tokenized discrete elements as the vision input, rendering these techniques used in NLP inapplicable in VL and the following two questions remain unaddressed: (1) whether effective VL ICDs exhibit certain statistical patterns and (2) whether such patterns can be leveraged to compose new ICD sequences for a given query. This study aims to address these questions. Specifically, we employ a tiny Language Model, e.g., a Transformer, to capture the inherent statistic patterns.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
