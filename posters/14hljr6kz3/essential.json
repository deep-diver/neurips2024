Existing prompt-learning methods address this by learning both domain-invariant and specific features using domain-agnostic and domain-specific prompts. However, these methods typically rely on constraints in representation, output, or prompt space, potentially hindering learning. \nThis paper tackles the problem by proposing Prompt Gradient Alignment (PGA). PGA formulates UDA as a multiple-objective optimization problem, where each objective is a domain loss. The core idea is to align per-objective gradients to build consensus between them, while also penalizing gradient norms to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning. PGA is shown to consistently surpass existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness on various benchmarks and showcasing its applicability to both single and multi-source UDA scenarios.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "14hLJr6kZ3/podcast.wav"}
