The smoothness values (0.40, 0.09, and 0.22 respectively) are calculated using a one-hidden layer neural tangent kernel (NTK) and provide insight into the complexity of the underlying regression functions. This information is crucial in the context of the paper's analysis regarding the impact of initialization on the generalization ability of neural networks.", "section": "5.2 Real data"}]
