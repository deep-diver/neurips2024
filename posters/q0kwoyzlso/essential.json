Existing theoretical frameworks, such as Statistical Queries (SQ), often fail to capture the nuances of gradient-based optimization. This paper tackles this problem by introducing a new query model called Differentiable Learning Queries (DLQ), which accurately reflects gradient computations.  The study focuses on the query complexity of DLQ for learning the support of a sparse function, revealing how this complexity is tightly linked to the choice of loss function. \nThe researchers demonstrate that the complexity of DLQ matches that of Correlation Statistical Queries (CSQ) only for specific loss functions like squared loss. However, simpler loss functions such as l1 loss show DLQ achieving the same complexity as SQ.  Furthermore, they show that DLQ can capture the learning complexity with stochastic gradient descent using a two-layer neural network model. **This provides a unified theoretical framework for analyzing gradient-based learning of sparse functions, highlighting the importance of loss function selection and offering valuable insights for researchers in optimization algorithms and deep learning.**", "affiliation": "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Q0KwoyZlSo/podcast.wav"}
