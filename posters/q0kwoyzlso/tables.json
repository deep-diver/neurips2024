DLQe is defined in Section 2, Leap and Cover of a set system in Definition 1, and systems CA of detectable sets in Definition 2 based on test functions depending on query type A, as specified in Eq. (14).", "description": "This table summarizes the complexity results of learning sparse functions using different query types: Statistical Queries (SQ), Correlation Statistical Queries (CSQ), and Differentiable Learning Queries (DLQ).  It shows how the query complexity (number of queries needed) scales with the input dimension (d) for both adaptive (queries depend on previous answers) and non-adaptive (queries are fixed in advance) algorithms.  The complexity is expressed in terms of a leap exponent (adaptive) or cover exponent (non-adaptive), which are determined by the structure of \"detectable\" subsets of coordinates, which in turn depends on the query type and loss function used.", "section": "Main Result: Characterizing the Complexity of Learning Juntas"}]
