It compares the proposed RectifID method to several existing methods, showing metrics such as identity preservation (Identity \u2191), prompt consistency (Prompt \u2191), and inference time (Time \u2193).  A key aspect highlighted is that RectifID achieves superior performance without requiring training on large face datasets, unlike many of the other methods compared.", "section": "4.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "KKrj1vCQaG/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison for face-centric personalization.
