Second, a temporally-conditioned diffusion model refines this prediction by modeling the residual errors to capture the high-frequency patterns and noise characteristics present in the high-resolution data. The entire process involves optimizing model parameters jointly during training, incorporating conditional diffusion and factorized attention mechanisms for improved efficiency and accuracy.
