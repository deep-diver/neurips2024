Nevertheless, the key challenge of domain-generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) lies in the domain gap attributed to the cross-domain styles, e.g., the variance of urban landscape and environment dependencies. Hence, maintaining the style-invariant property with varying domain styles becomes the key bottleneck in harnessing VFM for DGSS. The frequency space after Haar wavelet transform provides a feasible way to decouple the style information from the domain-invariant content, since the content and style information is retained in the low- and high-frequency components of the space, respectively. To this end, we propose a novel Frequency-Adapted (FADA) learning scheme to advance the frontier. Its overall idea is to separately tackle the content and style information by frequency tokens throughout the learning process. Particularly, the proposed FADA consists of two branches, i.e., low- and high-frequency branches. The former is able to stabilize the scene content, while the latter learns the scene styles and eliminates its impact to DGSS.

Compared with general domain generalization tasks, the feature distribution discrepancy between the source domain and unseen target domains in the context of DGSS holds some unique factors. Specifically, the cross-domain images in DGSS usually share the same content information (i.e., common semantic categories in driving scenes), while the cross-domain styles (i.e., urban landscape, weather, lighting conditions, etc.) mainly account for the feature distribution difference [65, 49, 18, 11, 72, 6, 23, 43, 24].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
