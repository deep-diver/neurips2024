FADA processes frozen Vision Foundation Model (VFM) features by first using a Haar wavelet transform to decompose them into low- and high-frequency components.  The low-frequency components, representing scene content, are processed by a low-frequency adaptation branch, while the high-frequency components, representing style information, are handled by a high-frequency adaptation branch using instance normalization. The adapted low- and high-frequency components are then fused and undergo an inverse Haar wavelet transform to yield the final feature map, which is then fed into a segmentation decoder.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "b7hmPlOqr8/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Channel-wise correlation matrix of the features from last VFM layer between source domain (C) and unseen domain (B).
