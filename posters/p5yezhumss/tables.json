[{"figure_path": "P5yezHuMSS/tables/tables_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Each column corresponds to a random subset of 5 ML models. Red dots correspond to markets where all firms use the same (1 of the 5) ML models to rank applicants (monoculture). Blue dots correspond to markets where all firms use a different ML model to rank applicants (polyculture). The top figure illustrates the accuracy of each market (the percentage of matched applicants with a positive label); here, polyculture outperforms monoculture, as predicted by Theorem 1. The bottom figure illustrates the average rank choice of applicant matches; here, monoculture outperforms polyculture, as predicted by Theorem 2. See Section 5 for details.", "description": "This figure shows the results of computational experiments using machine learning models to evaluate applicants in a matching market setting.  It compares the performance of monoculture (all firms use the same model) and polyculture (each firm uses a different model) in terms of accuracy (percentage of correctly matched applicants) and average rank of matches (how well applicants are matched to their preferences).  The results generally support the paper's theoretical findings.", "section": "Computational Experiments"}]
