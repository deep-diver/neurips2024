It shows how advertisers submit bids for their ads, and how these bids, along with the relevance of the ads to the user query, are used in an auction to select which ads to include in the LLM's output for each segment. The retriever component retrieves ads and bids from a database.  The auction determines the winning ad(s) for each segment. Finally, the LLM generates the output, incorporating the winning ads into the relevant segments.  The query is used by the Retriever to select relevant ads for the auction.", "section": "Our Contributions"}, {"figure_path": "Ujo8V7iXmR/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Segment auction architecture for LLMs via RAG.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of a segment auction for ad allocation in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
