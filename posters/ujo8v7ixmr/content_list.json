The retriever forwards the bids to the auction, along with click probabilities (aligned with retrieval probabilities). The auction implements a randomized allocation rule based on these inputs, following the RAG framework, and the LLM bases its output on the winning ad.

This balance is highly desirable for LLM outputs, which need to be satisfactory to users while potentially generating ad revenue. We show how the randomized RAG allocation rule can be obtained as a randomization over deterministic truthful auctions, which directly leads to a truthful implementation of RAG allocation. We confirm that the expected payment under this scheme matches the pricing rule that obtains from Myerson\u2019s lemma [28]. For the general setting of multi-ad allocation per segment, we again provide an auction obtained as a randomization over deterministic truthful auctions.

Our key finding is that whereas repeated single-ad segment auctions generate higher revenue, a multi-allocation auction leads to higher output quality, as measured by the cosine similarity between embeddings of the output omitting ads, and the output conditioned on ads.

Candidate outputs are generated by conditioning on context from each advertiser, and one of these outputs is sampled according to aggregate reward across agents. Our approach does not necessarily require generating output candidates for each ad, although this can increase allocative efficiency, as we discuss. Along similar lines, Sun et al.

In practice, RAG is often implemented simply by including information from the selected document $z_{i}$ into the prompt for generating $y$ . The model in (1) refers to a variant called RAG-sequence: a single document is selected probabilistically, and is then used to inform the entire output sequence. Lewis et al. [23] also introduce a variant called RAG-token, where a separate document is selected and considered for each token generation. The flexibility of RAG to consider different contextual inputs at separate stages of output generation is one of the features that make it particularly suitable for integrating ads.

Our approach is based on the popular RAG framework for incorporating factual information into LLM-generated content [23]. We introduced the concept of a segment auction where an auction is run to integrate single or multiple ads into each output segment (e.g., sentence, paragraph). We showed that our segment auction designs implement the RAG allocation rule while charging incentive compatible prices. We also showed that the single-ad segment auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare, which balances efficiency and fairness in the allocation. In our experimental evaluation, our key finding was that whereas repeated single-ad segment auctions have higher revenue, less-frequent multi-ad auctions lead to higher quality output, for the same number of ads. This uncovers an inherent trade-off between revenue and quality for operators of segment auctions. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "We see several avenues for follow-up work. We note that while our work takes the perspective of charging ads to appear in LLM output, one could also take the reverse perspective where information sources need to be compensated for providing unique, factual information under the RAG framework. In that case a reverse auction would be run to obtain high-quality information at minimum cost. We expect the main design ideas presented here to carry through, though important practical details (e.g., per-impression vs. per-click pricing) would change. Another question is the integration of reserve prices, which can serve to both increase revenue and maintain output quality standards. Finally, based on our findings on the relative quality of single- vs. multi-ad segment auction output, it would be worthwhile to investigate more sophisticated approaches to RAG segment auctions like joint fine-tuning of the retriever and generator components.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
