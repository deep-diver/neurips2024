The metrics used for comparison are PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity). Higher PSNR and SSIM values indicate better rendering quality, while a lower LPIPS value suggests better perceptual similarity to the ground truth. The table highlights the best and second-best performing methods for each metric on each dataset, providing a clear comparison of the proposed OccFusion method against state-of-the-art techniques.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "CZwphz5vgz/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison on the ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion datasets.
