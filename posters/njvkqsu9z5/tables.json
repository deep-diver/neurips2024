The table shows the target hit rate (targets acquired per minute) for each control method in three goal space configurations: Continuous, Linear, and Quadrant.  Each goal space has results for expert, noisy, and laggy surrogate pilots.  The results demonstrate that the IDA method generally outperforms the other two, especially with noisy or laggy pilots.", "section": "4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "nJvkQSu9Z5/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performance of surrogate pilots in the Lunar Lander environment.
