This often leads to inconsistent similarity rankings and reduced classification accuracy, especially when compared to more stable graph kernel methods that rely on pre-defined kernels.  These kernels, while effective, suffer from a lack of non-linearity and computational limitations for large datasets.\nThis paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel consistency loss function. The function enforces the similarity of graph representations to remain consistent across different layers, drawing inspiration from the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) kernel.  The results demonstrated significant improvements in graph classification accuracy across various GNN backbones and datasets, validating the hypothesis that consistent similarity preservation across layers is crucial for accurate graph representation.", "affiliation": "Dartmouth College", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dg0hO4M11K/podcast.wav"}
