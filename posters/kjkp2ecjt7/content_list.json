Given various textual prompts, the model should output the desired entities and relationships, facilitating a more natural and intuitive user interface. For instance, it should be able to detect just the person in an image or all possible interactions between a person and a horse, as illustrated in Fig. 1. 3) Open-vocabulary recognition of visual relationships.

Efforts to detect instances referred to by textual prompts have been made [21, 38, 75, 107], but these models fail to capture all desired entities or relationships comprehensively and struggle with classifying multi-label interactions between the pairs, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios.

We ablate Our FleVRS by testing different encoding strategies for relationships via the textual encoder in 7. Specifically, we compare encoding object and predicate categories as <person, predicate, object> triplets or separately, associating the results with either triplet cross-entropy (CE) loss or disentangled CE loss. Results reveal that while HICO-DET benefits from the disentangled CE loss, allowing better generalization to novel concepts, VCOCO performs better with triplet CE loss due to the challenge of distinguishing verbs without corresponding objects in various contexts (e.g., differentiating \u201ceat\u201d in \u201ca person eating an apple\u201d vs \u201ca person eating\u201d). Further experiments with various backbones demonstrate performance enhancements with larger models. Additionally, incorporating a box head for supervision alongside mask supervision enhances performance, which is attributed to the masked attention mechanism inspired by [6]. Exploring the potential synergies of training across multiple datasets, we find that while unified training improves VCOCO\u2019s performance due to its smaller size, HICO-DET and PSG show limited gains. This disparity is likely due to the different predicate categories used in PSG compared to HICO-DET and VCOCO. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Comparison with previous works. UniVRD uses a two-stage approach, where the model first detects independent objects and then decodes relationships between them, retrieving boxes from the initial detection stage.

This transition improves time efficiency from O(MxN) to O(K), where M is the number of subject boxes, N is the number of object boxes, and K is the number of interactive pairs.

RLIPv2 is a two-stage approach optimized for large-scale pretraining and relies on separately trained detectors.
