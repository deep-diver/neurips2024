By leveraging the human visual system's varying sensitivity to different frequency components, **CLFD reduces the dimensionality of input features**, improving efficiency.

Unlike the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which results in a complete loss of spatial information, the DWT effectively preserves both frequency and spatial domain features, enabling data augmentation techniques crucial for successful continual learning.  **This preservation of spatial information is key**, preventing the limitations seen in DCT-based approaches that hinder the use of data augmentation strategies.  The choice of Haar wavelet within the DWT is justified by its computational efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained edge devices, a central design goal of the CLFD framework.  **The multi-resolution analysis inherent in the DWT allows the model to capture both low-frequency components** (representing global information) and high-frequency components (representing local details), optimizing feature representation and reducing the input feature map size. This size reduction ultimately contributes to improved efficiency and memory usage."}}, {"heading_title": "CLFD Framework", "details": {"summary": "The CLFD framework, designed for continual learning, leverages the **frequency domain** to enhance training efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.  It cleverly utilizes wavelet transforms to reduce input feature map size, decreasing computational demands on edge devices. **Class-aware Frequency Domain Feature Selection** further refines the process, dynamically choosing relevant frequency features for each class across tasks, balancing reusability and interference. This approach avoids excessive parameter additions compared to traditional methods, and its seamless integration with rehearsal-based techniques makes it particularly effective.  **Experimental results demonstrate the framework's strong performance enhancements** in accuracy and training time reduction, particularly on edge devices.
