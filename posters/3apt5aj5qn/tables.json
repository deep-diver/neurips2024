[{"figure_path": "3apt5AJ5QN/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: We evaluate policies in real-world food rescue contexts by developing situations that mirror notifications (N = 100, K = 50) and phone calls (N = 20, K = 10). Our policies outperform baselines for both situations and achieve similar results due to the nearly linear reward function.", "description": "This table shows the performance comparison of different policies (Vanilla Whittle, Greedy, MCTS, DQN, Linear Whittle, Shapley Whittle, Iterative Linear, Iterative Shapley, MCTS Linear, and MCTS Shapley) on two real-world food rescue scenarios: notifications and phone calls.  The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adaptive policies compared to baselines in both scenarios. The near-linear nature of the reward function explains the relatively small difference in performance among the different policies.", "section": "6.2 Results with Real-World Data in Food Rescue"}]
