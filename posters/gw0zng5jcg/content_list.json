Specifically, owing to the low RNA capture rate, scRNA-seq data often contain zero values. These zero values represent unobserved gene expression resulting from both technical omissions (referred to as dropouts [8]) and true biological absence.

Despite their effectiveness, they overlook well-known genetic evidence [13, 14], which means that there are two types of relationships between genes: associating relationship and dissociating one.

To address this issue, FP can be a good solution because FP preserves observed values during diffusion while updates unobserved values through diffusion. Propagation-based imputation methods have shown their superiority in scRNA-seq data imputation. scFP [11] adopts FP developed for graph-structured data to resolve imputation for scRNA-seq data. scFP constructs a cell-cell $k$ -NN graph and applies FP for the imputation of zero values. Very recently, [12] proposes scBFP to utilize gene-gene relationships as well as cell-cell relationships. scBFP consists of two stages, and in each stage, it applies FP using a gene-gene $k$ -NN graph and a cell-cell $k$ -NN graph, respectively. Although scBFP is designed to leverage gene-gene relationships, the simple addition of FP using a gene-gene $k$ -NN graph cannot effectively exploit gene-gene relationships due to the following two reasons: (1) a gene-gene $k$ -NN graph can connect only associating genes which have co-occurrence relationships while overlooking the presence of dissociating gene-gene relationships; (2) Since the distributions for each gene significantly varies, propagation without additional processing will degrade recovery performance.

This occurs because associating genes may have high cosine similarity due to their co-occurrence. These genes with high cosine similarity may become connected in the cosinesimilarity-based $k$ -NN graph .

These processes, grounded in genetic evidence, led to significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks on scRNA-seq data, with fast imputation times. Furthermore, our work is not limited to simply utilizing genetic evidence to design a framework. We validated this evidence within real scRNA-seq datasets, and confirmed that our scCR effectively leveraged this insight. Like other scRNA-seq imputation methods, scCR is specifically designed for scRNA-seq data. However, since scRNA-seq data are inherently matrix-formatted, scCR can be extended to general tabular data imputation. We expect that the concatenation process will be effective even for general tabular data, as there are often both positive and negative correlation coefficients between channels in such data. The extension of scCR to other domains is left for future work.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
