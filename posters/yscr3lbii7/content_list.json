In this comparison, we focus on LORIS, the current state-of-the-art method in motion-to-music generation. It is evident that MoMu-Diffusion consistently outperforms LORIS across these metrics, particularly in FAD scores. This superiority can be attributed to MoMu-Diffusion\u2019s architectural innovations for capturing long-term correspondence. Unlike text, music encompasses a richer sequence length due to its complex acoustic features, such as melody, rhythm, and driving beats. To address this, MoMu-Diffusion employs mel-spectrograms in place of raw waveforms, thereby mitigating sequence length. Additionally, the introduction of BiCoR-VAE facilitates modality alignment in latent spaces.

For model evaluation, we compute the beat-matching metrics between synthesized motion beats and the reference musical beats with the aforementioned five beat-matching metrics. To validate the quality of synthesized motion sequences, we use Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) [17], Mean KL-Divergence (Mean KLD), and the Diveristy scores. The feature extractor is based on MotionBert [51] and trained with a classification task on the BHS Dance dataset. For the BHS Dance dataset, we exclude the BiCoR-VAE since this dataset only contains the paired audio MFCC features and motion sequences without raw audio.

This performance underscores the efficacy of our BiCoR-VAE in constructing an aligned latent space for cross-modal generation and the feed-forward diffusion model in capturing long-term correspondence. It should be noted that the metrics BCS (Beats Coverage Scores) and BHS (Beat Hit Scores) are defined differently in this context compared to motion-to-music scenarios.
