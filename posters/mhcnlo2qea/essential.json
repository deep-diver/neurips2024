This limits their applicability in scenarios with limited sensor visibility.  This paper addresses this limitation by focusing on **doubly sparse data** (sparse in time and space) which is more common in practical applications.  It examines how even sparse observations, like occasional hand poses captured during natural movement, are valuable in estimating overall body motion.\nThe paper proposes DSPoser, a two-stage approach. First, it uses masked autoencoders to impute missing hand pose data by leveraging temporal and spatial correlations with the available head pose data. This stage also provides uncertainty estimates for the imputed data. Second, conditional diffusion models are employed to generate the complete body pose.  Uncertainty information from the first stage guides the diffusion process, leading to more plausible and accurate full-body pose predictions. The comprehensive evaluation on two large datasets showcases that DSPoser's performance surpasses existing methods, especially when dealing with doubly sparse input data, and is robust in diverse AR/VR conditions.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "MHCnLo2QeA/podcast.wav"}
