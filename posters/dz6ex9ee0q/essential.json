", "takeaways": ["Existing robust GNNs suffer from estimation bias, leading to performance degradation under strong attacks.", "RUNG uses a robust and unbiased graph signal estimator that is unfolded as efficient aggregation layers in GNNs.", "RUNG demonstrates superior robustness against various attacks while maintaining accuracy compared to existing methods."], "tldr": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks, and existing defense mechanisms often prove inadequate, especially against adaptive attacks that directly target the victim model.  This is largely due to inherent estimation bias within many popular l1-based robust GNNs. These biases accumulate as attack budgets increase, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of these defenses.\nThis research introduces RUNG, a novel GNN architecture that addresses these shortcomings.  RUNG employs a robust and unbiased graph signal estimator, mitigating estimation bias. This is achieved through an efficient Quasi-Newton Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm, which is readily integrated into the GNN architecture as unbiased aggregation layers. Extensive experiments show that RUNG offers considerably improved robustness against adaptive attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for enhanced security in real-world applications.", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "dz6ex9Ee0Q/podcast.wav"}
