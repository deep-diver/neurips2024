In this example, the index defining the first bin, \u03c0\u2081, is such that for S we go B\u2081 = 0 and for S' we have B\u2081 = 0; but the index defining the 2nd bin, \u03c02 it does hold that B2 = 0, B2 = 1 so the indices starting from bin 2 onwards align.", "description": "This figure illustrates how two neighboring datasets (S and S') differing by a single data point affect the binning process used in the algorithm.  The addition of Bernoulli random variables to the bin indices (\u03c0\u2081, \u03c0\u2082 etc.) is highlighted, showing how this helps correlate the bins even with the addition or removal of a single data point. It demonstrates the algorithm's robustness to changes in the datasets. The top row shows the sorted data for dataset S, and the bottom row is for dataset S'.  The figure depicts a situation where a change occurs at the beginning of the sorted data in one dataset but at the end in the other, to illustrate how it affects the bins defined by using the added Bernoulli random variables.", "section": "3.1 Privacy Proof"}]
