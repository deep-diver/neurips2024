Current neural approaches often suffer from high bias or variance.  This necessitates the development of robust and efficient MI estimators for high-dimensional data.\n\nThis paper introduces f-DIME, a novel family of discriminative MI estimators based on the variational representation of f-divergence. It addresses the issues of high bias and variance by employing a novel derangement training strategy.  The results demonstrate that f-DIME achieves higher accuracy and lower complexity than state-of-the-art estimators across various scenarios. **The key innovation is using data derangements instead of random permutations**, significantly improving estimation accuracy and resolving the limitations imposed by the upper bound of log(N).", "affiliation": "University of Klagenfurt", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PThi9hf9UT/podcast.wav"}
