This leads to redundancy and slow processing. Existing multi-frame methods also struggle to effectively model the complex interactions between spatial and temporal information in videos, hindering accuracy. \nStreamFlow tackles this by introducing a streamlined in-batch multi-frame pipeline that simultaneously predicts flows for multiple frames within a single pass, significantly reducing redundancy and speeding up processing. It also introduces novel spatiotemporal modeling techniques, ISC and GTR, that efficiently capture both spatial and temporal information, leading to significant improvements in accuracy, especially in difficult areas such as occluded regions.  Experimental results demonstrate that StreamFlow achieves substantial improvements in both speed and accuracy compared to existing methods on several benchmark datasets.  The method shows strong cross-dataset generalization abilities, further demonstrating its robustness and wider applicability.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "FYLcH4HAZr/podcast.wav"}
