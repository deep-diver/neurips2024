It consists of three main modules: 1) Spatiotemporal Construction Module which takes CSP (Common Spatial Patterns) from EEG signals as input and outputs temporal patterns using temporal and spatial convolutional layers. 2) Dual Attention Refinement Module, which takes the output of the previous module and uses a dual-layer self-attention mechanism to refine features and capture long-range dependencies. 3) Feature Fusion & Classifier Module, which takes the output of the previous module, fuses the features from different levels, and makes final classification using a fully connected layer.", "section": "2 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "jWGGEDYORs/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: AAD accuracy(%) of DARNet across all subjects on three datasets.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of the DARNet model on three different datasets (KUL, DTU, and MM-AAD) across all subjects.

The box plots illustrate the distribution of accuracy across all subjects for each dataset and window length. The median accuracy is shown as a point within each box, representing the typical performance.  The boxes themselves span the interquartile range (IQR), meaning the middle 50% of the data. The whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR from each end of the box, capturing most of the data distribution. Points outside the whiskers represent outliers, indicating exceptional results.", "section": "4 Result"}]
