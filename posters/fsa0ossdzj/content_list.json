Standard black-box approaches mapping sequences of categorical variables to outputs are applicable, but they rely on poorly understood assumptions on how reliable generalization can be obtained, and may underperform under sparse sequences, temporal variability, and large action spaces. To approach that, we pose an explicit model for composition, that is, how the effect of sequential interventions can be isolated into modules, clarifying which data conditions allow for the identification of their combined effect at different units and time steps. We show the identification properties of our compositional model, inspired by advances in causal matrix factorization methods.

Much of the sequential intervention literature in AI and statistics considers generic black-box or parametric models1 to map sequences $D_{n}^{1:t}:=[D_{n}^{1},D_{n}^{2},\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot,D_{n}^{t}]$ to behavior $\\bar{X}_{n}^{t}$ and beyond, sometimes exploiting strong Markovian assumptions or short sequences and small action spaces [11, 43]. An unstructured black-box for sequences, such as recurrent neural networks and their variants [e.g. 23, 13, 45], can learn to map a sequence to a prediction. This is less suitable when actions are categorical and sparse, in the sense that most entries correspond to some baseline category of \u201cno changes\u201d. That is, there is no obvious choice of smoothing or interpolation criteria to generalize from seen to unseen strings $D_{n}^{1:T}$ , with the practical assumption being that we observe enough variability to reliably perform this interpolation. There is an increased awareness of problems posed by large discrete spaces among pre-treatment covariates [47, 48], which is of a different nature as losses can be minimized with respect to an existing natural distribution, as opposed to the interventional problem where the action variables are allowed to be chosen and so sparsity conditions can easily result in very atypical test cases of interest. Several papers address large intervention spaces (mostly for non-sequential problems) without particular concerns about non-smooth, combinatorial identifiability [25, 32, 38, 39]. A few more recent papers address explicit assumptions of identifiability directly in combinatorial categorical spaces by sparse regression [2] or energy functions [8], but without a longitudinal component. More classically, tools like the do-calculus [33] and their extensions [15] can be used with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to infer combinatorial effects, although they often restrict each manipulated variable to directly affect only a small set of variables (e.g. [5]). With strong assumptions and computational cost, this may include latent variables [50]. Alternative representation learning ideas for carefully extrapolating to unseen interventions are presented by [37] in the non-sequential, non-combinatorial, setting. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this paper, we consider the conservative problem of identification guarantees for the effect of sequential combinations of interventions which may never have co-occurred jointly in training data, formalizing assumptions that allow for the transfer and recombination of information learned across units. These are not of the same nature as identifiability of causal effects from observational data [33] or causal discovery [41], but of causal extrapolation: even in the randomized (or unconfounded) regime, it is not a given that the distribution under a particular regime $\\mathrm{do}(d_{n}^{1:t})$ can be reliably inferred from limited past combinations of action sequences without an explicit structure on the causal generative model. We will consider the case where actions imply non-stationary transitions: once unit $n$ is exposed to $D_{n}^{t}=d_{n}^{t}$ , then $X_{n}^{t+\\Delta}$ will have transition dynamics that can be affected not only by the choice of $d_{n}^{t}$ but also the difference $\\Delta$ , resulting in dense dependency structures such as the one in Figure 1. As multiple treatments are applied to the same unit $n$ , there will be a composition of effects that will depend not only on the labels of the actions, but also on the order by which they take place. If a substantive number of choices of treatments at time $t$ is available, a large dataset may have no two sequences $D_{n}^{1:T}$ and $D_{n^{\\prime}}^{1:T}$ taking the same values, even when considering only the unique treatment values applied to $n$ and $n^{\\prime}$ , regardless of ordering and time stamps.

Several approaches for conformal prediction in causal inference have emerged in recent years [e.g., 44, 28], including matrix completion [21] and synthetic controls [12]. Our focus has not been on individual nor average treatment effects, but directly on expected potential outcomes, similarly to the work on causal matrix completion [7, 3, 4, 42]. Unlike the matrix completion literature, we focused on prediction problems, out-ofsample for both units and time steps. Moreover, the matrix completion literature is usually framed in terms of marginal expectations $\\mathbb{E}[X_{n}^{t}(d)]$ , as opposed to conditional expectations (notice that [4] considers covariates, but those are included as part of the generative model). Marginal models have some advantages when modeling multiple-step-ahead effects [18], but they also involve complex computational considerations that we leave for future work. Compositionality based on additivity instead of the factorization trick is discussed by e.g. [29], but additivity lacks the connection to an explicit principle for universal function approximation.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
