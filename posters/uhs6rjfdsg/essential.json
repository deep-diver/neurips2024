For example, CLIP excels in general image understanding but struggles with documents or charts. This reliance on a single encoder creates inherent biases, hindering the MLLMs' generalization across various tasks.  This paper addresses this issue by proposing MoVA.\nMoVA tackles this limitation by introducing an adaptive routing and fusion mechanism that dynamically selects and combines multiple task-specific vision experts. This \"coarse-to-fine\" approach, facilitated by the strong understanding capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhances generalization.  **Extensive experiments show MoVA achieving state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks**, demonstrating the effectiveness of its adaptive expert management strategy.", "affiliation": "CUHK MMLab", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "uHs6RJFDsg/podcast.wav"}
