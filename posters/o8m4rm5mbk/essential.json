Existing methods struggle to effectively transfer knowledge from large source datasets to target datasets with limited samples. The paper reveals that the query-key attention mechanism in ViTs, while effective for discriminability in the source domain, lacks transferability across domains. This leads to ineffective attention in the target domain, hindering performance. \n\nTo address this, the researchers propose a novel method involving attention temperature adjustment. By multiplying the attention mechanism by a temperature parameter, they find that even reducing the attention map to a uniform distribution improves the target domain performance. They interpret this as a remedy for the ineffective target-domain attention caused by the query-key mechanism.  Further, they propose a method to boost ViT's transferability by adjusting attention mechanisms during training to resist learning query-key parameters and encourage learning non-query-key ones. Experimental results demonstrate consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art methods across four CDFSL datasets.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "o8m4RM5mBk/podcast.wav"}
