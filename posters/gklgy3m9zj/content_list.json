More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities.

This work explores the connection between conformal prediction and information theory, with the end goal of advancing the state of the art of uncertainty quantification in machine learning. With that in mind, we believe its potential societal consequences are chiefly positive, since our work might contribute to a larger adoption of uncertainty estimates, in a number of safety-critical applications. Notwithstanding, conformal prediction, like any other uncertainty estimation method, should be applied with care and a proper understanding of the provided guarantees so as not to create an illusion of safety when there is none. That is why our work aims to develop new methods and algorithms from first principles, with the hope of providing new techniques that we can study and understand at a deeper level so as to mitigate, or at least foresee, some of their failure modes. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations. Our work is not without limitations. In practice, estimating the conditional entropy $H(Y|X)$ is a difficult problem. That is part of the reason upper bounds might be useful, but that also means it is hard to evaluate how tight our upper bounds are. This also limits potential applications of our upper bounds like, for instance, estimating the expected prediction set size. Our experiments in Appendix G.3 rely on quantization to get a reasonable lower bound on the conditional entropy, and thus lower bound the expected prediction set size. Finally, in terms of our experimental results, we unfortunately have not been able to single out which of our new upper bounds performs best. The general trend we observe is that the DPI and model-based Fano bounds perform better on complex classification tasks, while simple Fano seems to excel in relatively simple tasks or where there is a high risk of overfitting, like in the federated setting.

However, in principle, our bounds pose no assumptions on the underlying prediction problem and we see the application of our results to the regression setting as a promising avenue for future work. In practice, only the simple Fano bound in (6) would not be directly applicable to the regression setting, but that is mainly because it assumes a uniform distribution over the output space and we get the, potentially infinite, $|\\mathcal{V}|$ term. The other two bounds we propose, DPI in (4) and model-based Fano in (5), do not include the $|\\mathcal{V}|$ and $|C(X)|$ terms and can be applied to regression problems as is.

", "page_idx": 18}, {"type": "text", "text": "The general setup studied in channel coding, including list decoding, can be summarized as follows. A message $y\\,\\in\\,\\mathcal{V}$ is encoded and transmitted over a noisy channel, and a message $x\\,\\in\\,{\\mathcal{X}}$ is received. The noisy channel is governed by probability density $p(x|y)$ that describes the probability of observing output $x\\in\\mathscr{X}$ given input $y\\in\\mathcal{V}$ . The receiver attempts to decode $x$ , that is, to guess the originally transmitted message $y$ from the received one, $x$ . At this point, parallels to machine learning should already have become clear. If the receiver provides a single guess of the transmitted message $y$ , we are in a unique-decoding scenario, which is akin to a point prediction in machine learning. Conversely, if the receiver is allowed to guess a set (or a list in the list decoding formalism) of the most likely messages, we have list decoding, which closely resembles conformal prediction. Note that in many settings, a list decoding algorithm is constrained to output a list of fixed size. While simple conformal prediction methods for regression settings show the same limitation, the parallel between the two domains is more pertinent when we consider variable-size list decoding [57].

Similarly, for a given input-label pair $(X,Y)$ the goal of conformal prediction is to provide a set that contains $Y$ with a certain pre-determined probability. It is this connection that motivates our bounds on the conditional entropy $H(Y|X)$ . However, the nonconformity score in conformal prediction is typically a function of the output of a given model $f:\\mathcal X\\to\\mathcal Y$ . For instance, $\\hat{Y}=f(X)$ could be the logits output by the model, i.e., a vector with the dimension equal to number of classes. If we consider $\\hat{Y}$ the noisy observation of the ground-truth $Y$ , then the problem of determining a set containing $Y$ is again the list decoding problem. Therefore, we can also consider the communication channel $\\bar{p}(\\hat{y}|y;\\bar{x^{\\big)}}$ directly, which justifies applying the same upper bounds to $H(Y|\\hat{Y})$ .

Again, similarly to [61], in all of our experiments we perform conformal training by thresholding on log-probabilities, which we observed to work best. The results we report for thresholding on probabilities (THR), APS and now RAPS show that this translates well to other score functions as well.
