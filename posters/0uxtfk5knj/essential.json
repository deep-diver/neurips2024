", "summary": "BAdam: A memory-efficient optimization method enabling full parameter fine-tuning of large language models using a block coordinate descent framework with Adam's update rule, achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods.", "takeaways": ["BAdam is a memory-efficient optimization method for training large language models.", "BAdam achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods like Adam and LoRA.", "The paper provides a theoretical convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic case."], "tldr": "Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, requiring significant GPU memory.  Existing memory-efficient methods like LoRA often compromise performance by using low-rank approximations.  Full parameter fine-tuning, while offering superior performance, is often infeasible due to memory constraints. This creates a need for optimization methods that are both memory efficient and preserve model performance. \nThis paper introduces BAdam, a novel optimization method that addresses this challenge.  BAdam leverages a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework, updating parameters block-wise to reduce memory footprint.  Experiments show that BAdam significantly outperforms other memory-efficient methods in terms of memory usage and running time while achieving comparable or even better downstream performance. The theoretical convergence analysis further supports BAdam's efficiency and effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "0uXtFk5KNJ/podcast.wav"}
