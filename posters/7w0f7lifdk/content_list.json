Creating realistic human avatar from consumer grade sensors [33, 96, 73, 92\u201394] is essential for downstream tasks such as human behaviour understanding [9, 51, 84, 86, 85] and gaming application [38, 44, 20, 105, 106]. Researchers have explored avatar creation from monocular RGB [31, 80], Depth [16, 93] video or single image [56, 57, 59, 87, 88]. Avatar from single image is particularly interesting and existing methods can be roughly categorized as templatebased [23, 87, 88, 108] and template-free [56, 57, 59, 95]. Despite the impressive performance, template-based approaches rely on the naked body model [46, 50] and fail to reason extremely loose clothing, while template-free methods produce blurry back side textures. Instead of SMPL shape prior, our method is template-free and leverages strong 2D image priors to create high-quality avatars. Orthogonal to humans, object reconstruction methods typically adopt template-free paradigms and early works [6, 71, 81, 83, 107] focus mainly on geometry.

In contrast, template-free methods like PIFu [56] and TripoSR [74] offer greater flexibility and better performance on loose clothing. However, they are not generative models and their deterministic formulations lead to blurry textures in unseen regions, as they tend to produce average textures rather than distinct details. Similar to our approach, LGM [67] and InstantMesh [89] utilize 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view images and perform sparseview 3D reconstruction. Nonetheless, their separation of 2D and 3D models cannot correct the 3D inconsistencies that may arise from the 2D models. Even further fine-tuning of LGM on human scans (Fig. 4) does not adequately address these challenges due to the complex and sensitive nature of human geometry and textures.
