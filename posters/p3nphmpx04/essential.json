Current GFSS methods often rely on complex techniques such as customized modules and meta-learning, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to implement.  The main challenge lies in achieving high accuracy for novel classes while maintaining the performance of the base-class model.  Existing methods struggle to balance these two aspects effectively.\nThis paper introduces a novel GFSS method called Base-Class Mining (BCM). BCM utilizes a simple rule to identify base classes closely related to novel classes, followed by standard supervised learning.  The authors show theoretically that BCM perfectly maintains the performance of the base-class model for a subset of base classes. Their experiments demonstrate that BCM substantially improves novel-class segmentation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the 1-shot setting, while maintaining good performance on base classes.  This is achieved without using complex techniques that can be computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in real-world applications.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "p3nPHMpx04/podcast.wav"}
