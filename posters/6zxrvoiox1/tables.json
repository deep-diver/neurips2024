It categorizes them based on the type of feedback (full information or bandit), algorithm type (model-based or model-free), regret bound achieved, efficiency (oracle-efficient or inefficient), and the type of loss function considered.  The table highlights the trade-offs between these aspects for different approaches.  Note that 'O' represents factors of order poly(d, |A|, log T, log |\u03a6||Y|).", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
