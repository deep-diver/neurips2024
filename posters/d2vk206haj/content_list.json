However, when it comes to processing facial images, the outcomes frequently fall short of expectations. Facial stylization is predominantly challenged by two significant hurdles. Firstly, obtaining a large dataset of high-quality stylized images is difficult. The scarcity and diversity of artistic styles make it impractical to compile comprehensive datasets for each style. Secondly, while many methods can transfer colors and strokes from style images, these elements alone cannot fully capture a specific style, which encompasses both concrete and abstract visual elements. Additionally, facial stylization often alters the visual features of the face, making it challenging to balance these changes with the need to retain facial information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called ACFun, which uses only one style image and one facial image for facial stylization. ACFun comprises an Abstract Fusion Module $(A F u n)$ and a Concrete Fusion Module (CFun), which separately learn the abstract and concrete features of the style and face. We also design a Face and Style Imagery Alignment Loss to align the style image with the face image in the latent space. Finally, we generate styled facial images from noise directly to complete the facial stylization task. Experiments show that our method outperforms others in facial stylization, producing highly artistic and visually pleasing results.

These methods have made progress in visual quality and computational efficiency. However, these style transfer techniques can only modify low-level image features such as strokes and colors, and they are unable to adjust high-level semantics such as shape and content. It\u2019s like using the style image as a template to paint the content image instead of truly creating a new image based on the style. Style encompasses not only basic visual elements like strokes and colors but also deeper aspects such as structure, layout, and shape. These elements combine to create a unique visual language and form of expression. In the context of facial stylization, the challenges of style transfer are even more significant. Facial recognition relies on distinct and recognizable individual characteristics, which means that style transfer must capture the visual features of the style image and seamlessly integrate them into the target image while preserving facial recognizability.

Moreover, the diversity and complexity of artistic styles make compiling a comprehensive dataset for each style impractical. Subsequently, there are also some Textual-Inversion methods [10, 11] that can use a single image, but this method only fine-tuned the CLIP model as the conditional input, which limited its ability to generate models and often caused it to be heavily affected by style degradation, resulting in simpler results and reduced image quality.

These differences are evident not only in visual features but also in high-level semantics, such as shape and distribution. In particular, as shown in the lower part of Figure 1, there are notable disparities between abstract style portraits and real portraits, leading to substantial changes in facial features during the stylization process. On the other side of the coin, it is essential for stylized facial images to maintain consistency in facial information so that they remain recognizable to people. In summary, for stylized facial images, balancing the ability to maintain facial images with the drastic semantic changes brought about by stylization is the key to achieving good facial stylization results. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To this end, we propose a facial stylization method that allows deep neural networks to fuse abstract visual elements (deformation, distribution, atmosphere, etc.) from style and facial image with concrete visual elements (color, brushstrokes, lines, etc.) into an imagery visual feature just like artists, to achieve facial image stylization, rather than simply transferring texture and color information. Specifically, we introduced an Abstract-Concrete Fusion Facial Stylization Model (ACFun) to fuse, consisting of an Abstract Fusion Module(AFun) and a Concrete Fusion Module (CFun). The method ACFun uses for facial stylization involves learning abstract and concrete features separately and then combining style images with facial images by aligning them in an imagery feature space formed by the fusion of abstract and concrete features. We first extract abstract features of style and face through AFun by encoding style images into the CLIP latent space and combining it with the facial description text prompts we use; then, we optimize it using a Textual-Inversion-based method to make it recognizable by CLIP for subsequent generation processes. In addition, by introducing face images during the training process, we implicitly fuse facial information with style abstract information. However, CLIP has limitations in distinguishing between specific style and facial images at the fine-grained level. To address this, we adopt the CFun module, which is a set of trainable parameters embedded in a pre-training generator to enhance its ability to extract concrete features from specific styles and facial images, which greatly improves the quality of the generated results. Finally, the above process is constrained by the Face and Style Imagery Alignment loss we proposed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and excellent facial stylization effect of our method through massive experiments.

The method based on generating adversarial networks [12] has been widely applied in text-to-image generation by training on paired images and text samples.

However, due to the difficulty of training GAN models and the significant progress of large language models [15, 16] and diffusion models, the diffusion models have gradually replaced the position of GAN. The diffusion model[17, 18]can generate realistic images through multiple rounds of iterative refinement. It has been widely used in the image generation task and has achieved significant results [19], attracting the attention of many researchers. Among all these diffusion-based methods, Stable Diffusion [20] is the most typical work. It achieves awe-inspiring results through training on large-scale text image datasets. Afterward, SDXL [21] was introduced with larger model parameters and larger datasets. However, these methods all focus on learning text prompts, meaning that the model can only fit the given reference style through existing knowledge rather than train the generated model to have the ability to generate specific style images. We fine-tune the model to make it more intuitive to learn the target style straightly.

How to use a pre-trained text-to-image large model to complete personalized image synthesis tasks has attracted widespread attention [22]. The widely used method in image generation tasks is the inversion-based method, which aims to find a corresponding noise or conditioning embedding to a generated image. Textual Inversion [9] and Hard prompt made easy (PEZ) [23] convert a set of images of an object into corresponding textual representations (such as embedding, token) instead of changing the parameters of the text-to-image model. Dreambooth [7] learns target concepts by fine-tuning the pre-trained model. At the same time, when learning new class concepts, Dreambooth transforms this concept into a special sub-concept of a specific class. Dreambooth achieves the goal of data augmentation by generating original classes, preventing new concept classes from overwriting existing original classes, leading to catastrophic forgetting and affecting the diversity of generated models, leading to overfitting. Lora [8] has also achieved widespread application by transferring the strategy of fine-tuning pre-trained LLM to image generation methods[24], allowing it to save computational and storage costs without the need to train the entire generation network. Although the above methods have achieved good results, they all learn the description of specific concepts through a set of images, which makes it difficult to meet our needs.

Typical style transfer methods such as [25, 26, 4, 6, 27] can effectively transfer the concrete visual features such as texture and color contained in the given style image. However, when facing facial images, especially when transferring real facial images to styles with strong geometric distortions (such as comics, anime, abstract paintings, etc.), the effect is often poor. Although some methods [28, 29] use large-scale paired image data for image-to-image translation training, in practical applications, due to the diversity and scarcity of high-quality style images, collecting such a large number of paired images is not realistic, and some images do not even exist, which makes the above methods difficult to apply in practice. StyleGAN [30] achieves facial stylization through image inversion [31, 29, 32\u201334], but due to the presence of its latent space, it suffers from problems such as image degradation and limited deformation.

Furthermore, due to the ambiguity of the style, our method is still unable to accurately extract a few visual elements of the style we want to exist in the style image. Moreover, our method relies on the effectiveness of the pre-trained model. We found that the training data used in the pre-trained model is imbalanced, especially when facing certain specific character images or style images.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
