Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from negative transfer when a single model is applied uniformly across different users.  This leads to suboptimal performance and inaccurate recommendations.\n\nThe proposed method, Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA), tackles this issue by integrating the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework with Low-Rank Adaptation of LLMs.  This allows for **dynamic parameter adjustment** based on individual user behavior.  iLoRA demonstrates **significant performance improvements** in hit ratio across multiple benchmark datasets compared to standard LoRA, highlighting its effectiveness in personalized recommendation.  The approach maintains a similar number of parameters, avoiding overfitting.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "isZ8XRe3De/podcast.wav"}
