{"importance": "This paper is vital for researchers in semi-supervised learning (SSL) as it tackles the crucial problem of sample selection, particularly under low-budget scenarios.  **It introduces a novel approach, RDSS, that significantly enhances model performance by strategically selecting representative and diverse samples for annotation.** This addresses a major limitation of existing SSL methods and opens exciting avenues for further research into efficient and effective SSL techniques.", "summary": "RDSS: a novel sample selection method for semi-supervised learning, boosts model accuracy by minimizing a-MMD, striking a balance between sample representativeness and diversity.", "takeaways": ["RDSS effectively improves semi-supervised learning performance by selecting both representative and diverse samples.", "The proposed a-MMD criterion and the GKHR algorithm provide a theoretically sound and efficient solution for sample selection.", "RDSS outperforms state-of-the-art sample selection methods in active and semi-supervised active learning settings, particularly under limited annotation budgets."], "tldr": "Many deep learning tasks rely on semi-supervised learning (SSL) to reduce reliance on extensive labeled data.  However, a major challenge in SSL is effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data, particularly when annotation budgets are extremely limited.  Existing sample selection methods often suffer from shortcomings like imbalanced class distributions or inadequate data coverage, resulting in poor performance.  This necessitates more effective sample selection strategies for optimal performance.\nTo address these limitations, this paper presents RDSS, a novel Representative and Diverse Sample Selection approach. RDSS uses a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimize a newly proposed criterion, called a-MMD, which balances representativeness and diversity in sample selection.  Experimental results demonstrate that RDSS consistently improves the performance of popular SSL frameworks, outperforming existing methods, even under low-budget conditions.  This is achieved by selecting a subset of unlabeled data that is both representative of the entire dataset and diverse in its features.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xRdpCOdghl/podcast.wav"}
