However, creating such higher-order GNNs requires careful handling of automorphism group equivariance. This is computationally complex as it demands finding appropriate operations for each group, making it difficult to scale. This paper tackles this problem by introducing a new algorithm called \"Schur Nets\".\nSchur Nets cleverly sidesteps the computationally expensive task of explicitly finding automorphism groups. It utilizes spectral graph theory, which is much more efficient, to directly construct a basis for equivariant operations from the graph Laplacian. This approach is shown to improve higher-order GNN performance, particularly in tasks like molecular property prediction, where local structure is vital.  **The key contribution is an efficient and scalable algorithm for building automorphism equivariant higher-order GNNs.**", "affiliation": "University of Chicago", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HRnSVflpgt/podcast.wav"}
