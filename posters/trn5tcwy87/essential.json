This problem leads to inaccurate surrogate models and poor-quality solutions. Existing solutions attempt to correct the misalignment problem through re-centering, but these methods are inefficient as they require a huge number of additional function evaluations. \nThis paper introduces Inversion-based Latent Bayesian Optimization (InvBO), a novel plug-and-play module that directly tackles the misalignment problem. InvBO consists of two key components: an inversion method to precisely recover the latent codes that reconstruct the data, and a potential-aware trust region anchor selection that strategically chooses the center of the trust region to enhance the optimization process.  InvBO demonstrates significant performance gains across several real-world tasks and is shown to be effective on various benchmarks. Importantly, InvBO is a plug-and-play module so can be implemented to improve performance of multiple existing LBO methods.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "TrN5TcWY87/podcast.wav"}
