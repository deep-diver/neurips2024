These results underscore the variability in performance with changes in network structure and budget allocation, highlighting the superior effectiveness of the GCN model in simpler cases and under increased budget conditions, with diminishing returns in more complex environments.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of four different misinformation mitigation methods across various network structures and budget levels. The methods include a GCN-based supervised learning approach, random node selection, static selection of maximum-degree nodes, and dynamic selection of maximum-degree nodes.  The results demonstrate the impact of network topology and action budget on the effectiveness of these strategies, with the GCN-based approach showing the best performance in less complex networks and with larger budgets.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "LYivxMp5es/figures/figures_52_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparative analysis of the GCN-Based SL Model Against Baseline Models Across Different Network Types and Budgets. Each subfigure represents one of the three cases (1, 2, and 3), organized by rows, for three different types of networks: Tree, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, and Watts-Strogatz, organized by columns. Within each panel, the infection rate is plotted for four methodologies: SL based on GCN (blue), random node selection (orange), static selection of maximum degrees (green), and dynamic selection of maximum degrees (red) across three levels of budget (1, 2, and 3).

The strategies are: supervised learning with a graph convolutional network (GCN), random node selection, static selection of maximum degree nodes, and dynamic selection of maximum degree nodes. The results show that the GCN-based method generally performs better, particularly in simpler networks and with larger budgets, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
