These values are used in the theoretical analysis of the watermark's robustness against attacks in Section 5 of the paper.  The expectation and variance are crucial for approximating the distribution of the test statistic and calculating the power of the robust watermark detection test.", "section": "5 Robust watermark detection"}]
