A green double arrow (\u21d2) from tail to head indicates that an efficient learner for a task in the setting of the arrow tail can be black-box transformed into an efficient learner for the same task in the setting of the arrow head. Meanwhile, an orange dashed double arrow (==>) from tail to head indicates that an efficient learner for a task in the tail setting can be black-box transformed into an efficient learner for the same task in the head setting, under some additional assumptions. Finally, a red slashed single arrow (\u2192) from tail to head indicates that there is a learning task for which an efficient learner exists in the setting of the arrow tail but no efficient learner can exist in the setting of the arrow head, possibly under some cryptographic assumptions.", "description": "This figure summarizes the computational relationships between several learning paradigms and notions of algorithmic stability, including replicability, online learning, differential privacy, and statistical queries.  Arrows indicate whether efficient transformations exist between these learning settings, with different arrow types indicating different transformation properties (black-box, conditional, or separation).", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
