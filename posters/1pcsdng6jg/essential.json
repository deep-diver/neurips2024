This paper investigates the computational aspects of replicability, exploring its connections to various learning paradigms, including online learning, statistical queries (SQ), and differential privacy.  Existing research has primarily focused on statistical connections, overlooking crucial computational aspects.  This paper tackles this gap.\nThe research uses concept classes to design efficient replicable learners.  It presents a novel replicable lifting framework inspired by prior work that translates efficient replicable learners under uniform marginal distribution to those under any marginal distribution, thus enhancing our understanding of replicability's computational landscape.  The study reveals a computational separation between efficient replicability and online learning, highlighting the distinct nature of these two properties.  Additionally, it demonstrates a transformation from pure differential privacy learners to replicable learners.  These findings significantly advance our understanding of computational stability.", "affiliation": "Yale University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "1PCsDNG6Jg/podcast.wav"}
