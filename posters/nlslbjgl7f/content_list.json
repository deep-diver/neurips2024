It assumes equal importance for all classes, hence equal severity for misclassifications. However, in the task of emotional classification, due to the psychological similarities between emotions, misclassifying a certain emotion into one class may be more severe than another, e.g., misclassifying \u2018excitement\u2019 as \u2018anger\u2019 apparently is more severe than as \u2018awe\u2019. Albeit high meaningful for many applications, metrics capable of measuring these cases of misclassifications in visual emotion recognition tasks have yet to be explored. In this paper, based on Mikel\u2019s emotion wheel from psychology, we propose a novel approach for evaluating the performance in visual emotion recognition, which takes into account the distance on the emotion wheel between different emotions to mimic the psychological nuances of emotions. Experimental results in semi-supervised learning on emotion recognition and user study have shown that our proposed metrics is more effective than the accuracy to assess the performance and conforms to the cognitive laws of human emotions.

Emotional similarity is a significant characteristic of emotions, revealing the commonalities among diverse emotional states in their essence, modes of expression, and influencing factors. And the essence of emotion can be explored through understanding the hierarchical nature of human cognitive processes. The Reverse Hierarchy Theory [14] in neuroscience suggests that, instead of exhibiting absolute object classification ability, humans first recognize coarse-grained categories and then proceed to identify finer-grained detailed information [21, 22]. This process involves comparing with prior information to make a comparative classification [10]. Under the same cognitive mechanism, both emotion recognition and object recognition follow a similar pattern of recognition [24], i.e., progressing from global to local, and from coarse-grained to fine-grained identification processes. And such emotional cognitive process is often characterized by the term Emotion Granularity in psychology [31, 18], where it involves the degree of nuance with which individuals can perceive. It also implies that there exists relative proximity between different emotions. For instance, belonging to positive emotions, the similarity between excitement and awe is greater than that between excitement and anger. This proximity is often associated with a misclassification-similar phenomenon in psychology referred to as \u2018affective biased attention\u2019, which is the tendency to pay more attention to some emotions than others. In complex psychological conditions, people tend to show negative bias compared to positive information, that is, they tend to use more negative information [36]. Though the emotion similarity and affective bias have been considered when evaluating cognitive ability for humans in psychology, the measurement of such ability for emotion recognition methods [19, 8, 25] in computer vision field still remains within the framework of the ordinary classification task. They primarily focus on employing global representation of objects [19], language prompts [8] or a multi-stage perception (entity, attribute and emotion) model [25] to improve the number of correctly classified samples, but totally ignore the influence (or severity) of different misclassifications caused by the similarity between emotions. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the relative distances between emotions are different. And after testing with the recent representative emotion classification methods in terms of both accuracy and severity of misclassification in Fig. 1(b), we observed that, although the classification accuracy has been improved to a high level, the severity of misclassification stayed at the same level or even worse. Therefore, metrics that aligns more closely with psychological models by taking the emotional similarity and the severity of misclassification into account are necessary for the visual emotion recognition task.

In the field of object classification, some researchers began to pay attention to the problem of misclassification and devised methods to measure and reduce mistake severity based on the hierarchical information of labels [1, 12, 4]. For instance, Bertinetto et al.

Many of these researchers have explored the relationship between emotions. Based on Plutchik\u2019s [28] theory that different emotions have different similarities. Zhao et al. [57] proposed the emotional distance for the first time based on Mikel\u2019s Wheel, which is used to calculate the emotional similarity between two pairs of pictures. In addition, Yang et al.

[25] generate pseudo labels through visual language models as auxiliary guidance for multi-stage visual perception. However, due to the ambiguity and subjectivity of emotions, a single image often elicits multiple emotional responses, when dealing with visual emotion recognition tasks, it is more reasonable to use label distribution than single label classification. In [48], they generate sentiment distributions from a single emotion dataset based on emotional distance to solve this problem. Moveover, inspired by the inherent relationship between emotions in psychology. Yang et al. [45] propose a well-based circular structure representation to use prior knowledge to learn visual emotion distribution.

This problem is also described as \u2018cost-sensitive\u2019 by introducing the cost imbalance between different misclassifications in real-world applications, and providing solutions that meet practical needs. Classic problems include bank lending issues, disease diagnosis issues [9, 51, 4], etc. The most common cost-sensitive solution is rescaling, which mainly preprocesses the training set to improve the sensitivity to classification results. Specifically, Turney [35] studies how to choose the correct cost assignment in cost-sensitive classification problems, and further explores the meaning and impact of cost values. Metacost [9] calculates the ideal class for each training sample by estimating the posterior probability density of the training samples and modifies the class of the original training sample to change the new data set. Different from the previous approaches, Zhou et al. [59] pointed out that in addition to the correction of the classification algorithm and dataset, the cost matrix needs to be corrected, which solves the problem that it is often ineffective for multi-class cost-sensitive learning. However, this kind of problem focuses more on the class imbalance of the dataset, and gradually loses interest in the cost of misclassification.

In [15], they train two separate models for coarse-grained and fine-grained, and make the final prediction by calculating the normalized scores of the two models in the reasoning process.

However, this measure is built on a binary philosophy, i.e., only considering whether or not the predicted category matches the true label. In fact, distinguishing between different types of mismatch is meaningful, particularly in the field of emotion classification. For example, due to the similarity between emotions, misclassifying \u2018excitement\u2019 as \u2018awe\u2019 may be acceptable in certain diagnose, while misclassifying it as \u2018sadness\u2019 could lead to severe diagnostic errors in clinic psychology. Based on this reasoning, we therefore define emotional distances to characterize their relative relationships, and further to aid in quantifying the degree of severity of misclassification. Existing psychological models such as CES and DES, either model emotions as completely independent categories or represent them as multidimensional continuous vectors. The former ignores the similarity between emotions, while the latter requires precise measurement of emotions by experts, which can be hard to achieve for visual emotion recognition task. In [57], authors provide a definition between emotional labels based on Mikel\u2019s wheel, where the paired emotional distance is $1+$ \u2018wheel distance\u2019. The \u2018wheel distance\u2019 means the number of steps when moving from one category to another on the wheel like shown in Fig. 2 (a).

We can finally obtain a symmetric cost matrix with each element being the distance between the corresponding emotions. Although our emotional distance is defined based on Mikel\u2019s wheel for classifying eight emotions, it is important to note that when calculating the classification of six emotions based on Ekman\u2019s model, we can still use a similar method for determining emotional distances. To achieve it, we can initially follow the definition used by Mikel\u2019s wheel, calculating the emotional distances for the same emotions present in both models.

This implies that accuracy may be misleadingly high in scenarios of class imbalance. Although directly using the confusion matrix as a metric allows for the consideration of both correct and incorrect classifications (misclassifications), this metric overlooks the distance between emotions in psychology.

How to select an appropriate threshold of pseudo-labeling in the training process has always been a hotspot for semi-supervised learning [5]. Existing methods either use an intuitive constant threshold [32] that is widely adopted in other semi-supervised learning tasks, or a dynamic threshold that varies in terms of the estimated learning status [52]. Considering that EMC can measure the severity of misclassification, we therefore recommend using EMC to dynamically adjust the confidence threshold before each epoch. This is similar to how, in a clinical scenario, a patient not only refers to the doctor\u2019s current confidence in the diagnosis but also takes into account the doctor\u2019s historical reputation (frequency of misdiagnoses and medical errors) to ultimately judge the reliability of the current diagnosis. For semi-supervised emotion recognition tasks, since there are only a few labeled samples available for training, the model can easily overfti these samples, resulting in all correct predictions and thus making it impossible to calculate EMC. To address this situation without introducing additional training data or increasing computational payload, we treat the pseudo-labels generated from weakly augmented unlabeled samples as the ground truth, and use the predicted labels from strongly augmented samples as the model\u2019s predictions to calculate EMC. Since the labels of the same sample should remain consistent under different data augmentation methods, a large EMC indicates that the model provide similar emotional predictions with different augment methods.

However, such models often suffer from the problem of confirmation bias [34], where the model will gradually deepen this error during the learning process. Accumulation of these errors eventually leads to the final model being unable to achieve good classification performances. As both ECC and EMC are designed based on the consideration of the cases of misclassification, which means they can better distinguish the ambiguity of labels, and models selected in terms of ECC or EMC will less effected by the cumulative confirmation bias, providing high-quality labels than those based on ACC. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "To prove that model with higher ECC or EMC is better for pesudo labeling, we train the same network with different loss functions: cross-entropy loss $\\mathcal{L}_{C E}$ and the combination of cross-entropy loss and order-based loss ListMLE [41] as $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{c}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CE}}+\\alpha\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{ListMLE}}$ , where $\\alpha$ is 1 and $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{ListMLE}}$ aims to constrain the final prediction probability of the samples to follow a preset order, thus favoring higher ECC and EMC (proved in Appendix A). This constraint will reduce the severity of misclassification, at the same time, the cost is to reduce ACC [1], specific experiment is in Appendix B. More precisely, we first train the model with $\\mathcal{L}_{C E}$ , once it starts to converge (the model has preliminary ability of recognition), we then keep the same loss function or replace $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ with ${\\mathcal{L}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ to make it continue to focus on the correct classification or focus more on the cases of misclassification. Therefore, models trained solely using $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ exhibit better ACC but limited capability to distinguish error samples, and the quality of the pseudo label is poor. Although the pseudo labels might still be incorrect compared to the ground truth when using a combined loss function for training the model, the pseudo-labels become closer to the ground truth. In such cases, these pseudo labels can still have a positive impact on the training process and thereby improve the model\u2019s accuracy. As we show in Tab. 1, we adopt the state-of-the-art method $\\mathrm{S^{2}}$ -VER [16] as our baseline, as it generates more reliable pseudo labels by calculating the similarity between emotional prototypes and samples, but ignores the error of pseudo labels. We follow the experimental setting of [16] and vary the proportions of the labeled samples as $0.5\\%$ , $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ (corresponding to 80, 800, 1600 label number for FI, and 400, 4000, 8000 label number for EmoSet), it can be observed that under the different settings of the two datasets, our method performs favorably against $\\mathrm{S^{2}}$ -VER by $1\\%$ in accuracy. Meanwhile, our method also far surpasses multiple state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised learning.

The specific experiments are shown in Table 3. And the specific experimental settings are detailed in Appendix C. Since we are only focusing on the impact of emotional rank (emotional distance) on the model, and changing the rank of ground truth label would prevent the model from training on correct classification categories. So we randomly shuffle and reverse the rank of the other labels while keeping the category with the first position in the emotional rank as the ground truth. Then, according to the changed order, use ListMLE for training. As shown in Table 3. Our rank achieve advanced performance in three measures. And the results are worse in reverse rank than random rank, and they are significantly worse than our rank. This shows that our rank is better, in line with human cognition of label rank, and our label rank will help the model learn the emotion category structure. Although the ranking of ground truth has not changed, a reasonable label ranking can often reflect the emotional and visual element relationship between images, which will enable the model to mine the visual and semantic correlation between similar categories, so as to learn a better label semantic structure.
