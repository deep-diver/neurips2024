Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) tackles this by finding solutions that perform well across various data distributions.  However, existing DRO algorithms often lack efficiency and struggle with large datasets and complex uncertainty sets.  These limitations hinder their practical use in real-world scenarios, which often involve high-dimensional datasets and unpredictable data distributions.\n\nThis paper introduces DRAGO, a novel stochastic primal-dual algorithm, designed to overcome these challenges. **DRAGO utilizes variance reduction and incorporates both cyclic and randomized updates to achieve linear convergence.** This significant improvement in speed and efficiency is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically, outperforming existing approaches.  DRAGO shows strong performance across various uncertainty sets and real-world datasets, making it a highly practical tool for real-world DRO applications. The superior complexity guarantee is supported by a detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ujk0XrNTQZ/podcast.wav"}
