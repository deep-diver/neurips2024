Each line represents a different retrieval method: MOPR, MMR, PBM, CLIP-clip, and DebiasCLIP. The results show that MOPR outperforms the other methods by achieving a higher fraction of Top-k cosine similarity while maintaining a lower fraction of Top-k MPR. This demonstrates that MOPR effectively balances retrieval accuracy and proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups.", "section": "Numerical Experiments"}]
