This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and exacerbate existing inequalities. This oversight is problematic as it fails to address the nuanced and often overlapping identities and experiences of many marginalized groups. For example, simply ensuring equal representation for both men and women does not guarantee equitable representation of women from minority racial groups. This research highlights the limitations of current fairness techniques and the need for more sophisticated approaches that account for intersectional identities. \nThis paper introduces Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel metric that quantifies representation across intersectional groups. MPR measures the worst-case deviation between the observed and target distributions over a diverse set of representation statistics. To achieve MPR in retrieval, the researchers developed a practical algorithm called Multi-group Optimized Proportional Retrieval (MOPR).  MOPR efficiently retrieves items that maximize both similarity to a query and proportional representation across intersectional groups. Through extensive experiments, the researchers showed that MOPR outperforms existing methods in balancing both retrieval accuracy and fair representation.  This work emphasizes the critical importance of accounting for intersectional identities when designing fair and equitable AI systems.", "affiliation": "Harvard University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "BRZYhVHvSg/podcast.wav"}
