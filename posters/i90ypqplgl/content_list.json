Previous work focused on the platform perspective, with the goal of setting prices maximizing the gain from trade (the sum of sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 utilities). Gain from trade is, however, potentially unfair to traders, as they may receive highly uneven shares of the total utility. In this work we enforce fairness by rewarding the platform with the fair gain from trade, defined as the minimum between sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 utilities. After showing that any no-regret learning algorithm designed to maximize the sum of the utilities may fail badly with fair gain from trade, we present our main contribution: a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fair gain from trade when, after each interaction, the platform only learns whether each trader accepted the current price. Specifically, we prove the following regret bounds: $\\Theta(\\ln T)$ in the deterministic setting, $\\Omega(T)$ in the stochastic setting, and $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(T^{2/3})$ in the stochastic setting when sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 valuations are independent of each other.

This reward function, however, is oblivious to asymmetries in the utilities of the buyer and the seller caused by $P_{t}$ not being close to the mid-price $(S_{t}+B_{t})/2$ .

This reward function ignores any surplus a trader may achieve at the expense of the other, thus encouraging the platform to set prices $P_{t}$ as close as possible to the mid-price, equalizing the profti of sellers and buyers. We call this new reward function fair gain from trade and denote it by FGFT. Our specific focus on the fair gain from trade objective can be seen as an implementation of the so-called egalitarian rule in social choice theory (sometimes also called the max-min rule or the Rawlsian rule), where one favors the alternative that maximizes the minimum utility of the involved parties to promote fairness. This approach might be especially relevant for online ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, where fairness problems have been previously studied, although in different settings with metrics different from ours (see, e.g., [31]). Our goal is to design algorithms minimizing the regret over $T$ rounds. This is the difference between the (expected) total FGFT achieved by the best fixed price $p^{\\star}$ and the (expected) total FGFT achieved by the algorithm. Note that the two bits received as feedback at the end of each round (i.e., $\\mathbb{I}\\{S_{t}\\leq P_{t}\\}$ and $\\mathbb{I}\\{P_{t}\\leq B_{t}\\})$ ) are not enough to compute bandit feedback (the reward earned by posting the price $P_{t}$ )\u2014neither for FGFT nor for GFT.1 ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our contributions.

This algorithm is built around the key Convolution Lemma (Lemma 1), which shows how one can estimate the expected FGFT through the feedback the learner has access to. Algorithm 1 does so by building uniform estimates for the expected FGFT via a discrete convolution procedure that combines the feedback collected from sellers and buyers across different time steps. We then derive a lower bound matching this rate up to a logarithmic factor (Theorem 3). The lower bound construction leverages the relationship between the feedback and the FGFT to build hard instances of our problem. These hard instances are similar to the ones in the revealing action problem of partial monitoring (see, e.g., [15]), that force the learner to perform a certain amount of costly exploration. An analogous phenomenon shows up even in the deterministic case, where $S_{t}=s$ and $B_{t}=b$ for all $t$ and for some unknown constants $s,b$ . In this simpler setting, we prove that posting some clearly suboptimal but informative prices is unavoidable, showing that no strategy can obtain a regret better than $\\Omega(\\ln T)$ (Theorem 4).

Here, we show that a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ can be achieved for any joint distribution of sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 valuations (Theorem 6), and we show that this rate is optimal up to constant factors, even if we assume that the traders\u2019 valuations are independent of each other (Theorem 7).

When regret is minimized with respect to the gain from trade, the independence of sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 valuations is not enough to guarantee sublinear regret, and an additional smoothness assumption2is required to compensate for the lack of Lipschitzness of GFT. In [9, 10] the optimal regret for GFT under the smoothness assumption turns out to be the same as the optimal rate $\\tilde{\\widetilde{\\Theta}}(T^{2/3})$ achievable for FGFT without smoothness. This happens because the fairness condition confers Lipschitzness to the gain from trade, allowing us to compare against a broader range of distributions. In fact, the smoothness assumption plays no role in the fair version of the problem. To further compare the two settings, note that the issue appearing in [9], i.e., a feedback so poor that is not even sufficient to reconstruct the reward at the posted price, arises here as well. In our case, however, the specific form of the objective requires new ideas\u2014i.e., our new Convolution Lemma (Lemma 1)\u2014to recover usable information about the reward function. Another difference is that, in [9], the realized gain from trade is maximized by posting any price $p\\in[S,B]$ . In our setting, instead, we have to address the more delicate task of locating the midpoint $\\boldsymbol{p}=\\bar{(}S+\\bar{B})/2$ . This is the reason why, as we show in Section 2, even optimal algorithms for bilateral trade can suffer linear regret in our setting. From the technical viewpoint, note that a direct application of the convolution lemma in the 2-bit feedback setting would yield a suboptimal upper bound of $T^{3/4}$ . To obtain the optimal $T^{2/3}$ rate, we carefully define a data-gathering procedure in which each observation contributes to estimating the convolution of the cdfs at all points.

The work [6] considers online prediction with expert advice and studies the problem of combining individually non-discriminatory experts while preserving non-discrimination. An early investigation of fairness in linear bandits is conducted in [23], where the fairness constraints demand that similar action be assigned approximately equal probabilities of being pulled, and the similarity metric must be learned via fairness violation feedback. Fairness in linear bandits is also investigated in [22], where the reward observed by the learner is biased towards a specific group of actions. In [4], the authors study an online binary classification problem with one-sided feedback where the fairness constraint requires the false positive rate to be equal across two groups of incoming users. The paper [19] applies Blackwell\u2019s approachability theory to investigate online learning under group fairness constraints. A different notion of fairness in bandits is considered by [28, 30], where each arm has to be pulled at least a pre-specified fraction of times (see also [8] for related results). This type of fairness requirement is also considered in [32] where the optimal policy is pulling an arm with a probability proportional to its merit (a problem-specific function of the arm\u2019s expected reward). Finally, the work [24] considers a $K$ -armed bandit setting in which pulling an arm yields different rewards for different agents. The algorithm\u2019s goal is to control regret against the optimal Nash Social Welfare (NSW). The NSW of a probability assignment $\\pi$ over the arms is the product of the agents\u2019 reward in expectation according to $\\pi$ .

The goal is to satisfy a given fairness criterion, which is typically not aligned with the maximization of the agents\u2019 utilities. Traditionally, this problem has been studied under the assumption that at the beginning of each round agents report their true utilities [29]. Very recently, the problem was studied in a bandit setting, where only the stochastic utility of the agent receiving the good is revealed [33]. In that setting, there is a finite set of types and the expected utility of agent $i$ for type $j$ is fixed but unknown. The regret is then defined in terms of the geometric mean of the total expected utilities of the agents. Our regret, instead, is defined additively over the minimum of the agents\u2019 utilities in each round, where the utilities of sellers and buyers depend on each other through the price posted by the platform. Our notion of regret can also be viewed as an online version of the Kalai\u2013Smorodinsky solution to the bargaining problem, in the sense that we also strive to equalize the utilities of the two players [25].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
