Since many fundamental objectives are submodular, including coverage, diversity, and entropy, submodular optimization algorithms play an important role in machine learning [18, 8], network analysis [17], and mechanism design [31]. For the canonical problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint, the celebrated greedy algorithm achieves a $_{1-1/e}$ approximation guarantee [27], which is the best approximation guarantee achievable by any polynomial-time algorithm [26]. Motivated by the highly dynamic nature of applications such as influence maximization in social networks and recommender systems on streaming platforms, a recent line of work has studied the problem of dynamic submodular maximization [20, 25, 28, 10, 11, 6, 7].

Very recent work has studied dynamic problems in settings where the algorithm is given as input predictions regarding the stream of updates [14, 22, 9]. This recent work is part of a broader research area called learning-augmented algorithms (or algorithms with predictions). In learning-augmented algorithms, the goal is to design algorithms that achieve an improved performance guarantee when the error of the prediction is small and a bounded guarantee even when the prediction error is arbitrarily large. A lot of the effort in this area has been focused on using predictions to improve the competitive ratio of online algorithms (see, e.g., [23, 30, 33, 24, 12, 3, 4, 19, 15, 5]), and more generally to improve the solution quality of algorithms.

The goal is to maintain, at every time step $t$ , a solution $S_{t}\\subseteq V_{t}$ that is approximately optimal with respect to $V_{t}$ while minimizing the number of queries to $f$ at each time step, which is referred to as the update time. As in [14, 9], we consider a prediction model where, at time $t=0$ , the algorithm is given a prediction regarding the sequence of updates, which can be used for preprocessing. More precisely, at time $t=0$ , the algorithm is given predictions $(\\hat{t}_{a}^{+},\\hat{t}_{a}^{-})$ about the insertion and deletion time of each element $a$ . A dynamic algorithm with predictions consists of two phases. During the precomputation phase at $t=0$ , the algorithm uses the predictions to perform queries before the start of the stream.

Thus, the interesting question is whether it is possible to obtain an improved update time not only when the predictions are exactly correct, but more generally when the error in the predictions is small. An important component of our model is the measure for the prediction error. Given a time window tolerance $w$ , an element $a$ is considered to be correctly predicted if the predicted insertion and deletion times of $a$ are both within $w$ times steps of its true insertion and deletion times.
