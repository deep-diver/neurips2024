It presents the number of queries and function values achieved by three algorithms: DYNAMICWPRED (the proposed algorithm), DYNAMIC (an algorithm without predictions), and OFFLINEGREEDY (an algorithm that uses predictions but is highly sensitive to prediction errors). The results are shown as functions of prediction error (\u03b7), cardinality (k), and window size (w). The figure helps evaluate the performance and robustness of DYNAMICWPRED under various conditions and in comparison to the other approaches.", "section": "7 Experiments"}]
