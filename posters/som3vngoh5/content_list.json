TAP utilizes an attacker LLM to iteratively refine candidate (attack) prompts until one of the refined prompts jailbreaks the target.

This significantly improves upon the prior automated methods for jailbreaking black-box LLMs with interpretable prompts (Table 1). Further, we evaluate TAP\u2019s performance on LLMs protected by a state-of-the-art guardrail (Llama-Guard) and find that it achieves a higher success rate than baselines (Table 2). Furthermore, we evaluate the transferability of the generated prompts and find that the prompts generated by TAP transfer at a similar rate as baselines (Table 3).

Empirical evaluations show that the combination of branching and pruning is important to achieve a higher success rate than previous methods while retaining a low number of queries (Table 4).

It would be interesting to explore whether TAP or other automated methods can also jailbreak LLMs for restricted requests beyond harmful content (such as requests for biased responses or personally identifiable information) [31, 28]. Further, it would be very interesting to evaluate the ability of TAP to generate novel jailbreaks (which are significantly different from existing ones), and designing new methods that substantially improve TAP on this front. Furthermore, our method uses LLMs to evaluate jailbreak success. These evaluations can be inaccurate and improving these evaluations is an important problem for the field of jailbreaking. Finally, one interpretation of TAP is that it is a method for \u201cenhancing\u201d the performance of existing methods.

[52]. However, the results can be different for guidelines that are meaningfully different. Our method uses a judge model to assess the prompts on a scale from 1 to 10. We use an off-the-shelf judge model in our evaluations and it is possible that the scores outputed by this judge model are inaccurate or miscalibrated, which could reduce TAP\u2019s performance. We evaluate the judge model\u2019s false positive and false negative rates in labeling examples as jailbreaks (i.e., assigning them a score of 10): we find that its false positive and false negative rates are not too large\u2013 $.13\\%$ and $0\\%$ respectively (Appendix A.2).

In this work, we improve the efficiency of existing methods for jailbreaking LLMs. The hope is that it helps in improving the alignment of LLMs, e.g., via fine-tuning with the generated prompts.

However, we believe that releasing our findings in full is important for ensuring open research on the vulnerabilities of LLMs. Open research on vulnerabilities is crucial to increase awareness and resources invested in safeguarding these models\u2013which is becoming increasingly important as their use extends beyond isolated chatbots. To minimize the adverse effects of our findings, we have reported them to respective organizations. Further, while we provide an implementation of our method, using it requires a degree of technical knowledge.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
