Existing methods often produce sketchy solutions and fail to capture the nuanced dynamics of multi-agent interactions. This necessitates a new approach that combines real-world experience and reasoning with generative modeling.\nThis paper introduces Learning Before Interaction (LBI), a framework that integrates a language-guided simulator into a multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline.  LBI uses an image tokenizer and a causal transformer to model dynamics, and a bidirectional transformer trained via expert demonstrations to model rewards.  The method's effectiveness is validated by outperforming existing methods on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark. The key contributions are the novel dataset, the interactive simulator design, and the improved answer quality for multi-agent decision-making problems.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Human-Machine Hybrid Augmented Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QWsLks8LCO/podcast.wav"}
