We observe much faster convergence of state activations in certain dimensions therefore indicating the dimensionality of the underlying dynamics of the forward pass is much lower than the defined dimension of the states. We thereby propose to exploit heterogeneous convergence by storing past linear operation results (e.g., fully connected and convolutional layers) and only propagating the state activation when its change exceeds a threshold. Thus, for the already converged dimensions, the computations can be skipped.

They are capable of matching or surpassing state-of-the-art performance in domains such as computer vision [3, 4, 17, 32, 41, 46], language modeling [2] and audio processing [32, 35]. Implicit networks typically model these tasks with certain dynamics represented by the evolution of the intermediate hidden states and are often described as fixed-point equations or differential equations. The implicit models, represented by the deep equilibrium (DEQ) model family, often achieve better parameter efficiency for reaching a similar level of task accuracy as their regular neural network counterparts. Furthermore, the implicit function theorem assists implicit models in avoiding the need for direct differentiation through numerous forward steps, like those required in back-propagation through time, which demands substantial memory for training. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite their compact architectural design with fewer parameters, implicit models frequently require extensive computations during inference to better approximate the fixed point. The fixed point is typically computed with fixed-point iteration methods [4] or other root-solving techniques such as Broyden [7] or Anderson [54] methods, all of which require multiple forward passes of the model. The substantial computational cost at inference time significantly hinders the deployment of implicit models. Various strategies have been developed to reduce this computational burden, including fixed-point reuse [4, 41] to accelerate the convergence of the forward pass for temporally correlated inputs like consecutive video frames, and global early stopping criteria [4] that halt the forward pass once the absolute or relative change of the hidden states norm is below a threshold. However, these approaches uniformly control the termination of updates across all dimensions of the hidden states and they fail to consider the internal structure of the dynamics. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "This work makes a finer-grained inspection of the dynamics of the hidden states update. By analyzing the element-wise trajectory and dimensionality of hidden states update, we observed the heterogeneous convergence phenomenon among implicit models. That is, there exists a significant variance in convergence speeds across different dimensions of the hidden states; and that certain dimensions converge substantially faster than others in the forward pass of an implicit model. Based on this finding, we modified the forward pass update of the DEQ models with the delta updating rule that stores the intermediate results of computationally intensive linear operators and only calculates at dimensions where their changes between two sequential updates exceed a threshold. Our method is orthogonal to other acceleration techniques including fixed-point reuse [4, 32] and early stopping [4, 41] of iterations. Unlike fixed-point reuse acceleration, our method does not assume temporal correlation of inputs i.e. effective even for static. While primarily applied to DEQ-based methods, our technique can be adapted to any iterative method that uses a fixed-point search in the forward pass. We empirically tested our method for two tasks: implicit neural representation (INR) for images and optical flow (OF) estimation. Compared to previous DEQ-based methods, Our approach achieved an $84\\%$ reduction in FLOPs for the INR task and a $73\\%$ and $76\\%$ reduction for the OF task using the Sintel and KITTI datasets, respectively, without significant loss in task accuracy.

For both Fourier and Siren variants of DEQ instantiations, applying the delta rule with training delta threshold $\\tau=1e-4$ reduces the training FLOPs in the forward pass for both phantom gradient and implicit function theorem used for the backward pass. Notice that the training FLOPs reduction level is obtained at the circumstances of fixed-point reuse (Sec. 4.3) for each training epoch and only one fixed-point iteration is executed except for the first epoch. This approach [32] has already significantly reduced the FLOPs required during the training forward pass to an asymptotically constant level [32]. Our method is orthogonal to this technique and can be implemented in conjunction with it.

Later works realized this structured delta activation sparsity on custom hardware [12, 14, 20\u201322] and turned the theoretical FLOPs reduction into runtime acceleration. Another line of work studies similar temporal-dependent delta activation sparsity but with CNNs.

To implement the delta rule in CNN architectures, it is necessary to store the intermediate feature maps of all convolution layers for computing the delta activations.

Although DeltaDEQ also requires storing feature maps, its property of high parameter efficiency could alleviate this issue by requiring fewer feature maps to be stored. Secondly, there is no guarantee that input data from consecutive time steps will produce temporally correlated features.

Our findings confirm that DeltaDEQ maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands across these network types. We provide detailed theoretical FLOPs reductions from our empirical research.

Tab. 4 shows the comparison among using the solvers (Broyden, Anderson) and using fixed-point iterations (Picard, KM). We care mostly about the best possible solving quality each method could get thus we did not use early stopping nor fixed-point reuse and we increased the number of iterations until the performance increase reached a plateau. We found that fixed-point iterations actually outperformed root-solvers in terms of performance controlling the number of iterations, indicating a faster global convergence speed. Moreover, the fixed-point iterations also have an advantage in terms of the best performance reached. Thus we argue that using fixed-point iteration is a better choice for the inference of DEQ models since they not only achieve better task accuracy and have faster convergence speed, but they also require fewer computes and simpler computing patterns.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
