Existing methods like co-teaching lack convergence analysis and are susceptible to getting stuck in local optima. This research addresses these limitations by: 1. **providing a novel theoretical framework that casts co-teaching as an EM iterative process**, showing how its convergence is achieved through continuous optimization of a variational lower bound; and 2. **introducing SRIT**, a new technique that integrates SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) into interactive teaching to improve generalization performance and escape local optima. \nSRIT enhances interactive teaching by incorporating SAM's strength, resulting in a novel sequential optimization process.  Experiments demonstrate that SRIT consistently improves model accuracy and generalization across multiple datasets and noise types compared to standard interactive teaching. The theoretical analysis explains the workings of the approach, while empirical validations showcase its effectiveness in various scenarios.  **This contributes a more robust and efficient strategy for interactive learning**.", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Prw98p1nV0/podcast.wav"}
