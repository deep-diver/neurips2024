The performance of two methods, Co-teaching and the proposed Sharpness Reduction Interactive Teaching (SRIT), are compared. The best accuracy for each condition is highlighted in bold, showcasing SRIT's superior performance across various datasets and noise conditions.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Prw98p1nV0/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Test accuracy (%) on five datasets.

Each dataset is subjected to four different noise types (Symmetric, Pairflip, Tridiagonal, Instance) at two noise ratios (20% and 40%). The table highlights the best accuracy for each dataset and noise condition, providing a quantitative comparison of the two algorithms' performance in noisy environments.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
