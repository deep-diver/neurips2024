Recent advancements utilize piecewise affine functions for mesh extraction; however, non-linear positional encoding in modern neural surface representation learning introduces challenges for existing techniques. This necessitates new methods, especially as non-linear encodings enhance accuracy and speed. \nThis research focuses on trilinear interpolation as a positional encoding. It introduces an analytical mesh extraction method.  The core contribution is a theoretical proof showing that, under eikonal constraints, hypersurfaces within trilinear regions transform into planes. This simplification enables precise mesh extraction. The proposed approach is validated empirically through experiments demonstrating both efficiency and accuracy,  revealing a strong correlation between eikonal loss and hypersurface planarity.
