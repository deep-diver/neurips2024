Current methods using pessimistic value iteration address this by penalizing rewards based on the uncertainty of predicted next states, usually estimated via Monte Carlo sampling; however, this randomness significantly slows convergence. \nThis paper introduces Moment Matching Offline Model-Based Policy Optimization (MOMBO), which uses progressive moment matching to deterministically propagate uncertainty.  **MOMBO approximates next-state distributions with a normal distribution**, and this deterministic propagation is computationally cheaper, allowing for faster convergence and tighter suboptimality bounds.  Empirical results confirm MOMBO's speed and comparable asymptotic performance to sampling-based methods across benchmark tasks.", "affiliation": "University of Southern Denmark", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "OFmclNhp0y/podcast.wav"}
