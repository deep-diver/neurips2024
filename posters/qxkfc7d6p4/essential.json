However, existing FTL methods mainly focus on optimizing transferability within local client domains, ignoring cross-client transferability, and relying on indirect transferability metrics. This often leads to suboptimal global model performance. This paper addresses these issues by developing a novel algorithm, which introduces two key features. First, a protocol for exchanging cross-client Jacobian norms improves transferability. Second, a local regularizer promotes an increase in the average Jacobian norms while reducing variance.  This approach is termed FedGTST (Federated Global Transferability via Statistics Tuning). FedGTST enhances transferability by directly controlling key factors: cross-client Jacobian variance and norm.  The algorithm only communicates scalars (Jacobian norms) for minimal communication overhead.  Through rigorous analysis, the authors established upper bounds on the target loss, showcasing a strong theoretical foundation. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that FedGTST significantly outperforms other baselines, highlighting the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QXkFC7D6p4/podcast.wav"}
