While post-training alignment via human feedback shows promise, these methods are often limited to generative AI settings where humans can interpret and provide feedback on model outputs. In traditional non-generative settings with numerical or categorical outputs, detecting misalignment through single-sample outputs remains challenging, and enforcing alignment during training requires repeating costly training processes. In this paper we consider an alternative strategy. We propose interpreting model alignment through property testing, defining an aligned model $f$ as one belonging to a subset $\\mathcal{P}$ of functions that exhibit specific desired behaviors. We focus on post-processing a pre-trained model $f$ to better align with $\\mathcal{P}$ using conformal risk control. Specifically, we develop a general procedure for converting queries for testing a given property $\\mathcal{P}$ to a collection of loss functions suitable for use in a conformal risk control algorithm. We prove a probabilistic guarantee that the resulting conformal interval around $f$ contains a function approximately satisfying $\\mathcal{P}$ . We exhibit applications of our methodology on a collection of supervised learning datasets for (shape-constrained) properties such as monotonicity and concavity. The general procedure is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of desired properties. Finally, we prove that pre-trained models will always require alignment techniques even as model sizes or training data increase, as long as the training data contains even small biases.

Although the alignment problem is predominantly examined in the context of potential artificial general intelligence (AGI), large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) agents, it also has roots in the modern machine learning pipeline (D\u2019Amour et al., 2022).

Constraining a prediction model during training to maintain monotonicity in this feature can be viewed as a form of alignment. For a pre-trained model $f$ that was trained without such constraints, ensuring monotonically decreasing predictions in this feature can be more complex. This complexity arises particularly in non-generative settings where the user cannot update $f$ or obtain any outputs other than point predictions $f(X)$ for a given input $X$ .

However, another contribution of this paper is to refute this argument in a stylized setting, building on recent advances in the theory of linearized neural networks (Mei and Montanari; Misiakiewicz and Montanari, 2023). Specifically, we show that increasing the size of the training data or the number of parameters in a random feature model (a theoretically tractable neural network proxy where hidden layer weights are randomly initialized and fixed (Rahimi and Recht, 2007)) cannot help it satisfy a property $\\mathcal{P}$ , if the pre-training data has biased labels.

In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n\u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. ", "page_idx": 26}, {"type": "text", "text": "3.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
