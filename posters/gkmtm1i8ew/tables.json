This specific bandit problem is designed to highlight the benefits of the proposed MF-GRAD algorithm by showcasing a situation where some fidelities are sub-optimal for specific arms. The authors use this example to illustrate how their algorithm outperforms existing approaches by dynamically allocating resources and exploiting the concept of optimal fidelity.", "section": "D.1 Further details on the experiments presented in Section 5"}, {"figure_path": "gKMTM1i8Ew/tables/tables_32_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Additional random multi-fidelity bandit model.", "description": "This table presents the parameters for an additional 4x5 multi-fidelity bandit model used in the experiments.

The means are set so that means of arms are slightly increasing over fidelities, creating a more stationary trend over fidelity than previous models.", "section": "D.3 Results on additional domains"}]
