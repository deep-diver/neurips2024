However, combining FL and DP in online settings presents unique challenges, particularly in online prediction from experts (OPE), where an adversary sequentially chooses loss functions.  Prior work mainly focused on single-client DP-OPE, lacking exploration of federated settings and comprehensive analyses of different adversary types. This paper addresses these gaps.\nThis research introduces new algorithms, Fed-DP-OPE-Stoch for stochastic adversaries and Fed-SVT for a specific class of oblivious adversaries (with a low-loss expert).  These algorithms achieve significant per-client regret speed-ups compared to non-federated counterparts while maintaining privacy guarantees and low communication costs. Notably, this research also establishes non-trivial lower bounds demonstrating the inherent difficulty of obtaining speed-ups in the general oblivious adversary setting.  **The experimental results confirm the theoretical findings, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms**.", "affiliation": "Pennsylvania State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "T826pwZLci/podcast.wav"}
