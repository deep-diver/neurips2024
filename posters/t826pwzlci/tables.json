It considers both stochastic and oblivious adversaries, and compares single-client and federated settings.  Metrics include regret (the difference between the algorithm's cumulative loss and that of the best expert), communication cost, and the type of differential privacy guarantee achieved (pure DP or approximate DP).", "section": "2 Preliminaries"}]
