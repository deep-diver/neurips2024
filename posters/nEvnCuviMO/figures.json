[{"figure_path": "nEvnCuviMO/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: A 1-d Euclidean example of voting probabilities. There are two candidates at 0 and 1. The figure on the left shows the voter position between 0 and 1. In the right figure, the voter is in positions to the left of 0. As the distance grows, both candidates look similar to the voter in the probabilistic model but not in deterministic voting. The case of voter positions to the right of 1 is symmetric.", "description": "This figure shows how the probability of voting for a candidate changes with the voter's position relative to the candidates, considering both probabilistic and deterministic voting models.  The left panel illustrates the probabilities when the voter is positioned between the two candidates (at 0 and 1). The right panel shows the probabilities when the voter is further away from both candidates.  The key observation is that as the distance between voter and candidates increases, the probability distributions in the probabilistic models approach uniformity while the deterministic model remains sharply defined.", "section": "Axioms and Model"}, {"figure_path": "nEvnCuviMO/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Here, we illustrate how the distortion bounds on different voting rules vary with m and with the randomness parameters of the two models, PL and PQV, in the limit n\u2192\u221e. Both the x and y axes are on the log scale. We plot the upper bound for Copeland (Theorem 3), the lower bound for RD (Theorem 5), and the matching bounds for Plurality (Theorem 1).", "description": "This figure shows how distortion bounds for Plurality, Copeland, and Random Dictator voting rules change with the number of candidates (m) and the randomness parameters (\u03b8 in the Plackett-Luce model and \u03bb in the Pairwise Quantal Voting model).  The x-axis represents the randomness parameters, and the y-axis represents the distortion.  As randomness decreases (\u03b8 or \u03bb increases), the distortion approaches the deterministic case. The figure highlights how different voting rules are affected by probabilistic voting and the number of candidates.", "section": "Numerical Evaluations"}]
