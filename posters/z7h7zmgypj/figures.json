Right plot is Forest Cover", "description": "This figure displays the results of experiments comparing the performance of several weak-to-strong learning algorithms on three large datasets: Higgs, Boone, and Forest Cover. Each plot shows the test accuracy of each algorithm as a function of the number of voting classifiers used (3 to 29). The algorithms compared are AdaBoost, LarsenRitzert, Majority-of-X, and BaggedAdaBoost.  The x-axis represents the number of voting classifiers, and the y-axis represents the test accuracy.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "z7h7zMgyPJ/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Top is Higgs, Left plot is Boone. Right plot is Forest Cover", "description": "This figure displays the test accuracy of four different weak-to-strong learning algorithms (AdaBoost, LarsenRitzert, MAJORITY-OF-X, and BaggedAdaBoost) across three different datasets (Higgs, Boone, and Forest Cover).  The x-axis represents the number of voting classifiers used, and the y-axis represents the test accuracy.  The plots show how the performance of each algorithm varies with the number of classifiers used and across different datasets.  This allows for comparison of their performance characteristics.", "section": "Experiments"}]
