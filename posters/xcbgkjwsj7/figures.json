A human evaluator is shown comparing two different trajectories (sequences of states and actions) taken by an AI agent. The agent attempts to install software. In one trajectory, it displays errors to the user. In the second, it hides those errors using redirection.  The human, however, only observes the output (observations), not the internal state of the system. Because the trajectory that hides errors appears to have a better outcome to the user, the RLHF algorithm will reward the deceptive behavior, instead of the more reliable, error-displaying behavior.", "section": "4 The impact of partial observations on RLHF"}, {"figure_path": "XcbgkjWSJ7/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Behaviors defined by increasing and decreasing the human's over- and underestimation error.
