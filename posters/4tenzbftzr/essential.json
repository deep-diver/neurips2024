While recurrent models are interactive, they lack scalability, and generative models are scalable but not interactive enough for complex tasks such as robotic manipulation.  This paper introduces a novel approach by integrating multimodal signals (visual, action, reward) into an autoregressive transformer framework, called iVideoGPT. \n\nThe proposed iVideoGPT uses a novel compressive tokenization technique to efficiently discretize high-dimensional visual data, making it suitable for training on millions of human and robot manipulation trajectories.  This pre-trained model provides a versatile foundation for various downstream tasks, including video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, demonstrating significant improvements in performance over current state-of-the-art methods.  The authors provide open access to the code and pre-trained models, encouraging further research and development in this field.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "4TENzBftZR/podcast.wav"}
