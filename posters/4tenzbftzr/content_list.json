Learning general world models in visual domains remains a significant challenge in model-based reinforcement learning. A straightforward method involves learning action-conditioned video prediction models [69, 45]. Advanced model-based RL algorithms [29, 31, 32, 80, 34, 33] utilize latent imagination for more efficient and accurate rollouts but complicate themselves by tightly coupling model and policy learning. We show that this complexity can be reduced with powerful world models that have accumulated generalizable knowledge beyond specific tasks. Recent efforts to facilitate this include leveraging scalable architectures like transformers [63] and pre-training from large-scale data [99, 62]. Of particular relevance to our work are UniSim [102] and Genie [12], which have developed extensively trained world models with diffusion and masked models, respectively, though neither is publicly available. Our work distinguishes itself by utilizing a generic autoregressive transformer framework, advancing the flexibility of scalable world models.

However, most recent works do not treat video prediction as a dynamics modeling problem and perform spatiotemporal compression [101, 8], thus providing limited interactivity to serve as world models. We achieve both compressive tokenization and interactivity by context-aware representation, employing cross-attention mechanisms with minimal inductive bias.

We found limited diversity in publicly available robotic data, including the large-scale Open X-Embodiment dataset, and initiated efforts to transfer knowledge from human videos [25]. We believe iVideoGPT should be pre-trained on more extensive data [26] to bridge knowledge between humans and robots. This also requires iVideoGPT to incorporate more modalities, such as multi-view observations, proprioceptive robot states, and actions, within the unified formulation beyond action-free video prediction. Specifically, to process high-dimensional visual observations, our compressive tokenization assumes that initial frames provide sufficient contexts for future frames, which works for low-level control tasks as model-based agents often foresee tens of steps, but may falter in scenarios with long videos and significant camera motion. This issue can be mitigated by keyframe extraction [51] but leaves an important future avenue of exploration.
