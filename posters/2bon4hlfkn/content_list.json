However, these methods are often heuristic and difficult to apply to general tasks because they typically require domain-specific prior knowledge for training. A more general approach is the recently proposed IR-SDE[22], which does not rely on any prior knowledge. It only requires pairs of high-quality(HQ)/low-quality(LQ) images for training and achieves good results across multiple image restoration tasks. However, like most diffusion-based methods, it requires multi-step sampling for inference, making it difficult to meet the real-time requirements of practical applications.

In a more general description, diffusion models can be described using stochastic differential equations (SDEs)[33, 34]. It achieves this by converting the original data distribution into a fixed Gaussian distribution, then learning the corresponding distribution gradients (score) through a network, and finally gradually reconstructing the original image using SDE solvers or ODE solvers. Most SDEbased methods can generate high-quality samples, however they often require many steps of sampling to accomplish this. Despite the existence of many methods for accelerating sampling[25, 35, 36], it remains challenging to meet the real-time requirements in industrial applications. Recently, the consistency model[37] has been proposed. It aims to map any point on the ODE trajectory of the SDE-based model to its origin. Once trained, the model can achieve one-step inference with some decrease in model performance. The training of consistency models is divided into two approaches: consistency distillation(CD) and consistency training(CT). The former involves distilling training based on the ODE trajectories of a pre-trained SDE model. The latter, while not requiring a pretrained SDE model and can be considered as an independent generative model, typically exhibits lower performance compared to the former[37]. This means that training consistency models often rely on pre-trained models, which inevitably leads to performance degradation.

IR-CM can be trained using consistency distillation (CD) on a pre-trained model, but at the cost of a slight decrease in performance. Therefore, we focus more on consistency training (CT), enabling IR-CM to become an independent image restoration model without relying on any pre-trained checkpoint.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
