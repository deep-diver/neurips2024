However, existing methods like Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) suffer from long inference times due to the use of continuous-time stochastic processes. This necessitates numerical solvers with many steps, limiting efficiency.\nThis research proposes a novel approach using Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF). This method replaces the learning of continuous-time stochastic processes with learning a few transition probabilities in discrete time.  **D-IMF is naturally implemented using Denoising Diffusion GANs (DD-GANs)**, achieving efficiency.  The method also delivers closed-form update formulas for high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, improving understanding.", "affiliation": "Skoltech", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "L3Knnigicu/podcast.wav"}
