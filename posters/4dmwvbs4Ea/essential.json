", "summary": "Offline RL algorithm achieves optimal sample complexity with weak data coverage assumptions via feature-occupancy gradient ascent, offering robust and efficient performance.", "takeaways": ["A new offline reinforcement learning algorithm (FOGAS) is developed that performs gradient ascent in the space of feature occupancies.", "FOGAS achieves optimal sample complexity under the least restrictive data coverage assumptions known in the literature.", "FOGAS is computationally efficient and easy to implement, requiring no prior knowledge of coverage ratio."], "tldr": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) faces challenges in large, complex environments where simulation is difficult or impossible. Existing ORL methods often require strong data coverage assumptions or suffer from suboptimal sample complexity. This limits their applicability in real-world scenarios.  The high dimensionality of many real-world problems adds further complexity.\nThis paper introduces FOGAS, a novel algorithm that addresses these challenges.  FOGAS uses a gradient ascent method in the space of feature occupancies, leading to improved efficiency and sample complexity guarantees. The algorithm is shown to be optimal under weak coverage assumptions, making it particularly suitable for real-world ORL applications where data is often sparse and not uniformly collected.  The method's ease of implementation is also a key advantage.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4dmwvbs4Ea/podcast.wav"}
