It shows the performance of various methods (DDIM, DPM++, LCM, AnimateLCM, AnimateDiff-Lightning, and MCM) using two different teacher models (AnimateDiff and ModelScopeT2V).  The evaluation metrics are FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance) at different sampling steps (1, 2, 4, and 8) and CLIPSIM (CLIP Similarity) at the same steps. Lower FVD scores indicate better video quality, while higher CLIPSIM scores suggest better alignment between generated videos and prompts.
