These layers fail to capture graph data's unique characteristics, potentially limiting GNN performance.  Existing graph-specific normalization methods also lack consistent benefits.\nThis paper introduces GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer.  **GRANOLA leverages the propagation of random node features (RNF) to generate expressive node representations, allowing it to adapt to each graph's unique structure.**  Extensive experiments show that GRANOLA significantly and consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks and architectures.  **The method's superior performance is achieved without increasing the computational complexity of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs).**", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qd8blc0o0F/podcast.wav"}
