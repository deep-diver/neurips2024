The experiment was conducted with a time horizon (T) of 2000. The functions are categorized into two groups: smoother functions without steep gradients or local optima (top three rows) and more challenging functions (bottom five rows). The table shows the mean cumulative regret and standard deviation for each algorithm across the different functions, allowing for a comparison of their performance in different optimization landscapes.", "section": "6.2 Benchmarking Acquisition Functions"}, {"figure_path": "wIE991zhXH/tables/tables_29_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Benchmarking RD for a variety of test utility functions, T = 2000.

The algorithms being compared include MAXMINLCB, DOUBLER, MULTISBM, MAXINP, RUCB, and IDS. The first three rows show the results for smoother functions, while the last five rows show the results for more challenging functions with local optima and steep gradients. The values shown represent the average cumulative regret and the standard error over 20 independent trials.", "section": "6.2 Benchmarking Acquisition Functions"}]
