Subsampling, a common technique to reduce computational costs, implicitly regularizes models in ways not fully understood.  The use of pretrained features is prevalent in machine learning, especially in computer vision and natural language processing, but using them effectively while managing computational burden is crucial. \nThis paper provides a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between observation weighting and explicit ridge regularization.  The researchers show that different weighting matrices and ridge penalty levels lead to asymptotically equivalent estimators.  This equivalence holds for various feature structures and subsampling strategies, and is validated using both synthetic and real-world data with pretrained ResNet models. They develop an efficient cross-validation method based on these theoretical findings and demonstrate its effectiveness in practical applications, confirming existing conjectures and resolving open questions in the field.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "oXCmwwkQTZ/podcast.wav"}
