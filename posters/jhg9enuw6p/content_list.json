Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing ARCHITECT, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. While there are still challenges that the camera parameters and scale of depth are still absent in the generated image, we address those problems by \u201ccontrolling\u201d the diffusion model by hierarchical inpainting. Specifically, having access to ground-truth depth and camera parameters in simulation, we first render a photo-realistic image of only back-grounds in it. Then, we inpaint the foreground in this image, passing the geometric cues in the back-ground to the inpainting model, which informs the camera parameters. This process effectively controls the camera parameters and depth scale for the generated image, facilitating the back-projection from 2D image to 3D point clouds. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.

A major focus in recent works pursuing this direction advocates for data generation in simulated environments [Wang et al., 2023b,a, Ha et al., 2023, Dalal et al., 2023], as simulation offers a cost-effective approach to data collection that scales naturally with computational resources; this thrust holds the potential for producing realistic physics and rendering data, and meanwhile grants access to valuable ground-truth state information for speeding up policy learning. Among the types of data needed for training Embodied AI agents, diverse and realistic environments with the possibility of interacting with surrounding entities is crucial. However, obtaining vivid interactive scene and environment data remains challenging. Recent studies have attempted to tackle this problem by developing generative models for environment creation via various approaches, including procedural generation with predefined rules [Deitke et al., 2022], diffusion-based scene generation [Tang et al., 2023a, Yang et al., 2024b, Feng et al., 2024], and large language model (LLM) guided scene population and design [Wang et al., 2023b, Yang et al., 2024c, Wen et al., 2023].

For example, manually designed environment datasets [Ramakrishnan et al., 2021, Weihs et al., 2021, Li et al., 2023a, Fu et al., 2020a,b] require excessive human effort and are hence inherently difficult to scale. Procedural generation methods [Deitke et al., 2022, Khalifa et al., 2020, Earle et al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2021] rely on predefined rules, which are limited in their ability to learn from and resemble real-world distributions, and struggle to generate open-vocabulary scenes. Large language model (LLM) guided scene generation process [Wang et al., 2023b, Yang et al., 2024c, Wen et al., 2023, Lin et al., 2023, Aguina-Kang et al., 2024, Feng et al., 2024] also presents its own limitations, as LLMs operate in language space and have limited 3D understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing LLM-based scene generation methods still rely on certain simplifications and hand-designed rules, such as primarily focusing on placements of large furniture pieces on the floor or against walls, and only considering simple inter-object relationships such as random placement of small items on top of large background furniture. Therefore, these methods struggle to generate more complex and cluttered object arrangements that are often encountered in daily life, such as \u201can organized dining table\u201d, \u201can office desk drawer cluttered with objects\u201d, or \u201ca shelf of toys\u201d, which typically require nuanced object placement and context-aware positioning.

To this end, we propose ARCHITECT, a generative framework for creating realistic and interactable 3D scenes via diffusion-based 2D inpainting [Podell et al., 2023]. Our pipeline leverages controllable and hierarchical generation in 2D image space. Compared to LLMs which operate in language space, pre-trained image-based generative models are able to better capture scene and object configurations from massive image data readily available, both at the scene level and in fine-grained inter-object spatial information. Pre-trained depth estimation models [Ke et al., 2024, Bhat et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2024a] can then be used to lift the generated 2D static image to 3D environments. However, images created from 2D generative models do not provide accurate camera parameters, which are crucial for reconstructing accurate 3D environments. In addition, the predicted depth images also present scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose to \u201ccontrol\u201d the 2D generative models with 3D constraints via hierachical inpainting. First, we render a photo-realistic image in a simulated empty scene with only a static background, where we have access to ground-truth depth and camera parameters. We then use this image as a template for inpainting the foreground using 2D diffusion models. During this process, the generation respects the camera parameters informed by the geometric cues in the background image and ensures that the inpainted components are both semantically and spatially consistent with existing components in the input image. By generating images this way, we effectively control the camera parameters and depth scale for the generated image, which allows us to project it back to 3D point clouds. Subsequently, utilizing visual recognition models [Kirillov et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023, Ren et al., 2024], we segment the 2D image to obtain the semantics and geometric information of each generated object. These objects are then instantiated in the actual simulated environments, by either retrieving from large-scale asset databases [Deitke et al., 2023a, Mo et al., 2019] or generating using image-to-3D generative models [Xu et al., 2024].

Therefore, we further extend the pipeline to perform iterative and hierarchical inpainting, during which we continuously render new image patches of different locations of the scene to further enhance the complexity when needed. Specifically, given a text description of a target scene, we (i) generate the floor plan following previous works [Yang et al., 2024c, Wen et al., 2023], (ii) add background assets such as walls and floors into a simulated environment, (iii) render images of this empty scene and perform the aforementioned, proposed iterative inpainting process for scene-level generation from multiple camera views, (iv) hierarchically, apply inpainting again at a finer level to place small objects in various semantically plausible locations in the interior space, and (v) finally resulting in a complex 3D scene.

Some works generate only the static mesh of the scene [H\u00f6llein et al., 2023, Schult et al., 2023]; in contrast, ours generates interactive scenes that can be used for downstream embodied AI and robotics tasks. One line of research generates interactive indoor scenes via procedure generation with manually defined rules [Deitke et al., 2022]. The quality and diversity of the generated scenes highly depend on the predefined rules, which demands huge human efforts. Another group of works train a generative model (e.g., transformers or diffusion models) on in-door scene datasets [Fu et al., 2021] and use the trained models for scene generation [Yang et al., 2024b, Feng et al., 2024, Tang et al., 2023a, Paschalidou et al., 2021], and the quality and diversity of the scenes are bounded by the training dataset. Ours differ from these two lines of work as we do not use any manually defined rules nor pre-collected datasets, which might constrain the diversity of the generated scenes. Instead, we achieve higher diversity in the generated scenes by leveraging 2D image generative models that are trained with abundant internet data, which cover a wider distribution of scenes than those generated by manually defined rules or a fixed dataset. Recently, several works employ a Large Language Model (LLM) for indoor scene generation [Wang et al., 2023b, Yang et al., 2024c, Wen et al., 2023], such as floor plan, layout, and object placements. Since the 3D spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs are still limited, the quality and diversity of the generated scenes are still bounded.

We also propose to control this inpainting process by processing geometric cues in the background of a rendered image. This process effectively controls the camera parameters and depth scale for the generated image, allowing us to project it back into 3D point clouds. The scenes generated by ARCHITECT provide realistic and complex environments for downstream Embodied AI and robotics applications.
