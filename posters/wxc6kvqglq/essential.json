Existing approaches often struggle with scalability and interpretability.  The field of Learning for Planning (L4P) aims to address these issues by learning to solve problems from training data but mostly focuses on symbolic representation. This paper explores L4NP (Learning for Numeric Planning). \n\nThe paper introduces GOOSE, a novel framework for L4NP that leverages graph learning. GOOSE employs a new graph kernel (CCWL) that effectively handles both continuous and categorical attributes, enabling data-efficient learning. The framework also incorporates novel ranking formulations for optimizing heuristic functions. Experimental results demonstrate that GOOSE's graph kernels are substantially more efficient than GNNs while offering competitive performance compared to existing domain-independent numeric planners. This research represents a significant advance in L4NP, bridging the gap between efficiency, interpretability, and generalization.", "affiliation": "LAAS-CNRS", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "Wxc6KvQgLq/podcast.wav"}
