These problems pose significant challenges due to their complex feasible set.  Existing methods often struggle with slow convergence or stringent assumptions.  This research focuses on addressing these challenges and improving the efficiency of solving simple bilevel optimization problems.\n\nThe paper introduces AGM-BiO, a novel method employing a cutting-plane approach to locally approximate the lower-level solution set.  **AGM-BiO utilizes an accelerated gradient-based update to efficiently minimize the upper-level objective function.**  The authors provide theoretical guarantees showing that their method achieves optimal or near-optimal convergence rates, especially when dealing with the additional assumption of compact feasible sets or the r-th order H\u00f6lderian error bound condition on the lower-level objective.
