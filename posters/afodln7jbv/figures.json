The algorithms are evaluated based on their infeasibility (how far the solution is from satisfying the constraints) and suboptimality (how far the solution is from the optimal objective value).  The comparison is shown over time and the number of iterations. The results show that the proposed AGM-BIO method generally performs the best in terms of both infeasibility and suboptimality.", "section": "Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "aFOdln7jBV/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of a-IRG, Bi-SG, SEA, R-APM, PB-APG, Bisec-BiO, and AGM-BIO for solving the linear inverse problem.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of several bilevel optimization algorithms, including the proposed AGM-BIO method, on a linear inverse problem.  The plots show the infeasibility and suboptimality gaps over the number of gradient evaluations for two different problem dimensions (n=3 and n=100).  AGM-BIO demonstrates superior performance in terms of infeasibility, consistently converging faster than other methods for both problem sizes.  For suboptimality, AGM-BIO's performance is highly competitive, especially when considering the absolute error. The results are consistent with the theoretical claims, suggesting AGM-BIO's efficiency in solving linear inverse problems.", "section": "Numerical Experiments"}]
