{"importance": "This paper is crucial because **it challenges the current research bias towards instruction optimization in automatic prompt optimization (APO)** and highlights the significant, often overlooked, role of exemplar optimization.  It provides practical methods and valuable insights for researchers to improve LLM performance and opens new avenues for APO research.  The findings are relevant across various LLM applications and could **significantly impact future prompt engineering strategies**.", "summary": "Smart prompt engineering is key to unlocking LLMs' full potential. This paper reveals that cleverly selecting examples (exemplar optimization) can outperform optimizing instructions alone, even with SoTA methods. Combining both techniques yields the best results!", "takeaways": ["Exemplar optimization (EO) is often as important as, or even more important than, instruction optimization (IO) in improving LLM performance.", "Smartly reusing model-generated input-output pairs from validation as exemplars consistently boosts performance on top of IO methods.", "Combining EO and IO methods synergistically improves performance beyond their individual contributions."], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on effective prompt engineering.  Automatic prompt optimization (APO) aims to automate this process, typically focusing on either instruction optimization (IO) or exemplar optimization (EO).  However, current research disproportionately emphasizes IO. This paper systematically compares IO and EO across various tasks.  The study addresses this research gap by comprehensively evaluating both approaches separately and in combination.\nThe findings reveal that EO, even with simple methods like random search, can significantly improve performance, surpassing SoTA IO methods that focus solely on instructions.  Furthermore, the research discovered a synergy between EO and IO: intelligently combining both techniques consistently outperforms either approach in isolation, even with constrained computational budgets. The results suggest a critical need for more balanced research in APO, with greater focus given to EO and its combined application with IO to advance the field.", "affiliation": "Google Cloud AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "IdtoJVWVnX/podcast.wav"}
