The x-axis represents the proportion of candidates observed (t/N), and the y-axis represents the remaining budget (b).  For each group and budget level, there's a threshold (\u03b1k,b). If a candidate's group and rank satisfy the threshold conditions, the algorithm determines if it's the best overall candidate using the remaining budget for inter-group comparison. The different colors represent different groups and the shaded areas represent the acceptance regions for each group under varying budgets.  The decision to skip or make a comparison depends on the candidate's group, rank, and the remaining budget, showing how the acceptance criteria adapt throughout the selection process.", "section": "3 Dynamic threshold algorithm for K groups"}, {"figure_path": "BdGFgKrlHl/figures/figures_4_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Schematic description of a DT algorithm in the case of 3 groups", "description": "The figure shows a visual representation of a dynamic threshold algorithm for three groups.

The right sub-figure shows the corresponding success probability of the single-threshold algorithm with varying budget B and different numbers of groups K.  For all K \u2265 2, as the budget grows to infinity, the optimal threshold converges to 1/e. However, the convergence is slower when the number of groups K is higher. The asymptotic success probability is independent of the probabilities of belonging to each group, and it is equal to a value smaller than 1/e.
