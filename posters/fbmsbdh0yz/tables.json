The left bracket is l and the right bracket is r.", "description": "This figure presents example Boolean vectors computed by a B-RASP program for the Dyck-1 language (depth 2), denoted as L1,2.  The left column shows a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that recognizes L1,2, illustrating the language's structure. The middle column details the Boolean vectors when the input string \"llrrllrlrr\" (which is in L1,2) is processed, while the right column shows the Boolean vectors for the input string \"lrrlllrrrl\" (which is not in L1,2). These vectors demonstrate the intermediate computations within the B-RASP program, ultimately leading to a decision of acceptance or rejection based on the final Boolean vector 'Y'.", "section": "3 Boolean RASP"}, {"figure_path": "FBMsBdH0yz/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Examples related to L1,2 (Dyck-1 of depth 2).
