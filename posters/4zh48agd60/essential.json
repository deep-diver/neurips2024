However, existing methods often fall short, particularly in online/sequential settings where data arrives continuously and labels are costly to obtain. This necessitates risk control in an active learning setting, where you strategically decide which labels to acquire to minimize costs while maintaining safety guarantees.\nThis research introduces a novel framework that addresses this challenge by extending the concept of risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) to anytime-valid and active settings.  The method uses a sophisticated betting strategy and incorporates active learning, enabling users to specify a label budget and dynamically decide which data points to label. The use of machine learning models for risk prediction further enhances the method's efficiency and performance.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4ZH48aGD60/podcast.wav"}
