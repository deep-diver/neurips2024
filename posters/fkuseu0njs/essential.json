Existing methods often struggle with scaling to complex scenarios due to resource constraints. Active learning offers a potential solution to address this. \n\nThis paper introduces Active Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (ASNPE), which integrates active learning into SBI to improve sample efficiency. ASNPE cleverly estimates the usefulness of potential simulation parameters to guide the selection process. This leads to considerable performance gains in travel demand calibration, a computationally expensive, high-dimensional inverse problem.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on real-world traffic networks and SBI benchmark environments, outperforming existing methods.", "affiliation": "USC", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Smart Cities"}, "podcast_path": "fkuseU0nJs/podcast.wav"}
