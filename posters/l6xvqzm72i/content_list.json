Nowadays, the existing deep learning-based methods have mainly been categorized into end-to-end and Retinex-based methods [27].

LightenNet [2] adopted the CNN for single image contrast enhancement. MBLLEN [35] proposed the multi-branch fusion within CNNs to extract rich features. Besides, SNR-Net [56], Restormer [62], LLFormer [22] and SCENet [36] adopted the self-attention mechanism to achieve excellent performance. However, all these end-to-end models mainly depend on the distribution of training dataset and ignore the inherent illumination prior. As contrast, ZeroDCE [15], RUAS [30] and subsequent works [38, 9, 51] represent impressive solutions for image enhancement, as ones precisely using physical priors to enhance the images.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
