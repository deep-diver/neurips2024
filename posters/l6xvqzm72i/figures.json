A broader distribution of bright areas signifies a larger ERF. The receptive field of SNR-Net is large but messy, due to the SNR-aware mechanism, Retinexformer achieves a larger receptive field of the central point, and MambaIR has the global receptive field, but presents the limited local perception. Only our proposed MambaLLIE achieves a global perception ability outwards from central point and preserves the large local receptive field.", "description": "This figure visualizes the effective receptive fields (ERFs) of four different low-light enhancement methods: SNR-Net, Retinexformer, MambaIR, and the authors' proposed MambaLLIE.  The ERF visualization shows the area of the input image that significantly influences each method's output.  A larger, more uniform ERF is desirable. The figure demonstrates that MambaLLIE achieves a superior ERF compared to the other methods, indicating its ability to capture both global and local contextual information effectively.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "l6xVqzm72i/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overall pipeline of the proposed MambaLLIE. Our Global-then-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) integrates Local-enhanced state space module (LESSM) and implicit Retinex-aware selective kernel module (IRSK) with layer normalization as its core, where the maximum and mean maps of low light images can be regarded as a rough illumination prior of GLSSB. Besides, The local-enhanced design essentially introduces the local invariance into state space model, which can integrate the existing directional scan with our local-enhanced term into state space.", "description": "This figure shows the architecture of the proposed MambaLLIE model for low-light image enhancement.  It highlights the key components: the Global-then-Local State Space Block (GLSSB), the Local-Enhanced State Space Module (LESSM), and the Implicit Retinex-aware Selective Kernel Module (IRSK). The diagram illustrates how these modules work together, including the use of layer normalization and how maximum/mean priors are incorporated.  The LESSM enhances the original SSMs by preserving local 2D dependencies, and the IRSK dynamically selects features using spatially-varying operations, adapting to varying inputs.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "l6xVqzm72i/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 8: More qualitative comparisons with SOTAs.
