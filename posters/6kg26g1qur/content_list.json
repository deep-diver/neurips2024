Despite the importance of maximizing ROI in various applications, it remains a challenging problem due to its nature as a ratio of two long-term values: return and accumulated cost. To address this, we formulate the ROI maximizing reinforcement learning problem as linear fractional programming.

The concept of ROI originates from the work of [5] and is widely regarded as a valuable metric by the majority of marketing managers [4]. ROI is calculated by dividing the profit generated from the investment by the cost of the investment, and it is a key indicator for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of various economic decisions and strategies [17]. Maximizing ROI is crucial as a decision with a high ROI yields a higher return at a relatively lower cost.

Previous studies on ROI maximization [3] have focused on multi-armed bandit scenarios, where reward and cost are immediately accessible following a decision. When it comes to sequential decision-making setups like the Markov Decision Process (MDP) that additionally considers a cost function, optimizing a sequence of decisions or a policy to maximize the ratio between return and accumulated cost becomes far more challenging and remains mostly unexplored. This optimization contains two major difficulties: the fractional relationship between the return and accumulated cost of a policy, and the fact that both are longterm quantities collected after a sequence of decisions or actions of the agent. The issues make ROI maximization via existing policy optimization techniques not straightforward, as it includes computing the gradient of the ratio between the two expected values.

The ROI maximization is approached through linear-fractional programming that incorporates the stationary distribution of the policy. We apply the Charnes-Cooper transformation to convert the problem into equivalent linear programming, ROI-LP. Motivated by the DICE RL frameworks, we extend ROI-LP to develop our offline policy optimization algorithm, ROIDICE, by incorporating convex regularization designed to properly regularize the distribution shift. We show that ROIDICE yields a policy with better efficiency than policies from the existing RL-based optimization methods by considering the trade-off between return and accumulated cost.

Consequently, the ultimate performance of the policy optimized with ROIDICE is contingent upon the quality of the provided dataset. Since ROIDICE takes into account both returns and accumulated costs, it is sensitive to the design of the reward and cost functions. For instance, the agent may behave similarly to one trained by an unconstrained RL when the cost function approximates a constant. Conversely, the agent may exhibit behaviors aimed at minimizing costs excessively, akin to laziness, when the cost function varies significantly.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
