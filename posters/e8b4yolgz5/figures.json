The results demonstrate that the Sylvester NCoVs can effectively approximate a wide range of pdfs, including those with multiple modes and complex shapes.", "section": "3.3 Meta-learning universal priors via MetaNCoV"}, {"figure_path": "E8b4yOLGZ5/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Transforming a standard Gaussian pdf into multi-modal target pdfs using Sylvester NCoVs.", "description": "This figure showcases the capability of Sylvester Non-injective Change of Variables (NCoVs) in transforming a standard Gaussian probability density function (pdf) into various multi-modal target pdfs.

The left panel shows the target checkerboard pdf. The middle panel displays the pdf learned by the non-injective Sylvester NCoV. The right panel shows the pdf learned by the injective Sylvester NF.  The comparison highlights the superior ability of non-injective NCoVs to capture complex, non-smooth pdfs compared to their injective counterparts. The results demonstrate the improved fitting capacity of NCoVs in cases where the target distribution does not have full support.", "section": "D Additional experiments"}]
