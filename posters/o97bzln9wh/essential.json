Data pruning offers a solution by reducing the training data, but existing methods struggle with imbalanced or noisy datasets, often resulting in degraded performance. This paper addresses this issue.\nThe paper introduces GDeR, a dynamic soft pruning method that uses trainable prototypes to select a representative and balanced subset of the training data during training. This approach not only accelerates training, but also improves the model's robustness to imbalance and noise, achieving competitive performance with a significantly reduced dataset. Extensive experiments show that GDeR surpasses existing methods in terms of efficiency, balance, and robustness across various datasets and GNN architectures.", "affiliation": "Tongji University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "O97BzlN9Wh/podcast.wav"}
