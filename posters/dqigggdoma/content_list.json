In this work, we introduce Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification (EASI), a novel approach that combines Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Evolutionary Strategy (ES) to address sim-to-real challenges.

However, training these RL controllers requires plenty of trial and error processes, it\u2019s unsafe and costly to complete training tasks in the real world. On the other hand, simulation provides a cheaper and safer way to obtain a vast amount of trial data which is more suitable for RL training.

As one of the most popular sim-to-real methods, Domain Randomization (DR) [3\u20136] injects random noise into observations, actions, and physical parameters during simulated training, which helps agents adapt to different environments, making the policies more robust. However, DR requires a good understanding of the specific domain to determine the appropriate ranges for these random variations. If these ranges are set inappropriately, it can hinder the successful transfer of policies. Additionally, DR often needs longer training time to ensure adaptability of the policy to various environments, and always results in suboptimal and conservative performance[6]. To tackle these challenges, recent attempts have been made to use real-world data for fostering policy transfer to real-world applications. One approach is optimizing simulator parameters to make the simulation more realistic [7\u201314]. Unfortunately, these methods still face challenges, such as the need to iteratively collect large amounts of high-cost real-world data, difficulty in applying to high-dimensional control tasks, and instability in the parameter optimization process.

The discriminator assigns higher scores to state transitions more likely sampled from reality, acting as the fitness function for ES and guiding the evolution of physical parameter distributions.

Previous research has approached sim-to-real transfer from both zero-shot and few-shot perspectives.Zero-shot sim-to-real transfer directly trains a policy capable of operating in reality without using any real-world data. Domain Randomization (DR) is one of the most intuitive and widely applied zero-shot sim-to-real methods[3\u20136]. DR injects random noise into state observations, actions, and physical parameters to enhance the robustness of the policy, allowing the agent to adapt to various environments. However, DR requires specific domain prior knowledge and hand-engineering to determine the distribution of injected random noise, while also suffering from reduced control performance and high training costs. To improve DR, Akkaya et al.[15] used task performance as a metric to develop a curriculum that gradually increases the level of randomization. Mehta et al.[16] employed GAN to identify the most informative parts of the randomization parameter space, focusing more attention on these areas. Furthermore, some zero shot methods [17\u201319] introduced an adaptation module or estimator to predict robot state latent variables or explicitly estimate privileged information that the robot cannot access in reality, allowing the robot to adapt to different reality environments relying only on limited proprioception.

Domain adaptation is one of the approaches that allows policy to generalize to reality. Image adaptation methods [20\u201323] used GAN to transform simulated RGB images in a way that is matched to the reality. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) [24\u201326] suggested action transformation that applying the transformed actions in simulation has the same effects as applying the original actions had on reality. In robotic tasks, domain adaptation methods often require a substantial amount of costly real-world data for effective transfer. Inspired by classic system identification [27\u201329], some efforts focused on optimizing simulators so that the policies trained within them will better adapt to reality. Bayesian optimization was used to find the posterior distribution of simulator parameters based on real-world observations [13, 14, 30]. Chebotar et al.[8] and Chang et al.[31] treated the trajectory mismatch as the cost function and iteratively updated the simulator parameters. Memmel et al. [11] and Marija et al.[32] designed effective real-world exploration policies to sample more informative trajectories for system identification. TuneNet [7] employed supervised learning to train a neural network mapping simulation trajectories to parameter gradients toward the real world. Some approaches [9, 33] used RL to find proper parameters, treating trajectories as RL states and parameters as RL actions. SimGAN [10] employed GAN to distinguish between source and target domain dynamics and enhance the hybrid simulator to make it more realistic.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
