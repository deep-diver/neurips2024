These methods utilize intermediate feature maps $U_{i}$ of size $C_{m}\\times H\\times W$ to capture complementary information and refine spatial relationships. CAFace [9] addresses the computational issue of these approaches with a two-stage feature aggregation method, using these feature maps as style information. This involves assigning $N$ inputs to $M$ global cluster centers and fusing clustered features. CAFace generates an affinity map with $N^{2}$ complexity [15]. The requirement for intermediate feature maps makes these methods incompatible with legacy biometric systems lacking precomputed intermediate features. In contrast, our method relies solely on the penultimate feature representation, typically used for generating biometric templates. Furthermore, Metadata extracted from face images can serve as an alternative source for inferring face quality. [14] introduced a feature aggregation method that integrates metadata (e.g., yaw, pitch, face size) and utilizes a siamese network to determine the relative quality correlations among face images in a set. Additionally, metadata can facilitate fine-grained matching across galleries and probes by identifying faces with similar characteristics.
