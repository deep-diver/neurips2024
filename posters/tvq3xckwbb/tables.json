The left column lists logical concepts (truth values, equality, conjunction, disjunction, implication, universal quantifier, and existential quantifier), and the right column shows their quantitative counterparts (real values [0,\u221e], strict premetric *d*, addition, minimum, subtraction*, aggregator**, infimum).
