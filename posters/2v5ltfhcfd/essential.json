Existing methods often lack performance guarantees. This is particularly concerning for safety-critical AI applications. The unpredictable nature of new data distributions makes reliable performance assessment difficult.  This paper tackles the challenge of providing such performance guarantees. \n\nThe researchers propose a new method based on the theory of partial identification and causal transportability. They leverage causal diagrams to model data generation processes and develop a general estimation technique to compute upper bounds for prediction errors.  Their approach is both rigorous and practical, introducing a gradient-based optimization scheme for scalability and demonstrating effectiveness through experiments with both simulated and real-world datasets. **This leads to improved performance guarantees, particularly valuable for high-stakes AI applications.**", "affiliation": "Columbia University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "2V5LTfhcfd/podcast.wav"}
