Existing solutions employing pixel differences or pre-trained representations have limitations in terms of efficacy and adaptability.  \nThis paper introduces CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor framework that addresses these challenges.  CLOVER uses a text-conditioned video diffusion model to generate visual plans, an embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller to refine actions and initiate replanning as needed.  Experimental results show that CLOVER outperforms prior open-loop methods by a significant margin on standard benchmarks and in real-world settings.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "1ptdkwZbMG/podcast.wav"}
