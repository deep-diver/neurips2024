Speculative decoding accelerates inference by using a small, fast model to generate draft tokens, which a large, accurate model validates. However, a theoretical understanding of this approach was lacking. This paper addresses that gap.  The paper starts by describing the challenges in LLM decoding that stem from the autoregressive nature of transformer models. The decoding process is significantly time-consuming as the model size scales up, which results from each generated token serving as input for future generations. This limitation has led to the development of techniques such as speculative decoding to mitigate this issue. \nThis paper provides a theoretical analysis of speculative decoding using a Markov chain abstraction.  It derives precise formulas for the expected number of rejections, which directly relates to inference time. The study proves that speculative decoding is optimal in a certain class of algorithms, establishing theoretical limits on acceleration. It also explores the trade-off between output quality and inference speed, offering a novel optimization model and revealing the fundamental relationships among LLM components. This theoretical analysis enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the performance of speculative decoding, enabling a more data-driven and informed approach to designing and optimizing efficient decoding algorithms.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "wSqpNeMVLU/podcast.wav"}
