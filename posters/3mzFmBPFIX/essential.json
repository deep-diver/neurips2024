These methods often struggle with high dimensionality, limited data, and the need to maintain energy conservation and entropy stability.  Existing approaches either impose strict constraints, leading to limited expressiveness, or relax these constraints, compromising accuracy and physical realism.  This paper introduces the Neural Metriplectic Systems method that addresses these issues.\nThe proposed Neural Metriplectic Systems (NMS) method uses a novel parametrization of the metriplectic operators, leveraging exterior algebra to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining essential mathematical properties.  NMS demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in various experiments, exhibiting improved accuracy, scalability, and the ability to generalize well to unseen timescales. The method's inherent stability ensures that it produces physically meaningful predictions, even when dealing with limited or incomplete data.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3mzFmBPFIX/podcast.wav"}
