The high inference costs and reliance on expensive GPUs are major obstacles for many researchers. This paper tackles these challenges by exploring ways to build more memory-efficient and faster T2I models using only publicly available datasets and open-source models.\nThe authors present KOALA, two types of efficient T2I models (KOALA-Turbo and KOALA-Lightning), leveraging three key practices: knowledge distillation, utilizing high-resolution images with detailed captions for training, and using step-distilled teacher models to reduce the number of denoising steps. KOALA-Lightning-700M achieves a 4x speedup over SDXL while maintaining quality, and runs on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM, unlike SDXL.  This demonstrates significant progress towards making high-quality T2I synthesis more accessible and practical.", "affiliation": "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "KNDUBpWV9b/podcast.wav"}
