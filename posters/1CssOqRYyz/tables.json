The best and second-best results are highlighted in bold and underlined, respectively.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different point cloud compression methods using two metrics: BD-PSNR (Bitrate-Distortion Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and BD-Rate (Bitrate-Distortion Rate).  The BD-PSNR metric measures the quality of the reconstructed point cloud, while the BD-Rate represents the compression efficiency.  G-PCC (Geometric Point Cloud Compression) serves as a baseline for comparison. The table highlights the best and second-best results for each method and dataset (ShapeNet, ModelNet10, ModelNet40). It also shows the encoding and decoding times for each method.  Higher BD-PSNR values indicate better reconstruction quality, and lower BD-Rate values suggest better compression efficiency.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "1CssOqRYyz/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study of the proposed method. The original Diff-PCC serves as the anchor.", "description": "This table presents the results of ablation studies conducted on the Diff-PCC model.  It shows the impact of removing key components such as the low-frequency and high-frequency feature extractors, and the Chamfer Distance loss term, on the overall BD-PSNR (dB) and BD-Rate (%).  Each row represents a different configuration where one or more components have been removed (indicated by an 'X'), enabling a direct comparison to the performance of the full Diff-PCC model. The results indicate the relative importance of each component in achieving the model's performance.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Studies"}]
