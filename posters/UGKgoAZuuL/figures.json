The left panel shows a schematic of how BGE works by incorporating external data into the contrastive learning process to compare data from different tasks, unlike traditional methods where inter-task data are considered incomparable. The right panel presents t-SNE visualizations of four classes belonging to different tasks, demonstrating that BGE improves the separability of inter-task data compared to existing methods (Fine-tune and CaSSLe).", "section": "3 Proposed method"}, {"figure_path": "UGKgoAZuuL/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance improvement of BGE at CIFAR100 100 tasks setting.
