Existing training strategies often lack consistency across different datasets.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of supervision at specific training steps is limited.  This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel way to assess the robustness of training strategies using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) probability density functions.\n\nTo tackle the issues, FasterDiT proposes a unified accelerating strategy based on experimental results and the proposed SNR analysis. This strategy includes a new supervision method, which improves the efficiency of the training process.  These contributions lead to a significant speedup in training time (7x faster) while maintaining comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art models.  The approach focuses on simplicity and practicality, emphasizing easy implementation and broad applicability.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "cqRgoDFaGN/podcast.wav"}
