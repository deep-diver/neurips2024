This often leads to poor performance on unseen data.  Topological data analysis offers a potential solution by encoding the underlying structure of the data to improve generalization. \nTopoFR leverages persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces.  This unique approach ensures that the crucial structural information of the input data is preserved in the model's learned representation.  In addition, a new hard sample mining strategy focuses the model's learning on the most challenging samples, further enhancing its ability to generalize.  The results show TopoFR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "KVAx5tys2p/podcast.wav"}
