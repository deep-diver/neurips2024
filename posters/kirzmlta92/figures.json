We observe that D3 still achieves the lowest test prediction error.", "description": "This figure shows the results of an experiment comparing three different feature acquisition methods for the Lung Cancer (with Chemo. & Radio.) dataset. The three methods are: D3-feature-selective-acquisition (D3's proposed method), D3-random-acquisition (randomly selecting features), and D3-no-feature-acquisition (using only the initial features).  The y-axis represents the validation MSE, and the x-axis represents the number of generations (iterations of the model improvement loop).  The graph demonstrates that D3's feature-selective acquisition consistently achieves the lowest validation MSE, indicating that its approach to intelligently selecting new features leads to better model performance than random selection or using only the initial features.", "section": "3.3 Feature Acquisition Agent A"}, {"figure_path": "KIrZmlTA92/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: D3 iteratively discovers better models fi.

D3 can effectively acquire and integrate new features, validate, and compare models to achieve a better-fitting model.", "description": "This figure shows how the D3 model improves over iterations.  The y-axis represents the validation MSE, indicating model accuracy. The x-axis shows the number of generations (iterations). The line graph tracks the best-performing model's validation MSE across generations.  Key points are annotated, describing model features and selected features at each generation. The figure demonstrates D3's ability to iteratively refine models by acquiring new features and selecting the best model at each generation.", "section": "3 Data-Driven Discovery (D3)"}]
