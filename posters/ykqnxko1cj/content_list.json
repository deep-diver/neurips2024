In this paper, we systematically investigate what contributes to solid face recognition model training, and reveal that face images with certain degree of similarities to their identity centers show great effectiveness in the performance of trained FR models. Inspired by this, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach (namely Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic Face Generation (CemiFace)) which produces facial samples with various levels of similarity to the subject center, thus allowing to generate face datasets containing effective discriminative samples for training face recognition.

To address such issues, synthetic face dataset generation-based solutions [24\u201328] have been found to gain beneftis in developing effective face recognition models. Existing synthetic face recognition (SFR) methods are frequently built upon recent advances of generative models such as Style-GAN [25, 27], Diffusion methods [24, 27] and 3DMM rendering [26].

However, domain gap issues exists as the model is trained with paired face images belonging to the same identity, while those paired images are not available at the inference stage.

We first split face images in the CASIA-WebFace [36] into various levels of groups according to their similarities to their corresponding subject-level identity centers. Here, the identity center of each subject is obtained by the weight of the linear classification layer, trained using AdaFace [3]. To avoid the impacts caused by different numbers of training samples, we assign around 100k face images to each group representing close similarities to their identity centers. This results in 5 distinct similarity groups. Table 1 reports the performance of model trained on each group and test on five standard face recognition evaluation datasets [37\u201341]. Table 9 in Supplementary material Section B.4 displays the similarity range of each group. We further validate the style variation in Visualization Sec 4.3.2.

This indicates that face images of a certain low similarity to their identity centers (which we refer to as center-based semi-hard samples) are essential for learning highly accurate face recognition models. In contrast, the group whose images have the lowest similarity (i.e., 0.53) to their identity centers obtained the worst performance, which suggests that it is difficult to train an effective face recognition model with the most challenging samples (i.e., the samples are normally hard to be distinguished by human observation).

We ablate the choice of the inquiry data source in Table 4, observing from changing the inquiry data, using 1-shot data of WebFace4M performs slightly better for our CemiFace. However, applying 1-shot WebFace4M to DCFace leads to a performance drop, as there are constraints for DCFace training and generation, e.g. frontal face and no glasses. Then using the challenging 1-shot Flickr as inquiry data brings worse results. This indicates that clean and real inquiry images are beneficial to generate discriminative datasets.

A notable advantage of CemiFace is its independence from a labelled dataset for training.

Consequently, some of the large-scale datasets [13, 15] are abandoned by their collector to avoid Legal Risk.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
