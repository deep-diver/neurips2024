Existing mathematical algorithms are often computationally intractable for large-scale polynomial systems.  This paper explores a novel approach using machine learning to address this challenge. The core issue is the lack of efficient methods to generate sufficient training data (non-Gr\u00f6bner set, Gr\u00f6bner basis pairs) for the machine learning model.  This necessitates the creation of new algebraic solutions for efficient data generation, a significant hurdle for previous attempts at using machine learning in this context.\nThis research proposes a learning-based method to compute Gr\u00f6bner bases using Transformers, overcoming the data generation challenge. It introduces efficient algorithms for generating random Gr\u00f6bner bases and transforming them into non-Gr\u00f6bner forms (backward Gr\u00f6bner problem).  The study also employs a novel hybrid input embedding technique to represent polynomial coefficients effectively. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset generation method is far more efficient than naive approaches and that computing Gr\u00f6bner bases is indeed learnable within a specific class of polynomial systems, **showing the potential of AI in tackling complex mathematical problems**.", "affiliation": "Chiba University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ZRz7XlxBzQ/podcast.wav"}
