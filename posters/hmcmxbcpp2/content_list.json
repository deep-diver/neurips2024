To solve this problem, we propose to densely connect the newly detected nodes to previous nodes in an incremental manner. We design a new form of prompt to control the computational complexity of this dense connecting process linear to the number of new nodes, which is followed by a pruning process to discard less informative edges.

We first construct a hierarchical 3D scene graph online to preserve rich context information of the environment. To speed up the building of scene graph, we propose an incremental updating and pruning strategy, which first densely connects newly registered nodes to all nodes by efficiently prompting the LLM. Then we divide the edges into long-range and short-range to prune them with different strategies. At each step, we divide the scene graph into subgraphs and prompt LLM with hierarchical chain-of-thought to output the probability score of each subgraph. Then the score for each frontier can be acquired by simple interpolation, which is also explainable as we can summarize the decision process of LLM on each subgraph. With the graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower SG-Nav with the ability to give up false positive goal objects and thus correct perception error. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate the great performance of SG-Nav and the effectiveness of our design.

Despite of the great performance, SG-Nav still has several limitations: (1) SG-Nav relies on online 3D instance segmentation method for scene graph construction. Currently we adopt 2D vision-language model and vision foundation model to segment each frame and merge the masks across different frames, which is not end-to-end and 3D-aware. A stronger online 3D instance segmentation model will further boost the performance of SG-Nav. (2) SG-Nav can only handle object-goal navigation yet. However, due to the strong zero-shot generalization ability of LLM and the rich context contained in 3D scene graph, we believe SG-Nav can be further extended to more tasks such as image-goal navigation and vision-and-language navigation.
