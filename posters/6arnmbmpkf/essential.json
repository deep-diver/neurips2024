Existing algorithms for such problems often lack theoretical guarantees or are computationally expensive.  This poses significant challenges for researchers seeking to design efficient and privacy-preserving resource allocation mechanisms.\nThis paper addresses this challenge by introducing the Noisy Dual Mirror Descent (NDMD) algorithm. NDMD uses noisy mirror descent on a dual problem to coordinate allocations while maintaining differential privacy. The authors provide theoretical analysis, showing that the algorithm achieves a near-optimal balance between utility and privacy. They also derive a minimax lower bound, which confirms the algorithm's effectiveness.  Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "6ArNmbMpKF/podcast.wav"}
