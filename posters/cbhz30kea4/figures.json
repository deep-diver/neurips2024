The left panel (a) shows a schematic of the Mountain Car environment. The right panel (b) plots the value sub-optimality against the sample size (n). Each red point represents the average value sub-optimality over 80 Monte Carlo trials, with the shaded area indicating twice the standard error. A linear least-squares fit to the last 6 data points is also shown (blue dashed line) to highlight the convergence rate of approximately -1, much faster than the typical -0.5 convergence rate.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
