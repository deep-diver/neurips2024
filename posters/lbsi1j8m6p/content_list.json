In recent years, machine learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients\u2019 future health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the vast joint search space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we employ surrogate model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover the optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AutoDP framework.

Using these, the machine learning (ML) community has been designing models to predict patients\u2019 future health conditions, e.g., models for mortality prediction [1], diagnosis prediction [2, 3] and hospital readmission [4]. Although most existing machine learning based prediction models are designed to be single-task, i.e. predicting the risk of a single target disease, some works [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] designed multi-task learning (MTL) models to jointly predict multiple targets. The motivation lies in the fact that two or more diseases might be related to each other in terms of sharing common comorbidities, symptoms, risk factors, etc. Consequently, training on related diseases simultaneously can offer additional insights and potentially enhance prediction performance. While multi-task learning offers potential advantages, the existing MTL frameworks for EHR data still suffer from the following limitations.

The task grouping problem [10] involves finding groups of tasks to train jointly. Multi-task learning only provides advantages when the tasks are synergistic, i.e., training on the tasks together makes the model learn general knowledge that helps in performing the tasks better in the test set and prevents overftiting. Thus, given a large set of related tasks in a domain, we may need to group the tasks (allowing tasks to belong to multiple groups) together to create groups of tasks on each of which we will train a model. However, existing works usually rely on human expert discretion to select multiple tasks upfront and create a shared model for those tasks [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Hence, none of them has addressed the general problem of task grouping for EHR data. Moreover, due to the complexity of disease correlations, grouping synergistic tasks together is extremely challenging for human experts. It not only demands substantial effort (trying out every possible task combination) but also introduces the risk of task interference (putting disparate diseases together), potentially leading to performance degradation. Therefore, how to design the appropriate task grouping for MTL on EHR data presents a critical challenge.

Existing works [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] typically rely on hand-crafted architectures for multi-task learning, which consist of a shared EHR encoder followed by several task-specific classifiers. However, due to the large number of possible operations as well as network topologies, manually tuning an optimal architecture for MTL is impossible. Furthermore, the optimal architectures for different task groups might also be distinct. Thus, things can even get worse when the number of tasks grows and different task combinations are involved for joint tuning. Therefore, we need a more efficient and effective approach to design the optimal MTL architectures for EHR data. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Automating the MTL framework design for EHR data. To address the aforementioned challenges, we look to Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) [11]. Since AutoML relies on data-driven approaches to automate the design of machine learning algorithms, it has the potential to improve the design of an MTL framework for EHR data and reduce human interventions. Several attempts have been explored in other domains, e.g., computer vision, to improve the design of task grouping [12, 10, 13] and MTL architectures [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, the exploration of AutoML in healthcare domain remains relatively limited [19].

Morever, currently there exists no end-to-end optimization framework for automating MTL, even in other domains. Current approaches independently address the problems of task grouping and architecture design. First, a line of work [12, 10, 13] solves the task grouping problems by learning the task correlations. They operate under the underlying assumption that MTL architectures are the same across different task groups, which might not be practical nor optimal. Second, researchers also apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [20] to automatically design MTL architectures for a predefined set of tasks [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21]. No existing work has integrated these two approaches to address both problems simultaneously. However, combining them naively could lead to sub-optimal results, as sequential optimization might result in inaccurate estimations for both aspects. Therefore, we need a more generalized AutoML framework for the joint optimization of both task grouping and architecture search. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Overview of the proposed approach. Therefore, in this paper, we show that an integrated approach for multi-task grouping and neural architecture search provides significant improvements.

Second, we apply DARTS [23], an NAS method used in MTL settings in different domains to the EHR domain. We use one shared model for predicting multiple tasks. These adaptations improve over the single-task setting. Second, we explore the impact of automated task grouping in the EHR setting by grouping tasks and finding an optimal NAS model for each task group. This further improves the performance. Finally, we propose an integrated framework an Automated multi-task learning framework, AutoDP, for joint Disease Prediction on electronic health records, which aims at jointly searching for the optimal task grouping and the corresponding neural architectures that maximize the multi-task performance gain. We show that this third method provides the maximal performance gain.

First, we define the joint search space of task combinations and architectures that includes all possible configurations for MTL. We want to find optimal solutions from this search space. To achieve that, the first question is how we can evaluate the performance of each configuration. Performing the ground truth evaluation for every configuration is infeasible, since it requires an entire multi-task learning procedure for each pair of architecture and task combination. Therefore, instead of exhaustively evaluating all the configurations, we build a surrogate model to predict the multi-task gains for any given configurations from the search space. In this way, we only need to evaluate the ground truth gains for a subset of samples from the search space, and use them to train the surrogate model for estimating the rest ones. The intuition is that there exists an underlying mapping from each configuration to the expected multi-task gains; thus it can be learned by a neural network. The remaining question is how we can effectively train the surrogate model using as few samples as possible. To this end, we further propose a progressive sampling strategy to guide the surrogate model training for improving sample efficiency. That is we train the surrogate model through multiple iterations. At every iteration, we select some points from the search space and update the surrogate model accordingly. The selection is conditioned on the current surrogate model and involves both exploitation and exploration. That is, we iteratively select the points that bring higher performance gains and also come from unexplored areas, which makes the training samples represent the whole search space. Eventually, after we obtain the trained surrogate model, we further use it to derive the final optimal task grouping and architectures. Because of the huge search space, it is not practical to use brute-force search. Hence, we develop a greedy search method to find the near-optimal solution.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [20] stands as a prominent research area in AutoML, focusing on the exploration of optimal deep network architectures through a data-driven approach. Although the main stream of NAS focuses on the setting of single task learning, some researchers also try to employ NAS in multi-task learning applications, predominantly for searching computer vision MTL architectures. Notably, studies done by Ahn, et al. [14] and Bragman, et al.

Furthermore, other recent works [16, 17, 18, 21] leverage differentiable search algorithms [23], to determine the optimal sharing patterns across multiple network layers for diverse tasks. Despite the demonstrated advancements, a common limitation is their reliance on human experts to pre-define a set of tasks for joint training. This constraint poses challenges in practical scenarios where task grouping is not readily available, thereby limiting their broader applicability. What is more, their frameworks often search for better MTL architectures on top of one or several backbone architectures such as ResNet [28].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
