It shows the accuracy (CTT) scores, the ability levels (\u03b8), and the l2 scores for four subjects (humanities, languages, science, math) in both languages.  The data helps to evaluate the consistency of model performance and compare it to human responses in different language contexts. The metrics used provide insights into model capabilities and reveal discrepancies between model and human responses.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "Cth1PyCwZt/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Random choice selection performance on English and Portuguese versions of 2022 test 4 subjects.", "description": "This table presents the results of a random choice selection experiment conducted on English and Portuguese versions of a 2022 test for four subjects (Humanities, Languages, Science, and Math).
