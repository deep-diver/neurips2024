Each sub-figure shows a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the index of the parameter matrix, and the y-axis represents the heterogeneity score for each metric. The impact-based metric consistently shows higher heterogeneity scores compared to weights and activations, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between normal and cherry parameters. The higher heterogeneity scores suggest a more significant disparity in parameter importance, with a small subset of parameters exhibiting significantly higher impacts than the majority.", "section": "5 Heterogeneity-based Cherry Parameter Selection"}, {"figure_path": "QAiKLaCrKj/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Scatter plot of parameter impacts in different LLMs. We randomly sampled 4096 parameters from the corresponding parameter matrix.
