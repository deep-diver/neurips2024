Therefore, CRL\u2019s objective is to use the observed data and learn the latent causal generative factors, which include the causal latent variables and their causal relationships.

Despite covering many aspects of interventional CRL, such as parametric versus nonparametric causal models, parametric versus nonparametric transformations, and intervention types, the majority of the existing studies assume that the interventions are singlenode, i.e., exactly one latent variable is intervened in each environment [3\u201310]. This assumption, however, is restrictive in some of the application domains of CRL such as biology and robotics in which generally the subset of nodes intervened in an intervention environment can be fully unknown. For instance, biological perturbations in genomics are imperfect interventions with off-target effects on other genes [11, 12], or interventions on robotics applications are likely to affect multiple causal variables [13].

We establish identifiability results and design algorithms to achieve them under both soft and hard interventions. For this purpose, we delineate connections between UMN interventions and the properties of score functions, i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions.

There are two broad challenges specific to addressing the UMN intervention setting that render it substantially distinct from the single-node (SN) intervention setting. First, in SN interventions, since the learner knows exactly one node is intervened in each environment, it can readily identify the intervention targets up to a permutation. In contrast, in UMN interventions, the learner does not know how many nodes are intervened in each environment. Therefore, the nature of resolving the uncertainty about the intervention targets becomes fundamentally different. An immediate impact of this is that it becomes more challenging to properly capitalize on the statistical diversity embedded in the interventional data. Secondly, in SN interventions, only one causal mechanism changes across the environments. Such sparse variations of the causal mechanisms are a core property leveraged by various existing CRL approaches, e.g., contrastive learning [8], and score-based framework [6, 7]. On the contrary, UMN interventions allow for many concurrent causal mechanism changes, which renders leveraging sparsity patterns in mechanism variations futile. Finally, since intervention targets are unknown, our central algorithmic idea is to properly aggregate the UMN interventional environments to create new distinct environments under which the inherent statistical diversity is more accessible.

The majority of the studies on interventional CRL focus on SN interventions [3\u201310, 14], which can be categorized based on their assumptions on the latent causal model, transformation, and intervention model. Based on this taxonomy, it has been shown that SN hard interventions suffice for identifiability with general latent causal models and linear transformations (one intervention per node) [7], with linear Gaussian latent models and general transformations (one intervention per node) [8], and with general latent models and general transformations (two interventions per node) [6, 9]. For the less restrictive SN soft interventions, identifiability up to ancestors is shown for general latent models and linear transformations [7] and linear Gaussian latent models and general transformations [8]. Furthermore, under additional assumptions such as sufficiently nonlinear latent models, the latent DAG is shown to be perfectly identifiable [7, 10, 14].
