This is problematic because various alignment objectives (like helpfulness, safety, and verbosity) often need to be balanced depending on the context.  Existing solutions, such as creating mixed datasets or retraining for each weighting, are inefficient and resource-intensive.\nThis paper introduces Multi-objective decoding (MOD), an efficient algorithm for decoding the next token as a weighted combination of predictions from multiple base LMs, each trained on different single objectives.  **MOD is training-free**, meaning no retraining is required for new weighting combinations, enabling quicker experimentation.  The paper theoretically demonstrates MOD's optimality under certain conditions and empirically shows significant reward improvements compared to existing methods.
