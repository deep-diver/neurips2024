We begin by creating a virtual specimen containing various initial reconstruction results. We then simulate the imaging process of cryo-EM, incorporating physical priors such as ice gradient and point spread function (PSF) to generate a physical simulation. By adding simple Gaussian noise to the physically simulated results, we introduce randomness within a contrastive learning framework. To enhance training efficiency and performance, we use the particle background mask as a guide for patch sampling. The sampled positive and negative instances are then encoded into multi-scale features for contrastive learning.
