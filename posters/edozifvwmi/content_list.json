As illustrated in Figure 5, our approach consistently achieves the best qualitative results across all datasets in terms of overall noise patterns and the preservation of particle structural information. Traditional methods fail to mimic authentic noise distributions. CycleGAN struggles with convergence due to the breakdown of its bijection assumption. CUT can achieve better visual quality but its performance is still limited due to its random sampling scheme. CycleDiffusion cannot learn the the authentic noise patterns. As shown in Table 1, we also employed Frechet Inception Distance (FID) which is widely used in generative tasks to measure the similarity between generated and real data. Our results significantly outperform existing baseline methods in all five datasets. For additional conditional generated and zero-shot results, please refer to Figure 10 in the appendix.

Our approach outperforms the original Topaz and other baseline methods in terms of the quality of visual picking results. As illustrated in Figure 6, the fine-tuned Topaz model is employed to select particles across five datasets. The original Topaz often mistakenly picks false particles from contaminants, particle aggregations, and ice patches. Our fine-tuned Topaz significantly improves accuracy by reducing the incidence of false positives and redundant particle picks. Table 2 presents the quantitative particle picking results, where we utilize the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) metric that is widely used as particle picking metric [4, 51]. For the calculation of the AUPRC score, we retain the original particle-picking results for comparison against the ground truth labels, without any thresholding. The quantitative comparison shows that the finetuned Topaz using our data achieves the best performance across all datasets.

Given synthetic datasets generated from different baselines, we directly supervise its pose estimation module by minimizing the quadratic error between the matrix entries in the prediction and ground truth. The details of direct supervision and the evaluation metrics as well as the visualization of improved structures (Figure 14) can be found in Appendix C.3.

As the first trial to achieve authentic cryo-EM image generation with a novel combination of physics-based simulation and unpaired noise translation via contrastive learning, CryoGEM does have room for further improvements. First, our physics-based simulation relies on a coarse result as an input, which may be hard to obtain in some challenging cases, e.g., when the target molecule is very small or dynamic. The latest AlphaFold 3 [1] can help predict the structure directly. Furthermore, we sacrifice the generalization capability for a lightweight training framework. In the future, we will train a generalized version of CryoGEM to unlock more real applications. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Conclusion. We have presented the first generative approach in cryo-EM image synthesis, CryoGEM, that marries physics-based simulation with a contrastive noise generation, to enhance downstream deep models, finally improving cryo-EM reconstruction results.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
