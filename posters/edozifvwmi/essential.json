This necessitates extensive and laborious manual data annotation.  The lack of sufficient data hinders the performance of crucial steps in cryo-EM data analysis such as particle picking and pose estimation. \nCryoGEM, a novel physics-informed generative model, addresses this challenge by integrating physics-based cryo-EM simulation with generative unpaired noise translation. It leverages contrastive learning with a mask-guided sampling scheme to generate physically correct synthetic cryo-EM datasets with realistic noise.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryoGEM generates authentic cryo-EM images and significantly improves the performance of existing deep models in downstream tasks, enhancing both particle picking and pose estimation.  **The synthetic dataset produced by CryoGEM serves as valuable training data, overcoming the limitations of real datasets.**", "affiliation": "ShanghaiTech University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "edOZifvwMi/podcast.wav"}
