We use red text to highlight the deficiencies of existing methods and blue text to emphasize our advantages.", "description": "This figure compares three different types of medical VLP methods: alignment-based, reconstruction-based, and the proposed G2D.  Alignment-based methods struggle to learn detailed visual features, while reconstruction-based methods don't effectively align image and text information. The G2D method, using pseudo segmentation and image-text alignment, addresses both issues, enabling learning of dense, clinically relevant features.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "zsXbGJJ7Oo/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Left: Framework of G2D.

The left side illustrates the overall architecture, showing how image and text encoders are used to generate global and dense visual features.  The image encoder (Fe) and the text encoder (Fl) process the input image and text report, respectively.  A vision-language alignment (VLA) task is used to align global image and text features, while a pseudo segmentation (PS) task leverages a pseudo mask generated from an attention mechanism to learn dense visual features using an image decoder (Fd). The right side details the pseudo mask creation pipeline, starting from an aggregated attention map, followed by filtering, edge smoothing, and finally combining with a body mask to produce the final pseudo mask used in the PS task.  This detailed visualization helps to understand how dense visual features are extracted and used within the G2D framework.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "zsXbGJJ7Oo/figures/figures_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Left: Framework of G2D.
