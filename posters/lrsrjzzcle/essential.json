This is a significant challenge, as models trained on biased data may perform poorly on unseen data that have a different distribution of subpopulations.  Addressing this requires innovative techniques to make models more robust and less susceptible to these biases. \nThis paper proposes a new approach called CODA (Correlation-Oriented Disentanglement and Augmentation) to address this issue.  CODA uses a two-stage process. First, it disentangles spurious and causal correlations through a bi-branch encoding and a decoy classifier.  Second, it strategically augments the training data with synthetic samples generated using the disentangled features and a novel reweighted consistency loss.  Experiments on ColoredMNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate that CODA significantly improves model robustness to subpopulation shifts, leading to better generalization performance and reducing the performance gap between different subgroups.", "affiliation": "City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lrSrJZZCle/podcast.wav"}
