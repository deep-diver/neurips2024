The comparison includes the number of parameters, the time steps used, the energy consumption (in mJ), and the accuracy achieved by each model. This allows for an assessment of the trade-off between model complexity, energy efficiency, and accuracy. The table highlights STMixer's ability to achieve competitive accuracy with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption, particularly at very low time steps (T=1).", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "iYcY7KAkSy/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Effect of STMixer components and training methods", "description": "This table shows the ablation study results on CIFAR-100 using the STMixer-4-384-16 model with one time step. By replacing components of the STMixer model with different alternatives, it demonstrates the individual contributions and effects of each component to the model's performance.  The results highlight the importance of the Spiking Token Mixing (STM) module, the Information Protect Spiking Patch Splitting (IPSPS) module, and the surrogate module learning (SML) method in achieving high accuracy.", "section": "5.3 Ablation studies"}, {"figure_path": "iYcY7KAkSy/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Performance comparison of our method with existing methods on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet.
