The reported times reflect the average time spent optimizing each acquisition function during a single iteration of the active learning process.  These times provide insights into the computational cost associated with each method, which is crucial when considering their practical applicability, especially for computationally expensive problems.  The table includes results for both variance-reduction and information-gain methods. The inclusion of representative problems helps evaluate how the runtime changes across different problem complexities.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
