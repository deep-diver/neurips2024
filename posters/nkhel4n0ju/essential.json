However, existing PEFT techniques often suffer from significant performance degradation when there's a large disparity between pre-training and fine-tuning datasets. This issue limits the broader application of PEFT methods, creating a significant challenge for researchers.\n\nTo address this challenge, the authors propose Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning (VFPT). VFPT innovatively integrates the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into prompt embeddings, incorporating both spatial and frequency domain information. This method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency across various tasks with low parameter usage. The authors also provide intuitive visualizations to explain the effectiveness of VFPT, showcasing its simplicity, generality, and superior performance in handling data disparity issues.  **VFPT's success demonstrates a significant advancement in PEFT methods for large vision models.**", "affiliation": "Rochester Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "nkHEl4n0JU/podcast.wav"}
