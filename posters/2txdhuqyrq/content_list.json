Motivated by their remarkable capability in complex distribution modeling and conditional generation, researchers have developed a series of works applying diffusion models for decision-making tasks in recent years [55]. DMs can play various roles in decision-making tasks, such as acting as planners to make better decisions from a longterm perspective [20, 1, 8, 36, 10], serving as policies to support complex multimodal-distribution modeling [38, 50, 6], and working as data synthesizers to assist reinforcement learning (RL) training [33, 51, 16], etc. Among these roles, diffusion planning is the most widely applied paradigm [55]. Unlike auto-regressive planning in previous model-based RL approaches [14, 49, 15], diffusion planning avoids severe compounding errors by directly generating the entire trajectory rather than one-step transition [55]. Also, its powerful conditional generation capability allows planning at the trajectory level without being limited to step-wise shortsightedness. The diffusion planning paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various offline RL tasks, including single-agent RL [27], multi-agent RL [54], meta RL [36], and more.

Such a low decision frequency fails to meet the requirements of numerous real-world applications, e.g. real-time robot control [48] and game AI [39]. The low decision frequency is primarily attributed to modeling a denoising process for a long-horizon trajectory distribution, which requires a heavy neural network backbone and multiple forward passes. A question may arise whether the generation of complete long-horizon trajectories is necessary for successful planning.

Two pioneering frameworks, Diffuser [20] and DD [1], were the first to attempt using diffusion models for trajectory generation and planning in decision-making tasks. Based on these two frameworks, diffusion planning has been continuously improved and applied to various decision-making domains [36, 10, 54, 8, 17, 26, 21]. However, long-horizon estimation and prediction often suffer from potential exponentially increasing variance concerning the temporal horizon, called the \u201ccurse of horizon\u201d [42]. To address this, HDMI [27] is the first algorithm that proposed a hierarchical decision framework to generate sub-goals at the upper level and reach goals at the lower level, achieving improvements in long-horizon tasks. However, HDMI is limited by cluster-based dataset pre-processing to obtain high-quality sub-goal data for upper training. Another concurrent work, HD-DA [5] introduces a similar hierarchical structure and allows the high-level diffusion model to automatically discover sub-goals from the dataset, achieving better results. However, the motivation behind DiffuserLite is completely different, which aims to increase the decision-making frequency of diffusion planning. Also, DiffuserLite allows for more hierarchy levels and refines only the first interval of the previous layer using PRP. Since HD-DA does not ignore redundant information, it fails to achieve a notable frequency increase. Compared to related works, DiffuserLite has more clean plugin design and undoubtedly contributes to increasing decision-making frequency and performance.

Experimental results on various D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuserLite achieves a super-high decision-making frequency of $122.2\\mathrm{Hz}$ $\\mathrm{112.7x}$ faster than previous mainstream frameworks) while maintaining SOTA performance. DiffuserLite provides three generative model backbones to adapt to different requirements and can be flexibly integrated into other diffusion planning algorithms as a plugin. However, DiffuserLite currently has limitations mainly caused by the classifier-free guidance (CFG). CFG sometimes requires adjusting the target condition, which becomes more cumbersome on the multi-level structure of DiffuserLite. In future works, designing better guidance mechanisms, devising an optimal temporal jump adjustment, or integrating all levels in one diffusion model to simplify the framework is worth considering. DiffuserLite may also have some societal impacts, such as expediting the deployment of robotic products that could be utilized for military purposes.

We progressively reduce the model size from DiT-S [40] until the current size setting, and there is still no significant performance drop. This suggests that future works could even explore further reduction of network parameters to achieve faster decision speeds.   \n\u2022 Across all the experiments, we employ DiffuserLite with 3 levels. In Kitchen, we utilize a planning horizon of 49 with temporal jumps for each level set to 16, 4, and 1, respectively. In MuJoCo and Antmaze, we use a planning horizon of 129 with temporal jumps of 32, 8, and 1 for each level, respectively.   \n\u2022 For diffusion models, we use cosine noise schedule [37] for $\\alpha_{s}$ and $\\sigma_{s}$ with diffusion steps $T=1000$ . We employ DDIM [45] to sample trajectories. In MuJoCo and Kitchen, we use 3 sampling steps, while in Antmaze, we use 5 sampling steps.   \n\u2022 For rectified flows, we use the Euler solver with 3 steps for all benchmarks. After one reflow procedure, we can further reduce it to 1 step for MuJoCo and 2 steps for Kitchen and Antmaze.   \n\u2022 All models utilize the AdamW optimizer [31] with a learning rate of $2e-4$ and weight decay of $1e-5$ . We perform 500K gradient updates with a batch size of 256. We do not employ the exponential moving average (EMA) model, as used in [20, 1]. We found that using the EMA model did not yield significant gains in our experiments. For reflow training, we first use the trained rectified flow to generate a 2M dataset with 20 sampling steps. Then we use the same optimizer, but with a learning rate of $2e-5$ , to train the model for 200K gradient steps.   \n\u2022 For conditional sampling, we tune the guidance strength $w$ within the range of $[0,1]$ . In general, a higher guidance strength leads to better performance but may result in unrealistic plans and instability. On the other hand, a lower guidance strength provides more stability but may lead to a decrease in performance. In our implementation of DiffuserLite, we observe that the earlier levels are more closely related to decision-making. In contrast, the later levels only need to ensure reaching the key points provided by the previous levels. Therefore, we only apply conditional sampling to level 0, while the other levels are not guided.   \n\u2022 In MuJoCo, we only utilize the cumulative rewards as the generation condition. However, in Kitchen and Antmaze, we employ the discounted cumulative return and the value of the last generated state as the generation condition. The values are evaluated using a pretrained IQL-value function [24]. We have found that this generation condition is beneficial for training models in reward-sparse environments, as it helps to prevent the model from becoming confused by suboptimal or poor trajectories.   \n\u2022 The inverse dynamic model is implemented as a 3-layer MLP. The first two layers consist of a Linear layer followed by a Mish activation [35] and a LayerNorm [3]. And, the final layer is followed by a Tanh activation. This model utilizes the same optimizer as the diffusion models and is trained for 200K gradient steps.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
