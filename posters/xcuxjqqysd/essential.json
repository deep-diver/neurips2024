This poses significant challenges for personalized medicine, especially in creating models of dynamic physiological processes.  The lack of sufficient labeled data is also a major hurdle for employing supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe researchers address these issues by introducing Med-Real2Sim, a novel method employing physics-informed self-supervised learning. This technique uses a two-step approach. First, a neural network is pre-trained on synthetic data to learn the dynamics of a physics-based model of the physiological process. Then, this model is fine-tuned using real non-invasive patient data to learn a mapping between the data and the model's parameters. This method effectively combines data-driven and mechanistic modeling techniques. This method successfully builds digital twins of cardiac hemodynamics from echocardiography data alone, enabling the accurate simulation of pressure-volume loops and leading to improved disease detection and enabling in-silico trials.
