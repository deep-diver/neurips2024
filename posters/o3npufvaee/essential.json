Existing methods often struggle to generalize well from training data to real-world scenarios, often requiring paired noisy-clean datasets which are expensive and difficult to obtain. Self-supervised methods offer a solution, but their performance is often limited by the difficulty of handling noise correlation in real images.\nSelfFormer addresses these issues with a novel approach. It uses a transformer-based architecture with a directional self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies between pixels and mitigate the impact of noise correlation. This, combined with a pseudo-Siamese network for mutual learning and a gridding scheme for efficiency, leads to significant improvements in real-world image denoising.  **The method outperforms existing self-supervised and clean-image-free methods on benchmark datasets.**", "affiliation": "South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Denoising"}, "podcast_path": "O3nPufVaee/podcast.wav"}
