However, their generalization capabilities remain not well understood.  This paper investigates the impact of latent representation errors, which are inherent in world model learning, on generalization.  It reveals that for the case with zero drift errors, modest errors can surprisingly function as implicit regularization, boosting generalization. However, non-zero drift errors can lead to instability and hinder generalization.\nTo address this challenge, the researchers propose a Jacobian regularization scheme to mitigate the effects of non-zero drift. The method stabilizes training, accelerates convergence, and improves the performance on predictive rollouts. Experimental results in various MuJoCo environments corroborate that the proposed approach not only stabilizes training but also improves performance.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3sWghzJvGd/podcast.wav"}
