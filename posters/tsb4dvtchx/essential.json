However, its theoretical understanding, especially in high-dimensional settings, remains limited. This paper focuses on high-dimensional linear regression, a fundamental model in machine learning, and investigates the statistical properties of adversarial training under l\u221e-perturbation (a common type of data perturbation).  Prior work has primarily focused on asymptotic analysis, lacking non-asymptotic guarantees which are vital in practice. \nThis research provides a non-asymptotic analysis of adversarial training in linear regression.  The authors demonstrate that under specific conditions (such as the restricted eigenvalue condition), the prediction error converges at the minimax rate, up to a logarithmic factor. They further extend their analysis to group adversarial training, showing that it can achieve even better results if the underlying data exhibits group sparsity. These theoretical findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of adversarial training in high-dimensional data and have significant implications for improving the robustness and efficiency of machine learning algorithms.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Tsb4dVtCHx/podcast.wav"}
