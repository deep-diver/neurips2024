Existing methods, such as backpropagation, require excessive memory, while zero-order methods suffer from slow convergence and accuracy issues.  Forward-mode auto-differentiation (AD) shows promise in reducing memory, but its direct application to LLM finetuning leads to poor performance.\nThe paper introduces SPRY, a novel FL algorithm that addresses these challenges. SPRY splits the trainable weights of an LLM among participating clients, allowing each client to compute gradients using forward-mode AD on a smaller subset of weights.  This strategy reduces the memory footprint, improves accuracy, and accelerates convergence.  SPRY's effectiveness is demonstrated empirically across a wide range of language tasks, models, and FL settings, showcasing its significant memory and computational efficiency improvements over existing methods.  Theoretical analysis supports its unbiased gradient estimations under homogeneous data distributions, highlighting its practical value.", "affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "dGQtja9X2C/podcast.wav"}
