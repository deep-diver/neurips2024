The figure visually compares the generated samples to the original MNIST data, highlighting the differences in quality and realism between the approaches.  NRGBoost generates samples that are visually most similar to the original digits, suggesting that its generative modeling approach effectively captures the underlying structure of the tabular MNIST data.  TVAE\u2019s generated samples are still recognizable, but with lower visual fidelity.  TabDDPM\u2019s generated samples, on the other hand, are quite noisy and less coherent.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ojFEP11Cqj/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Joint histogram for the latitude and longitude for the California Housing dataset.", "description": "This figure compares the joint distribution of latitude and longitude from the California Housing dataset with the generated samples produced by different generative models: NRGBoost, DEF (KL), TabDDPM, and TVAE.  The plots visualize how well each model captures the spatial distribution of housing data.  A good generative model should produce a similar distribution to the original data.", "section": "6.2 Sampling"}, {"figure_path": "ojFEP11Cqj/figures/figures_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Downsampled MNIST samples generated by NRGBoost and two tabular DL methods.", "description": "This figure compares the image generation capabilities of NRGBoost with two other deep learning methods for tabular data, TVAE and TabDDPM.  Each method is given the same downsampled MNIST training data, and then asked to generate new samples. The figure shows example images generated by each method, allowing a visual comparison of their outputs. The visual comparison demonstrates that the samples generated by NRGBoost are more similar to real MNIST data than those of other models.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
