It specifically investigates the impact of two types of data augmentation techniques: virtual camera augmentation (VCA) and canonical camera jittering. The results are presented in terms of three commonly used metrics for evaluating stereo depth estimation performance: Absolute Relative Error (Abs.Rel.), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the percentage of pixels with a delta error less than 1.25 (\u03b4 < 1.25). By comparing performance across different augmentation strategies, the table aims to showcase the advantages of incorporating equivariance into the model for improving robustness and generalization.", "section": "4.2 Stereo Depth Estimation"}, {"figure_path": "yRuJqoWoCs/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Stereo depth estimation results compared with the state-of-the-art: DPSNet [27], NAS [31], IIB [57], DeFine [23], DeMoN [49], DeepMVS [26].", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the proposed Equivariant Perceiver IO (EPIO) model's performance on stereo depth estimation against several state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, it analyzes the effects of removing camera information, using Fourier encodings instead of spherical harmonics, removing the equivariant attention module, varying the maximum order of spherical harmonics (lmax), and using a non-equivariant decoder. The results are reported in terms of three metrics: Absolute Relative error (Abs. Rel.), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the percentage of pixels with error less than 1.25 (\u03b4 < 1.25).
