The comparison is made across several state-of-the-art methods (RED, DGP, SNIPS, DDRM, DDNM, GDP) and the proposed BIR-D method. The metrics used for comparison are PSNR, SSIM, Consistency, and FID.  Higher PSNR and SSIM values generally indicate better image quality, while lower FID and Consistency values suggest better image fidelity and fewer inconsistencies.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "NbFOrcwqbR/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative comparison among various zero-shot learning methods of low-light enhancement task on LOL [22] and VE-LOL-L [23] Bold font represents the best metric result.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different zero-shot learning methods for low-light image enhancement.  It evaluates the performance on two datasets, LOL and VE-LOL-L, using metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, LOE, FID, and PI.  The best result for each metric is highlighted in bold font.
