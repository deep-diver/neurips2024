The classical EXP4 algorithm, which is frequently used in such scenarios, doesn't account for this. Consequently, it often leads to suboptimal decisions, resulting in accumulated losses.  This paper introduces the problem of prediction with expert advice under bandit feedback, specifically focusing on scenarios where abstaining from making a prediction is an option.  The existing approaches have limitations in handling this abstention efficiently.\nThe paper proposes a novel algorithm called Confidence-Rated Bandits with Abstentions (CBA). CBA specifically incorporates the abstention action, leading to significantly improved reward bounds compared to EXP4. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of CBA both theoretically through improved regret bounds and experimentally on various datasets.  Furthermore, they extend CBA to address the complex problem of adversarial contextual bandits, showcasing its applicability across different contexts and its superior performance over previous methods.  CBA also achieves a runtime reduction for certain types of data, making it more efficient for high-dimensional problems.", "affiliation": "Alan Turing Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "l04i6dPMxK/podcast.wav"}
