The success rate is measured across three different sizes of QR codes (3cm x 3cm, 5cm x 5cm, and 7cm x 7cm) and two angles (45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0). Three different QR code scanners (Scanner, TikTok, and WeChat) were used to assess the scannability. The high success rates demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the generated QR codes in various practical settings.", "section": "4.3 Quantitative Comparsion"}, {"figure_path": "rvBabL7DUu/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 6: Comparison of average face feature distance d and average Aesbench scores Ba. [Key: Best]", "description": "This table quantitatively compares the performance of Face2QR with ArtCoder and Text2QR in terms of face ID preservation and aesthetic quality.  Face feature distance (d) measures the similarity between the generated QR code's facial features and the original image's facial features; a higher value indicates better preservation.  The Aesbench score (Ba) provides an objective aesthetic quality assessment, with higher scores representing better aesthetics.  Face2QR demonstrates superior performance across both metrics.", "section": "4.2 Qualitative Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "rvBabL7DUu/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Visual comparison of different methods.", "description": "This table presents a qualitative comparison of Face2QR against other state-of-the-art aesthetic QR code generation techniques, including QArt, Halftone QR code, ArtCoder, and Text2QR.
