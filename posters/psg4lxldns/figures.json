The shaded area represents the feasible region of policies in the LP formulation. The optimal policy is a corner point of this polytope, and its distance from the nearest suboptimal corner point defines the hardness gap \u0394. A larger gap indicates an easier problem instance, while a smaller gap indicates a harder problem instance.", "section": "2.1 Characterization of Instance Hardness"}, {"figure_path": "psG4LXlDNs/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The computational performance of Algorithm 2.

The x-axis represents the size of N, while the y-axis represents the error term. The error term decreases as N increases, suggesting that the performance of the algorithm improves with more samples.", "section": "A Numerical Experiments"}]
