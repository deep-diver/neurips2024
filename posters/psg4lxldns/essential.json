However, existing approaches often rely on conservative worst-case bounds, leading to suboptimal performance in practice.  A key challenge is the lack of optimal, problem-dependent guarantees, which are more accurate than worst-case bounds. This hinders progress towards developing more efficient algorithms. \nThis paper tackles these issues by developing a novel algorithm for CMDPs. The algorithm operates in the primal space by resolving a primal linear program (LP) adaptively.  By characterizing instance hardness via LP basis, the algorithm efficiently identifies an optimal basis and resolves the LP adaptively.  This results in a significantly improved sample complexity bound of \u00d5(1/\u03b5), surpassing the state-of-the-art O(1/\u03b5\u00b2) bound.  The improved complexity is achieved by utilizing instance-dependent parameters and adaptive updates of the linear program. The paper's contributions are a significant advancement in reinforcement learning theory and algorithm design for CMDPs.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "psG4LXlDNs/podcast.wav"}
