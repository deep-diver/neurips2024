Best performances are highlighted in bold.", "description": "This table compares the computational efficiency (measured in Giga FLOPs) of COSMIC against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines for satellite image compression.  It shows the number of FLOPS required by each method's encoder to process a single image tile, as well as the resulting performance metrics: PSNR, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and bits per pixel (bpp). The lower the FLOPS value, the more efficient the encoder, allowing for deployment on resource-constrained satellite hardware.  COSMIC demonstrates significantly lower FLOPS than the other methods while maintaining competitive performance metrics.", "section": "5.3 Encoder efficiency analysis"}, {"figure_path": "itbKmreqUZ/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Effect on image classification model.", "description": "This table presents the impact of different image compression methods on the accuracy of an image classification model.  The \"Original\" column shows the accuracy of the classification model on the uncompressed images.  The subsequent columns show the change in classification accuracy (percentage decrease) after compressing the images using various methods.  The results are shown for three different numbers of image categories (classes) in the classification model: 10, 15 and 20.  A negative percentage indicates a decrease in accuracy.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "itbKmreqUZ/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: The results of different random seeds for fMoW dataset.", "description": "This table presents the results obtained using different random seeds for the fMoW dataset.
