In general, multi-agent cooperation research is categorized into two prominent areas: pure-motive cooperation and mixed-motive cooperation [Du et al., 2023, McKee et al., 2020]. Recent progress in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been primarily focusing on pure-motive cooperation, also known as common payoff games. This game models situations where each agent\u2019s individual goal fully aligns with the collective objectives [Yu et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2020, Zhong et al., 2024, Li et al., 2024].

One popular approach is to align objectives as per existing mechanisms in cooperative games, such as reputation [Anastassacos et al., 2021], norms [Vinitsky et al., 2023], and contracts [Hughes et al., 2020]. Another prevalent method leverages intrinsic motivation to align individual and collective objectives, enhancing altruistic collaboration by integrating heuristic knowledge into the incentive function. Conventionally, some works accumulate individual rewards with the group to promote altruistic conduct [Hostallero et al., 2020, Peysakhovich and Lerer, 2018, Apt and Sch\u00e4fer, 2014, Roesch et al., 2024]. Furthermore, some studies derive more sophisticated preference signals from the rewards of other agents [Hughes et al., 2018, McKee et al., 2020]. Additionally, several approaches aim to learn the potential influences of an agent\u2019s actions on others [Yang et al., 2020, Jaques et al., 2019, Lu et al., 2022]. Most of these algorithms rely heavily on carefully crafted designs, necessitating significant human expertise and detailed domain knowledge. On the other hand, several studies leverage Nash equilibria and related game theory concepts, such as the price of anarchy, to automatically modify rewards by learning additional weights that adjust the original objectives [Gemp et al., 2022, Kwon et al., 2023].

In addition to commonly used testbeds like the public goods matrix game and sequential social dilemma games (Cleanup and Harvest) [Leibo et al., 2017], which are limited in terms of agent scale, action space, and task complexity, we introduce a more complex mixed-motive environment called SelfishMMM2, an adaptation of the MMM2 map from the StarCraft II game [Samvelyan et al., 2019]. Selfish-MMM2 offers the following significant improvements over other mixed-motive games: it supports large-scale scenarios with 10 heterogeneous controlled agents facing 11 enemies, features a large action space with a size of $18^{10}$ , which vastly exceeds the action spaces in Cleanup $9^{5}$ and Harvest $8^{5}$ that are limited to 5 homogeneous agents.

Mixed-motive cooperation refers to scenarios where the group\u2019s objectives are sometimes aligned and at other times confilcted [Philip S. Gallo and McClintock, 1965]. Recently, there has been a surge in academic interest in the Sequential Social Dilemma (SSD) [Leibo et al., 2017], which expands the concept from its roots in matrix games [Macy and Flache, 2002] to Markov games. Prosocial [Peysakhovich and Lerer, 2018] improves collective performance by blending individual rewards to redraft the agent\u2019s overall utility. Inequity aversion further integrates the concept into Markov games by adding envy (disadvantageous inequality) and guilt (advantageous inequality) rewards to the original individual rewards [Hughes et al., 2018]. To further promote cooperation, the gifting mechanism\u2014a crucial strategy in mixed-motive cooperation [Lupu and Precup, 2020]\u2014allows agents to influence each other\u2019s reward functions through peer rewarding. Besides, PED-DQN [Hostallero et al., 2020] introduces an automatic reward-shaping MARL method that gradually adjusts rewards to shift agents\u2019 actions from their perceived equilibrium towards more cooperative outcomes. Social Value Orientation (SVO) strategy introduces a unique shared rewardsbased compensation approach, encouraging behavior modifications in line with interdependence theory [McKee et al., 2020]. The LIO strategy bypasses the need to modify extrinsic rewards by empowering an agent to directly influence its partner\u2019s actions [Yang et al., 2020]. Meanwhile, other studies introduce new cooperative mechanisms such as incorporating a reputation model [McKee et al., 2021], social norms [Vinitsky et al., 2023]. Recently, Roesch et al. [2024] proposed a selfishness level method that incorporates social welfare into individual rewards to enhance altruistic cooperation. Additionally, several works have explored automatically modifying rewards online. D3C [Gemp et al., 2022] learns to mix rewards to improve efficiency in a Nash equilibrium. Kwon et al. [2023] extended D3C by addressing the problem of automatically modifying individual agent objectives to optimize a desired global objective. Despite these advances, many current studies lack both cost efficiency in design and theoretical analysis of alignment and convergence. To address this, our study applies a gradient perspective to align goals and further investigates the learning dynamics of our proposed method.

Our proposed AgA is fundamentally a gradient adjustment methodology, making gradient-based optimization methods highly relevant to the context of this paper. Methods based on gradient have been developed to find stationary points, such as the Nash equilibrium or stable fixed points. Optimistic Mirror Descent leverages historical data to extrapolate subsequent gradients Daskalakis et al. [2018], while Gidel et al. [2019] extends this concept by advocating averaging methodologies and variants of extrapolation techniques. Consensus gradient adjustment, or consensus optimization, is a technique that embeds a consensus agreement term within the gradient to ensure its convergence [Mescheder et al., 2017]. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) utilizes information from other players to compute one player\u2019s anticipated learning steps [Foerster et al., 2018]. Subsequently, Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS) [Letcher et al., 2019b] and Consistent Opponent-Learning Awareness (COLA) [Willi et al., 2022] methods have enhanced the LOLA algorithm, targeting convergence assurance and inconsistency elimination, respectively. Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (SGA) alters the update direction towards the stable fixed points based on a novel decomposition of game dynamics [Balduzzi et al., 2018, Letcher et al., 2019a]. Recently, Learning to Play Games (L2PG) ensures convergence towards a stable fixed point by predicting updates to players\u2019 parameters derived from historical trajectories [Chen et al., 2023]. However, these methods, while focusing on zero-sum or general sum games, could potentially act counter to their individual interests, as they may prioritize stability over minimizing personal loss.

Neglecting rising pollution levels ultimately ceases apple production, thus setting up a trade-off between individual gains and communal welfare. In contrast, the Harvest scenario compensates agents for apple collection, with the regeneration of apples being ideally dependent on the proximity to other apples.

By facilitating effective cooperation among agents with different motivations, our approach can be applied to domains such as video games, autonomous systems, smart cities, and decentralized resource allocation.

AgA can be easily incorporated into any centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) framework of MARL. In a typical CTDE framework, each agent, denoted as $i$ , strives to learn a policy that employs local observations to prompt a distribution over personal actions. The unique characteristic during the centralized learning phase is that agents gain supplementary information from their peers that is inaccessible during the execution stage. Furthermore, a centralized critic often operates in tandem in CTDE settings, leveraging shared information and evaluating individual agent policies\u2019 potency. To incorporate our proposed AgA algorithm into CTDE frameworks, supplementary reward exchanges between agents are required, offering the essential inputs for Algorithm 1. The individual losses are calculated from individual rewards conforming to established MARL algorithm framework, such as IPPO [de Witt et al., 2020] or MAPPO [Yu et al., 2022]. Here, the collective loss $\\ell_{c}$ is calculated according to individual rewards; for example, it could be a sum of individual rewards or an elementary transformation thereof. Furthermore, the AgA algorithm requires a magnitude value of the alignment parameter $\\lambda$ , which should be a positive entity. The sign of $\\lambda$ is then calculated in line 5 of Algorithm 1 and is based on each gradient component calculated in lines 2-4.
