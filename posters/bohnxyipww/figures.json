(3) C-LDP-C: Corruption happens before and after the LDP mechanism.

The x-axis represents the sample size (n), and the y-axis represents the mean estimation error. Each plot shows the results for both LTC (LDP-then-corruption) and CTL (corruption-then-LDP) settings. The plots are grouped by corruption level (\u03b1) and privacy budget (\u03b5). The results demonstrate that the mean estimation error is higher under LTC than under CTL, and the difference increases as the privacy budget decreases or the corruption level increases. The results are consistent with the theoretical findings in Theorem 1, which provides a tight characterization of the mean estimation error under both LTC and CTL settings.", "section": "A Simulations"}, {"figure_path": "BOhnXyIPWW/figures/figures_20_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Mean estimation error with weak Huber corruption in Definition 8 under LTC and CTL settings.", "description": "This figure shows the mean estimation error under weak Huber corruption for different sample sizes (n).
