Existing sparse attention methods like Exphormer help but may still require many edges, impacting scalability. This necessitates finding efficient methods to reduce the number of edges used in attention mechanisms without sacrificing performance.  The paper investigates this problem and seeks to improve the efficiency of graph transformers on large graphs.\n\nThis paper introduces Spexphormer, a novel two-stage training method. It first trains a narrow network to identify important edges and then uses this information to train a wider network on a sparser graph. The authors show theoretically and experimentally that attention scores remain consistent across network widths. This allows them to substantially reduce the memory footprint of training large-scale Graph Transformers while maintaining competitive performance on various graph datasets.  **Spexphormer offers a significant improvement in scalability for graph neural networks.**", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "K3k4bWuNnk/podcast.wav"}
