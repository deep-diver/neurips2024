The study compares the performance of the full ID\u00b3 model against variations where components such as the reversed likelihood score, attribute conditioning, and the anchor generation method are removed or altered.  The results show the relative contribution of each component to the overall accuracy.", "section": "4.3.2 Quantitative Results"}, {"figure_path": "x4HMnqs6IE/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: SOTA Comparison.
