Current methods struggle to generate diverse yet identity-consistent synthetic faces, hindering the performance of trained face recognition models.  This limitation arises from the difficulty in balancing inter-class diversity (differences between identities), intra-class diversity (variations within an identity), and intra-class identity preservation (consistency of an individual's features across different images).\nThe researchers introduce ID\u00b3, a novel diffusion-based SFR model that directly addresses these issues. ID\u00b3 leverages an innovative ID-preserving loss function and a corresponding sampling algorithm to generate high-quality synthetic face images that maintain identity while exhibiting both inter-class and intra-class diversity.  Rigorous testing on five challenging benchmarks shows that ID\u00b3 significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize privacy-preserving face recognition.", "affiliation": "Tencent Youtu Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "x4HMnqs6IE/podcast.wav"}
