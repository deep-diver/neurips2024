The metrics used are PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity). Higher values for PSNR and SSIM indicate better visual quality, while a lower LPIPS value indicates better perceptual similarity to the ground truth. The results demonstrate that LiveScene significantly outperforms other methods, achieving the best performance across all three metrics on the synthetic dataset and the best PSNR on the controllable dataset.", "section": "5.1 View Synthesis Quality Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "Jkt42QYyEH/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative results on OmniSim Dataset.
