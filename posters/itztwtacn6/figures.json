[{"figure_path": "itztwTAcN6/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Approximation provided by sigmoid activation function.", "description": "The figure shows a sigmoid activation function used to approximate a piecewise constant function.  The horizontal axis represents the predictor values and the vertical axis represents the loss value. The sigmoid function smoothly transitions between two horizontal lines representing the minimum loss for each class (\u03b1\u2212 and \u03b1+). This illustrates how a sigmoid can approximate a best-in-class classifier composed of different constant values for each class, which is relevant for the discussion of minimizability gaps in the paper.", "section": "6.3 Small surrogate minimizability gaps"}]
