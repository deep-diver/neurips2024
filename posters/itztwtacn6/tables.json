Each row shows a different surrogate loss function (e.g., exponential loss, logistic loss, squared hinge loss, hinge loss), along with the corresponding H-consistency bound.  These bounds relate the estimation error of the zero-one loss to the estimation error of the surrogate loss, including minimizability gaps (Me). The H-consistency bound shows how quickly the zero-one loss estimation error decreases as the surrogate loss estimation error is minimized.", "section": "E Examples of H-consistency bounds"}, {"figure_path": "itztwTAcN6/tables/tables_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Examples of H-consistency bounds for comp-sum losses.", "description": "This table presents examples of H-consistency bounds for several comp-sum loss functions.  Each row shows a different comp-sum loss function (defined by its \u03a6(u) function) and the corresponding H-consistency bound in terms of the zero-one loss, the surrogate loss, and their respective minimizability gaps.
