The comparison is made across four metrics: the number of parameters (Params), the number of floating-point operations (GFLOPS), the memory cost (Mem), and the training time (TT). GEM (Single) refers to the GEM model without the relation discovery module.  GEM (Full) represents the full GEM model including the relation discovery module. The results show the relative computational efficiency of each model, offering insights into their practical applicability based on resource constraints.", "section": "4.2 Quantitative Results"}, {"figure_path": "a1wf2N967T/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Disentanglement metrics among VAE, \u03b2-VAE and GEM.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the disentanglement performance of three different models: VAE, \u03b2-VAE, and the proposed GEM model.  Four metrics are used to evaluate disentanglement: Mutual Information Gap (MIG), Inter-representation Similarity (IRS), Mutual Information (MI), and total Information (Info). Higher scores generally indicate better disentanglement.
