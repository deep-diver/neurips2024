However, noise accumulation along this path often distorts the explanation. Existing solutions focus on finding alternative paths, but they overlook the critical issue that intermediate images may not accurately reflect the model's training data distribution, thus amplifying noise. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the features truly driving a model's decisions. \nThis paper introduces Denoising Diffusion Path (DDPath), a novel method that leverages diffusion models to mitigate noise. DDPath constructs a piecewise linear path, using diffusion models to gradually denoise the image at each step ensuring the images stay within the model's training data distribution. This leads to a cleaner path, free from distortions caused by noise.  DDPath is theoretically sound and can be readily integrated with existing techniques.  Extensive experiments show DDPath significantly reduces noise, resulting in clearer explanations and better quantitative performance (insertion and deletion curves, accuracy).
