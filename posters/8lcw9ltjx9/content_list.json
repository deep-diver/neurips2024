Addressing this limitation, we present an end-to-end general-purpose multi-modal system named Any-to-Policy Embodied Agents.

Because of the lack of existing multi-modal robotics datasets for evaluation, we assembled a comprehensive real-world dataset encompassing 30 robotic tasks.

We conducted extensive validation of our proposed unified modality embodied agent using several simulation benchmarks, including Franka Kitchen and Maniskill2, as well as in our real-world settings.

Our policy network was trained using few-shot learning, utilizing either ten or twenty-five demonstrations. We assessed the success rate of these models in 100 randomized evaluations across five different tasks in each benchmark. These evaluations were conducted under two settings, each with five separate runs and from two different camera perspectives, using only visual observations.

The overall framework, coupled with its multi-modal dataset, represents a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
