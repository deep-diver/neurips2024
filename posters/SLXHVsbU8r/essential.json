This is a major impediment to scalability and efficient training.  The high cost of 3D annotation limits the amount of training data and restricts model development.\nThe proposed method, UAD, addresses these issues with a novel unsupervised learning framework. It uses an Angular Perception Pretext to eliminate annotation requirements and a self-supervised training strategy to improve robustness.  UAD achieves significant performance improvements over existing models using far fewer resources. This innovative approach shows promise for making end-to-end autonomous driving more practical and efficient.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "SLXHVsbU8r/podcast.wav"}
