Lower AIC values indicate a better fit to the data. The models compared include 'Perception', 'Soft Optimality', 'Observation', and 'Expected Value Ratio'. The table is organized by model and shows the AIC values for ten different subjects (columns 1-10). The table helps to quantitatively assess which confidence model best explains the participants' confidence judgments in the context of a perceptual decision-making task.", "section": "4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "BRvGfN3Xfm/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Rate/Probability of each reporting high confidence in each subject and each model's prediction for the trials with value asymmetry in the perceptual decision making task", "description": "This table presents the rate or probability of each subject reporting high confidence for trials with value asymmetry in a perceptual decision-making task.  It compares the experimental results to predictions from four different confidence models: Perception, Soft Optimality, Observation, and Expected Value Ratio.  Each model's accuracy in predicting high-confidence reports is shown for each subject.", "section": "4.1 Perceptual Decision Making Task with varying priors and rewards"}, {"figure_path": "BRvGfN3Xfm/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: AIC values for the fit to all confidence models with an additional parameter accounting for the choice bias", "description": "This table shows the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values for different confidence models, including the soft optimality model proposed in the paper, after adding a parameter to account for bias in subject choices. Lower AIC values indicate a better fit to the data.  The table compares the performance of several models in predicting subjects' confidence judgments.  The models include a perception-based model, soft optimality model, and expected value ratio model. The addition of the bias parameter aims to improve the models' ability to capture the observed data by accommodating individual differences in decision-making tendencies.", "section": "4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "BRvGfN3Xfm/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: AIC values by subject for different confidence prediction models on the value-based decision making task", "description": "This table presents the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values for each subject in the value-based decision-making task.  AIC values are shown for two different confidence prediction models: the expected value ratio model and the soft optimality model. Lower AIC values indicate a better fit to the data. The table allows for a comparison of the model fits across individual subjects, providing insights into which model better explains the subjects' confidence judgments in this specific task.", "section": "4.2 Value Based Decision Making Task"}]
