Due to this critical role, confidence has been the topic of many theoretical and experimental decision neuroscience studies. However, primarily focused on in perceptual decision-making experiments, confidence is mainly mathematically defined only for scenarios where different choices have the same potential reward. In these situations, based on some perceptual cues, the goal is to pick the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice instead of all other equally \u201cincorrect\u201d ones. Consequently, confidence is defined as the probability of choosing the correct option [1, 4]. In these setups, perception confidence, i.e., \u201cwhat is the probability that my observation was correct?\u201d and decision confidence, \u201cwhat is the probability that I made the correct decision?\u201d are inseparable because the choices do not differ in value.

This self-assessment is, to some degree, similar to inverse reinforcement learning.

One of the main reasons behind such computational cost is the belief state, with a space size exponential in the original state space size in the most general cases. Another reason is the need for normalization, which requires the calculation of the probability of optimality for all possible trajectories. In practice, however, fitting confidence is not intractable due to the simplicity of models of perception and the existing experimental setups. First, behavioral and even neural data on perception have been shown to be accurately modeled with Gaussian distributions. Second, in the current experimental setups, the dynamics of the task (transition function) are often very simple, and the number of actions is very minimal, e.g., one action of choosing one of the options after a perceptual cue.

The additional two models used for comparison in the perceptual decision-making experiment couldn\u2019t be used as metrics of comparison in this task as there was no perceptual component, which is a requirement of using the observation and perception models. On average, our soft optimality outperformed the expected value model with an average AIC value of 206.65 across all subjects as compared to an average AIC value of 282.11. The soft optimality model was also a better fti for the majority of the subjects; it best explained 21 out of the 33 subjects\u2019 confidence reporting behavior. Moreover, the difference in AIC values is significantly larger in subjects whose behavior is better explained by our model (soft optimality) as demonstrated in Fig. 2, middle plot. We also compared the relationship between the difference in the value of the offered choices and the subject\u2019s confidence (relative to their minimum confidence level, i.e. confidence offset, for normalization across all subjects) with the predictions of the two models.

Validating our model on this data set strengthens our conviction that it can generalize across multiple types of common decision paradigms and that it can be descriptive of more subjects than other comparable Bayesian approaches.

Notably, soft reinforcement learning has been used to fit subjects\u2019 choices in decision-making before. However, those were actual decisions in the context of exploration-exploitation or imperfect rationality. We used this approach in action evaluation. In fact, according to our model, actions themselves follow strict optimality (modeled by a POMDP). We validated our results on two different experiments from different groups.

We believe the generalizability of our framework makes it a great candidate for testing and modeling confidence in more complicated setups. Future experiments could go in multiple directions. One example is confidence assessment in a sequence of actions instead of one action. One important aspect of our model, which is not present in other models and even most experiments, is the ability to assess confidence in a sequence of actions (trajectory). Multiple common experimental setups in the field, such as two-step task for humans [24] and even maze navigation for rodents can be used to study confidence of a sequence of actions (whole decision) if confidence assessment is added to them. Another example direction is confidence assessment in multiple choices. Two-choice tasks are too simple to distinguish between various models. Therefore, some researchers have started focusing on confidence assessment on multiple choices. For example, one study has shown that the difference between the probability of the top two choices explains confidence better than the posterior probability of the most likely state when three choices are presented [5]. In that study, the reward was the same for all options. It could also be illuminating to test confidence assessment when the rewards of different choices are not equal.
