For example, in an autonomous driving scenario, a company might train its cars with the same learning algorithm, yet once on the road, these cars must cooperate with cars from another company.

In the following, only the performance of the best naive MARL baseline is reported.   \n\u2022 Independent PPO in the NAHT setting (IPPO-NAHT): IPPO is a policy gradient MARL algorithm that directly generalizes PPO [35] to the multi-agent setting. It was found to be surprisingly effective on a variety of MARL benchmarks [45]. In contrast to the naive MARL baselines, IPPO-NAHT is trained using the NAHT training scheme presented in Section 6.1. The variant considered here employs full parameter sharing, where the actor is trained on data only from controlled agents, but the critic is trained using data from both controlled and uncontrolled agents. The latter detail is a key algorithmic feature which POAM also employs, but is an extension from the most naive version of PPO (see Section 6.4). IPPO can be considered an ablation of POAM, where the agent modeling module is removed.   \n\u2022 POAM in the AHT setting (POAM-AHT): As considered in Section 4, a natural baseline approach to the NAHT problem is to use AHT algorithms that train only a single controlled agent, and copy these policies as many times as needed in the NAHT setting. To evaluate the intuition that AHT policies do not suffice for the NAHT problem setting, we consider an AHT version of POAM that is trained identically to POAM, but where the number of controlled agents is always one ( $N=1$ ) during training. Note that POAM-AHT is equivalent to the AHT algorithm introduced by Papoudakis et al. [29], LIAM.

We attribute the initial similarity in sample efficiency to the initial cost incurred by learning team embedding vectors, which once learned, improves learning efficiency. IPPO-NAHT, which can be viewed as an ablation of POAM with no agent modeling, is the next best performing method. Although IPPO-NAHT has generally poorer sample efficiency than POAM, the method converges to approximately the same returns on two out of five tasks (8v9 and 10v11). While the agent modeling module of POAM provides team embedding vectors to the policy learning process, the embeddings are themselves produced from each agent\u2019s own observation.

POAM is a policy gradient approach that uses an encoder-decoder architecture to perform teammate modeling, and leverages data from uncontrolled agents for policy optimization.

Further, POAM\u2019s actor update is purely on-policy, and therefore cannot leverage data generated by uncontrolled agents.

In addition to the directions suggested by POAM\u2019s limitations, algorithmic ideas from AHT, such as diversity-based teammate generation [25] and teammate-model-based planning methods [6], also suggest rich avenues for future work.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
