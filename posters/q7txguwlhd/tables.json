POAM-AHT is an algorithm designed for the Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT) setting (N=1), while POAM is designed for the N-Agent Ad Hoc Teamwork (NAHT) setting (N>1).  The results show that both algorithms perform optimally when only one agent is controlled (N=1), but POAM significantly outperforms POAM-AHT when more agents are controlled (N=2), highlighting the limitations of using an AHT algorithm in a NAHT setting.", "section": "A.5.1 The Need for Dedicated NAHT Algorithms - Empirical Evidence"}]
