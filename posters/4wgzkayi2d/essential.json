This inconsistency arises from existing methods' reliance on high-certainty 2D priors, which limits view consistency.  The discrete viewpoint encoding and shared 2D priors exacerbate this issue.\nThe proposed LCGen method tackles this by leveraging low-certainty generation.  LCGen guides text-to-3D generation toward different priors with varying certainty from different viewpoints.  This approach, tested across several SDS-based text-to-3D models, consistently improves view consistency without sacrificing generation quality or increasing computational costs.  LCGen's effectiveness is demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Engineering Research Center of AI & Robotics, Academy for Engineering & Technology, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "4wgzkAyi2D/podcast.wav"}
