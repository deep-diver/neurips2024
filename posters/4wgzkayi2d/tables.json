Two metrics are used: Janus Rate (JR), representing the percentage of images with the Janus problem, and CLIP Score (CS), assessing the consistency between the generated image and text prompt. Lower JR values and higher CS values are better. The table shows that LCGen significantly reduces the Janus problem in all three baselines without reducing the quality of generated images.", "section": "5.2 Results of LCGen"}, {"figure_path": "4wgzkAyi2D/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of different methods dealing with Janus Problem.", "description": "This table compares LCGen with other methods that address the Janus Problem.  It highlights key differences in whether additional priors are used, if the method is single-stage or requires multiple stages and fine-tuning, and whether the method is object-specific.  The Janus Rate (JR) and CLIP Score (CS) are provided as quantitative metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of each method in mitigating the Janus Problem and maintaining the quality of generated images.", "section": "LCGen vs. Other Methods addressing Janus Problem"}, {"figure_path": "4wgzkAyi2D/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of different methods dealing with Janus Problem.", "description": "This table compares LCGen with other methods that aim to address the Janus Problem in text-to-3D generation. It contrasts the methods in terms of their approach, whether they utilize additional priors or data, the number of training stages, whether they require fine-tuning, and whether they are object-specific.
