LCGen is designed to be integrated into existing SDS-based text-to-3D models. The diagram shows how LCGen takes in a text prompt and camera parameters (c), processes these inputs through a text encoder and LCGen module, and then uses the output to guide a pre-trained diffusion model (\u03a6). The process generates a 3D representation (\u0398), which is then rendered into 2D images from various viewpoints.  These images are compared against the diffusion model\u2019s predictions via a Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss (LSDS), and the entire system is trained end-to-end. A key aspect is LCGen's constraint on generation certainty, ensuring that different viewpoints receive appropriately varied guidance, thereby reducing the inconsistencies associated with the Janus Problem.", "section": "4 LCGen: Low Certainty Generation"}, {"figure_path": "4wgzkAyi2D/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Results of Qualitative Comparison.
