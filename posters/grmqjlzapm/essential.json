Existing approaches often use encoder-decoder architectures, which are complex and inefficient in data utilization.  The manual separation of historical and future trajectories also hinders performance.\nBehaviorGPT uses a homogenous, fully autoregressive Transformer to address these shortcomings. It introduces a Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3) that improves the prediction of trajectory patches at the patch level, capturing long-range interactions. The method shows significant improvement in realism scores compared with other top models while using fewer parameters (only 3M). This innovative approach won the 2024 Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge.", "affiliation": "City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "GRmQjLzaPM/podcast.wav"}
