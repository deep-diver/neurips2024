It shows that using a patch size of 5 (2Hz replan frequency) significantly outperforms the baseline model without patching. Increasing the patch size to 10 (1Hz replan frequency) further enhances performance across multiple metrics, such as minADE and REALISM, indicating the benefits of the Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3).  However, there is an interaction between patch size and replan frequency, shown by the model with patch size 10 outperforming even the 2Hz model with patch size 5.", "section": "4.5 Ablation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "GRmQjLzaPM/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Impact of replan frequency on the test set.", "description": "This table presents the results of the BehaviorGPT model on the test set with varying replan frequencies (1Hz, 2Hz, and 5Hz) while maintaining a fixed patch size of 10.
