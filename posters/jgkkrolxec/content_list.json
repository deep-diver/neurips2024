Unfortunately, most Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) frameworks are hampered by the specificity, complexity, and incompleteness of their GA techniques. Firstly, GAs designed for specific scenarios may compromise the universality of models if mishandled. Secondly, the process of identifying and generating optimal augmentations generally involves substantial computational overhead. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the GCL, even the learnable ones, is constrained by the finite selection of GAs available. To overcome the above limitations, this paper introduces a novel unified GA module dubbed UGA after reinterpreting the mechanism of GAs in GCLs from a message-passing perspective. Theoretically, this module is capable of unifying any explicit GAs, including node, edge, attribute, and subgraph augmentations. Based on the proposed UGA, a novel generalized GCL framework dubbed Graph cOntrastive UnifieD Augmentations (GOUDA) is proposed.

They typically follow a message-passing paradigm [10], where the representation of each node is updated by aggregating the representations of its adjacent nodes and subsequently combining the aggregated representations with itself. In general, to produce discriminative representations, GNNs need to resort to the task-relevant labels (i.e., supervised information) to guide the network training, which limits their applicability in the label scarcity scenarios [24, 37, 43]. To overcome this limitation, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), a typical graph self-supervised learning architecture, has been developed to provide training guidance by capturing the self-supervised information contained in the graph [53, 32, 50, 2, 21, 39, 20].

Thus, GCLs inherit the merit of enabling learning representations invariant to augmentation, which is achieved by maximizing the agreement between embeddings from different perturbations of the same graph [51, 52]. To further improve the representation capacity of GCLs, great endeavors have been made to design augmentations for the original graph, i.e., Graph Augmentations (GAs), which target nodes, edges, attributes, and subgraphs. Based on how information is processed, GAs can be divided into two categories: heuristic [53, 35, 32, 14] and learnable methods [47, 31, 21, 56]. The heuristic GAs modify graphs through the combination of fixed, random rules, such as attribute masking [53], edge removing [32, 2], and graph diffusion [14]. They tend to neglect the subsequent steps, namely encoding and contrastive optimization, hence leading to suboptimal performances. In contrast, learnable GAs leverage prior knowledge and feedback during training to refine augmentations, already surpassing base augmentations on many tasks. Notable contributions include GAs based on spectral methods [21], and adversarial training [31]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Given their inherent and distinct characteristics, various networks and tasks require the meticulous selection of optimal GAs to improve model performance pivotally. However, most GCLs face several limitations regarding the selection: (1) Specificity. GCLs are typically tailored with specific GAs to meet the needs of particular scenarios, resulting in a lack of generality across diverse scenarios. For instance, node dropping (specifically, removing nodes and their associated edges), widely applied in graph-level tasks [47, 48], could significantly compromise the integrity of graphs [36], rendering it less suitable for node-level tasks. (2) High complexity. Either way, identifying and generating the scene-specific GAs impose a considerable computational burden on the models. For example, the set sampling method necessitates a validation of all combinations [45, 38]. Furthermore, the adversarial attack method [47, 31] entails recalculating contrastive losses, which takes a quadratic complexity of $O(n^{2})$ . Besides, the spectral method requires Laplacian matrix decomposition [5], which has a cubic complexity of $O(\\dot{n}^{3})$ . (3) Incompleteness.

The conclusion is that, from the message-passing perspective, GAs uniformly induce attribute modifications within the neighborhoods of nodes, even though they appear diverse from the spatial perspective, as depicted in Fig. 1. Therefore, the essence of GCLs is to learn node representations invariant to such local augmentation. Drawing from this insight, a novel Unified GA (UGA) module with a simple yet effective design is presented. It strategically interpolates an appropriate amount of Augmentation-Centric (AC) vectors in a graph-structured manner [55, 8], where AC vectors are treated as another type of node, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

To realize general utility, GOUDA proposes to capture the consistency and diversity across augmentations (defined in Section 3.3), which are essential and shared goals for GCLs to be applicable across diverse scenarios. To be specific, the objective function of GOUDA is twofold: (1) maximizing Mutual Information (MI) between representations from these distinct views. (2) maximizing the distributional difference between the AC matrices. The former is a fundamental principle behind classic contrastive losses and inherently ensures consistency, while the latter is a constraint to modulate diversity. In practice, GOUDA is instantiated by leveraging widely employed contrastive losses alongside a Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)-based distributional independence loss.

This is attributed to the greater adaptability of the UGA module, stemming from its integration of augmentation and contrastive updating over random GAs.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
