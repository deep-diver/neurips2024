GAs designed for specific scenarios may not generalize well, and finding optimal augmentations can be computationally expensive.  Existing learnable GAs are also limited by the finite selection of available options. \nThis paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel unified GA module called UGA. UGA reinterprets GAs from a message-passing perspective, enabling the unification of node, edge, attribute, and subgraph augmentations. Based on UGA, the authors introduce GOUDA, a generalized GCL framework that incorporates widely-used contrastive losses and a novel independence loss.  **GOUDA achieves superior performance compared to existing GCLs, demonstrating its generality and efficiency across diverse datasets and tasks.**", "affiliation": "Hebei University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jgkKroLxeC/podcast.wav"}
