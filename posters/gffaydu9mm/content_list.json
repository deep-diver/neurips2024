Our approach also excels in qualitative assessments, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. It is important to note that in simpler scenes with low variability in inpainting results, where the inconsistency issue is less pronounced (Fig. 4 first row), most methods perform adequately. NeRFiller [93], through its use of multiple joint denoising steps, ensures consistency but often produces overly smooth outputs that lack fine details. It is noteworthy that InFusion [109] performs well when geometry estimation is accurate. However, its performance deteriorates in scenarios where depth accuracy is compromised, leading to geometry artifacts (Fig. 5). This underscores the critical role of multi-view supervision in addressing such challenges. By incorporating consistent multi-view supervision, our method remains effective even when depth or geometry is inaccurate, achieving robust and promising results. This explains why our method shows little difference from InFusion when geometry is accurate, but excels when the depth is inaccurate. Additionally, the exclusive reliance on perceptual loss by SPIn-NeRF [53] fails to fully address the multi-view inconsistencies introduced by inpainting diffusion models, often resulting in a blurred effect, particularly visible in Fig. 4 third and fourth rows. To further validate our findings, we conducted a user study based on the SPIn-NeRF dataset, focusing on the coherence of the background within the inpainted area, the fidelity of detail preservation in the inpainted region, and overall preference.

The improvements achieved through our work offer significant societal beneftis, such as enhanced editability of radiance fields.

To overcome this, future iterations could explore the integration of multi-view training directly within the 2D inpainting diffusion models (DMs) framework, or exact 3D generative models. Our approach currently requires predefined masks as a prerequisite for the task. Integrating advanced 3D perception methods [66, 67] could greatly improve the accuracy and flexibility of the approach. This integration would enable precise, language-driven interactions, enhancing automation and adaptability across various scenes and creating a more user-friendly, versatile framework for neural 3D scene editing.

To mitigate this, we propose sampling $n$ candidate views around the geometrical centroid and selecting the one with the highest similarity votes. This approach automatically avoids such occasion artifacts without human intervention. In our implementation, we used five candidate views, and the similarity was calculated using perceptual hashing. In the reprojection procedure of ELA, we adjust the camera intrinsics to match the latent dimensionality.

This conclusion is also supported by qualitative results. Larger $\\lambda_{a}$ values tend to produce slight variations in some small regions, but the global structure and semantics are preserved. This stability is attributed to the significant role of the initial latent alignment in ELA, which effectively aligns the underlying inpainting structure, thereby maintaining low variability in appearance.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
