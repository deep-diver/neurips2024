The comparison is done across two datasets, CIFAR-10 and CINIC-10, and under different levels of data heterogeneity (controlled by the Dirichlet distribution parameter \u03b1). The results are presented as accuracy \u00b1 standard deviation, showing the average performance across multiple runs. This table demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSign in achieving higher accuracy compared to other methods, particularly in scenarios with Non-IID data distributions.", "section": "6 Applications to Model Fusion"}, {"figure_path": "CW0OVWEKKu/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Aggregation performance comparisons of FedSign with several popular FL algorithms.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the performance of FedSign, a novel federated learning algorithm proposed in the paper, against several other popular federated learning algorithms. The algorithms are evaluated on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and CINIC-10, with varying levels of data heterogeneity (controlled by the parameter \u03b1).  The results show the accuracy achieved by each algorithm across different settings, allowing for a direct comparison of their relative effectiveness in handling Non-IID data and improving model aggregation in federated learning scenarios.
