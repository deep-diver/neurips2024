While existing research primarily focuses on flat or sharp minima, this paper investigates an asymmetric valley shape.  This asymmetry is often overlooked and its causes and effects aren't fully understood, hindering improvements to deep learning methods. \nThis research systematically explores factors influencing this valley asymmetry, including dataset characteristics, network architecture, initialization methods, and hyperparameters. Key findings indicate that the sign consistency between added noise and the model's convergence solution strongly affects valley symmetry. The paper presents theoretical explanations for this phenomenon using ReLU activation and softmax functions and proposes practical applications for model fusion and federated learning. This provides insight to improve model aggregation and parameter alignment by leveraging sign alignment, potentially boosting performance.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "CW0OVWEKKu/podcast.wav"}
