Since world models are initiated to predict futures from the current state, the starting of their prediction should be firmly aligned with the condition image. Therefore, we tailor SVD into a dedicated predictive model by imposing the first frame as the condition image and discarding the noise augmentation [5, 49] during training. With this prediction ability, Vista can perform long-term rollouts by iteratively predicting short-term clips and resetting the condition image with the last clip. Dynamic Prior Injection. Nevertheless, using the aforementioned setup for training often results in irrational dynamics with respect to historical frames, especially in long-term rollouts. We conjecture that this mainly arises from the ambiguity caused by insufficient priors about the tendency of future motions, which is also a common limitation of existing driving world models [54, 68, 125, 127, 136]. Estimating coherent futures requires at least three essential priors that inherently govern the future motion of instances in the scene: position, velocity, and acceleration. Since velocity and acceleration are the first- and second-order derivative of position respectively, these priors can be entirely derived by using three consecutive frames for conditioning. Concretely, we build a frame-wise mask $\\mathbf{\\nabla}m\\in$ $\\{\\dot{0},1\\}^{\\dot{K}}$ with a length of $K$ to indicate the presence of condition frames. The mask is set sequentially following the time order, with at most three elements being assigned as 1 to denote three condition frames. Instead of concatenating additional channels to the inputs, we inject new condition frames by replacing the corresponding noisy latent $n_{i}$ with the clean latent $z_{i}$ encoded by the image encoder. Formally, the input latent is constructed as $\\hat{\\pmb{n}}=\\pmb{m}\\cdot\\pmb{z}+(1-\\pmb{m})\\cdot\\pmb{n}$ (see Fig. 3 [Left]). To discern the clean latent, we duplicate a new timestep embedding from the pretrained weights and allocate it to the condition frames according to $\\mathbf{\\nabla}m$ . The timestep embeddings for condition frames and prediction frames are trained separately. Compared to channel-wise concatenation, we find that replacing the latent is more effective and flexible in absorbing varying numbers of condition frames. In addition, we observe that the replaced latent, when applied to SVD directly, does not degrade its generation quality. Thus, the original performance will not be disturbed when the training is launched.

Specifically, participants are presented with a side-by-side video pair and asked to choose the video they deem better on two orthogonal aspects: visual quality and motion rationality. To avoid potential bias, we crop each video to a fixed aspect ratio, downsample them to the same resolution, and trim the excess frames when Vista generates longer videos than others. We only feed one condition frame to align with other models. To ensure the variety of scenes, we uniformly assemble 60 scenes from four representative datasets: OpenDV-YouTube-val [136], nuScenes [10], Waymo [112], and CODA [79]. These datasets collectively exemplify the intricacy and diversity of real-world driving, e.g., OpenDV-YouTube-val includes geofenced districts, Waymo offers a unique domain compared to our training data, and CODA contains extremely challenging corner cases. We collect a total of 2640 answers from 33 participants. As presented in Fig. 7, Vista outperforms all baselines on both aspects, demonstrating its profound comprehension of the driving dynamics. Further, unlike other models that are only applicable for short-term generation, Vista can accommodate more dynamic priors and produce coherent long-horizon rollouts as shown in Fig. 6.

Specifically, we compute the standard deviation of each waypoint from the nuScenes training set as prior distributions. These priors are jointly rescaled to sample perturbations with different L2 errors. The perturbations are then added as offsets to the ground truth trajectories. To ensure the plausibility of sampled trajectories, we adopt an explicit correlating strategy [35, 95] to regularize offset sampling and recursively sample new trajectories until their offsets are consistent in tendencies. To demonstrate the generality of our reward function, we conduct reward estimation on Waymo [112], which is unseen in training. This is done by uniformly sampling from each command category on Waymo validation set, resulting in 1500 cases in total. We compare the average reward of the trajectories with varying L2 errors in Fig. 10. Our reward decreases when the deviation from the ground truth increases, underscoring the potential of our approach to serve as a viable reward function. It also holds the promise to remedy the irrationality in current evaluation protocols for planning [18, 83, 141], such as the L2 error shown in Fig. 10.

To be specific, Drive-WM obtains the rewards from the perception results. Given that the detectors [82, 84] take image sequences as inputs, Drive-WM has to accomplish all steps of the denoising process before perception. Differently, our reward function estimates the reward with the uncertainty that originates from the world model itself without relying on other perception models. Therefore, the estimation of uncertainty does not require completing the generation process. It can be realized by only denoising each sample for a few steps. In fact, as specified in Appendix C, the total computation required for reward estimation per situation (10 steps, 5 rounds) is no greater than that of generating the entire video (50 steps for our model) as Drive-WM does. Note that the computational cost for our reward estimation can be flexibly reduced to further improve its efficiency.

Taking advantage of this property, there is great promise for our reward function to be used as a critic module [76], which enables model-predictive control by executing the optimal action that maximizes the estimated reward [27, 30, 35].

After synthesizing the video plan, we can convert the resultant image trajectory to executable actions by a non-causal inverse dynamics model [4, 65, 71], which can be efficiently learned from much fewer data compared with the imitation learning pipeline [2, 9]. In autonomous driving, the inverse dynamics model could be implemented with visual odometry [75].

In contrast, Vista integrates versatile action controllability that can generalize to new scenarios in a zero-shot manner.

Extra refinements on the prediction results [6, 49, 54, 99, 126, 144] could be helpful. Speculatively, applying our recipe to more scalable architecture [54, 97] is also promising to address this limitation.

Some practices imagine the world in the bird\u2019s eye view (BEV) space [20, 31, 52, 53, 78, 81].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
