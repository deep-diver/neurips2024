The comparison is done in terms of risk and unfairness, across a range of unfairness thresholds. Both ADW versions (ADW-1 using both labelled and unlabelled data, ADW-2 using only labelled data) are included.  The plot shows that DP-postproc is competitive or outperforms ADW across various settings.", "section": "Numerical illustration"}, {"figure_path": "UtbjD5LGnC/figures/figures_27_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of SDG, ACSA, ACSA2, SDG3+ACSA and SDG3+ACSA2 algorithms on Communities and Crime and Law School datasets.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of several stochastic gradient descent algorithms (SDG, ACSA, ACSA2, SDG3+ACSA, SDG3+ACSA2) on two benchmark datasets: Communities and Crime, and Law School.
