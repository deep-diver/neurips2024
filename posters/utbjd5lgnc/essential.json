This paper presents a novel post-processing algorithm, achieving demographic parity with strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency.", "takeaways": ["A new post-processing algorithm achieves demographic parity in regression without using sensitive attributes during inference.", "The algorithm is computationally efficient and suitable for online settings, only requiring unlabeled data.", "The method is fully theory-driven, providing strong theoretical guarantees and post-processing bounds."], "tldr": "Many machine learning models unintentionally exhibit biases against certain demographic groups, violating fairness.  Existing fairness methods often require access to sensitive attributes (like race or gender), but this is problematic for privacy and data availability reasons.  This paper focuses on regression tasks\u2014predicting a continuous value like income\u2014and tackles the challenge of ensuring fair predictions without using this sensitive information during the prediction phase.\nThis research introduces a novel post-processing algorithm that addresses these issues. It uses accurate estimates of the regression function and sensitive attribute predictor to generate predictions satisfying the demographic parity constraint.  The method leverages discretization and stochastic optimization of a smooth convex function, making it suitable for online post-processing.  The algorithm boasts strong theoretical guarantees, including finite-sample analysis and post-processing bounds, which are validated through experiments.", "affiliation": "IRT SystemX, Universit\u00e9 Gustave Eiffel", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "UtbjD5LGnC/podcast.wav"}
