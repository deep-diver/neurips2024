Table 2: 3D relighting quantitative comparison.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed Neural Gaffer model against DiLightNet [79] for single-image relighting and against TensoIR [30] and NVDIFFREC-MC [25] for 3D relighting.  The metrics used are PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.  For single-image relighting, both raw and channel-aligned results are shown. Channel-aligned results adjust the average intensity of each channel to match the ground truth, addressing ambiguity between lighting intensity and object color. The 3D relighting results use only the channel-aligned metrics.", "section": "4.3 Results analysis"}, {"figure_path": "zV2GDsZb5a/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablations on diffusion model designs.", "description": "This table presents the ablation study results on different designs of the lighting conditioning for the diffusion model. It shows the performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) for four different model variations: the full model, the model without LDR map, the model without HDR map, and the model without rotation. The results demonstrate the impact of each component on the overall relighting performance.", "section": "4.4 Ablation Study"}]
