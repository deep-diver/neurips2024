Existing methods either focus on specific image categories or necessitate special capture conditions, hindering widespread application.  Many also rely on explicit scene decomposition, often leading to inaccuracies.  This limits the realism and generalizability of such techniques.\n\nNeural Gaffer addresses these limitations using a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model. It leverages the inherent understanding of lighting present in a pre-trained diffusion model, fine-tuned on a synthetic relighting dataset.  This approach avoids explicit scene decomposition, improving accuracy and generalization.  The model excels at relighting various objects under diverse lighting conditions, both from real and synthetic data, facilitating various downstream 2D tasks and providing a robust relighting prior for 3D applications.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "zV2GDsZb5a/podcast.wav"}
