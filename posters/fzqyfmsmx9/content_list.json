LAIF first performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using demonstrations from a teacher model and then further fine-tunes the model with reinforcement learning (RL) or direct preference optimization (DPO), using feedback from a critic model. While recent popular open-source models have demonstrated substantial improvements in performance from the RL step, in this paper we question whether the complexity of this RL step is truly warranted for AI feedback. We show that the improvements of the RL step are virtually entirely due to the widespread practice of using a weaker teacher model (e.g. GPT-3.5) for SFT data collection than the critic (e.g., GPT-4) used for AI feedback generation. Specifically, we show that simple supervised fine-tuning with GPT-4 as the teacher outperforms existing LAIF pipelines. More generally, we find that the gains from LAIF vary substantially across base model families, test-time evaluation protocols, and critic models. Finally, we provide a mechanistic explanation for when SFT may outperform the full two-step LAIF pipeline as well as suggestions for making LAIF maximally useful in practice.

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with large datasets of user queries and human-written responses is one popular approach. Further refining a model fine-tuned with SFT using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al. [2017]) has been shown to further improve the quality of model responses, as judged by humans [Ouyang et al., 2022, Stiennon et al., 2020]. However, collecting the data for SFT and RLHF is expensive, requiring human annotations for both the SFT and preference rankings over several candidate responses to a query to be used as feedback for the RL stage. Given the high cost of data collection as well as the high level of disagreement among human annotators, many works such as Bai et al. [2022] and Lee et al. [2023] have replaced the human annotators in both the SFT and RLHF stages with strong language model annotators such as GPT-4 [Achiam et al., 2023]. The corresponding techniques, supervised model distillation [Taori et al., 2023, Chiang et al., 2023, Ding et al., 2023] and learning from AI feedback (LAIF; Bai et al. [2022], Lee et al. [2023], Cui et al.

However, plugging in LLMs to substitute human annotators in the same RLHF pipeline may not be the best way to leverage such LLMs. First, LLMs are often better at generating answers for instructions than discriminative tasks [West et al., 2023], and labeling preferred answers for AI feedback is an example. Further, while humans may find comparing answers incurs lower cognitive cost than producing answers themselves, for modern LLMs, the cost of generating a preference comparison or ranking may actually be higher than simply generating a demonstration, owing to the longer input context when comparing multiple responses. Therefore, while LAIF may seem like a more convenient variant of RLHF prima facie, we ask: what kind of data from strong LLMs is more effective for learning instruction-following: completions for SFT or AI feedback for RL? ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To answer this question, we compare the effectiveness of the LAIF pipeline with doing SFT on demonstrations directly generated from the annotator language model. In our experiments, we align a variety of pre-trained base language models, both with SFT and LAIF, using the prompts from the ShareGPT dataset [Chiang et al., 2023]. We use SFT demonstrations from three teacher language models, namely, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude, and use two strong language models as critics, GPT-4 and Claude, for collecting AI feedback. We evaluate our fine-tuned models using AlpacaEval [Li et al., 2023]. The experimental setup is described in further detail in Section 4. In our experiments, we find that two conditions are necessary for LAIF to significantly outperform SFT: (a) a sufficiently strong pre-trained base model and, (b) a capability mismatch between the teacher used for the SFT data collection and the critic used for collecting AI feedback. The latter condition has surprising consequences: if the target completions are sufficiently performant and capability gap between models used for SFT and AI feedback is minimal, then simply doing SFT can suffice. We observe this in Figure 1, where SFT on the completions generated by GPT-4 outperforms GPT$3.5\\;\\mathrm{SFT}+\\mathrm{GPT}{\\mathrm{-4}}$ feedback.

However, simply performing SFT on completions from GPT-4 can result in a better model (GPT-4 SFT), suggesting that improvement in performance from LAIF is partly because the default ShareGPT completions are from a weak teacher (GPT3.5).

Further, we should consider updated instruction-tuning datasets created using more recent state-of-the-art LLMs, like GPT-4 (as of February 2024). Second, while our experiments suggest that SFT on strong teacher completions can be just as effective as LAIF, we caution readers into generalizing these findings to RLHF setting and highlight why preference-based RL might be superior when collecting human feedback due to inherent cognitive load of collecting demonstrations. Third, our experiments further support the importance of pre-training for effective instruction-following, both in terms of absolute performance and also in its ability to fine-tune from AI feedback. Finally, we also provide possible ways to improve the effectiveness of AI feedback and hypothesize how AI feedback could improve over SFT over target distributions from strong teacher LLMs. Overall, AI feedback has several desirable features that make it a compelling avenue for scalable oversight and effective alignment, but current evaluation may be overestimating the significance of improvements in instruction-following for open-source LLMs and we hope that this paper will inspire investigation into more effective LAIF approaches.

Some recent datasets are collecting better instruction-tuning datasets, such as the GPT4-LLM dataset Peng et al. [2023], also demonstrating better instruction-tuned models.

As motivated in the introduction and shown by our experiments, using LLMs for generating completions or providing feedback in the RLHF pipeline introduces new considerations for data collection and algorithms to use for optimization, specifically that SFT on the right target distribution can be much more performant. While one may be tempted to conclude that SFT may suffice in case of human completions and human feedback, the performance gains of RLHF over SFT are well documented Ouyang et al. [2022], Bai et al. [2022], Rafailov et al. [2023]. We postulate that this dichotomy is due to how data collection works for RLHF and LAIF. In RLHF, the completions for the SFT stage are collected by humans, whereas most LAIF instruction tuning SFT datasets use LLMs for completion generation.4 Humans, when asked to generate completions, may not be sufficiently incentivized to generate high-quality completions for instructions, especially when collecting data at scale. For example, writing detailed and insightful answers for every question may be a demanding task, and humans may also not be sufficiently informed to write such answers. However, humans may implicitly prefer longer detailed answers [Singhal et al., 2023], and thus, when giving feedback on completions for RLHF, may encourage such behavior. This discrepancy between the quality of human completions and what humans prefer may explain the effectiveness of RLHF over SFT. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Additionally, in terms of data collection efficiency for human feedback, it is easier for humans to generate preference labels as opposed to generating completions.

In this paper, our limited claim is that adapting preference-based learning from the RLHF framework by replacing humans with AI might lead to sub-optimal outcomes from the perspectives of both downstream performance and cost-effectiveness. Our experiments suggest that the performance gains of LAIF depend upon several factors that can impact final performance in non-obvious ways, such as the base pre-trained model size and class, the SFT data distribution, and the quality of the exploration performed in the generated responses in the preference data. Nonetheless, our discussion in Section 5 suggests that if (1) preference datasets contain adequate exploration and (2) AI feedback provides high-quality preference labels, learning from AI feedback may be a promising and scalable approach to training capable instruction-following models. Moreover, alignment can have broader goals than improving instruction following abilities [Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022], in which case AI feedback can be leveraged for inducing safe and desirable behavior in a cheap and automated fashion.

We observe in our experiments that current gains observed by open-source LAIF models might be an artifact of the capability mismatch between the models generating SFT data and the AI feedback, and effectiveness of LAIF for strong-instruction following LLMs may be overestimated. We also showed that LAIF gains do not translate universally across models, evaluators, and oracle models. We our analysis is limited, we provide some mechanistic insight into this behavior via a simplified bandit setting. Finally, we provide some practical suggestions and discuss the implications of these results for future LAIF and RLHF research. Concretely, we recommend periodic versioning and regular updates to AI-generated instruction finetuning datasets with the release of more powerful language models.
