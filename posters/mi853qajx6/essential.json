This overlooks the significant variability in LLM performance, raising concerns about their reliability in real-world applications where diverse prompts are expected.  Existing benchmarks often simplify the complexity of real-world user queries by focusing on task-level instructions, neglecting the diversity of real-world prompts. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the worst-case performance, which represents a more realistic lower-bound of LLM capabilities. \nTo address the shortcomings of existing benchmarks and approaches, the researchers introduce ROBUSTAL-PACAEVAL, a new benchmark focusing on semantically equivalent prompts for varied tasks. They evaluate the performance of several LLMs, finding substantial performance variability and difficulties in identifying consistently poor prompts.  Their findings show that existing methods, such as prompt engineering, have limited impact on enhancing the worst-case prompt performance.  This highlights the need for creating more robust LLMs capable of maintaining high performance across a wide range of prompts, emphasizing the importance of evaluating lower-bound performance to provide a more complete picture of LLM capabilities.
