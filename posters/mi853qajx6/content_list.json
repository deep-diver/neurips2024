Existing studies often divide prompts into task-level instructions and case-level inputs and primarily focus on evaluating and improving robustness against variations in tasks-level instructions. However, this setup fails to fully address the diversity of real-world user queries and assumes the existence of task-specific datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce ROBUSTALPACAEVAL, a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries and emphasizes the importance of using the worst prompt performance to gauge the lower bound of model performance. Extensive experiments on ROBUSTALPACAEVAL with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model performance; for instance, a difference of $45.48\\%$ between the worst and best performance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping as low as $9.38\\%$ We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst prompt from both modelagnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing the absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to enhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and prompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited.

However, the performance of these LLMs is significantly sensitive to the prompts they receive (Gu et al., 2022; Mizrahi et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Even minor alterations in format, without semantic changes, can trigger substantial performance degradation (Sclar et al., 2023). Consequently, prompt engineering has surfaced as a critical component, playing a critical role in unlocking the full potential of these models (Shin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2022a; Pryzant et al., 2023; Prasad et al., 2023; Gonen et al., 2022; Schulhoff et al., 2024).

First, it is unrealistic to expect users to master the art of designing optimal prompts or to invest a significant amount of time in doing so. Second, automatic prompt engineering often necessitates testing on substantial labeled data to pinpoint the most effective prompts (Shi et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2023), a process that is impractical for users who just have one or a few unlabeled queries.

The task-level instruction is an abstract task definition and explanation supplemented by case-level concrete input (See the left part of Figure 1). This setup is reminiscent of conventional NLP practice, where taskspecific models are developed using a testing set for each well-defined NLP task. Consequently, they have focused on the LLM\u2019s resilience to task-level instructions exclusively, reporting the average performance across testing set cases. Nonetheless, these studies have limitations. First, they disregard that the best task-level instruction might vary across individual cases. Second, they overlook the impact of variations in case-level input on model performance. Last but not least, real-world user queries often do not explicitly segregate task-level instruction and case-level input (See the right part of Figure 1). These queries may cover a wide array of tasks and it is not possible to optimize the prompts through evaluating on a task-specific testing set.

We argue that the worst prompt performance, defined as the lowest performance a model exhibits across different paraphrases of a query with equal semantics and fluency, is a crucial metric for assessing the lower bound of LLM performance. Our extensive experiments on ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) and six opensource LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families reveal substantial variability in model performance. For instance, Llama-2-70B-chat model shows a difference of up to 45.48 points in winrate against GPT4 using RobustAlpacaEval, and its worst prompt performance can be as low as $9.38\\%$ . Our findings further reveal that the worst prompts, which cause the model to perform the worst in specific cases, are not universally applicable across different models. Each model also exhibits unique preferences towards all paraphrases, as demonstrated by their inconsistent performance rankings on identical cases. Beyond the absence of model-agnostic traits in identifying the worst prompts, model-dependent prompt features, such as perplexity and hidden states, also prove inadequate in forecasting model performance. Furthermore, we also find that different models are more sensitive in different cases, which further underscores the complexity involved in tackling the issue of worst prompt performance.

During the exploration phase, they create analogous prompts using techniques such as rephrasing the current prompts with an LLM. Subsequently, the best prompts are selected based on the model\u2019s performance on downstream tasks. This process can be iterative. Although these approaches can proficiently pinpoint prompts that result in better performance for a specific task, they all necessitate a test set for prompt scoring. However, in real-world scenarios, such test sets are often absent. Gonen et al. (2022) suggests that prompt perplexity can be an effective data-free criterion.

This trend suggests that direct prompt engineering without reference to test data can lead to degraded model behaviors. $(i i)$ When applying the voting method, the model\u2019s best performance significantly decreases, and the average performance may also be affected (a $6.71\\%$ drop for Llama-2-13b-chat). However, it effectively improves the worst performance, for instance, boosting the Llama-2-70B-chat model by 21.98, surpassing its average performance. We believe this method is particularly effective in scenarios where the lower bound of model performance is of concern. This is because, even when faced with a less-than-optimal prompt from the user, the paraphrasing-then-voting strategy can still deliver satisfactory results. However, this improvement comes at the cost of a several-fold increase in computational expense. (iii) While swarm distillation enhances the model\u2019s performance consistency, it unfortunately results in a decrease in overall performance. This is likely because the model is over-fitting to its self-generated outputs, which could introduce noise or be of lower quality than its original training data, thereby reducing the overall performance of the model.

Our findings underscored the importance of continued research into prompt robustness in more realistic settings. Despite the efforts, our study is not without limitations. The range of models we examined may not be extensive enough to capture a full spectrum of insights. Additionally, alternative approaches to pinpointing worst prompts could offer deeper understanding.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
