Given that training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost, it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2) real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point cloud flies being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud flies is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we first propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can embed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner and accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled secured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS\u2019s spherical harmonics coefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle the original RGB scene and the hidden message.

Considering that rendering a 3DGS is extremely costly, protecting the copyright and privacy of 3D assets should be a priority. As a widely studied technique in copyright protection, digital watermarking, and encrypted communication, steganography aims to hide messages like audio, images, and bits into digital content in an invisible manner. In its reveal process, it is only possible for the receivers with pre-defined revealing operations to reconstruct secret information from the container.

Classical 3D steganography methods [38, 40, 55] often use Fourier and wavelet transforms to embed messages into explicit 3D representations such as meshes and point clouds. During extraction, the receiver must obtain the complete 3D representation. Considering that sometimes only a few views of a 3D scene are publicly available online, the 3D-to-2D watermarking mechanism [60] is designed via a deep encoder-decoder framework, enabling to extract the copyright embedded in the mesh from any 2D perspective. Recently, steganography methods for implicit representations, such as NeRF [35], have emerged. These methods modify the weights of the NeRF [24] or replace the color representation of the NeRF [33], ensuring that each rendered view contains hidden copyright information. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, the methods mentioned above do not effectively apply to 3DGS due to its unique properties. First, since 3DGS is an explicit 3D representation where the attribute of each point has clear physical meanings, we cannot treat it as an implicit representation like NeRF, where the message can be directly and seamlessly embedded into the model weights via optimization [24]. This approach could disrupt the fidelity of the rendered RGB views and compromise the integrity of the embedded message. Meanwhile, it is difficult for a single message decoder to faithfully memorize large-capacity hidden messages, such as an entire 3D scene. Second, since 3DGS is a real-time renderable 3D representation, users might upload the entire 3DGS point cloud flie online and allow others to render it. Thus, the various attributes of the 3DGS are transparent and public, making it difficult to effectively conceal information by simply adding an attribute. Such approaches could lead to significant security concerns. Third, similar to image steganography [64, 19], we aspire for 3DGS steganography to conceal versatile messages (such as 3D scenes, and images) and to explore the capacity limits. Hiding multiple messages allows various users to extract distinct information from the same 3D scene, thereby enhancing the adaptability and engagement of the transmission process.

In recent advancements, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [21] has emerged as a powerful method for reconstructing and representing 3D scenes using millions of 3D Gaussians. Compared to previous implicit representations such as NeRF, 3DGS offers significant improvements in both training and rendering efficiency. To further enhance the rendering performance of 3DGS, MipSplatting [62] achieves high-quality alias-free rendering at arbitrary resolutions by incorporating 2D and 3D filtering. Additionally, Scaffold-GS [30] introduces structured neural anchors, further enhancing the rendering quality of 3DGS from different viewpoints. The superior performance of 3DGS has expanded its applicability to a wide range of fields [54, 46], including SLAM [20, 34], 4D reconstruction [25, 31, 53, 57], and 3D content generation [49, 58].

Thus, similar to the task settings of [24, 33], we design a rendering-resistant traceable watermarking strategy (RTWS) inspired by box-free watermarking approach [63], which allows for the decoding of the copyright from any rendered 2D view by fine-tuning the GS-Hider and a newly added watermark decoder $\\mathcal{D}_{w}$ .

In fact, we inevitably need to make a trade-off between rendering quality and steganography capacity. However, our GS-Hider is a universal framework that can be integrated with the latest 3DGS variants, such as Mip-splatting [62], to enhance rendering performance. Meanwhile, the current scene and message decoder designs are relatively simple. Integrating more efficient neural rendering and decoding designs (such as Scaffold-GS [30]) can also help improve the overall rendering quality of the framework. 2) Decreased rendering speed: Due to the rasterization of high-dimensional features and network decoding, although we can still achieve real-time rendering, the rendering speed has decreased compared to the original 3DGS. However, we can easily improve rendering speed by pruning Gaussian points, reducing the dimension of feature attributes, and decreasing the number of convolution layers or feature kernels.

For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
