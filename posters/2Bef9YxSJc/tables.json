It demonstrates the importance of the inherent structure and information within the original embeddings generated by the LM, rather than simply using random vectors of the same dimensionality. The results are presented for three metrics (Recall@20, NDCG@20, HR@20) across three datasets (Books, Movies & TV, Video Games).  The significant difference in performance between the original embeddings and the shuffled ones highlights that the LMs encode collaborative signals which are lost when the order of the embeddings is disrupted.", "section": "B.3 Empirical findings"}, {"figure_path": "2Bef9YxSJc/tables/tables_16_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 7: Dataset statistics.", "description": "This table presents the statistics of six datasets used in the paper's experiments.
