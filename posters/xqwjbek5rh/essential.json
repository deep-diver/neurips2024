Traditional methods often struggle with **irregularly sampled data and incomplete observations**, which limit the accuracy and reliability of structural inference.  These limitations significantly hinder our understanding and predictive capabilities for various domains, including physics, biology, and social sciences. \n\nTo tackle these challenges, the authors propose SICSM, a novel framework that combines the robust temporal modeling of selective State Space Models (SSMs) with the flexible structural inference of Generative Flow Networks (GFNs). This approach effectively learns input-dependent transition functions to handle irregular sampling intervals and approximates the posterior distribution of the system's structure by aggregating dynamics across temporal dependencies. The results show that SICSM significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when dealing with incomplete and irregularly sampled data, showcasing its potential as a valuable tool for scientific discovery and systems analysis across various disciplines.", "affiliation": "University of Luxembourg", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xQWJBeK5rh/podcast.wav"}
