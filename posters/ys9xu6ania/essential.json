Existing importance sampling methods often struggle with efficiency and variance issues, hindering practical applications.  Many also require multiple rounds of proposal learning, increasing computational cost.\nThis paper introduces Exogenous Matching, a novel importance sampling method that addresses these issues.  It minimizes variance by transforming the problem into learning a conditional distribution, allowing for efficient estimation of counterfactual expressions.  The method is validated through experiments on various structural causal models (SCMs) showing its superiority and improved scalability, particularly when structural prior knowledge is integrated.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing, East China Normal University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "yS9xU6ANiA/podcast.wav"}
