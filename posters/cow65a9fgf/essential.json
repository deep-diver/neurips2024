These attacks often manipulate the model's attention mechanism, focusing it on irrelevant visual features. This paper investigates this vulnerability, highlighting the need for more robust models that are resistant to such manipulations. \nThe paper introduces TGA-ZSR, a novel framework that enhances the robustness of vision-language models. TGA-ZSR incorporates two key modules: an Attention Refinement Module and an Attention-based Model Constraint Module. The refinement module aligns attention maps from adversarial and clean examples, improving robustness. The constraint module ensures consistent performance on clean images while boosting overall robustness.  Experiments show TGA-ZSR surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new benchmark for zero-shot robust accuracy.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "cOw65A9FGf/podcast.wav"}
