Deep learning-based generative methods show promise but struggle with sample efficiency. Classical methods, particularly genetic algorithms (GAs), often outperform recent deep learning methods when sample efficiency is a priority.  This paper introduces Genetic GFN, a novel algorithm that addresses these challenges. \nGenetic GFN cleverly incorporates domain knowledge from GAs into GFlowNets, an off-policy method for amortized inference. This allows the deep generative policy to learn effectively from domain knowledge, enhancing sample efficiency.  The method significantly outperforms existing techniques on the PMO benchmark, a standard evaluation suite for molecular optimization.  The algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in designing SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using substantially fewer reward calls.", "affiliation": "Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "B4q98aAZwt/podcast.wav"}
