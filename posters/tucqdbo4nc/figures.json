Panel (a) illustrates selective visual attention, where the brain focuses on specific frequencies of visual information, effectively filtering out irrelevant details. Panel (b) depicts the non-fixed membrane potential leak in biological neurons.  The membrane potential leak in biological neurons isn't constant; it changes based on internal and external factors like ion concentration differences across the cell membrane. This variability enables neurons to better adapt to and handle noise.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "TuCQdBo4NC/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visualization frequency spectrums for data observation. The first column shows three cases of original CIFAR10 images. The second column shows the corresponding frequency spectrums of the images in the first column. The third column to the seventh column shows the frequency spectrums of corresponding added noises to the images in the first column, where added noise maps the difference between the noise image and the original one. The center of each frequency spectrum represents the low-frequency information, and the edge area is the high-frequency information.", "description": "This figure visualizes the frequency spectrums of original CIFAR10 images and their corresponding noise-added versions.

(a) Frequency encoding to simulate the selective visual attention in biological brain and (b) Evolutionary leak factor to simulate the non-fixed membrane potential leak in biological nervous system.", "description": "This figure illustrates the FEEL-SNN architecture, highlighting two key components: Frequency Encoding (FE) and Evolutionary Leak Factor (EL).  FE mimics selective visual attention by processing input images in the frequency domain and suppressing noise at different frequencies across time steps.  EL simulates the non-fixed membrane potential leak in biological neurons by allowing each neuron to learn its own optimal leak factor over time, enhancing robustness. The figure shows how FE transforms an original image into a sequence of frequency-encoded images which are then processed by the SNN. The EL component is illustrated as a set of trainable leak factors associated with different neurons at different time steps, allowing the network to adaptively adjust its robustness to various noise levels.", "section": "4 FEEL-SNN: Robust SNNs with Frequency Encoding and Evolutionary Leak Factor"}, {"figure_path": "TuCQdBo4NC/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Performance of the proposed FE and FEEL under different white-box attacks.
