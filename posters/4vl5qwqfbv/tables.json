Comparison of results across different watermarking methods. The stark disparity in t@k@100%wd between our results and the baseline reveals that traditional invisible watermarks are prone to be removed or diluted during diffusion training.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the proposed z-Watermarking method against several existing digital watermarking techniques.  The comparison focuses on two key metrics: average watermark accuracy (Avg acc) and the percentage of samples achieving 100% watermark bit accuracy (t@k@100%wd). The results highlight the superior performance of the proposed method, particularly in maintaining high watermark accuracy even when traditional methods suffer from watermark removal or dilution during the AI model training process. This indicates that the proposed method is more resilient to attacks that could compromise traditional watermarking schemes.", "section": "5.3 Robustness Study"}, {"figure_path": "4VL5QWQFBV/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Main results.
