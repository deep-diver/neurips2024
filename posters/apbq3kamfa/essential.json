This paper investigates the properties of solutions to multi-task learning problems using shallow ReLU neural networks. Unlike single-task scenarios, the researchers demonstrate that multi-task learning problems exhibit nearly unique solutions, a finding that challenges common intuitions and existing theories in the field. This unexpected uniqueness is particularly interesting when dealing with a high number of tasks, making the problem well-approximated by a kernel method. \nThe study focuses on the behavior of the network's solutions when trained on multiple diverse tasks. Through theoretical analysis and empirical observations, the authors show that the solutions for individual tasks are strikingly different from those obtained through single-task training.  In the univariate case, they prove that the solution is almost always unique and equivalent to a minimum-norm interpolation problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Similar phenomena are observed in the multivariate case, showing the approximate equivalence to an l\u00b2 minimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, determined by the optimal neurons. This highlights the significant impact of multi-task learning on the regularization and behavior of neural networks.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "APBq3KAmFa/podcast.wav"}
