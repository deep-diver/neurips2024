Linear methods and variations thereof, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS), are often employed to identify discrete states with evolving neural dynamics. However, these techniques may not be able to capture the underlying nonlinear dynamics associated with neural propagation. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used to model neural dynamics thanks to their nonlinear characteristics. In our work, we develop Switching Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNN), RNNs with weights that switch across time, to reconstruct switching dynamics of neural time-series data. We apply these models to simulated data as well as cortical neural activity across mice and monkeys, which allows us to automatically detect discrete states that lead to the identification of varying neural dynamics. In a monkey reaching dataset with electrophysiology recordings, a mouse self-initiated lever pull dataset with widefield calcium recordings, and a mouse self-initiated decision making dataset with widefield calcium recording, SRNNs are able to automatically identify discrete states with distinct nonlinear neural dynamics. The inferred switches are aligned with the behavior, and the reconstructions show that the recovered neural dynamics are distinct across different stages of the behavior. We show that the neural dynamics have behaviorally-relevant switches across time and we are able to use SRNNs to successfully capture these switches and the corresponding dynamical features.

A foundational principle in theoretical neuroscience suggests that the computations within the nervous system can be explained through the dynamics of the underlying non-linear systems (Breakspear [2017], Pandarinath et al. [2018], Durstewitz et al. [2023]). As our ability to record from larger areas of the brain with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution increases, we find neural population activity often exhibits distinct dynamical features across time. These features may correspond to distinct internal processes or behavior (Saxena and Cunningham [2019], Churchland et al. [2012]). Identifying these dynamical features may help us understand how cognitive functions are implemented in the brain. Previous works have revealed a number of computational strategies through analysis of neural dynamics, particularly across tasks, and during orchestration of precise behavioral states such as during movement generation (Kaufman et al. [2014], Miri et al. [2017]).

Neural dynamics can be time-varying due to internal fluctuations of physiological states as well as the external effect of environment. Previous works such as (Kaufman et al. [2014], Miri et al. [2017]) have found differences in neural subspaces between distinct behavioral states. Furthermore, correlation-based analysis methods, such as functional connectivity, also reveal that the brain-wide covariation in neural activity changes during movement. For example, West et al. [2022] highlight the changes in functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex, representing a series of changes in the cortical state from rest to locomotion and on return to rest. In practice, researchers typically model switching temporal dynamics by fitting different model parameters to consecutive temporal windows of neural activity (He et al. [2023], Mitelut et al. [2022], Song et al. [2022]).

[1994], Rigotti et al. [2013], Hernandez et al. [2018], Saxena and Cunningham [2019], Cunningham and Yu [2014]). Accordingly, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown efficiency in modeling dynamics due to their non-linearity (Mante et al. [2013]). While goal-driven models have been very useful to build in normative function in these networks, data-driven RNNs are becoming more popular over recent years (Durstewitz et al. [2023], Perich et al. [2020], Duncker and Sahani [2021], Valente et al. [2022]). Specifically, these RNNs can be trained to reproduce temporal neural activity from large-scale neural recordings across a set of trials. They are also able to capture a very high amount of explained variance of the neural activity because of their static non-linearities (Durstewitz et al. [2023], Perich and Rajan [2020]). Once trained, the internal mechanisms of the RNNs can be analyzed, thus extracting the structure of the neural dynamics. Prior works have studied RNNs that perform a wide range of tasks, e.g., cognitive, sensory, motor tasks, and so on (Dubreuil et al. [2022], Mastrogiuseppe and Ostojic [2018]). However, with a few notable exceptions, models do not typically express neural activity as a set of switching nonlinear functions and directly reproduce recorded neural data. Here, we develop Switching Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNNs) which, through switches between different time-varying weights as determined by Markov transitions, are able to directly model neural activity as emanating from a discretely changing set of low-dimensional dynamical models. We perform end-to-end training of SRNNs to reconstruct the neural observations through Variational Inference. We validate SRNNs on a simulated dataset, and then analyze the performance of SRNNs on three different experimental data with distinct recording modalities and behavioral tasks with different animals: (1) electrophysiological recordings of single-unit MC activity from a non-human primate performing a reaching task (Churchland et al. [2012]), (2) cortex-wide widefield calcium imaging (WFCI) from mice performing a complex self-initiated decision-making task (Musall et al. [2019]), and (3) WFCI from mice performing a simple self-initiated lever-pull task (Mitelut et al. [2022]). We are able to not only reconstruct the multidimensional neural activity but accurately predict forward in time and recover behaviorally-relevant switches of neural dynamics.

In Perich and Rajan [2020], the authors introduce Current-Based Decomposition (CURBD), an approach for inferring brain-wide interactions using data driven RNNs that directly reproduce experimentallyobtained neural data. In Mastrogiuseppe and Ostojic [2018], the authors used low-rank RNNs trained on high-dimensional neural activity obtained from different tasks and successfully characterized the neural dynamics and connectivity between neurons.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Switching State Space Models Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a commonly-used statistical model based on a Markov process: it dictates the evolution of observations where the evolution is determined by internal factors, which are not directly observable. HMMs are widely used in computational neuroscience to identify different neural events (Baldassano et al. [2017], Masaracchia et al. [2023], Baldassano et al. [2016]). Previous studies have also explored switching dynamical systems, with the observations emanating from a dynamical system that discretely switches according to a Markov process. Auto-regressive HMMs and Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) are commonly used models, where the discrete state transitions and observation dynamics are both linear and dependent solely on the previous timepoints. Various extensions of these also applied changes to these models. For example, in Linderman et al. [2017], the authors make the current discrete state dependent on the previous continuous state, termed recurrent-SLDS (rSLDS). Researchers have also changed the dynamics process to be nonlinear, such as in a Structured Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) (Johnson et al. [2016]). Moreover, both nonlinear transitions and nonlinear dynamics processes were also proposed, such as in a Switching Nonlinear Dynamical System (SNLDS) (Dong et al. [2020]). Out of these, SRNNs have the most comparable structure to SNLDS; the main differences are: (1) we specify the dynamical system as an RNN instead of passing the data to neural networks with nonlinear activation functions; (2) our transition process is the same as rSLDS, which is dependent on the previous hidden state instead of the observation in SNLDS; (3) we constrain the structure of the models in order to predict future observations. Moreover, here we analyze the ability of the model to reconstruct and elucidate the structure of recorded neural activity, while examining prediction as well as region-to-region interactions (Appendix). A relevant recent study also explored the communication between brain regions via multi-regional switching dynamical systems (MR-SDS) (Karniol-Tambour et al.

A well-known approach is the ExpectationMaxmization (EM) algorithm, which is to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in State Space Models, e.g., Baum-Welch Algorithm for HMMs (Bishop and Nasrabadi [2006]). Another common approach to estimating the parameters of Switching State Space Model is Variational Inference (VI), which turns the problem of computing conditional distributions of latent variables into an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by gradient descent. Essentially, this consists of maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) to learn the parameters (Kingma and Welling [2013], Linderman et al. [2017]). The reparameterization trick is a crucial technique in VI, which enables more efficient gradient estimation during optimization. Instead of sampling from the variational distribution itself, reparameterization models the parameters of a distribution, usually Gaussian. This allows the gradient of the objective function with respect to the variational distribution parameters to be computed directly, and backpropagation to be implemented easily. To enable the model to generalize effectively to unseen data, we use Amortized VI. Instead of optimizing for single trials of neural activity independently as in traditional VI, Amortized VI allows us to train the models on multiple trials simultaneously, thus creating a more stable mapping between the observations and the latent variables (Dong et al.

Using SRNNs, we recover these states purely using the neural activity. ", "page_idx": 5}, {"type": "text", "text": "Firstly, we train SRNNs and competing methods on the two different types of reaching conditions (curved reaches and direct reaches) separately. We use $N$ -fold cross-validation, where $N$ equals to the number of conditions in the data; $N=18$ for curved reaches and $N=9$ for direct reaches. We show an example of comparison between neural dynamical states recovered by different models and the behavioral states, in Figure 3A and Figure D.1A. The neural dynamical states recovered by SRNNs in both curved and direct reaching match their corresponding behavioral states. We use $P=16$ for the latent state $(h)$ dimensionality for all three models in Figure 3A. We quantify the difference between the recovered neural dynamical states and the behavioral states by considering them an imbalanced multi-class classification, i.e., one state as one class, the error of the classification measures the difference between the neural and behavioral states. Specifically, it is defined as the average of \u20181-recall\u2019 obtained on each class (Mosley [2013]). We claim that 0 error between the recovered neural dynamical states and behavioral states does not necessarily mean that the recovered neural dynamical states are perfectly identified, because the neural dynamical switches may happen consistently leading to or following the behavioral state switches. However, these states recovered by the models with small errors can still be considered as behaviorally-relevant states, which can help us understand the cognitive function implemented in the brain. We show the error for different hidden states in Figure 3B, which illustrates that SRNNs outperform SLDS, rSLDS, SNLDS, and $\\mathrm{mrSDS}$ on recovering the behavior-relevant neural dynamical states for 4 different values for the latent state dimensionality $P$ . We determine the number of discrete latent states via a hyperparameter sweep for SRNNs. We consider the following metrics to compare the performance of SRNNs with different $K$ : (1) Convergence to lower number of discrete states and reuse of discrete states: We tested our model by changing the number of hidden states $K$ while keeping the number of continuous latent states $P$ constant. We show a comparison in Figure D.3A. We found that $61\\%$ of SRNNs with a higher number of discrete hidden states (e.g., $K=6$ ) finally converge to the optimal number of discrete hidden states, i.e., $K=5$ , and $94\\%$ of SRNNs with a lower number of discrete hidden states (e.g., $K=4$ ) had at least one hidden state reused after other states; in other words, SRNNs are not able to perform well with 4 unique discrete hidden states without reusing one of them. (2) Reconstruction performance plateau: While keeping other hyperparameters constant, the reconstruction accuracy plateaus at the same number of discrete states as in the behavior. Thus, we can set $K$ as the minimum number of discrete states as it takes for the model to perform well. We show that SRNNs with $K=5$ have lower reconstruction error in Figure D.3B. Moreover, we also implemented a \u2018co-smoothing\u2019 analysis (Yu et al. [2008]Karniol-Tambour et al. [2023]); we show the results in Figure D.3C, where we found that $K=5$ also does well in reconstructing the data with a \u2018co-smoothing\u2019 neuron drop-out analysis. (3) Variability across conditions: In stereotyped tasks or experiments, such as reaching, there may not be a significant amount of variability in the timing of behavior across conditions, and this variability can thus be used as a metric for determining the optimal number of discrete states. Here, we found that SRNNs with $K=5$ have much lower variability on recovered behaviorally-relevant states than $K=4$ and $K=6$ (i.e., 0.098 for $K=5$ , 0.384 for $K=4$ , and 0.282 for $K=6$ in Figure D.3D).

The results show that SRNNs outperform competing models in both recovering behaviorally-relevant neural states, and predicting future neural activity. However, certain limitations of this method still exist. Firstly, we set the maximum number of discrete states manually based on our observations of behavior, but we note that the reconstruction accuracy does not change drastically if we change this hyperparameter. Secondly, analogous to other generative models trained via Variational Inference, the model needs a good initialization to be trained efficiently; without this, the model may get stuck in one state and not adequately capture the switching nature of neural dynamics. Lastly, the complexity of the model increases the training time, for example, one experiment for SRNNs trained on reaching datasets may take several hours (e.g., around 6.5 hours on one session of curved reaching on NVIDIA A100 GPUs), which is more than the amount of time taken by SLDS and rSLDS (typically less than one hour). In conclusion, we use SRNNs to identify behaviorally-relevant neural dynamical states. We find that the neural dynamics have behaviorally-relevant switches across time and we are able to use SRNNs to capture these switches as well as the corresponding dynamical features.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
