Current methods demand computing forces on all microscopic coordinates, a significant hurdle for large systems.  This study addresses this limitation by focusing on macroscopic properties directly, rather than relying on full microscopic detail. \n\nThe researchers propose a novel method that learns macroscopic dynamics using only partial microscopic force computations. This approach relies on a sparsity assumption; each microscopic force depends only on a few others. By mapping the training to the microscopic level and using partial forces as a stochastic estimate, the method updates model parameters efficiently.  The paper demonstrates accuracy and efficiency gains through various simulations, showcasing its potential for modeling complex systems more effectively.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cjH0Qsgd0D/podcast.wav"}
