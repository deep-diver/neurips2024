In this paper, we study this problem from a theoretical perspective, building on prior work on this topic [13, 26, 12, 42]. We focus on transfer learning via learning a representation that provides a method for sharing knowledge between different, albeit related, tasks [7, 45, 14, 29, 49].

Prior work has shown that the normalization of model weights, data, and the definition of robustness can significantly impact the dimensional cost of achieving adversarial robustness. Although not directly comparable, it is informative to contrast the generalization bounds for linear classifiers presented by [5] and [17]. Both works perform Rademacher complexity based analysis with losses that are Lipschitz and satisfy certain monotonic properties. However, they mainly differ in how they normalize the quantities involved. Let $p$ and $q$ be Holder-conjugates. [5] consider $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{p}$ linear classifiers with $\\left\\lVert\\cdot\\right\\rVert_{q}$ normalized data being attacked with $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$ perturbations. They show that the Rademacher complexity of suitably transformed version of the linear model, after applying Talagrand's contraction lemma, has a tight $d^{1/q}$ dimensional dependence. Thus, when $p=1$ , there is no dimensional dependence. On the other hand, [17] consider ${\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|}_{2}$ and $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{p}$ bounded linear classifiers with data being $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_{2}$ bounded and being attacked with $\\left\\lVert\\cdot\\right\\rVert_{q}$ perturbations. They show that the Rademacher complexity of similarly transformed function class has no dimensional dependence. Both rates lead to generalization bounds on the robust risk. Taken together, these works demonstrate how prior research has strongly leveraged the relationship between the norm on the attack, which we cannot control, and the model and data norms. Both works also provide rates for neural networks. [5] provides a lower bound, showing that a certain variational version of a neural network has a $\\sqrt{d}$ lower bound.

Theoretical analyses of adversarial transfer in MTRL remain relatively scarce, despite many empirical studies [33, 47, 43, 1, 38, 32]. Two works that provide theoretical insights into this problem are [13] and [26]. First, [13] is perhaps the first theoretical study of this problem. Specifically, they study a shared linear projection onto a smaller dimensional subspace with linear classifiers trained on top of it, analogous to the regression study in [36, 15]. Under $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$ Or $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert_{2}$ perturbation attacks, they show that the transfer risk of the adversarial loss decays as $\\sqrt{k/m}+\\sqrt{k^{2}d/n t}$ along with multiplicative constants that depend on task diversity and can reduce the rate as more diverse tasks are gathered. In addition, they study the combination of semisupervised learning and adversarial training and show their complementary qualities. Second, [26] considers a composite model, with a linear model being trained on top of a neural network. For additive perturbations and Lipschitz losses, they provide two results showing that the robustness of the predictor is bounded by the robustness of the representation it is trained on. Their first result, with high probability, bounds the difference between the adversarial loss of the end-to-end predictor and the standard loss in terms of the average Euclidean difference in the representations over the predictions. Their second result, applied to classification, provides a sufficient condition for robustness in terms of a bound on the aforementioned Euclidean difference.

It seems that the literature has yet to formally made a distinction between these two settings. Therefore, we would like to make a few short remarks about how Assumption 4.B is natural and mild. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "First, in practice, $\\mathcal{X}$ is frequently known. Therefore, if one seeks to protect against adversarial attacks, protections can be put in place for inputs that are not in $\\mathcal{X}$ . Thus, since the adversary wants to avoid detection, it is reasonable for an adversary to only perturb within the input domain. Second, many attacks in the empirical literature naturally fall into this category, e.g., a sticker placed on a stop sign. In addition, for image classification with $\\mathcal{X}$ as the space of images, the famous examples of images [35] that have been slightly perturbed by definition fall into this category. Also, a key difficulty of being robust to adversarial attacks is caused by the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, in classification, this manifests in the distance from any point to the decision boundary being exceedingly small. This is also true under Assumption 4.B. Finally, in practice, it is common to preprocess the input before passing it to the model, e.g., subtracting the mean, removing outliers, dividing by the standard deviation, and clipping. So, it is a reasonable assumption that the input to the model, adversarial or not, will often be within the same space.

Although we both consider MTRL, there are several differences: they consider classification with representation functions that are orthonormal matrices and the predictors as linear maps, $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$ attacks, a spectral condition to relate the tasks similar to [15, 36], the loss function $(x,y)\\mapsto-{\\bar{y}}{\\bar{f}}(x)$ , and a sub-Gaussian generative model. Ignoring these differences, they show that the excess transfer risk decays as $\\dot{\\sqrt{k/m}}+\\sqrt{k^{2}d/n t}$ . In comparison, if we instantiate our function classes as they have, $C(\\mathcal{F})$ is $O(k)$ and $C(\\mathcal{H})$ is $\\mathcal{O}(d k^{2})$ (see e.g., [37, p. 7]). Plugging these values into the expression from the asymptotic analysis of the Lipschitz loss, our rate is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d k/n}+d k/\\sqrt{n t}+k/\\bar{\\sqrt{m}})$ We observe a $\\sqrt{d}$ and $\\sqrt{k}$ gap between the source tasks and target task rate, respectively, compared to their rate.

Like in Appendix B.3, we must be careful due to different assumptions. In particular, our results hold for a subtly different attack model. Let us define their notation for illustrative purposes. They define an attack as $A:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{X}$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ is the \u201cnoise class.\" They require that $\\delta\\mapsto\\ell(f(A(x,\\delta)),y)$ is $L$ -Lipschitz for $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{A}$ and, similar to our own assumption, the existence of a cover of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ . Yet, unlike Lemma 4.4 of [25], we do not require the Lipschitz assumption. Consequently, our analogous lemma, Lemma 1, applies to attack models for which theirs does not.
