It iteratively updates its prediction by considering the current loss, a positive definite symmetric matrix M, and a scale-free FTRL update. The algorithm dynamically adjusts its step size and prediction based on the accumulated loss and variance.", "section": "4 Dynamic regret for unconstrained OLO via weighted norms"}]
