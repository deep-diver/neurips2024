(A) Example target alignment plan  Ptgt, where the target over all samples from the same domain are set to \u03b1, the diagonal values are set to 1, and across-domain samples are set to \u03b2. (B) The domain classification accuracy (red) and overall class accuracy (blue) with (\u03b1 \u2013 \u03b2) increases.", "description": "This figure shows how the proposed method (GCA) can be used to improve domain generalization performance by incorporating domain-specific alignment constraints.  Panel (A) illustrates a target transport plan (Ptgt) that incorporates domain information by weighting the alignment between samples from the same domain (\u03b1) differently from those in different domains (\u03b2). Panel (B) demonstrates the effect of this weighting strategy on both domain classification accuracy (red) and overall classification accuracy (blue) as the difference between \u03b1 and \u03b2 ((\u03b1 - \u03b2)) increases.  The results show that incorporating domain information into the alignment process improves the overall performance of the model.", "section": "6.2 Block Diagonal Transport in Domain Generalization"}]
