Traditional methods are limited by the need for large, labeled datasets.  Existing deep learning approaches, while improving accuracy, still rely on supervised learning and thus suffer from the same data limitations. This reliance on large labeled datasets is costly and time-consuming to acquire, making it difficult to analyze specialized scenarios or less-common flow types.\nThis research introduces FluidMotionNet, a novel self-supervised method for dual-frame fluid motion estimation.  The core innovation is a zero-divergence loss function, efficiently implemented using a splat-based approach, which is tailored to the specific characteristics of fluid flow.  This self-supervised nature enables test-time optimization, leading to a dynamic velocimetry enhancer module that further improves accuracy. The results show that FluidMotionNet significantly outperforms existing supervised methods, even with a mere 1% of their training data.  **This demonstrates remarkable data efficiency and cross-domain robustness.**", "affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "WOBhJs9gqU/podcast.wav"}
