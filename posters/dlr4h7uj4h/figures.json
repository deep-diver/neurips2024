It visually demonstrates how codewords (points) are organized and partitioned in each method. The USQ uses uniformly spaced horizontal and vertical lines, LVQ uses a structured hexagonal lattice, and GVQ allows for arbitrarily shaped Voronoi cells to optimally fit the data distribution.  This illustrates the trade-off between complexity and effectiveness.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "dLr4H7Uj4H/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Rate-distortion curves for the Bmshj2018 model on the Kodak and CLIC datasets, evaluated in terms of MSE and SSIM.", "description": "This figure displays rate-distortion curves, illustrating the trade-off between compression rate (bits per pixel) and distortion (measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)).  The curves compare the performance of the Bmshj2018 image compression model using different quantization methods (OLVQ and standard scalar quantization (USQ)) with various context models (Factorized, Checkerboard, Channel-wise Autoregressive, and Spatial-wise Autoregressive). The results show how the proposed Optimal Lattice Vector Quantization (OLVQ) method improves the rate-distortion performance of the model compared to using uniform scalar quantization across different context models and datasets.", "section": "4.2 Comparison with scalar quantizer"}]
