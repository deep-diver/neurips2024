To overcome this, we introduced a novel learning method that designs rate-distortion optimal LVQ codebooks tailored to the sample statistics of the latent features. Our proposed method successfully adapts the LVQ structures to any given latent sample distribution, significantly improving the rate-distortion performance of existing quantization schemes in DNN-based image compression.
