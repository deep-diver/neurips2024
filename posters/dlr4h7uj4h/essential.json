While vector quantization offers better performance, it's computationally expensive. This paper tackles this challenge. \nThe proposed solution is a novel learning method that designs optimal lattice vector quantizers (OLVQ). OLVQ learns the optimal codebooks based on the statistics of latent features, achieving better rate-distortion performance than traditional methods.
