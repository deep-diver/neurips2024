It highlights how each component influences and is influenced by the others.  For example, discriminative representation learning benefits from accurate clustering results (1) and can use anomaly detection to avoid preserving abnormal patterns (2). Accurate clustering benefits from discriminative representations (3) and uses accurate anomaly detection to avoid including anomalies (4). Finally, anomaly detection benefits from both discriminative representations (5) and accurate clustering results (6), showcasing a mutually dependent and enhanced relationship.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "WpEaUIBIWH/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Interdependent relationships among representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection.", "description": "This figure illustrates the interconnectedness of representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection.

It highlights how each component influences and benefits from the others.  Discriminative representation learning improves clustering by providing a more informative feature space. Accurate clustering helps representation learning by focusing on the dominant patterns and ignoring outliers. Both contribute to improved anomaly detection. Conversely, effective anomaly detection can improve both representation learning (by removing outlier influence) and clustering (by excluding anomalies during cluster formation). This mutual enhancement is crucial for the successful integration of these components in a unified anomaly detection framework.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "WpEaUIBIWH/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Interdependent relationships among representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection.", "description": "This figure illustrates the interconnectedness of representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection.
