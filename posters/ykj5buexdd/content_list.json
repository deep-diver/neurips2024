Theoretical works have unified the many preference learning algorithms into clear taxonomies that permit analysis and, sometimes, yield new variants [2, 61, 48, 50, 63, 34]. Several works study idiosyncrasies of preference learning, such as why DPO decreases the likelihood of both rejected and chosen outputs from the dataset [42, 13, 35] and why RLHF exhibits vanishing gradients [44]. In contrast, our work approaches understanding DPO and RLHF through the lens of ranking accuracy, and our findings emphasize the role of the reference model regularization in preference learning. Relatedly, SliC-HF [67], CPO [59], and pairwise cringe loss [60] optimize log probability margins $\\log\\pi(y_{w}|x)-\\log\\pi(y_{l}|x)$ , effectively removing the regularization toward the reference model. Liu et al. [32] recommend using the reference model at inference time to exert more granular control over the regularization. Meng et al.

Several iterative training methods aim to bridge this gap, where the reference model and the dataset are refreshed during the alignment procedure to contain annotated preferences on generations from the model at that point in training [65, 24, 53].
