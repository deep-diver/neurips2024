However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner frames by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefti of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs.

On top of the success in the image domain, there has been rapid progress in the generation of videos [9, 22, 37, 31]. Despite the progress, long video generation still lags behind compared to image generation. One reason is that video diffusion models (VDMs) often consider a video as a single 4D tensor with an additional axis corresponding to time, which prevents the models from generating videos at scale. An intuitive approach to generating a long video is autoregressive generation, which iteratively predicts a future frame given the previous ones. However, in contrast to the transformerbased models [10, 28], diffusion-based models cannot directly adopt the autoregressive generation strategy due to the heavy computational costs incurred by iterative denoising steps for a single frame generation. Instead, several recent works [9, 7, 29, 12, 4, 1] adopt a chunked autoregressive generation strategy, which predicts several frames in parallel conditioned on few preceding ones, consequently reducing computational burden. While these approaches are computationally tractable, they often leads to temporal inconsistency and discontinuous motion, especially between the chunks predicted separately, because the model captures a limited temporal context available in the last few\u2014only one or two in practice\u2014frames. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address the limitation, we propose a novel inference technique, FIFO-Diffusion, which realizes arbitrarily long video generation without training based on a pretrained video generation model for short clips. Our approach effectively alleviates the limitations of the chunked autoregressive method by enabling every frame to refer to a sufficient number of preceding frames. Our approach generates frames through diagonal denoising (Section 3.1) in a first-in-first-out manner using a queue, which contains a sequence of frames with different\u2014monotonically increasing\u2014noise levels over time. At each step, a completely denoised frame at the head is popped out from the queue while a new random noise image is pushed back at the tail. Diagonal denoising offers both advantage and disadvantage; noisier frames benefti from referring to cleaner ones while the model may suffer from training-inference gap because video models are generally trained to denoise frames with the same noise level. To overcome this trade-off and embrace the advantage of diagonal denoising, we propose latent partitioning (Section 3.2) and lookahead denoising (Section 3.3). Latent partitioning reduces training-inference gap by narrowing the range of noise levels in to-be-denoised frames and enables inference with finer steps. Lookahead denoising allows to-be-denoised frames to reference cleaner frames, thereby performing more accurate noise prediction. Furthermore, both latent partitioning and lookahead denoising offer parallelizability on multiple GPUs. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our main contributions are summarized below.

On the other hand, Make-A-Video [22] employs a 1D temporal convolution layer following a 2D spatial convolutional layer to approximate 3D convolution. This design enables the model to capture visual-textual relationships by training spatial layers with image-text pairs before incorporating temporal context through 1D temporal layers. Recently, [16] introduce a transformer architecture, known as DiT, for diffusion models.

Autoregressive methods are capable of producing indefinitely long videos in theory, but they often suffer from quality degradation due to error accumulation and limited temporal consistency across frames. Alternatively, NUWA-XL [34] adopts a hierarchical approach, where a global diffusion model generates sparse key frames with local diffusion models filling in frames using the key frames as references.

However, training diffusion models from scratch introduces significant computational costs, especially for text-to-video generation tasks. In contrast, our approach is a training-free inference technique based on the standard diffusion models, trained on latents with uniform noise, for sequence generation within the sliding window framework. While [20] is implemented with a nested loop to deal with two different axes corresponding to video frame index and diffusion time step, FIFO-Diffusion combines these two dimensions using a 1D queue, improving efficiency with a single loop.

Our approach achieves this by introducing diagonal denoising, which processes latents with increasing noise levels using a queue in a first-in-first-out fashion. While diagonal denoising presents a trade-off, we addressed its limitations with latent partitioning and leveraged its strengths with lookahead denoising. Together, these techniques allow FIFO-Diffusion to generate high-quality, long videos that maintain strong scene consistency and expressive dynamic motion. Although latent partitioning reduces the training-inference gap of diagonal denoising, the gap persists due to changes in the model\u2019s input distribution. However, we believe that this gap could be addressed by integrating the diagonal denoising paradigm into the training phase, and the benefits of FIFO-Diffusion remains for training as well. We leave this integration as future work; aligning the training and inference environments can significantly enhance FIFO-Diffusion\u2019s performance.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
