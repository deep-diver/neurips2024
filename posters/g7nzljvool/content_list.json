However, this necessitates forward/backward processes across the entire model and is limited by the incapability to fully leverage data based solely on entropy. This study presents a groundbreaking TTA solution that involves a departure from the conventional focus on minimizing entropy. Our innovative approach uniquely remodels the stem layer (i.e., the first layer) to emphasize minimizing a new learning criterion, namely, uncertainty. This method requires minimal involvement of the model\u2019s backbone, with only the stem layer participating in the TTA process. This approach significantly reduces the memory required for training and enables rapid adaptation to the target domain with minimal parameter updates. Moreover, to maximize data leveraging, the stem layer applies a discrete wavelet transform to the input features. It extracts multi-frequency domains and focuses on minimizing their individual uncertainties. The proposed method integrated into ResNet-26 and ResNet-50 models demonstrates its robustness by achieving outstanding TTA performance while using the least amount of memory compared to existing studies on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-C benchmark datasets.

Various solutions such as normalization and regularization have been proposed to address these issues [26, 56, 30]. Additionally, the need for trained models to adapt to the diversity of data distributions in the real world has also emerged recently. This phenomenon, known as domain shift, has resulted in the proposal of various scenarios and practical studies [63]. Scenarios for addressing model domain shifts are generally introduced with the key themes of domain adaptation (DA) or domain generalization (DG). These are differentiated by their capability to access the data in the target domain. To clarify, DA can access all domains but can only use unlabeled data in the target domain [16, 64, 58, 2], whereas DG can only train in the source domain [66, 34, 49, 35]. Recent source-free DA has indicated that accessing source domain data is generally infeasible. It has proposed a scenario where the target domain adapts using a teacher model that generates pseudo labels [48, 31, 12].

Typically, TTA research focuses on two critical observations: (1) the variation in batch normalization (BN) statistics when domain shift occurs [52, 42] and (2) the possibility of adaptation when the models are trained to minimize the entropy of predictions [59]. Notably, recent studies based on entropy minimization improved the performance by simultaneously passing various augmentations through the input at test-time and either minimizing the average entropy [65] or flitering out noisy data points with high entropy that hinder training [45]. Although these studies enhanced the adaptation performance, they were limited by the substantial training costs and memory usage (which reduced their practicality). For these reasons, TTA performance improvement must be achieved, but in practical terms, there is a need to simultaneously eliminate unnecessary processes and conserve memory resources as much as possible due to gradient, which causes the largest power consumption in training.

This is based on the understanding that domain shifts in input images affect model outcomes. To overcome the drawbacks of the aforementioned entropy minimization, we introduce a new paradigm for fast and high-performance TTA. This is achieved using a reconstructed stem layer that incorporates a Gaussian channel attention layer (GCAL) constructed on the squeeze and excitation (SE) block [25] and domain embedding layer (DEL) based on a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT) [29].

These models are influenced significantly by the data distribution [18].

Therefore, it could be challenging for a model trained and fitted on data from $D_{s}$ to infer data from $D_{t}$ . Scenarios designed to address this domain shift are classified into DG and DA depending on whether there is direct access to the $D_{t}$ distribution during training. Both strategies primarily aim to align the feature space with domain-invariant content information and style information sensitive to variations. In DG, where access to $D_{t}$ is unavailable, auxiliary networks are frequently employed to learn the adjustment of means and standard deviations to fti the domain [15] or use generative models to create $D_{t}$ adversarial to the distribution of $D_{s}$ and train simultaneously [49, 35]. Recently, multiple augmentations were employed in conjunction with an equal number of meta-networks to comprehend meta-knowledge regarding the domain directly. This secured superior generalization performance [6]. However, this competitive trend increases the load regarding training costs and inference, thereby necessitating improvements in practicality and efficiency. In DA, where direct access to $D_{t}$ is feasible, model generalization is more convenient. However, a significant characteristic is the unavailability of labels. Early DA research involved training with labeled data from $D_{s}$ [16, 58, 64]. However, in practical applications, storing and utilizing the $D_{s}$ dataset in memory is considered unrealistic. To overcome this issue, source-free DA employs pseudo-labeling techniques by dually leveraging pre-trained models [48, 31]. Nonetheless, these approaches still have the burden of maintaining the dual models in real-world application deployment as well as the problem of confirmation bias.

It proposes a strategy to minimize the prediction entropy and significantly improve the performance by updating statistics and affine transformation parameters for each batch. MEMO [65] applies multiple augmentations to the input at test-time and minimizes the average (marginal entropy) of entropies obtained by passing the model through, thereby demonstrating better adaptation effects. EATA [45] extends TENT as the baseline. It expounds that data points with high entropy do not contribute to adaptation and proposed criteria for establishing a threshold.

It aims for a stable TTA by allocating the same class to all the samples and proposes a strategy to minimize the sharpness of the loss surface. REALM [53] achieves the highest performance among entropy minimization-based studies. Unlike other methodologies, REALM introduces a framework based on self-supervised learning that enables the inclusion of noise samples in training without skipping. However, based on existing research, achieving TTA through entropy minimization incurs the basic training cost for performing forward/backward operations globally in the model.

In particular, EcoTTA [55] introduces a pioneering method to minimize memory consumption during the TTA process.

The approach ensures that only the BN layers included in the main and auxiliary networks pass through during backpropagation, significantly shortening the path. This simultaneously reduces the memory required for gradients and the time consumed. MECTA [24] follows a training flow similar to EcoTTA, where all layers of the model are forwarded and a specialized normalization layer is introduced to minimize memory usage, particularly within the cache. However, it relies on methodologies like TENT and EATA to perform TTA. SFT [33] based on MEMO divides the model into subsets and introduces a method of learning only certain layers based on the distribution of $D_{t}$ . This provides insight into the fact that learning the initial layers is more effective in supporting adaptation learning than the subsequent ones. Notwithstanding these efforts, it is necessary to forward the entire model for TTA, owing to the training based on entropy.

Based on these advantages, 2D DWT [28] is commonly used to extract detail and edge information in the spatial domain. Additionally, it allows for multi-level decomposition until both the width and height of the input image are powers of two. This enables aggressive summarization and extraction of essential information. Through the inverse transform, the original image can be reconstructed highly accurately with minimal information loss. The 2D DWT process involves sequentially applying a one-dimensional DWT (1D DWT) [44] to the rows and columns of the input data. For 1D DWT, we operate using the simplest wavelet family, i.e., the Haar wavelet [36]. It should be noted that Haar can be performed conveniently through CONV operations [47]. In the first stage, the horizontal direction decomposition is performed to split a single original feature map into two components: the low-frequency component (LFC), which generally contains visually intuitive information and represents the basic image structure, and the high-frequency component (HFC), which includes finer details of the image and a small amount of edge information.

As depicted in Fig. 2, GCAL is the only key architecture that enables adaptation and outputs channel-wise attention and its associated uncertainty in an end-to-end manner. Similarly, as with an SE block, the extracted attention is scalar and applied to each feature on a per-channel basis. Meanwhile, the uncertainty is minimized through negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. In DEL, DWT decomposes the input feature map into multiple frequency domains while maintaining spatiality. This step is performed before CONV. It allows for capturing more diverse features from independent data, thereby better grasping the differences between $D_{s}$ and $D_{t}$ . By performing IDWT at the end of the stem layer, the shape of the features is restored to its original state before the stem layer is modified.
