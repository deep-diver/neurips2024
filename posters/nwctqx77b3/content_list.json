Our proposed scheme effectively preserves the true precision of the data while enabling subsequent lossless compression. Additionally, the approach offers flexibility by allowing the use of various lossless encoding algorithms, which can be selected based on factors such as availability, speed, and resulting file sizes, tailored to specific application requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has competitive reconstruction performance with the general-purpose methods, while providing a novel perspective on scientific data compression. MeLLoC has several limitations. As discussed in Section 3.1, its performance is contingent upon the accuracy of the differential equation models representing the data. The method is particularly suitable for scientific data whose order of magnitude aligns well with the assumed physical models. For datasets that do not fit these criteria, the method may not be as effective. The precision control, crucial for optimizing compression, also necessitates careful calibration, which might be challenging with diverse data characteristics. Despite these constraints, MeLLoC presents a valuable approach for scientific data compression.
