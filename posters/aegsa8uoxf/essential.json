This limits our ability to extract meaningful physical insights from data.  The challenge lies in efficiently searching the vast space of possible equations while adhering to known physical principles.\nThis work introduces a novel approach that integrates symmetry into automated equation discovery. By explicitly incorporating time-independent symmetries, the proposed method significantly reduces the search space and improves the accuracy and parsimony of the discovered equations.  This is achieved through a pipeline that adapts various equation discovery algorithms to incorporate symmetry constraints, either by solving them directly or by using them as a regularization term.  Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, especially in noisy datasets.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aeGSA8UoXF/podcast.wav"}
