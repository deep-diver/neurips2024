A higher number indicates better performance.  The benchmarks encompass different types of problems, including those involving string manipulation (SLIA) and bit-vector arithmetic (INV-BV). The data reveals that while both methods often generate correct solutions, ASAp's performance varies across different benchmark tasks.  In some cases, ASAp yields significantly more correct solutions, while in others, GCD outperforms ASAp.", "section": "E.2 Correctness Results for SyGuS Tasks"}]
