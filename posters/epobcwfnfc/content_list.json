As expected, DUSDi performs similarly to previous unsupervised RL methods in the DMC walker environment due to the simplicity in terms of its downstream objectives (all related to center-of-mass locomotion), but significantly outperforms all previous methods on domains where downstream tasks require coordinative control of multiple state factors. The most crucial comparison is between DUSDi and DIAYN. DIAYN is a special case of DUSDi where there is only one state factor (consisting of the entire state) and one skill component. Therefore comparing against DIAYN offers a straightforward examination of the effect of disentangled skills for downstream task learning. DUSDi significantly outperforms DIAYN in all downstream tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of using disentangled skills. In general, we found exploration-based methods to be less capable than skill discovery methods, possibly due to their lack of temporal abstraction. CIC performs very poorly, likely because the CIC objective does not explicitly encourage distinguishable skills and instead generates the intrinsic reward solely based on state entropy, making it very hard for the upper policy to select the right skill. This result again shows the importance of having a proper skill representation. DUSDi also outperforms CSD and METRA on most downstream tasks, especially on the more complex and high-dimensional domains, like Multi-Particle. This superiority is perhaps surprising considering that in our experiments, DUSDi only relies on the simple DIAYN-style intrinsic reward for skill discovery, but further demonstrates the importance of learning a disentangled skill space. It is important to notice that many techniques proposed to improve skill discovery quality (e.g., Baumli et al. [3], Zhao et al. [57]), can be seamlessly incorporated into DUSDi.

Secondly, DUSDi primarily focuses on learning a structured skill space for more efficient downstream learning, and its exploration capability during skill learning is largely determined by the specific algorithm used to optimize for our mutual information objective.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
