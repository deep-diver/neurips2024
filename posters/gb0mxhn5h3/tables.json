The methods are categorized by the prediction model used to obtain the uStim response predictions to initialize the closed-loop optimization; the training data used to train the prediction model; the uStim patterns (single or double electrodes) used in both training data and the closed-loop optimization; and the online algorithm used to choose the next uStim pattern.

It breaks down the sessions into three categories: reference sessions (no uStim), training sessions (used to train the CNN model), and closed-loop test sessions (during which MiSO was used).  The table shows how many sessions were used for each figure or result presented in the paper, clarifying which sessions contributed to the findings.  Different numbers of sessions are utilized depending on the specific experiment (single vs. double electrode stimulation) and the specific analysis performed.", "section": "Supplementary material"}, {"figure_path": "Gb0mXhn5h3/tables/tables_14_2.jpg", "caption": "S4 Closed-loop performance assessment methods", "description": "This table summarizes the methods used for evaluating the performance of closed-loop optimization in the study.
