The study compared the authors' method against three baseline methods (DreamGaussian, Wonder3D, and DreamCraft3D) for both texture appearance and geometric detail. For each comparison, participants were shown renderings from two methods and asked which one was preferable. The table shows the percentage of times the authors' method was preferred, indicating a strong preference for their method in both texture and geometry aspects.", "section": "5 Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "fA3RMMl8ii/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: List of objects in TouchTexture and their text descriptions.", "description": "This table lists the 16 objects used in the TouchTexture dataset, along with a short textual description for each object.
