Existing unsupervised methods often rely on iterative curve adjustments with limitations in convergence and performance.  Many supervised learning approaches require large, paired training datasets which are time-consuming and resource-intensive to acquire.\n\nCLODE tackles these issues by framing the iterative curve adjustment process as a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). This innovative approach allows for learning a continuous image enhancement dynamic, achieving better convergence and state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. **CLODE also offers user-controlled exposure adjustment** without modifying the network architecture, making it more flexible and user-friendly.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Enhancement"}, "podcast_path": "5p57uCUH8k/podcast.wav"}
