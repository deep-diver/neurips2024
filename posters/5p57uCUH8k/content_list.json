Despite recent   \n3 improvements in deep learning models, the lack of paired training datasets remains   \n4 a significant obstacle. Therefore, unsupervised methods have emerged as a promis  \n5 ing solution. In this work, we focus on the strength of curve-adjustment-based   \n6 approaches to tackle unsupervised methods. The majority of existing unsupervised   \n7 curve-adjustment approaches iteratively estimate higher order curve parameters   \n8 to enhance the exposure of images while efficiently preserving the details of the   \n9 images. However, the convergence of the enhancement procedure cannot be guar  \n0 anteed, leading to sensitivity to the number of iterations and limited performance.   \n11 To address this problem, we consider the iterative curve-adjustment update process   \n12 as a dynamic system and formulate it as a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations   \n13 (NODE) for the first time, and this allows us to learn a continuous dynamics of   \n14 the latent image. The strategy of utilizing NODE to leverage continuous dynamics   \n15 in iterative methods enhances unsupervised learning and aids in achieving better   \n16 convergence compared to discrete-space approaches.

Therefore, many studies have been conducted   \n22 to improve the quality of the low-light images and achieve images with optimal exposure levels.   \n23 In particular, recent supervision-based deep learning approaches [1, 2, 3] have shown remarkable   \n24 performance in enhancing low-light images. However, the process of collecting pairs of low-light   \n25 scenes and their corresponding ground-truth images for supervised learning is time consuming and   \n26 resource intensive. As a result, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on low-light images have   \n27 been proposed to address this problem.   \n28 Among many unsupervised low-light image enhancement approaches, curve-adjustment-based meth  \n29 ods, conventionally used in photo editing software (e.g., Photoshop), have received much attention.   \n30 After the introduction of first learning-based curve-adjustment work by Yuan and Sun [7], iter  \n31 ative curve-adjustment-based methods have been explored in various subsequent studies. These   \n32 unsupervised methods achieve enhancement without using the ground-truth images by fitting the   \n33 brightness values of pixels in the input image to specific curves. In addition, it is advantageous to   \n34 preserve local structural information adaptively by allowing efficient pixel-by-pixel computations.   \n35 For example, ZeroDCE [6, 8] introduced a fast and lightweight neural network to predict pixel-wise   \n36 curve parameter maps within a fixed iteration step. In addition, ReLLIE [9] produced more accurate   \n37 image enhancement results by using reinforcement learning to predict the curve parameter map at   \n38 each iteration step, with users able to adjust the number of iterations.   \n39 In general, these curve-adjustment-based methods, which have fewer parameters, offer the advantage   \n40 of fast and efficient training and also demonstrate the effectiveness of using higher-order curves   \n41 for low-light image adjustment. However, conventional iterative approaches in discrete-space with   \n42 fixed update steps do not arrive at the optimal solution and cannot guarantee convergence of the   \n43 optimization. Therefore, we alleviate this problem in the discrete-space updating process of existing   \n44 methods. In doing so, we bring out the strengths of curve fitting methods by reformulating the   \n45 iterative update formula into ordinary differential equations, which allows the iterative approach to be   \n46 transformed from discrete-space to continuous-space and find input-specific higher-order curves until   \n47 convergence within a specified tolerance. To be specific, we present the Neural Ordinary Differential   \n48 Equations (NODE) model for the low-light enhancement task for the first time. By solving the   \n49 NODE problem using conventional ODE solvers, we obtain better approximate solutions to the   \n50 curve-adjustment problem, producing more accurate results than conventional results from iterative   \n5 updates in discrete-space by exploring the continuous exposure dynamics. In this work, we introduce   \n52 Continuous exposure learning for Low-light image enhancement using neural Ordinary Differential   \n53 Equations (CLODE), which is the first dynamic system for low-light image enhancement. Our main   \n54 contributions can be summarized as follows:   \n55 \u2022 CLODE is the first approach to formulate the higher-order curve estimation problem as a   \n56 NODE problem, enabling effective and accurate solutions with standard ODE solvers.   \n57 \u2022 By transforming the discrete update formula into NODE, which is solvable in continuous  \n58 space, we significantly enhance the unsupervised low-light image enhancement results across   \n59 various benchmark datasets as shown in Fig. 1.

To address   \n67 this limitation, many unsupervised methods have been developed to tackle the problem. First, there   \n68 are some approaches [10, 11, 12, 13] that utilize the principles of retinex-theory. Among them,   \n69 PairLIE [13] utilizes retinex-theory to identify the reflectance and illumination, and employs gamma   \n70 correction with user-defined gamma values to enhance the illumination. In addition, UDCN [14] and   \n71 HEP [15] use histogram equalization results as a reference for exposure enhancement. Moreover,   \n72 recent approaches using GANs have shown remarkable improvements by additionally utilizing   \n73 unpaired images of normal exposed [16, 17]. Lastly, there are curve-adjustment-based methods [6, 8,   \n74 18, 9] that transform images through tone mapping. These methods have advanced the curve-fitting   \n75 techniques from traditional editing tools into deep learning-based approaches, enhancing images by   \n76 predicting the fitting curves pixel-by-pixel. By repeating the pixel-wise curve fitting and exposure   \n77 enhancement for a fixed number of iterations in discrete-space, these approaches aim to handle locally   \n78 varying exposure levels (i.e., single image with both underexposed and overexposed areas) in an   \n79 unsupervised manner. Our CLODE also follows this unsupervised curve-adjustment-based method   \n80 and reformulates the curve-fitting problem into a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE). By   \n81 solving the NODE problem using conventional ODE solvers, we increase the accuracy of curve ftiting   \n82 and thus significantly improve the performance of low-light image enhancement.

It captures the relationship between a function   \n86 and its derivatives, providing a powerful tool for modeling dynamic systems, such as Newton\u2019s   \n87 Second Law of Motion. To effectively apply the strength of ordinary differential equations to the   \n88 deep learning model, the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) is introduced   \n89 in [19]. The use of NODE facilitates model definition and evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness in   \n90 parameter efficiency, adaptive computation, and modeling continuous data. In order to effectively   \n91 capture more complicated functions, the Augmented Neural ODE (ANODE) [20] has been introduced.   \n92 Furthermore, for seamless continuous time-series modeling, Latent ODE [21] is proposed and recently,   \n93 ClimODE [22] proposed a continuous-time NODE models for numerical weather prediction. To be   \n94 specific, in the field of computer vision, the Vid-ODE approach [23] has been introduced to generate   \n95 continuous-time videos. NODEO [24] has presented a versatile architecture tailored for deformable   \n96 image registration, and a temporal deformation model using the capabilities of NODE has been   \n97 developed in [25] to address the challenges associated with future prediction tasks in the context   \n98 of 4D reconstruction.

This can be time-consuming and potentially less   \n112 accurate in certain scenarios. To address this problem, Yuan and Sun [7] have proposed a solution   \n113 that aims to mitigate the limitations of manual adjustments. They introduced an automated approach   \n114 that involves estimating an image-specific $S_{}$ -shaped nonlinear tone curve (referred to as an $S_{}$ -curve)   \n115 tailored to each input image.

We employ the parameter regularization loss at each update step (e.g., red points   \n237 in Fig. 2 (a)) and accumulate the loss while solving the NODE problem.   \n238 Noise Removal Loss To estimate a spatially smooth $A_{t}$ regardless of the noise in the image $I_{t}$ , we   \n239 use the Noise Removal module $(g)$ to remove the noise. To train the Noise Removal module, we   \n240 utilize a self-supervision-based loss $\\mathcal{L}_{n o i s e}$ that follows the Noise2Noise approaches [31, 32, 33].   \n241 Specifically, we employ the loss introduced in Zeroshot-N2N [33].

CLODE and CLODE\u2020   \n279 outperform other unsupervised learning methods.

Moreover, two notable points   \n282 can be highlighted in Table 1. First, the effectiveness of using NODE to compute accurate higher   \n283 order curves is evident, as demonstrated by its superiority over curve-adjustment-based methods;   \n284 ZeroDCE [6] and ReLLIE [9]. Second, unlike other models trained on the same training dataset   \n285 (LOL), our model shows robust performance on both the LSRW and LOL test datasets, indicating   \n286 that our model generalizes better than conventional approaches.   \n287 In Table 2, we demonstrate the robustness under various exposure conditions including both under  \n288 and over- exposures, and evaluate the performance on SICE Part2 [35].

In the discrete setting, similar to [6], curve parameters for fixed update steps [1, 5,   \n310 10, 20, 30] are estimated in parallel ((a1) - (e1)). In the continuous setting, however, curve parameters   \n311 are estimated sequentially for non-fixed adaptive steps, up to a maximum of 30 steps ((f1)). Results   \n312 in Table 3 demonstrate that the curve parameters produced during the sequential continuous update   \n313 procedure are more accurate and verify superior performance of the proposed method over the update   \n314 procedure in the conventional discrete setting. In addition, in Fig. 5, we visualize the trajectories   \n315 of improvement by plotting PCA dimension reduction results of latent images during updates. We   \n316 observe that when curve adjustments are made in continuous space by (f1), the trajectories converge   \n317 more accurately at the final states compared to (e1).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.

However, if there is a direct path to   \n774 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n775 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n776 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n777 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n778 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n779 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n780 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n781 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n782 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n783 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n784 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n785 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n786 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n787 11.

The authors   \n800 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n801 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n802 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n803 faith effort.   \n804 12.
