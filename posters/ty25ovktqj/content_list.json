However, reconstructing real-world captures of complex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not adequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that explicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed reflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we observe that these methods are often not robust in real scenarios where non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this work, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can reconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both camera view as well as reflected view-based color parameterization techniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space enables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate, especially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with a multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on object-level datasets DTU, Shiny Blender as well as unbounded datasets Mip-NeRF 360 and Ref-NeRF real demonstrate that our method is able to robustly reconstruct complex large-scale scenes with fine details and reflective surfaces, leading to the best overall performance.

As a seminal method in view synthesis, NeRF [28] represents a scene as a continuous volumetric field with an MLP, with position and camera view direction as inputs, and renders an image using volumetric ray-tracing. Since NeRF is slow to train, some methods [30, 42, 8] use voxel-grid-like data structures to accelerate training. Many follow-up works apply NeRFs to different tasks, e.g., sparse-view synthesis [54, 31, 43], real-time rendering [9, 34, 18, 53], 3D generation [33, 23, 7] and pose estimation [24, 41, 59]. For the 3D reconstruction task, there are many methods [32, 50, 47, 55, 13, 21, 37, 26, 35] integrating NeRF with signed distance functions, a common implicit function for geometry. Specifically, they transform SDFs back to volume density for volume rendering. However, we observe that they are unable to reconstruct shiny / reflective surfaces since NeRF\u2019s camera view direction parameterization for the color prediction does not accurately model reflective parts of the scene. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "NeRFs for reflections. To render reflective appearance, [40, 5, 57, 58] extend NeRF and decompose a scene into physical components with strong simplifying assumptions, e.g., known lighting [40] or no self-occlusion [5, 57]. Recently, Ref-NeRF [44] reparameterizes the appearance prediction with separate diffuse and reflective components by using the reflected view direction, which improves the rendering of specular surfaces. As a result, recent works [51, 22, 25, 14, 27] adopt this representation to reconstruct glossy surfaces. While leading to strong view-synthesis for reflections, we find that reflected view radiance field approaches often lead to overly smooth reconstructions with missing details and that their optimization is not stable on real-world scenes. In contrast to existing methods with a single radiance field, we propose to seamlessly combine reflected view and camera view radiance fields into a novel unified radiance field with learnable weight, which is robust for reconstruction in challenging scenes with reflective surfaces. The recent preprint Factored-NeuS [12] also uses camera view and reflected view radiance fields. It separately supervises the rendered colors of two radiance fields with ground-truth color, instead of learning a weight field to combine them like ours. We find that our approach to combine two radiance fields with learnable weight is simpler to train and leads to better reconstruction. Other recent methods [17, 56, 52] use weight to compose the colors from camera view radiance field(s) to render reflections, similarly to us. [17, 56] can only handle planar reflections, e.g., mirrors, and require ground-truth masks of reflective objects to supervise the weight. In contrast, our method can handle non-planar reflective objects, e.g., spheres. As we learn the weight to compose camera view and reflected view radiance fields without supervision, our method does not require additional input and can be trained from only RGB images. MS-NeRF [52] uses multiple volume density fields and how to reconstruct the underlying surface is undefined. In contrast, we use a single SDF field to represent geometry and can hence directly extract the iso-surface from it.
