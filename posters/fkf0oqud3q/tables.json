For readability, we omit logarithmic factors that depend on T and 1/\u03b4.", "description": "This table compares the regret bounds achieved by prior work and the proposed work for differentially private online prediction from experts (DP-OPE) and differentially private online convex optimization (DP-OCO).  The regret is a measure of the algorithm's performance compared to the best possible outcome in hindsight.  The table shows that the new algorithms significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art, especially in the high-privacy regime where \u03b5 is small.", "section": "1.1 Our contributions"}]
