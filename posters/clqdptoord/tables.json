The other algorithms may be valid under weaker assumptions. For ease of comparison, we fix \u03bb\u2081/\u03bb\u2082 = 1 + \u03a9(1) and reff log(n) = O(1) for our results in this table.", "description": "This table compares different sparse PCA algorithms based on several factors: the ratio of the largest to second largest eigenvalues (\u03bb\u2081/\u03bb\u2082), whether the algorithm works for general or spiked covariance matrices, whether it converges globally, space and time complexity, and the sin\u00b2 error achieved.  Assumptions 1 and 2 from the paper are required for the proposed algorithm's performance guarantees, while others may have different requirements.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
