Existing streaming algorithms for sparse PCA either need strong initialization or assume specific covariance structures. This limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where datasets are large and complex, and prior knowledge about the covariance is unavailable.  The focus is often on a spiked covariance model, which is a simplified version of the problem. \nThis research introduces a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for streaming sparse PCA. It leverages Oja's algorithm, a well-known iterative method, and incorporates a simple thresholding technique to extract sparse principal components. The algorithm is remarkably simple and achieves the minimax error bound under some regularity conditions, using only O(d) space and O(nd) time.  The key contribution lies in a novel analysis of Oja's algorithm\u2019s unnormalized vector, proving that the support can be recovered with high probability in a single pass, paving the way for optimal error rates in high-dimensional settings.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "clQdPtooRD/podcast.wav"}
