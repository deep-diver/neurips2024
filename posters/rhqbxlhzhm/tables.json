For each dataset, it shows the number of samples, the number of original features, and the number of encoded binary features (after binarization of continuous features, if applicable).  The datasets include real-world datasets (like Flchain, Kickstarter1, Dialysis, and EmployeeAttrition) and synthetic datasets created to specifically test performance in situations with high feature correlation (SyntheticHighCorrHighDim1, SyntheticHighCorrHighDim2, SyntheticHighCorrHighDim3).", "section": "C Experimental Setup Details"}]
