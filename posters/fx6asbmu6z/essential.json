However, existing methods like graph autoencoders (GAEs) often suffer from the over-smoothing problem, where repeated information propagation leads to indistinguishable node representations.  This hinders their effectiveness in various downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification.  Additionally, many GAEs focus mainly on node-level information and lack robust universal representation for multiple tasks. \nTo address these issues, the paper introduces HC-GAE, a hierarchical cluster-based graph autoencoder.  HC-GAE tackles over-smoothing by employing hard node assignment to decompose the graph into isolated subgraphs. This prevents information from over-propagating during encoding. In addition, it utilizes soft node assignment during decoding to reconstruct the graph structure and extract both node-level and graph-level representations.  The experimental results demonstrate that HC-GAE outperforms existing methods on real-world datasets for node and graph classification tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in handling over-smoothing and generating robust representations for multiple downstream tasks.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Intelligent Education Technology and Application,Zhejiang Normal University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fx6aSBMu6z/podcast.wav"}
