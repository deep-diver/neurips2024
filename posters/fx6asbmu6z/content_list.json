For instance, the Higher-order Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) [6] has been developed based on the higher-order interactions to recognize intrinsic features across varying topological scales. Its effective expressiveness makes it capable for various graph-based tasks. The DeepRank-GNN [21] has been proposed by combining the rotation-invariant graphs and the GNN to represent proteinprotein complexes.

For instance, the Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoders (GraphMAE) [4] focusing on the feature reconstruction adopts a masking strategy and the scaled cosine error in the training model. Compared to the traditional GAE approach like VGAE [24], its decoder is retrofitted with the GNN and the re-masking operation.

Since the separated subgraphs are isolated from each other, the convolution operation cannot propagate the node information between different subgraphs. The proposed HC-GAE can in turn reduce the over-smoothing problem arising in the classical GAEs. Moreover, since the effect of the graph structure perturbation is limited within each subgraph, the required convolution operation performed on each subgraph can strengthen the robustness of the encoder for the proposed HC-GAE. As a result, the outputs of the encoder can be employed as the graph-level representations. On the other hand, for the decoding process, we adopt the soft node assignment to reconstruct the original graph structure by expanding each coarsened node into all retrieved nodes probabilistically.

Thus, these GAE methods are usually employed for node classification, and have poor performance for graph classification. To overcome this shortcoming, the proposed HC-GAE model adopt the following schemes. First, the HC-GAE adopts the node assignment strategy to improve the encoding and decoding performance. Specifically, for the encoder, we utilize the hard node assignment to decompose the input graph into separated subgraphs to extract local structural information, and this can reduce the redundancy for the graph-level representation learning. On the other hand, for the decoder, we use the soft node assignment to reconstruct the original graph structure, and employ the associated node features of the reconstructed graph as the node-level representations. The combination of these assignment strategies guarantees that the HC-GAE can effectively learn multi-level representations for various downstream tasks. Second, the loss function of the HC-GAE consists of both the local and global loss. The global loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{global}}$ can either reconstruct the graph features or the topological structures, reducing the over-emphasizing on graph features. The local loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{local}}$ not only plays a role of regularization in $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{HC-GAE}}$ , but also captures the local information from the separated subgraphs, improving the generalization of the graph representations through the local information [35].

Thus these models are only effective for node classification and have poor performance for graph classification.

During the decoding process, the HC-GAE has employed the soft node assignment to reconstruct the original graph structure, by expanding the coarsened graph of the encoder. The proposed HC-GAE can not only extract hierarchical structural features of the original graph, but also reduce the notorious over-smoothing problem arising in most classical GAEs, by restricting the convolution operation within each separated subgraphs during the encoding process.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
