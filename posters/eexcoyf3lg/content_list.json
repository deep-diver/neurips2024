With its significant economic potential in e-commerce and entertainment, this technique is attracting widespread attention from the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. Given a pair of source and reference face images, makeup transfer involves simultaneously focusing on the realism of the transferred result, the content preservation of the source image, and the makeup fidelity of the reference image. Although previous approaches [21, 3, 11, 4, 17, 24, 7, 29, 27, 16, 26, 41, 36, 47, 46] have made significant advances in image realism and content preservation , the challenge of achieving high-fidelity transfer of various makeup styles still remains unsolved.

On the one hand, makeup transfer is essentially an unsupervised task, which means that there are no real transferred images that can be used as labeled targets for model training. To address this issue, previous methods typically synthesize a \"pseudo\" ground truth from each input source-reference image pair, as an alternative supervision signal. However, as shown in Figure 1(a), current pseudo-paired data synthesis techniques, including histogram matching [21, 29] and geometric distortion [11, 41, 36], fail to produce desirable outcomes. The reason is that histogram-matching-based methods often ignore the spatial properties of makeup styles, thus generating over-smoothed targets that lose most makeup details. And since the warping process in geometric-distortion-based methods relies solely on the shape information (e.g., facial landmarks) of input images, their pseudo targets usually contain undesired artifacts. Consequently, these sub-optimal pseudo-paired data will inevitably misguide the model training. This eventually results in the fact that most existing methods [21, 17, 24, 7, 41, 36, 47] generally exhibit low makeup fidelity, especially for those images with complex makeup details.

Specifically, given a face image, SHMT first extracts its content and makeup representations, and then simulates the makeup transfer procedure by reconstructing the original input from these decoupled information. In SHMT, the content representation of a face image includes its 3D shape and texture details, while the associated makeup representation is captured by destroying the content information from the input image through using random spatial transformations. In this way, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, thus eliminating the misguidance of pseudo-paired data. To address the second issue, we introduce a Laplacian pyramid [2] to hierarchically decompose the texture information in input image, allowing SHMT to flexibly control the preservation or discard of these content details for various makeup styles, as illustrated in Figure 2.

RamGAN [45] and SpMT [54] explore local attention to eliminate potential associations between different makeup components. Considering that histogram matching discards the spatial properties of the makeup styles, FAT [41] and SSAT [36, 37] design a pseudo-paired data synthesis based on geometric distortion. EleGANt [47] proposes a more effective pseudo-paired data by assigning varying weights to above two synthesis methods for performance improvement.

Figure 8 (a) illustrates the visual comparison of SHMT with varying texture details in handling both simple and complex makeup styles. SHMT- $h_{0}$ tends to preserve high-frequency details of the source image, such as subtle expressions, single and double eyelids, eyelashes, and freckles. It is more suitable for simple makeup transfer. On the other hand, SHMT- $h_{4}$ is more likely to transfer the high-frequency details from the reference image, making it more appropriate for complex makeup transfer. By staggering the timestep and employing a different model to predict the noise, i.e., using SHMT- $h_{0}$ for [T,t] and SHMT- $h_{4}$ for (t,0), we can easily achieve a seamless interpolation between the two results.

In addition, $w$ of SHMT- $h_{4}$ is significantly higher than that of SHMT- $h_{0}$ at each timestep $t$ , which we attribute to the fact that transfering high-frequency texture details requires more precision in semantic alignment.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
