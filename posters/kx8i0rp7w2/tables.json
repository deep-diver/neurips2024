The metric backbone is approximated by only using 2logn shortest-path trees. The table shows the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and the number of edges for each algorithm and graph type.  Higher ARI values indicate better community structure preservation.", "section": "4 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "Kx8I0rP7w2/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Dimensions of networks considered.

The metric backbone is a sparsified version of the graph containing only edges that belong to at least one shortest path between any pair of nodes. The table demonstrates that the metric backbone significantly reduces the number of edges while maintaining relevant network properties such as community structure.", "section": "4 Experimental Results"}]
