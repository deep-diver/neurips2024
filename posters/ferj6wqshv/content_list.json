To address this, we propose a novel Prompt Contrastive Recovery approach, PCRIL, which progressively identifies promising positive classes from unknown label sets and recursively searches for other relevant labels. Identifying unknowns is nontrivial due to the fixed and long-tailed patterns of positive label sets in training data, which hampers the discovery of new label combinations. Therefore, we consider each subset of positive labels and construct three types of negative prompts through deletion, addition, and replacement for prompt learning. The augmented supervision guides the model to measure the completeness of label sets, thus facilitating the subsequent greedy tree search for label completion. We also address extreme cases of significant unknown labels and lack of negative pairwise supervision by deriving two augmentation strategies: seeking unknown-complementary samples for mixup and random filpping for negative labels.

To overcome these challenges, we introduced Prompt Contrastive Recovery for CMH with Incomplete Labels (PCRIL), a novel framework that jointly recovers semantic classes and pairwise similarity. This is the first CMH method to enable prompt learning with incomplete labels. Specifically, by constructing contrastive learning with a hierarchical label prompting method, prompt contrastive recovery learns the completeness of label descriptors and detects lost labels. Moreover, complementary semantic augmentation eliminates the sparsity of semantic pairs via a complementary feature blending strategy to restore similarity. An adaptive negative masking strategy is adopted to further balance the pairwise hashing. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks validated that PCRIL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art CMH methods with different partial levels.

However, annotation length exceeding the CLIP capacity is extremely rare in practice. Meanwhile, the learning of PCR relies on sufficient multi-labeled samples.
