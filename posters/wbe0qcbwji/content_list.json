While these methods can deceive classifiers using minimal geometric perturbations, they are not as successful in black-box attack scenarios. Furthermore, the recent surge in adversarial defense methods [26, 33] primarily targets geometric-based attacks, gradually reducing their effectiveness. In response to these challenges, unrestricted adversarial attacks are gaining traction as a potential solution.
