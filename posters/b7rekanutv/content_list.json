ML methods for charge density prediction are promising as a means of greatly accelerating DFT by circumventing the iterative procedure used to find the ground-state charge density given a set of atomic coordinates. In this paper, we propose a recipe that combines three ingredients: (1) virtual nodes; (2) expressive basis sets; and (3) high-capacity equivariant networks that collectively outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while being more than an order of magnitude faster. Nevertheless, there are still many directions for further improving the performance of our proposed model. First, the simple heuristic of assigning virtual node coordinates to bond centers may not be optimal. With recent advances in auto-regressive [46] and diffusion-based [47, 48] equivariant generative models for 3D atomic structures, learning to insert the virtual orbitals may be a promising avenue for optimizing the placement of virtual nodes, thus improving charge density prediction. Due to the \u201cnearsighted\u201d nature of electronic matter [49], an automated method for placing a higher density of virtual nodes near sites of chemical relevance may also be worthwhile to pursue. Second, we can use basis functions beyond Gaussian-type orbitals (e.g., Slater-type orbitals [50, 51] or non-decay radial basis functions [52]) that may require fewer functions to achieve the same level of accuracy. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "There are several limitations of the current paper that we aim to address in future work: (1) Despite substantial improvements in efficiency, the computational cost for training the current model is still significant: our best-performing model was pretrained for six days and fine-tuned for six days over four NVIDIA A100 GPUs for the QM9 charge density prediction task. The scaling factor fine-tuning stage requires a small learning rate, which prolongs training. The prediction model can benefti from resolving the training instability issues with the scaling factors as well as further improvement on the model architecture [53]. (2) While our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9 charge density prediction benchmark, its effectiveness in crystalline materials [21, 8] has major room for improvement. The GTOs and the equivariant network can be applied to materials without modification. The bond-midpoint-based virtual node assignment for molecules can be generalized to crystals through a crystal graph construction algorithm, such as CrystalNN [54]. Alternatively, virtual nodes can be iteratively added to occupy void space inside the unit cell of the material using an algorithm based on the Voronoi diagram [55]. The virtual nodes are expected to play an even more important role in prediction accuracy \u2014 this is because the diverse atomic species in materials and their complex interactions induce even more complex charge density patterns. (3) To better validate the practical utility of the predicted charge density, evaluation on the reduction of self-consistent field calculations, or on recovering physical observables, such as energy and forces [7, 56, 15], will be highly valuable.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
