Real-world data, however, frequently exhibits autocorrelation and cross-lag correlation due to omitted factors.  Ignoring this correlation leads to inaccurate uncertainty quantification and suboptimal predictive performance.  Existing deep learning models, while efficient in handling contemporaneous covariance, often fail to address this temporal dependence effectively.\nThis work presents a novel method to address the limitations of existing probabilistic forecasting models by explicitly modeling the covariance structure of errors over multiple steps.  It employs a low-rank plus diagonal parameterization for contemporaneous covariance and independent latent processes to capture cross-covariance. This efficient parameterization enables scalable inference. The learned covariance matrix then calibrates predictions using observed residuals. The proposed method is evaluated using RNNs and Transformers, demonstrating significant improvements in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, especially in multivariate settings.  This method is demonstrated to be effective without adding significant model complexity.", "affiliation": "McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cAFvxVFaii/podcast.wav"}
