However, directly optimizing the L2D loss function is computationally expensive, requiring surrogate loss functions that facilitate optimization.  Previous research proposed several surrogate losses with varying consistency guarantees, but none satisfied all desired properties simultaneously.  Specifically, realizable H-consistency, Bayes-consistency and H-consistency bounds were not achieved in previous works. \nThis paper introduces a broad family of surrogate loss functions for L2D, parameterized by a non-increasing function. The authors prove that these functions achieve realizable H-consistency under mild conditions.  Furthermore, for classification error cost functions, these losses admit H-consistency bounds. Notably, the paper resolves an open question regarding a previous surrogate loss function, proving both its realizable H-consistency and Bayes-consistency. The authors identify specific choices of the parameter function that lead to H-consistent surrogate losses for any general cost function, achieving the desired consistency properties simultaneously. Empirical results demonstrate that these proposed surrogate losses are either comparable or superior to existing baselines across various datasets.", "affiliation": "Courant Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "OcO2XakUUK/podcast.wav"}
