{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in deepfake detection because it challenges the existing paradigm of solely relying on blendfake data for training.  **It introduces a novel approach, ProDet, that effectively leverages both blendfake and deepfake data, significantly improving generalization and robustness of deepfake detectors.** This opens avenues for improving detection accuracy and adapting to the evolving nature of deepfake technologies, which is vital for addressing privacy and security concerns.", "summary": "ProDet: Deepfake detection enhanced by progressively organizing blendfake and deepfake data in the latent space, improving generalization and robustness.", "takeaways": ["ProDet effectively combines blendfake and deepfake data for training deepfake detectors, addressing limitations of previous methods.", "The proposed Oriented Progressive Regularizer (OPR) and feature bridging techniques facilitate a smooth transition between real, blendfake, and deepfake data in the latent space.", "ProDet demonstrates superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and unseen perturbations."], "tldr": "Current state-of-the-art deepfake detectors often use only blendfake data for training, avoiding deepfake data due to empirically observed performance issues. This raises a critical question: can deepfake data be entirely discarded? This paper investigates this question and finds this to be counter-intuitive. Deepfakes contain additional forgery clues. \nTo address this, the paper introduces ProDet, a novel method that leverages both blendfake and deepfake data by organizing them progressively in the latent space. This is achieved through an Oriented Progressive Regularizer (OPR) and feature bridging, which ensures a smooth transition between data types and effective use of forgery information from both. Extensive experiments show ProDet outperforms existing methods in generalization and robustness.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "vh9yEPLeyD/podcast.wav"}
