Current dense and sparse behavioral representations struggle with inefficiency and inconsistency in multi-agent modeling, leading to instability of collective behavioral patterns when integrating prediction and planning (IPP). To address this, we initiate a topological formation that serves as a compliant behavioral foreground to guide downstream trajectory generations. Specifically, we introduce Behavioral Topology (BeTop), a pivotal topological formulation that explicitly represents the consensual behavioral pattern among multi-agent future. BeTop is derived from braid theory to distill compliant interactive topology from multi-agent future trajectories. A synergistic learning framework (BeTopNet) supervised by BeTop facilitates the consistency of behavior prediction and planning within the predicted topology priors. Through imitative contingency learning, BeTop also effectively manages behavioral uncertainty for prediction and planning. Extensive verification on large-scale real-world datasets, including nuPlan and WOMD, demonstrates that BeTop achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction and planning tasks.

Dense representation quantizes agent behaviors under ego-centric rasterization, forecasting bird\u2019s eye view (BEV) occupancy probabilities [14, 7, 15] or temporal flow [16\u201318]. It is easy to deduce interactions, perform scalable behaviors for agents [19], and align with BEV perceptions [20]. Still, dense representation is hindered by frozen receptions. It causes safety-vulnerable intractability and occlusions potentially interacting with ego maneuvers [16, 21]. Contrary to pixel-wise behavioral probability, sparse representation forecasts agent-anchored set of trajectories [22\u201325] or intention distributions [10, 26, 27]. Its multimodal formulation for each agent marks the elasticity in diverse behavioral uncertainty and tractability under flexile spatial semantics. However, behavioral misalignment [28] and modality collapse [24] impede compliant multi-agent modeling, requiring exponential computations with growth agent numbers [29]. Issues particularly result in unstable and slow behavioral learning when exposed to predictions and planning (IPP) [30]. Typical solutions by conditional prediction [31, 28, 32] or game-theoretic reasoning [8, 33] often lead to nonstrategic maneuvers [34] due to non-compliant rollouts in adjusting interactive behaviors.

Humans primarily determine the future behavior of interacted agents for decision-making without relying on their specific states [2, 36]. Thus, an effective strategy involves assessing agent-wise behavioral impact on planning maneuvers, and reasoning about compliant interactions. Our fundamental insight is that compliant multi-agent behaviors exhibit topological formations, which can be identified by distilling consensual interactions from future behaviors. Prior works have approached this challenge through structural design [37, 38] or implicit relational learning [39\u201341] using GNNs [42] or Transformers [43].

At its core, BeTop explicitly forms the topological supervision of consensual multi-agent future interactions, and reasons to guide prediction and planning. BeTop stems from braid theory [46], which infers compliant interactions of multiple paths from the intertwining of their braids. This empowers BeTop to intuitively distill forward intertwines (occupancy) as joint topology from braided multi-agent future trajectories (Fig. 1), marrying dense and sparse representation. With the aid of BeTop, we introduce a synergistic Transformer-based learning stack, BeTopNet, for learning IPP objectives. To implement, an iterative decoding strategy simultaneously reasons about Behavioral Topology and generates trajectory sets. Then the topology-guided local attention, embedded in each decoder layer, selectively queries behavioral semantics from social-compliant agents within the predicted BeTop priors. To further alleviate multi-agent uncertainty through topological guidance, a contingency planning paradigm is fitfully deployed. We lay out the imitative contingency learning process, which regulates the safety-ensured short-term plan. It maintains the long-range uncertainty by reasoned joint predictions from BeTop. Experimental results exhibit enhanced consistency and accuracy for prediction and planning in real-world scenarios.

However, rigidity in resolution induces scenario occlusion [16], rendering intractable occupancy [21]. In parallel, sparse representation consolidates multi-agent behavior into cohesive modalities across future trajectories [52, 22, 53, 54] or intentions [27, 10, 26, 55]. Joint future behaviors are derived through goal-based sampling or recombination from marginal predictions [56\u201358]. However, the collection of joint modalities is susceptible to mode collapse and entails exponential complexity [29, 59]. Meanwhile, topological representation has garnered traction as motion primitives [60, 61] or tools [44, 45] for scenario quantification, yet topological properties delineating collective future behaviors remain largely unexplored.

Still, the absence of real-world behaviors exhibits significant gaps in interactive scenarios. Learning-based methods yield imitative planning by integrating predictions within holistic modeling [72\u201374]. However, history-based coalitions pose challenges in supervising future homology among agents. Recently, hybrid pipelines [8, 75] have utilized post-processing and optimization upon learning-based models to realize behavior interactions among predictions and planning. This can entail significant computational overhead, and imitative planning tends to overestimate hereditary uncertainty in behavior predictions. Tree-based [10, 27] and contingency-enabled [76, 11] works seek to balance planning preemption and aggression in the face of behavior uncertainty. Nonetheless, pipelines without holistic interactions fall into passive planning maneuvers and incur high exponential cost for predictions.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
