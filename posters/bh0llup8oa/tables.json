The table entries show the outcome probabilities given the actions.", "description": "This table presents a canonical contract setting with three actions (a1, a2, a3) and two outcomes (\"Failure\", \"Success\").  Each action has an associated cost (c1, c2, c3) and a probability distribution over the two outcomes. For example, action a1 (with cost 0) results in \"Failure\" with probability 1 and \"Success\" with probability 0.  Action a3 (with cost 3/6) results in \"Failure\" with probability 0 and \"Success\" with probability 1. This setting is used to illustrate how a dynamic contract can outperform the best static contract by strategically changing the contract over time.", "section": "1.2 Illustrative Example"}]
