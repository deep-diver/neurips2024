It consists of two phases: query selection and reconstruction.  The query selection phase iteratively samples subsets of points and queries them to gain information about cluster memberships. The reconstruction phase uses the query results to iteratively build a clustering solution by identifying connected components within a graph constructed from the query data. The algorithm iteratively refines the clustering, handling clusters of different sizes by employing two different strategies based on cluster size.", "section": "Algorithms with Nearly Linear Query Complexity"}]
