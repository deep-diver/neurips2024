The left panel shows a 2D embedding of four classes (a, b, c, d) into a unit cube, highlighting the central hallucination region where the model could predict a class that has zero probability under the true distribution. The right panel extends this concept to a 3D embedding of six classes (a, b, c, d, e, f) using a permutahedron, illustrating regions of strict calibration, inconsistency, and hallucinations.", "section": "Polytope Embedding and Existence of Calibrated Regions"}, {"figure_path": "xCIbVuXwPM/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (Left) Mode level sets of \u2206y where y = {a, b, c, d} embedded into a two dimensional unit cube.
