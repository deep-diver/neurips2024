Existing methods often struggle with computationally expensive enumeration when dealing with many or overlapping groups, hindering their practicality for large-scale applications.  The challenge is to design efficient algorithms that avoid explicitly checking all groups. This is crucial especially in fairness applications where considering numerous demographic attributes can lead to an explosion in the number of groups.\nThis paper introduces **novel oracle-efficient algorithms** that elegantly circumvent the enumeration problem.  Instead of explicitly checking every group, these algorithms utilize optimization oracles to access groups implicitly. This makes them computationally feasible even for extremely large datasets, a substantial improvement over existing methods. The study proves that these algorithms achieve sublinear regret under diverse conditions (i.i.d., smoothed adversarial and adversarial transductive settings), demonstrating their robustness and efficacy in different contexts.", "affiliation": "Columbia University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "klsyhjLlX5/podcast.wav"}
