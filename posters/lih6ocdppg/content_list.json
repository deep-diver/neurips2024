Interestingly, as we show in Appendix F.2, the full rank equilibria described in Theorem 3 align with this observation, as tokens lie in a narrow region on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ . While it still remains unclear how exactly such a representation geometry is useful for downstream tasks [1, 9, 14, 17], empirical studies have found that anisotropy is not necessarily harmful for semantic representations and can assist with tasks like clustering [1, 26].

This suggests that while LayerNorm improves the expressivity of pure self-attention dynamics, the resulting expressive power might still be limited in a way that it would be difficult for a generic input sequence to reach a specific configuration at equilibrium. This observation seems in line with the fact that MLP modules are crucial for the universal sequence-to-sequence approximation power of transformers [40, 41].
