Moreover, to account for the cost of switching among documents (analogous to the mental switching cost between different environments and the waiting cost of obtaining new data), we allow the network to take multiple gradient steps for each document.

Curiously, we discover that in a structured training environment, LLMs exhibit a remarkable anticipatory recovery behavior: they recover from the forgetting of one document before seeing it again, multiple steps in the sequence prior to the recurrence of the document (see Figure 1(a) and 1(b)). It is analogous to a person anticipating to eat breakfast while taking a morning shower, but leaving the thought aside for the rest of the day. Critically, we never present two documents together in context, so the model cannot directly learn sequential relationships between them. Thus, our finding is surprising as there is no explicit memory in LLMs that stores sequential knowledge across context windows, and there is no systematic overlap of content across documents\u2014the behavior emerges from a random document sequence after repeated exposure to that sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as a result of anticipatory recovery, training with fixed ordering achieves superior performance than random shuffilng in the prequential evaluation [10] setting (see Figure 1(c) and Table 1). For an agent that continuously acts and learns in the real world, the performance on the upcoming task is what matters, and prequential evaluation measures such performance.

We flatten and concatenate the model weight vectors after fine-tuning on each document. However, the cosine similarities between these raw model weight vectors are all very close to 1 without obvious structure, due to the proximity of model weights along the same optimization trajectory and numerical instability in huge weight vectors. To resolve these issues, we instead explore the structure of \u201cweight residuals.\u201d We compute the weight residuals by subtracting the average of $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{w_{\\mathrm{res}}(t)}}=w(t)-\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{n=t-T/2}^{t+T/2^{'}}w(n)}\\end{array}$ $T$ . This removes the shared components along the optimization visualizes a heat map of the cosine similarity between each pair of weight residuals from the second epoch to the fourth epoch. The visualization shows a cyclic structure in the weight residuals, as equidistant bright stripes that align with the training epochs. Furthermore, each stripe spans several documents, suggesting the similarity of weight residuals for proximal documents.

We compute the top three PCs of the flattened last-layer weight vector (the output word embedding layer) for the Pythia-1B model, and plot its trajectory in Figure 9. The plot exhibits a clear helical structure that gradually converges. We believe this is highly relevant to anticipatory recovery: right before revisiting a task, the projected model weights in the helix move closer to the point corresponding to the previous appearance of that task, leading to anticipatory recovery on the loss of that task. As we go on with cyclic training, the model also exhibits less forgetting and gradually converges to a solution that achieves low loss on all tasks. It is important to note that the helical structure of the weight trajectory is not an obviously necessary consequence of the cyclical training. Cyclical training could be expected to yield a repeating pattern, but the facts that the tasks come to be organized in a circle that respects their ordering and that the trajectory goes through one full revolution per epoch (rather than some other arc length) are nontrivial and seem to be essential for anticipatory recovery.

First, for larger networks, it is more likely that the network can develop task-specific parameters that quickly adapt to and memorize new input data, corresponding to Equation 2. And when the fast memorization is achieved, the gradient descent dynamics of the slow weights push the representations of the two adjacent tasks $\\mathbf{\\nabla}P\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $P x_{i+1}\\rangle$ closer when $f$ is an identity function, according to Equation 1. This effect can be seen in earlier LLM experiments (Figure 2), where larger models achieve significantly lower losses within a few gradient update steps. Second, larger networks have more learning capacity to map the features of two adjacent tasks closer. In our linear projection model, anticipatory recovery keeps growing over many epochs, whereas the anticipatory effect is already at the strongest within 2 or 3 epochs in LLM experiments. Moreover, all data points are randomly generated in the toy model, which makes it easier to separate and map their representations according to a temporal structure than real-world data.

Prior theoretical works have studied convergence rates, under various assumptions, for the training setup where the data points are shuffled only once and that order is reused for all epochs [21, 22, 23, 24]. On the empirical side, [25] found that shuffling the data only once in the beginning can achieve a convergence rate comparable to shuffilng every epoch.

Many subsequent works have developed cheaper algorithms under different assumptions [27, 28, 29]. Many recent works also explore the connection between online learning and meta-learning or continual learning [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. The cyclic training setting that we explore in this research can be considered as a special case of the online learning setting where the data stream has a cyclic repetition structure.

In large models, studies suggest that pre-trained vision classifiers can undertake continual learning with ease, by either freezing or fine-tuning representations [57, 58, 59]. In the language domain, research also suggests that LLMs exhibit emerging continual learning capabilities [60, 61].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
