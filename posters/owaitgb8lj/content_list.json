This optimization led to substantial improvements exceeding an order of magnitude across all metrics. On the LSUNBedrooms and LSUN-Churches datasets, the FID metric decreased from 319.66 to 22.74 and from 292.48 to 29.70, respectively.

We have supplemented our work with BBCU, a binarization method more akin to generative models like DMs rather than discriminative models. Experimental results indicate that even as a binarization strategy for generative models, BBCU faces significant breakdowns when applied to DMs, as FID dropped dramatically to 236.07 on LSUN-Bedrooms. As a work targeting QAT for DM, EfficientDM is indeed a suitable comparison, especially since it designs TALSQ to address the variation in activation range. The results show that EfficientDM struggles to adapt to the extreme scenario of W1A1, and this may be due to its quantizer having difficulty adapting to binarized DM, and using QALoRA for weight updates might yield suboptimal results compared to full-parameter QAT.

Furthermore, when we combined our two methods and applied them to LDM, we observed an additional improvement compared to the individual application of each method.
