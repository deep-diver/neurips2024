The x-axis represents the number of synthetic data points (m) used in the RKME specification.  The y-axis shows both data preservation ability and search ability. As the number of synthetic points increases, the search ability improves (approaching the ideal ability), but the data protection decreases (approaching zero protection). The shaded area indicates a practical range of m where both data privacy and search are reasonably well-balanced.", "section": "3.2 Data preservation and search ability"}, {"figure_path": "wsqDJHPUHN/tables/tables_34_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Trade-off between data consistency preservation and search ability.", "description": "This table shows the trade-off between data privacy and search ability for different values of m (number of synthetic data points in RKME). The search error represents the performance of the model obtained through the search on the user's dataset.  Lower search error indicates better search ability.  The three types of privacy risks (consistency, linkage, and inference) are shown as percentages. Lower percentages for these metrics indicate stronger data preservation and privacy protection. The table shows that as m increases, the search error decreases, but the privacy risks also increase, demonstrating the trade-off between these two aspects.", "section": "3.2 Data preservation and search ability"}]
