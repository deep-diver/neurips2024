This paper investigates using Mamba, a more efficient linear-time sequence model, in trajectory optimization.  Existing methods face challenges with substantial parameter size and limited scalability, particularly critical in resource-constrained scenarios. \nThe paper introduces Decision Mamba (DeMa), which uses a transformer-like architecture.  Extensive experiments show DeMa outperforms existing methods like Decision Transformer (DT), achieving higher accuracy with significantly fewer parameters in both Atari and MuJoCo environments.  This demonstrates DeMa's compatibility with trajectory optimization and its potential to improve the efficiency and scalability of offline RL systems.  The hidden attention mechanism in DeMa is highlighted as a critical component.", "affiliation": "National University of Defence Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "yWSxjlFsmX/podcast.wav"}
