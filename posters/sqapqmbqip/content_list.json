One of the key challenges for many alignment methods has been that they seem to work only at the surface level, decreasing the rate of explicitly problematic model outputs while preserving internal biases that end up resurfacing during further interaction [11]. Several recent studies have found implicit biases in large language models (LLMs) originating from biases represented in their training data, including widespread racial and gender biases [12, 15] that create major roadblocks for safely using these models in domains like education [52] and medicine [16]. Current approaches to correcting these biases, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), show promise but also have significant limitations [e.g., for RLHF; 8, 11]. The difficulty of the alignment problem is further compounded in the case of personalization, where we want pre-trained agents to align with user preferences, values, or morals after only a small number of interactions [17]. When deployed models are learning by directly interacting with users, it becomes crucial to ensure safe exploration [14, 2] \u2013 the model should not harm the user as it learns their preferences. Surprisingly, even though AI systems like GPT4 [1] are now broadly available for customization and interact with millions of users every day, there has been little research on enabling safe, personalized alignment.

Recent work has increasingly explored representational alignment between humans and machines [29, 24, 30, 27, 25, 10] and has shown that machine learning models that learn humanaligned representations often perform better in few-shot learning settings, have better generalization ability, and are more robust to adversarial attacks and domain shifts than non-human-aligned models [47]. Representational misalignment has also recently been proposed as one of the two key drivers of disagreement between agents [35]. Having more human-aligned representations of the world helps to improve trust in these systems because humans can better understand what they learn, increasing opportunities for deployment for a wider set of human-centric use cases [54]. However, many modern machine learning models do not naturally learn human-like representations of the world [26, 34, 28, 32, 31].

For example, there is no clear set of values that we would want an image classification or object detection model to learn, outside of completing its relatively well-defined objective, although researchers are increasingly identifying additional objectives related to fairness and bias-minimization [22, 20]. In contrast, the question of value alignment and safe exploration arises quite naturally in reinforcement learning (e.g. [4, 44]), where an agent is given autonomy to act within its environment and thus can make harmful and poorly aligned choices as it learns. Therefore, we focus on reinforcement learning in this work, in particular a multi-armed bandit setting where we study morally relevant actions with a clear link to human values. In particular, in addition to studying whether AI agents are capable of learning a human-centric reward function with feedback, we also study characteristics of the agent\u2019s learning process with respect to safe exploration (taking fewer harmful actions) and fast learning (needing less feedback to learn), and show how representational alignment with humans impacts these.

Much of the existing literature on representational alignment is in the context of classification in computer vision, and does not consider settings such as reinforcement learning where the model has more autonomy and alignment becomes much more critical. Further, many existing papers provide empirical evaluations of how changing certain model parameters affect representational alignment, but do not provide significant motivation to improve representational alignment.

Of course, eventually the assistant should learn the human\u2019s value function; but perhaps more importantly, it should not take harmful actions as it learns. For example, the robot should not harm another person before it learns that the human thinks this (and other actions they consider \u201charmful\u201d) are bad. Instead, as soon as the robot does something the human considers slightly harmful (for instance, stealing candy), and the human gives it a penalty, we want the robot to learn that not only should it not steal candy, it also should not perform similar actions that the human also considers harmful; this relates to the idea of safe exploration. Additionally, we do not want the robot to require many (e.g., hundreds or thousands) rounds of feedback to learn the human\u2019s values, because the human may be unwilling or unable to provide this much real-time feedback.

However, there is a notable exception to this. When learning to predict the difficulty of tasks, agents with higher representational alignment exhibited somewhat safer exploration, but there was not a statistically significant effect of representational alignment in the generalization phase. We suspect that this is because the difficulty or challenge level of a particular action can vary greatly based on each individual human and their own abilities or comfort level, meaning that these ratings are less reflective of some shared notion of human values than originally anticipated and are thus not strongly correlated with a common human representation.

The additional complexity of realistic settings makes human value functions much harder to learn, even with perfect representational alignment (or the ability to perfectly simulate human representations).

Though our experiments demonstrate that representational alignment supports learning a fixed set of human values, this may not be true for all models and architectures.

In reality, there are many dimensions to human values, with significant variations at both cultural and individual levels (as shown in [6], which specifically quantifies this variation). Our human value scores were collected from English-speaking internet users from the US and, as a result, are not representative of all perspectives. While we believe our study confirms that representational alignment is an important component of solving the AI alignment problem, future work should collect a larger and more diverse set of human judgments and examine the role of representational alignment in adapting models to individual and cultural differences. Future work should also explore how the action selection strategy used by LLMs in a text-based reinforcement learning setting differs from traditional methods like Thompson sampling and kernel regression and could enable them to converge faster on tasks like ours.
