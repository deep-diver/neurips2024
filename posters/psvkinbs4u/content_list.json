This innovative strategy propels the DEQH model beyond the traditional confines of predictive machine learning models, transforming it into an iterative solver that refines Hamiltonians. This paradigm shift ushers in a new epoch of computational efficiency and scalability, enabling the model to adeptly process voluminous datasets and master the complexities of elaborate systems. The DEQH model methodology is a universal one, readily adaptable to established machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. With QHNet as the backbone, our DEQHNet has exhibited enhanced predictive accuracy in empirical evaluations on the MD17 and QH9 datasets.

To investigate this, we conducted additional experiments. We randomly selected a molecule, added a Hermitian Gaussian noise matrix to its Hamiltonian, and solved the corresponding generalized eigenvalue equation. As shown in Fig. 6, it can be seen that as the noise on the Hamiltonian gradually increases, the range of error in the orbital energy becomes larger. The errors in the orbital energy of QHNet and DEQHNet on MD17 and QH9 are all within the range shown in the figure. Only when the MAE of the Hamiltonian is sufficiently small can it be ensured that the corresponding orbital energy error is also small. In the comparison between QHNet and PhiSNet, we observed similar situations. This somewhat suggests that using existing Hamiltonian error measurements cannot definitively reflect the errors in the eigenvalues. These evidence suggests that it is a nontrivial and long-standing challenge in the domain of Hamiltonian prediction to design a proper metric on the matrix space so that reflects the metric of derived quantities e.g. energy, for which we will investigate in future work.

Therefore, to enhance training efficiency, we set the maximum number of iterations for both the forward and backward passes of DEQ to 3 in our experiments with the QH9 dataset.

Specifically, in the DFT solution process, the information from the previously obtained Hamiltonian is used to construct the current Hamiltonian for the current DFT solution. This process is repeated until certain criteria meet a set threshold. We hypothesize that introducing DEQ enables the network to learn the iterative mechanism of solving the Hamiltonian, rather than directly learning the solution to the Hamiltonian. This shift could allow the network to better capture inherent physical laws, thereby improving generalizability. Compared to models without self-consistency, DEQ introduces additional orbital information to the network input. This, coupled with the introduction of scientific priors, can expedite DFT convergence even when the model\u2019s output is simply used as the initial value for DFT. In contrast with methods that introduce self-consistency (which often include DFT computations in the loss function during model training), our method offers an architectural enhancement. The DEQH model does not directly include DFT computations, leading to a more efficient computational process. Empirically, if the dataset and molecular size are relatively small and the cost of DFT computations during training is acceptable, previous methods introducing self-consistency might outperform ours (as suggested by DEQHNet\u2019s results on water, where DEQHNet requires more data). However, when the dataset is large enough, or when it includes large molecules where DFT computation cost is prohibitive, the benefits of the DEQH model become more significant.

This limitation stems from PhiSNet\u2019s matrix prediction module, which is tailored to predict matrices of fixed size for identical molecules [32]. Additionally, based on the ablation studies, we also posit that providing the overlap matrix could enable training on data whose DFT labels are associated with varying basis sets, whereas models lacking it may be restricted to consistent DFT-level datasets. Furthermore, the DEQH model employs a method that is entirely orthogonal to the inclusion of iterative DFT processes during training to achieve the self-consistency of the Hamiltonian\u2014an architectural innovation within the model. Incorporating DFT iterations into the existing Hamiltonian training introduces a more explicit physical prior [? 28, 29, 30] compared to the DEQH model, which requires a larger dataset to enable the model to learn the iterative solving process. However, for cases involving large datasets and larger molecules, the DEQH model may be more appropriate.
