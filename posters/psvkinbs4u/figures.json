The model takes as input the structural information of a molecule, the current Hamiltonian (H<sup>t</sup>), and the overlap matrix (S).

The output of the Hamiltonian solver is the next iteration of the Hamiltonian (H<sup>t+1</sup>), which is then fed back into the model until convergence is achieved.
