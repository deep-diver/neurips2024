Object-centric learning methods can be categorized into singleimage-based, video-based, and multi-viewpoint-based approaches depending on the type of input data. Many classical object-centric methods, such as N-EM [15], AIR [2], and Slot Attention [16], learn compositional representations from a single image, establishing mechanisms to infer object-centric representations that form the basis for video- and multi-viewpoint-based approaches. Video-based methods, such as SAVi [17], utilize multi-frame videos as input, often leveraging temporal cues to model object motion and relationships and to maintain object identities across frames. Multiviewpoint-based methods, such as MulMON [5], SIMONe [7], and OCLOC [9, 10], use multiviewpoint images as input and sometimes rely on viewpoint annotations. These approaches typically model viewpoint representations individually and learn viewpoint-independent object representations for each scene. Unlike video-based methods, where video frames are continuous, the viewpoints in multi-viewpoint-based methods may be independent and unrelated. In contrast to previous approaches, where observation viewpoints are predefined or selected with a generic strategy (e.g., random or sequential), we propose an approach that actively selects viewpoints based on specific scene information.

Object-centric learning methods can also be categorized by the type of decoder used to reconstruct the input image: mixture-based decoders, transformer-based decoders, and diffusion-based decoders. Mixture-based decoders process each object representation individually, combining results through weighted summation to obtain the final reconstruction. While this approach promotes independence between object representations, it demands significant computational time and memory, often resulting in blurred, less detailed images. Transformer-based decoders, proposed by SLATE [18] and STEVE [19], employ transformer architecture to decode the set of object representations autoregressively, yielding more detailed reconstructions and effectively segmenting naturalistic images and videos. However, in more complex scenes, the slot-to-image reconstruction quality of transformer-based decoders remains limited. Diffusion-based decoders, introduced by LSD [11] and SlotDiffusion [12], leverage the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models to produce diverse and realistic images. However, current diffusion-based methods are limited to single images and videos, without support for multi-viewpoint scenes.

By active selecting the unknown viewpoint with the highest information gain as the next observation, our model enhances the accuracy of viewpoint-independent object representations.

One potential improvement is to use reconstructed features instead of reconstructed images, thereby downscaling from a high-dimensional image space to a low-dimensional vector space. This approach can significantly reduce the computational complexity associated with predicting unknown viewpoints. Another solution is to implement a more direct viewpoint selection mechanism that outputs the next observation viewpoint directly, rather than predicting each unknown viewpoint through traversal.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
