Our empirical and theoretical analysis reveals that most fine-tuned models in cloud have a small difference (delta) from their pre-trained models. To this end, we propose a novel lossless compression scheme FM-Delta specifically for storing massive fine-tuned models in cloud.

In this way, cloud only needs to store one uncompressed pretrained model and other compressed fine-tuned models. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that FM-Delta efficiently reduces cloud storage consumption for massive fine-tuned models by an average of around $50\\%$ with only negligible additional time in most end-to-end cases.

After fine-tuning, these fine-tuned models are usually uploaded to cloud storage by users for future use. This trend imposes a heavy storage overhead in the cloud. From Figure 1, we can see that the total number of models stored on HuggingFace has rapidly increased from 33,187 in 2022 to 574,270 in 2024, reflecting the prominent storage overhead on cloud providers. Among these models, fine-tuned models account for a large proportion, which exist in two forms: full fine-tuned models and parameter-efficient fine-tuned (PEFT) models(6; 7).

Therefore, lossless compression is a natural solution which perfectly reconstructs the original data(10; 11; 12; 13; 14). Lossless compression has been widely used to reduce the storage size of images, sound, and text, which often contain redundant data such as transparent backgrounds in images. However, we observe that directly applying traditional lossless compression techniques on models has almost no compression effect, since model itself seems to have little redundant bytes such as high element similarity suitable for compression.

In this way, for a certain family, the cloud only needs to hold a complete pre-trained model and other compressed fine-tuned variants, significantly reducing the storage consumption of massive full fine-tuned models. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that FM-Delta can significantly reduce the cloud storage consumption by approximately $50\\%$ for massive full fine-tuned models, achieving a compression throughput of around 109MB/s. In our implementation, model compression and decompression processes are parallel with network transfer. This ensures that the total end-to-end time for users with a network bandwidth below 800Mbps remains nearly unchanged, with only a negligible increase in pre-trained model loading time. The 800Mbps bandwidth threshold corresponds to the compression and decompression throughput. Actually, it is the common case in the real world considering the latest global average internet bandwidth 80Mbps(15). If compression is performed on the user side, the total time for model downloading or uploading can even be significantly reduced to as low as $70\\%$ of the original time.

Traditional lossless compression schemes mainly include Huffman coding(16), run-length coding(17), entropy coding(16) and LZ77(18). Based on these traditional schemes, researchers continuously propose new lossless compression algorithms to improve the compression rate and speed. Here we introduce five common algorithms, including LZMA(10), Gzip(12), Zlib(11), Bzip2(13), and FPzip(14). LZMA, known for its high compression rate, combines LZ77 with context modeling techniques. Gzip is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding, widely used in network protocols and Unix-based systems. Zlib is based on the DEFLATE algorithm(19), which also combines LZ77 and Huffman coding. Bzip2 is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform(20) and Huffman coding. The above four algorithms compress byte streams directly without considering the data format. FPzip specifically targets scientific data and compresses the delta of adjacent elements through Lorenzo predictor(21), achieving effective compression for floating-point arrays. However, when compressing models, these lossless compression algorithms have minimal effectiveness. The existing works on applying lossless compression to models have mostly focused on compressed models that have already been quantized or sparsified(22; 23). Although Hershcovitch et al. concurrently propose a byte grouping method and apply the stardard compressors to compress float models, its compression rate is limited without reporting the actual compression speed(24). In contrast, FM-Delta is the first lossless compression algorithm specifically for fine-tuned models, achieving significant storage reduction in cloud.

Delta compression is a popular compression technique which encodes a target file relative to one or more reference files through exploiting the high redundancy between them(14; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31). It has been also used in the context of neural networks to compress the model updates and has demonstrated potential in accelerating model synchronization in distributed training(27; 28), accelerating multi-model serving(31; 32), and reducing the transmission and storage of model checkpoints or versions(29; 30). In the latter case which also considers storage, models are continually updated on the same data domain, with the primary focus on meeting the accuracy requirements of the final model checkpoint. Therefore, these researches use lossy techniques like quantization to compress delta between two checkpoints. In contrast, cloud storage service for massive fine-tuned models is a totally novel issue, where storage requires the data of users \"exactly lossless\". Besides, it is still yet to be mined about the numerical relationship between fine-tuned and pre-trained models which have different data domains.

The impact on $r$ can be observed to diminish successively in sign, exponent, and fraction. Taking the 32-bit floating-point number as an example, following the most common IEEE 754 standard(49), there are respectively 1, 8, 23 bits in the sign, exponent, and fractional parts (e.g. $n_{s}=1$ , $n_{e}=8$ , and $n_{m}=23$ ). According to Inequality (6), with the same sign, the upper bound for the most significant bit position of the integer delta $r$ is 25 when wf = 22, is 26 when $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{w_{f}}{w_{p}}=2^{6}}\\end{array}$ , and is 27 when $\\frac{w_{f}}{w_{p}}=2^{14}$ , which is rare as experimentally and theoretically analyzed in Section 3.

For the sake of clarity, we further illustrate in Table 3 the most significant bit position $r$ corresponding to different ranges of fine-tuned element values, given a base (i.e. pre-trained) element value of 0.001. It can be observed that FM-Delta can accommodate a vast range of difference, with the most significant bit increasing by only 4 bits even in an extreme case where the value changes from 0.001 to 65.536. Therefore, we deduce that although FM-Delta benefits more with small tuning steps which has a higher similarity between models, it nonetheless exhibits considerable robustness for a large range of model differences.

Although we hold that the real-world cloud has powerful elastic computing resources(62), we give the following analysis on storage and computing hardware cost for better understanding.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
