The first layer uses 3-cycles (C3) as patterns to detect local subgraph structures, and the second layer uses 2-cycles (C2). The combination of these layers enables the detection of more complex patterns (like the 'spoon' pattern shown) not explicitly specified in the pattern set.  The shaded areas represent the 'receptive field' of each layer, showing how the pattern detection works cumulatively.", "section": "4 Deep Homomorphism Networks"}, {"figure_path": "KXUijdMFdG/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Example Deep Homomorphism Network (DHN) built from two P*-homomorphism layers: C3 and C2.
