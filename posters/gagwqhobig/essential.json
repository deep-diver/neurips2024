Existing methods often rely on specific representations or lack efficient temporal modeling. This research tackles these issues by proposing DINTR, a novel tracking framework. \n\nDINTR leverages the power of diffusion models for visual generation but avoids their limitations by employing a more efficient and stable interpolation mechanism.  This mechanism allows seamless transitions between video frames, enabling accurate temporal modeling. The results demonstrate DINTR's superior performance across seven benchmarks with five different types of object indications, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.", "affiliation": "University of Arkansas", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "gAgwqHOBIg/podcast.wav"}
