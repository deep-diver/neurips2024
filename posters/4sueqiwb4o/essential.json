This instability, known as the 'deadly triad', arises from the combination of off-policy learning, function approximation, and bootstrapping, leading to unreliable or divergent results.  Existing solutions often require complex modifications or strong assumptions, limiting their practicality.\nThis paper introduces RegQ, a novel algorithm designed to overcome these limitations.  RegQ incorporates a simple regularization term in the Q-learning update rule, ensuring convergence when linear function approximation is used. The authors rigorously prove the algorithm's stability and convergence using recent analytical tools based on switching system models.  They also provide an error bound on the solution, offering insights into the algorithm's performance.  Extensive experiments show that RegQ successfully converges in scenarios where standard Q-learning diverges.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4sueqIwb4o/podcast.wav"}
