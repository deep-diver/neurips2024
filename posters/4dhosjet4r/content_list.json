A popular autobidding strategy is value maximization subject to a target return-on-investment (ROI) constraint, in which the autobidding agents aim to maximize their value, such as the number of clicks/conversions, subject to a minimum admissible ratio on the return-on-investment constraint.

This is because aiming to maximize utility, $i$ may bid in a way such that both the value $i$ receives and the payment $i$ makes are smaller, but their difference (which is the utility $i$ gets) is larger. One simple fix is to consider instead the following proxy strategy: $b_{i,j}^{\\prime\\prime}=v_{i,j}/2$ .

We set $v_{1,1}=1$ , $v_{2,2}=1-\\varepsilon$ , and $v_{1,2}\\,=\\,v_{2,1}\\,=\\,0$ , where $\\varepsilon>0$ is a small quantity to be fixed later. Consider the following deterministic bidding strategies: $b_{1,1}=b_{2,1}=0$ (so bidder 1 wins in auction 1 by tiebreaking and pays 0), $b_{1,2}=1$ , and $b_{2,2}=0$ (so bidder 1 wins in auction 2 and pays 1). First we verify this is in fact an equilibrium. Observe that the ROI constraints of both bidders are satisfied. Bidder 1 does not want to deviate from $b_{1}$ , since bidder 1 already gets the maximum value possible, i.e., 1. Bidder 2 would ideally want to bid higher (possibly randomly) in auction 2 in order to win with some probability and get positive value. However, given $b_{1,2}=1$ , bidder 2 would have to bid at least 1 in order to win, which means $p_{2,2}\\geq1$ whenever $x_{2,2}=1$ . This would violate bidder 2\u2019s ROI constraint. So both bidders\u2019 strategies are best responses, and therefore form an equilibrium. On the other hand, the optimal welfare is $v_{1,1}+v_{2,2}=2-\\varepsilon.$ , and the welfare resulting from the above equilibrium is only $v_{1,1}=1$ , which means the PoA is at most $1/(2-\\varepsilon)$ .
