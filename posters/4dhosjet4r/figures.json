The x-axis represents the accuracy (\u03b3) of the reserves, ranging from 0 (completely inaccurate) to 1 (perfectly accurate). The y-axis shows the PoA, which measures the efficiency of the auction. As the accuracy of the reserves increases, the PoA improves, approaching 1 (perfect efficiency).  The curve demonstrates a smooth transition between the case with no machine learning (\u03b3 = 0) and perfect accuracy (\u03b3 = 1).", "section": "5 Improved Efficiency with ML Advice"}]
