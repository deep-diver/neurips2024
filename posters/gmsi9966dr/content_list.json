In this paper, we propose DeepITE, an innovative deep learning framework designed around a variational graph autoencoder. DeepITE can concurrently learn from both unlabeled and labeled data with different intervention targets and causal graphs, harnessing correlated information in a self or semi-supervised manner.

Within this framework, a critical yet often overlooked component is Intervention Target Estimation (ITE) [3], alternatively known as Intervention Recognition [4]. ITE is the process of pinpointing which variables in a system have been subject to intervention, particularly when such interventions are opaque or not directly manipulable. This process not only fosters a deeper understanding of the causal mechanisms driving specific outcomes, which resonates with the principles of explainable AI (XAI), but also plays a pivotal role in recognizing variables that can be strategically altered to produce desired effects, aligning with the concept of algorithmic recourse [5].

ITE is the key that unlocks definitive insight into the RCA process. It methodically pinpoints the specific services whose malfunctions\u2014stemming from network issues, hardware failures, or security breaches\u2014lead to the anomalies in question. ITE not only equips operators with a clear and logical explanation for the system\u2019s alerts, enhancing their comprehension of the issues at hand, but it also empowers them to implement immediate and effective countermeasures and fortify the system against future incidents. Beyond RCA in microservice systems, ITE\u2019s applicability extends to a multitude of domains, from unraveling the genetic factors involved in diseases within biomedicine, to tracing the determinants of user behavior for marketing.

Only recently, Varici et al. [3, 6] pioneered the exclusive study of learning intervention targets in linear SCMs. In parallel, Li et al. [4] approached the problem from the perspective of RCA, coining it intervention recognition. Finally, Yang et al. [7] extended ITE to non-linear SCMs. This handful of methods can only identify the targets for an intervention instance3 with a large sample size, relying on an accompanying dataset of known observational data, all within the confines of a fixed causal graph. The drawbacks of these strategies are twofold: From the learning perspective, they independently map data to intervention targets for each intervention instance, disregarding the potential correlations among distinct instances. In RCA scenarios, for example, various incidents could stem from the same underlying service problem. A collaborative learning approach, which considers all instances collectively, could more effectively elucidate the data-intervention target relationships. Moreover, these methods often neglect the labeled data that are often available, such as those obtained from controlled chaos engineering exercises that identify specific services as failure root causes. Consequently, opportunities to refine and expedite future similar analyses are lost. From the inference standpoint, slight changes in the data or in the graph structure necessitate a burdensome and complete re-estimation of intervention targets. In RCA contexts, this means that despite shared causality between distinct incidents, we still require piecemeal analyses for each new occurrence, leading to extended system downtime and delayed resolutions. Additionally, the premise that a large volume of data pertains to a uniform set of intervention targets is restrictive. Such data are challenging to obtain, which further complicates the assurance of these methods\u2019 performance.

In particular, we design a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) that can concurrently learn across diverse causal graphs and sets of intervention targets in a self-supervised or semi-supervised mode, thus, effectively harnesses correlated information to unravel the intricate relationship between input data and intervention targets. Once the VGAE is trained, its inference model can instantly identify intervention targets for new, unseen samples with different interventions and causal graphs, all without the need to retrain or refer to observational data. Specifically, leveraging the principle that interventions entail the removal of all incoming edges to intervention targets, our VGAE framework is designed to estimate the probability of edge removal for each node, thereby identifying the intervention targets. The generative model within the VGAE employs a non-linear Graph Neural Network (GNN), an extension of linear SCMs that adheres to causal factorization and meets the criteria for causal interventions, across causal graphs of various structures and sizes. This theoretical foundation ensures robust ITE capabilities. The generative model accepts exogenous noise variables $\\mathbf{u}$ , the adjacency matrix of the observational causal graph $\\pmb{A}$ , a Bernoulli-distributed intervention indicator $\\gamma$ characterizing edge removal probability, and outputs the distribution of endogenous variables x. Conversely, the inference model interprets a given sample of endogenous variables $\\mathbf{x}$ to infer distributions of exogenous variables u and the intervention indicator $\\gamma$ , all of which rely on the causal graph $\\pmb{A}$ . We employ graph attention networks (GAT) as the backbone due to their flexibility and scalability.

Ghassami et al. [11] explore linear structural causal models (SCMs) yet may struggle with complexity in diverse data settings. For causal insufficient systems, Jaber et al. [12] propose $\\Psi$ -FCI for matching interventional distributions to causal graphs and intervention target pairs, contending with exponential growth in complexity as the number of variables increases. Mooij et al. [13] alternatively propose a method leveraging context variables for integrating interventional datasets, but this method suffers from scalability issues with large graphs. To overcome this problem, RCD [9] further adapts the $\\Psi$ -FCI algorithm in [12] to the $\\Psi$ -PC algorithm to expedite the process in causally sufficient systems. The second approach, exemplified by CITE [3] and PreDITEr [6], zeros in on ITE by contrasting precision matrices from observational and interventional data, achieving scalability at the cost of being initially restricted to linear Gaussian SCMs. LIT [7] explores non-linear SCMs through non-linear ICA, still carrying quadratic complexity. Alternatively, CI-RCA [4] conducts ITE by detecting shifts in probability distributions of a variable conditioned on a variable\u2019s parents via hypothesis testing.

(iv) Hard&Soft Intervention: We examined DeepITE under varying ratios of hard and soft interventions, where soft interventions were modeled by modifying the linear structural equations of the intervention targets to quadratic forms.

Our results show that DeepITE exhibits robustness with performance generally improving as the sample size increases. In contrast, traditional ITE methods [3, 6, 10] typically require thousands of samples for a single graph and intervention set to perform well. This resilience can be attributed to the collaborative learning framework of DeepITE and the relatively few parameters in the GNN-based encoder and decoder.

AI explainability endeavors to demystify model decisions, a pursuit encompassing feature attribution and contrastive explanations. Feature attribution methods initially focused on associations, revealing how input features correlate with predictions [24]. Moving beyond mere correlations, recent approaches integrate causality to enhance interpretability: CXPlain [32] employs supervised learning to discern the causal impact of features on model predictions, though computational demands escalate with the need for repeated model evaluations. Generative Causal Explanations (GCE) [33] introduce disentangled latent factors to isolate causal effects, yet ensuring these factors accurately reflect the data distribution is complex. Asymmetric Shapley Value (ASV) [25], Shapley Flows [26], and PWSHAP [27] further this trend by considering the causal graphs, with the former adapting Shapley values to reflect causal structures and the latter two focusing on the causal relationships signified by the graph\u2019s edges and paths. On the other hand, Contrastive explanations, illustrated by Counterfactual Explanations (CE) [34] and Causal Algorithmic Recourse (CAR) [35, 36], offer a counterfactual narrative on how slight modifications or specific interventions could lead to different, often more favorable outcomes. Specifically, CE suggests minimal feature changes for an alternate outcome, teaching individuals how to achieve a different result. Their application must navigate constraints of plausibility and actionability to avoid recommending impractical changes. CAR extends CEs by proposing interventions grounded in causal relationships, aiming to recalibrate outcomes with consideration of the cost and effect of actions.

They can serve as a foundation for ITE by treating the most influential factors as potential intervention targets.

", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Root Cause Analysis: Lastly, graph-based RCA methods warrant discussion, due to the intertwined nature of root causes and intervention targets. These methods usually operate in two distinct stages. Initially, the graph structure is established either via causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm [28, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], Granger causality [44] and DAG-GNN [31], or it is derived from domain-specific knowledge like topology graphs [45, 46, 29, 47, 48, 49, 30]. The second stage then leverages algorithms such as PageRank [46, 31], breadth-first or depthfirst search [28, 37, 38, 29], and random walk [50, 40, 41, 42, 43, 30] for root cause localization within the graph. Despite their utility, the second stage tends to focus on association rather than causation, assigning a higher correlation to the connections between a node and its parents over those between the node and its children to consider the directionality in the causal graph. In contrast, as highlighted in the preceding sections, CI-RCA [4] emphasizes causation, utilizing linear regressionbased hypothesis testing to pinpoint intervention targets. As an alternative, RCD [9] incorporates the $\\Psi$ -PC algorithm in a hierarchical fashion, intertwining the learning of intervention targets with graph structure discovery. These approaches not only improve root cause identification but also harmonize with ITE goals, fostering a causally informed analysis in RCA. However, as noted earlier, these methods lack collaborative learning and are fully unsupervised, necessitating complete inference for each RCA instance from scratch and failing to utilize labeling information.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
