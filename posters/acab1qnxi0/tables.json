Taking HFedAvg as the benchmark, we show the speedup achieved by MTGC and other baselines as we vary aggregation periods E and H. MTGC consistently outperforms baselines, and the speedup gets more significant as E and H increase. Standard deviation is based on 3 random trials.", "description": "This table shows the number of global rounds needed by different federated learning algorithms (HFedAvg, Local Correction, Group Correction, and MTGC) to reach 80% testing accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset under various data distribution scenarios and aggregation period settings (E and H).  It highlights MTGC's superior performance and improved speedup with increasing E and H values.  Standard deviations across 3 trials are included.", "section": "5.2 Results and Discussion"}]
