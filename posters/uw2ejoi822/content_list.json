In Fig. 8a, we present a per-category IoU analysis on RENOVATE names within the ADE20K dataset.

While OpenSeg [5] is the only prior work for the name problems in open-vocabulary segmentation, there are more research works on improving name quality for open-vocabulary classification. For example, [50] improve class names by including their parents and children from the WordNet hierarchy [51]. [32] propose to replace the fixed vocabulary list with nouns extracted from best-matching captions. [52] improve the descriptiveness of the vocabulary by adding class descriptions. However, since the VLMs used by these models are all trained on image-text datasets, it is non-trivial to extend them to dense prediction tasks like segmentation. For the renaming strategy, our context name design and LLM-based generation approach ensure the diversity of our names with hierarchical concepts as well as descriptive contexts, without the use of an external word hierarchy as [51] or class descriptions as [52]. Our renaming model further improves the name quality based on the visual segments and is more specifically designed for the segmentation tasks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
