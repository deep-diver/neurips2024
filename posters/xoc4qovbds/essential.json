{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in multi-view clustering because it introduces a novel framework for evaluating and enhancing view cooperation, a critical aspect often overlooked in existing methods.  **The Shapley value-based approach provides a theoretical justification for balancing view contributions**, leading to improved clustering performance and opening avenues for future research in cooperative game theory applications to machine learning.", "summary": "Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing Multi-view Clustering (SCE-MVC) improves deep multi-view clustering by using game theory to fairly evaluate and enhance individual view contributions.", "takeaways": ["A novel framework, SCE-MVC, uses Shapley values to quantify each view's contribution to multi-view clustering.", "SCE-MVC effectively enhances view cooperation by dynamically adjusting the training speed of each view based on its contribution.", "Experimental results demonstrate that SCE-MVC consistently improves clustering performance on various benchmark datasets."], "tldr": "Multi-view clustering aims to leverage information from multiple data sources for improved performance.  However, existing deep multi-view clustering (DMVC) methods often lack a principled way to balance the contributions of different views, leading to suboptimal results.  Some views may dominate the fusion process, hindering the contribution of others.\nThis paper tackles this issue by proposing Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing Multi-view Clustering (SCE-MVC).  **SCE-MVC models DMVC as a cooperative game**, using the Shapley value to quantify each view's contribution. **It then dynamically adjusts the training process to balance view contributions**, ultimately leading to significantly improved clustering accuracy and robustness.", "affiliation": "National University of Defence Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xoc4QOvbDs/podcast.wav"}
