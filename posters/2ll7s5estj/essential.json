However, designing such algorithms is often challenging due to their increased sample and list complexities. This paper investigates this problem using geometric partitions and variants of Sperner's Lemma, which provides a geometric approach to algorithm design and analysis. Existing research utilizes these tools, but leaves open questions about the optimality of such techniques and their limitations.\nThe study reveals the near-optimality of previous work, showing that existing algorithms are nearly as efficient as possible.  Furthermore, this paper provides a new construction of secluded partitions with improved tolerance parameters. It presents a novel 'neighborhood' variation of Sperner's Lemma, offering a more nuanced understanding of geometric properties and their implications for replicable learning.  This enhances the current toolbox for designing and analyzing such algorithms.", "affiliation": "Sandia National Laboratories", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "2lL7s5ESTj/podcast.wav"}
