Existing methods using Optimal Transport (OT) to learn rewards from expert demonstrations often ignore temporal order, leading to noisy reward signals and inefficient learning. This limits RL's real-world applicability due to the difficulty and cost of manual reward design. \nThis paper introduces Temporal Optimal Transport (TemporalOT), a new method that addresses the limitations of existing OT-based reward approaches. By incorporating temporal order information using context embeddings and a masking mechanism, TemporalOT generates a more accurate and informative proxy reward, leading to improved policy learning.  Experiments on Meta-World benchmark tasks demonstrated TemporalOT's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LEed5Is4oi/podcast.wav"}
