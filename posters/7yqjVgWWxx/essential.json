Diffusion models offer an appealing alternative due to their ability to generate text in a more efficient and less computationally intensive manner. However, existing discrete diffusion models, such as Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD), suffer from computational inefficiencies and a lack of theoretical understanding.\nThis paper introduces Reparameterized Absorbing Discrete Diffusion (RADD), a novel method designed to address these limitations. RADD reparameterizes the concrete score, a key quantity in SEDD, as conditional probabilities of clean data. This simplification allows for more efficient sampling through caching and leads to a new loss function called denoise cross-entropy, enabling exact likelihood evaluation. Empirically, RADD is up to 3.5 times faster than SEDD while consistently demonstrating superior performance on zero-shot language modeling benchmarks.", "affiliation": "OpenAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "7yqjVgWWxx/podcast.wav"}
