Notably, Federated   \n15 Learning (FL) consists in training machine learning models in a distributed and collaborative way   \n16 (Konec\u02c7n\u00fd et al., 2016a,b; McMahan et al., 2017; Bonawitz et al., 2017). The key idea in this rapidly   \n17 growing field is to exploit the wealth of information stored on distant devices, such as mobile phones   \n18 or hospital workstations. The many challenges to face in FL include data privacy and robustness   \n19 to adversarial attacks, but communication-efficiency is likely to be the most critical (Kairouz et al.,   \n20 2021; Li et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2021). Indeed, in contrast to the centralized setting in a datacenter,   \n21 in FL the clients perform parallel computations but also communicate back and forth with a distant   \n22 orchestrating server. Communication typically takes place over the internet or cell phone network,   \n23 and can be slow, costly, and unreliable. It is the main bottleneck that currently prevents large-scale   \n24 deployment of FL in mass-market applications.   \n25 Two strategies to reduce the communication burden have been popularized by the pressing needs   \n26 of FL: 1) Local Training (LT), which consists in reducing the communication frequency. That is,   \n27 instead of communicating the output of every computation step involving a (stochastic) gradient call,   \n28 several such steps are performed between successive communication rounds. 2) Communication   \n29 Compression (CC), in which compressed information is sent instead of full-dimensional vectors.   \n30 We review the literature of LT and CC in Section 1.2.   \n31 We propose a new randomized algorithm named LoCoDL, which features LT and unbiased CC   \n32 for communication-efficient FL and distributed optimization. It is variance-reduced (Hanzely &   \n33 Richt\u00e1rik, 2019; Gorbunov et al., 2020a; Gower et al., 2020), so that it converges to an exact solution.   \n34 It provably beneftis from the two mechanisms of LT and CC: the communication complexity is doubly   \n35 accelerated, with a better dependency on the condition number of the functions and on the dimension   \n36 of the model.

We consider the server-client model in which $n\\,\\geq\\,1$ clients   \n41 do computations in parallel and communicate back and forth with a server. The private function   \n42 $f_{i}$ is owned by and stored on client $i\\;\\in\\;[n]\\;:=\\;\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ . Problem (1) models empirical risk   \n43 minimization, of utmost importance in machine learning (Sra et al., 2011; Shalev-Shwartz & Ben  \n44 David, 2014). More generally, minimizing a sum of functions appears in virtually all areas of science   \n45 and engineering. Our goal is to solve Problem (1) in a communication-efficient way, in the general   \n46 heterogeneous setting in which the functions $f_{i}$ , as well as $g$ , can be arbitrarily different: we do not   \n47 make any assumption on their similarity whatsoever.   \n48 We consider in this work the strongly convex setting \u2014 an analysis with nonconvex functions would   \n49 certainly require very different proof techniques, which we currently do not know how to derive. That   \n50 is, the following holds:   \n51 Assumption 1.1 (strongly convex functions). The functions $f_{i}$ and $g$ are all $L$ -smooth and $\\mu$ -strongly   \n52 convex, for some $0<\\mu\\leq L$ .1 Then we denote by $x^{\\star}$ the solution of the strongly convex problem   \n53 (1), which exists and is unique. We define the condition number $\\begin{array}{r}{\\kappa:=\\frac{L}{\\mu}}\\end{array}$   \n54 Problem (1) can be viewed as the minimization of the average of the $n$ functions $(f_{i}+g)$ , which can   \n55 be performed using calls to $\\nabla(f_{i}+g)=\\nabla f_{i}+\\nabla g$ . We do not use this straightforward interpretation.   \n56 Instead, let us illustrate the interest of having the additional function $g$ in (1), using 4 different   \n57 viewpoints. We stress that we can handle the case $g=0$ , as discussed in Section 3.1.   \n58 \u2022 Viewpoint 1: regularization. The function $g$ can be a regularizer. For instance, if the functions $f_{i}$   \n59 are convex, adding $\\begin{array}{r}{g=\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|\\cdot\\|^{2}}\\end{array}$ for a small $\\mu>0$ makes the problem $\\mu$ -strongly convex.   \n60 \u2022 Viewpoint 2: shared dataset. The function $g$ can model the cost of a common dataset, or a piece   \n61 thereof, that is known to all clients.   \n62 \u2022 Viewpoint 3: server-aided training. The function $g$ can model the cost of a core dataset, known   \n63 only to the server, which makes calls to $\\nabla g$ . This setting has been investigated in several works, with   \n64 the idea that using a small auxiliary dataset representative of the global data distribution, the server   \n65 can correct for the deviation induced by partial participation (Zhao et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021,   \n66 2023). We do not focus on this setting, because we deal with the general heterogeneous setting in   \n67 which $g$ and the $f_{i}$ are not meant to be similar in any sense, and in our work $g$ is handled by the   \n68 clients, not by the server.   \n69 \u2022 Viewpoint 4: a new mathematical and algorithmic principle. This is the idea that led to the   \n70 construction of LoCoDL, and we detail it in Section 2.1.

Before that, we note that we should distinguish uplink, or   \n75 clients-to-server, from downlink, or server-to-clients, communication. Uplink is usually slower than   \n76 downlink communication, since uploading different messages in parallel to the server is slower than   \n77 broadcasting the same message to an arbitrary number of clients. This can be due to cache memory   \n78 and aggregation speed constraints of the server, as well as asymmetry of the service provider\u2019s   \n79 systems or protocols used on the internet or cell phone network. In this work, we focus on the   \n80 uplink communication complexity, which is the bottleneck in practice. Indeed, the goal is to   \n81 exploit parallelism to obtain better performance when $n$ increases. Precisely, with LoC\u221aoDL, the uplink   \n82 communication complexity decreases from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\log\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$ when $n$ is small to $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d}\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\log\\bar{\\epsilon}^{-1})$   \n83 when $n$ is large, where the condition number $\\kappa$ is defined in Assumption 1.1, see Corollary 3.2. Many   \n84 works have considered bidirectional compression, which consists in compressing the messages sent   \n85 both ways (Gorbunov et al., 2020b; Philippenko & Dieuleveut, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Philippenko &   \n86 Dieuleveut, 2021; Condat & Richt\u00e1rik, 2022; Gruntkowska et al., 2023; Tyurin & Richt\u00e1rik, 2023b)   \n87 but to the best of our know\u221aledge, this has no impact on the downlink complexity, which cannot be   \n88 reduced further than $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\log{\\epsilon^{-1}}\\right)$ , just because there is no parallelism to exploit in this direction.   \n89 Thus, we focus our analysis on theoretical and algorithmic techniques to reduce the uplink commu  \n90 nication complexity, which we call communication complexity in short, and we ignore downlink   \n91 communication.   \n92 Communication Compression (CC) consists in applying some lossy scheme that compresses vectors   \n93 into messages of small bit size, which are communicated. For instance, the well-known rand- $k$   \n94 compressor selects $k$ coordinates of the vector uniformly at random, for some $k\\in[d]:=\\{1,\\ldots,d\\}$ .   \n95 $k$ can be as small as 1, in which case the compression factor is $d$ , which can be huge. Some   \n96 compressors, such as rand- ${\\cdot k}$ , are unbiased, whereas others are biased; we refer to Beznosikov et al.   \n97 (2020); Albasyoni et al. (2020); Horv\u00e1th et al. (2022); Condat et al. (2022b) for several examples and   \n98 a discussion of their properties. The introduction of DIANA by Mishchenko et al. (2019) was a major   \n99 milestone, as this algorithm converges linearly with the large class of unbiased compressors defined   \n100 in Section 1.3 and also considered in LoCoDL. The communication complexity $\\bar{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\kappa\\log\\epsilon^{-1})$ of   \n101 the basic Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm is reduced with DIANA to $\\mathcal{O}\\big((\\kappa+d)\\log\\epsilon^{-1}\\big)$ when $n$   \n102 is large, see Table 2. DIANA was later extended in several ways (Horv\u00e1th et al., 2022; Gorbunov   \n103 et al., 2020a; Condat & Richt\u00e1rik, 2022). An accelerated version of DIANA called ADIANA based   \n104 on Nesterov Accelerated GD has been proposed (Li et al., 2020b) and further analyzed in He et al.   \n105 (2023); it has the state-of-the-art theoretical complexity.   \n106 Algorithms converging linearly with biased compressors have also been proposed, such as EF21   \n107 (Richt\u00e1rik et al., 2021; Fatkhullin et al., 2021; Condat et al., 2022b), but the acceleration potential is   \n108 less understood than with unbiased compressors. Algorithms with CC such as MARINA (Gorbunov   \n109 et al., 2021) and DASHA (Tyurin & Richt\u00e1rik, 2023a) have been proposed for nonconvex optimization,   \n110 but their analysis requires a different approach and there is a gap in the achievable performance: their   \n111 complexity depends on $\\frac{\\omega\\kappa}{\\sqrt{n}}$ instead of $\\frac{\\omega\\kappa}{n}$ with DIANA, where $\\omega$ characterizes the compression error   \n112 variance, see (2). Therefore, we focus on the convex setting and leave the nonconvex study for future   \n113 work.   \n114 Local Training (LT) is a simple but remarkably efficient idea: the clients perform multiple Gradient   \n115 Descent (GD) steps, instead of only one, between successive communication rounds. The intuition   \n116 behind is that this leads to the communication of richer information, so that the number of com  \n117 munication rounds to reach a given accuracy is reduced. We refer to Mishchenko et al. (2022) for   \n118 a comprehensive review of LT-based algorithms, which include the popular FedAvg and Scaffold   \n119 algorithms of McMahan et al. (2017) and Karimireddy et al. (2020), respectively. Mishchenko et al.   \n120 (2022) made a breakthrough by proposing Scaffnew, the first LT-based variance-reduced algorithm   \n121 that not only converges linearly to the exact so\u221alution in the strongly convex setting, but does so with   \n122 accelerated communication complexity $O(d\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\log\\epsilon^{-1})$ . In Scaffnew, communication can occur   \n123 randomly after every iteration, but occurs only with a small probability $p$ . Thus, there ar\u221ae in average   \n124 $p^{-1}$ local steps between successive com\u221amunication rounds. The optimal dependency on $\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ (Scaman   \n125 et al., 2019) is obtained with $p\\,=\\,1/{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$ . LoCoDL has the same probabilistic LT mechanism as   \n126 Scaffnew but does not revert to it when compression is disabled, because of the additional function $g$   \n127 and tracking variables $y$ and $v$ . A different approach to LT was developed by Sadiev et al. (2022a)   \n128 with the APDA-Inexact algorithm, and generalized to handle partial participation by Grudzie\u00b4n et al.   \n129 (2023) with the 5GCS algorithm: in both algorithms, the local GD steps form an inner loop in order   \n130 to compute a proximity operator inexactly.   \n131 Combining LT and CC while retaining their beneftis is very challenging. In our strongly convex and   \n132 heterogeneous setting, the methods Qsparse-local-SGD (Basu et al., 2020) and FedPAQ (Reisizadeh   \n133 et al., 2020) do not converge linearly. FedCOMGATE features $\\mathrm{LT}+\\mathrm{CC}$ and converges linearly   \n134 (Haddadpour et al., 2021), but its complexity $\\mathcal{O}(d\\kappa\\log\\epsilon^{-1})$ does not show any acceleration. We can   \n135 mention that random reshuffilng, a technique that can be seen as a type of LT, has been combined with   \n136 CC in Sadiev et al. (2022b); Malinovsky & Richt\u00e1rik (2022). Recently, Condat et al. (2022a) managed   \n137 to design a specific compression technique compatible with the LT mechanism of Scaffnew, leading   \n138 to CompressedScaffne\u221aw, the first $\\mathrm{LT}+\\mathrm{CC}$ algorithm exhibiting a doubly-accelerated complexity,   \n139 namely $\\mathcal{O}\\big(\\big(\\sqrt{d}\\sqrt{\\kappa}+\\frac{d\\sqrt{\\kappa}}{\\sqrt{n}}+d\\big)\\log\\epsilon^{-1}\\big)$ , as reported in Table 2. However, CompressedScaffnew uses   \n140 a specific linear compression scheme that requires shared randomness; that is, all clients have to agree   \n141 on a random permutation of the columns of the global compression pattern. No other compressor can   \n142 be used, which notably rules out any type of quantization.

If there is no communication, which is the case with probability $1-p,\\,x_{i}$ and $y$ are updated   \n197 with these predicted estimates, and the dual variables $u_{i}$ and $v$ are unchanged. If communication   \n198 occurs, which is the case with probability $p$ , the clients compress the differences $\\hat{x}_{i}^{t}-\\hat{y}^{t}$ and send   \n199 these compressed vectors to the server, which forms $\\bar{d}^{t}$ equal to one half of their average. Then the   \n200 variables $x_{i}$ are updated using a convex combination of the local predicted estimates $\\hat{x}_{i}^{t}$ and the global   \n201 but noisy estimate $\\hat{y}^{t}+\\bar{d}^{t}$ . $y$ is updated similarly. Finally, the dual variables are updated using the   \n202 compressed differences minus their weighted average, so that the dual feasibility condition remains   \n203 satisfied. The model estimates $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{t}$ , ${\\hat{x}}_{i}^{t}$ , $y^{\\bar{t}}$ , $\\hat{y}^{t}$ all converge to $x^{\\star}$ , so that their differences, as well as   \n204 the compressed differences as a consequence of (2), converge to zero. This is the key property that   \n205 makes the algorithm variance-reduced. We consider the following assumption.   \n206 Assumption 2.1 (class of compressors). In LoCoDL the compressors $\\mathcal{C}_{i}^{t}$ are all in $\\mathbb{U}(\\omega)$ for some   \n207 $\\omega\\ge0$ . Moreover, for every $i\\in[n]$ , $i^{\\prime}\\in[n]$ , $t\\geq0$ , $t^{\\prime}\\geq0$ , $\\mathcal{C}_{i}^{t}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{i^{\\prime}}^{t^{\\prime}}$ are independent if $t\\neq t^{\\prime}$ $\\mathcal{C}_{i}^{t}$   \n208 and $\\mathcal{C}_{i^{\\prime}}^{t}$ at the same iteration $t$ need not be independent). We define $\\omega_{\\mathrm{av}}\\geq0$ such that for every $t\\geq0$ ,   \n209 the collection $(\\mathcal{C}_{i}^{t})_{i=1}^{n}$ satisfies (3).   \n210 Remark 2.2 (partial participation). LoCoDL allows for a form of partial participation if we set $\\rho=1$ .   \n211 Indeed, in that case, at steps 11 and 13 of the algorithm, all local variables $x_{i}$ as well as the common   \n212 variable $y$ are overwritten by the same up-to-date model $\\hat{y}^{t}+\\bar{d}^{t}$ . So, it does not matter that for   \n213 a non-participating client $i$ with $d_{i}^{t}\\,=\\,0$ , the $\\hat{x}_{i}^{t^{\\prime}}$ were not computed for the $t^{\\prime}\\leq t$ since its last   \n214 participation, as they are not used in the process. However, a non-participating client should still   \n215 update its local copy of $y$ at every iteration. This can be done when $\\nabla g$ is much cheaper to compute   \n216 that $\\nabla f_{i}$ , as is the case with $g\\,=\\,\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\,\\|\\,\\cdot\\,\\|^{2}$ . A non-participating client can be completely idle for a   \n217 certain period of time, but when it resumes participating, it should receive the last estimates of $x$ , $y$   \n218 and $v$ from the server as it lost synchronization.

This   \n315 successful combination makes LoCoDL highly communication-efficient, with a doubly accelerated   \n316 complexity with respect to the model dimension $d$ and the condition number of the functions.   \n317 In practice, LoCoDL outperforms other algorithms, including ADIANA, which has an even better   \n318 complexity in theory obtained from Nesterov acceleration and not Local Training. This again   \n319 shows the relevance of the popular mechanism of Local Training, which has been widely adopted in   \n320 Federated Learning. A venue for future work is to implement bidirectional compression (Liu et al.,   \n321 2020; Philippenko & Dieuleveut, 2021). We will also investigate extensions of our method with calls   \n322 to stochastic gradient estimates, with or without variance reduction, as well as partial participation.   \n323 These two features have been proposed for Scaffnew in Malinovsky et al.

Limitations   \n531 Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?   \n532 Answer: [Yes]   \n533 Justification: the limitations are discussed in the conclusion.   \n534 Guidelines:   \n535 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that   \n536 the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.   \n537 \u2022 The authors are encouraged to create a separate \"Limitations\" section in their paper.   \n538 \u2022 The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to   \n539 violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,   \n540 model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors   \n541 should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the   \n542 implications would be.   \n543 \u2022 The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was   \n544 only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often   \n545 depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n546 \u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.   \n547 For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution   \n548 is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be   \n549 used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle   \n550 technical jargon.   \n551 \u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms   \n552 and how they scale with dataset size.   \n553 \u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to   \n554 address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n555 \u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by   \n556 reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover   \n557 limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best   \n558 judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor  \n559 tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers   \n560 will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.   \n561 3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs   \n562 Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and   \n563 a complete (and correct) proof?   \n565 Justification: the proofs are in the appendix.   \n566 Guidelines:   \n67 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.   \n68 \u2022 All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross  \n69 referenced.   \n70 \u2022 All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.   \n71 \u2022 The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if   \n72 they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short   \n73 proof sketch to provide intuition.   \n74 \u2022 Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented   \n75 by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.   \n76 \u2022 Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

Open access to data and code ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "617 Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc  \n618 tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental   \n619 material?   \n620 Answer: [Yes]   \n621 Justification: The data used in the experiments are publicly available. The code is provided.   \n622 Guidelines:   \n623 \u2022 The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.   \n624 \u2022 Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/   \n625 public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.   \n626 \u2022 While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be   \n627 possible, so \u201cNo\u201d is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not   \n628 including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source   \n629 benchmark).   \n630 \u2022 The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to   \n631 reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:   \n632 //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.   \n633 \u2022 The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how   \n634 to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.   \n635 \u2022 The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new   \n636 proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they   \n637 should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.   \n638 \u2022 At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized   \n639 versions (if applicable).   \n640 \u2022 Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the   \n641 paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.   \n642 6. Experimental Setting/Details   \n643 Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper  \n644 parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the   \n645 results?   \n646 Answer: [Yes]   \n647 Justification: We provide these details.   \n648 Guidelines:   \n649 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n650 \u2022 The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail   \n651 that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.   \n652 \u2022 The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental   \n653 material.   \n654 7. Experiment Statistical Significance   \n655 Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate   \n656 information about the statistical significance of the experiments?   \n657 Answer: [No]   \n658 Justification: the variability with respect to different random realizations plays a minor role   \n659 in the performance.   \n660 Guidelines:   \n661 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n662 \u2022 The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi  \n663 dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support   \n664 the main claims of the paper.   \n665 \u2022 The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for   \n666 example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall   \n667 run with given experimental conditions).   \n668 \u2022 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,   \n669 call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)   \n670 \u2022 The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).   \n671 \u2022 It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error   \n672 of the mean.   \n673 \u2022 It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should   \n674 preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a $96\\%$ CI, if the hypothesis   \n675 of Normality of errors is not verified.   \n676 \u2022 For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or   \n677 figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative   \n678 error rates).   \n679 \u2022 If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how   \n680 they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.   \n681 8. Experiments Compute Resources   \n682 Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com  \n683 puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce   \n684 the experiments?   \n685 Answer: [Yes]   \n686 Justification: we do not focus on the computation time but on the number of communicated   \n687 bits, which is independent from the hardware. So the experiments can be reproduced on any   \n688 machine.   \n689 Guidelines:   \n690 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n691 \u2022 The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,   \n692 or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.   \n693 \u2022 The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual   \n694 experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.   \n695 \u2022 The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute   \n696 than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that   \n697 didn\u2019t make it into the paper).   \n698 9. Code Of Ethics   \n699 Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the   \n700 NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?   \n701 Answer: [Yes]   \n702 Justification:   \n703 Guidelines:   \n704 \u2022 The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.   \n705 \u2022 If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a   \n706 deviation from the Code of Ethics.   \n707 \u2022 The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid  \n708 eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).   \n709 10. Broader Impacts   \n710 Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative   \n711 societal impacts of the work performed?   \n712 Answer: [NA]   \n713 Justification: This is a theoretical work whose goal is to advance the foundations of opti  \n714 mization and machine learning. The positive impact of developing more efficient algorithms   \n715 is clear and does not need to be discussed. We do not see any particular negative impact.   \n716 Guidelines:   \n717 \u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n718 \u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal   \n719 impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.   \n720 \u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses   \n721 (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations   \n722 (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific   \n723 groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.   \n724 \u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied   \n725 to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to   \n726 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n727 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n728 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n729 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n730 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n731 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n732 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n733 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n734 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n735 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n736 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n737 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n738 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n739 11. Safeguards   \n740 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible   \n741 release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,   \n742 image generators, or scraped datasets)?   \n743 Answer: [NA]   \n744 Justification:   \n745 Guidelines:   \n746 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.   \n747 \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with   \n748 necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring   \n749 that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing   \n750 safety filters.   \n751 \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors   \n752 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n753 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n754 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n755 faith effort.   \n756 12. Licenses for existing assets   \n757 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in   \n758 the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and   \n759 properly respected?   \n760 Answer: [Yes]   \n761 Justification: we use the LibSVM and mention the 3-clause BSD license.   \n762 Guidelines:   \n763 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.   \n764 \u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.   \n765 \u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a   \n766 URL.   \n767 \u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.   \n768 \u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of   \n769 service of that source should be provided.
