Representations like target states are limited to simple tasks, while natural language is ambiguous.  This paper tackles these issues by proposing **compositional deterministic finite automata (cDFAs)** as a robust and expressive goal representation.  However, directly conditioning on cDFAs is challenging due to their complexity and the sparse reward signal in RL tasks.  This makes learning efficient policies extremely difficult.\nTo overcome these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach: pre-training graph neural network embeddings on a simpler class of DFAs derived from reach-avoid tasks. This pre-training method enables **zero-shot generalization** to various cDFA task classes.  The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments, showing faster policy specialization and improved performance compared to existing hierarchical methods. Their findings suggest that cDFAs combined with their pre-training method offer a promising new direction for building more adaptable and powerful goal-conditioned AI agents capable of handling complex real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6KDZHgrDhG/podcast.wav"}
