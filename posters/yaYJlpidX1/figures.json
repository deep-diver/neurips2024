It shows a self-referential weight matrix (Wo) which is sequentially modified by observing examples from different tasks (Task A and Task B). The weights (Wa and WA,B) learned after observing examples from each task are used to make predictions.  The key concept shown is the ability of the model to perform backward transfer (predicting Task A after learning Task B) and forward transfer (predicting Task B after learning Task A).", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "yaYJlpidX1/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: ACL/No-case meta-training curves displaying 6 individual meta-training loss terms, when the last term of the ACL objective (the backward tranfer loss; \u201cTask A ACL bwd\u201d and \u201cTask B ACL bwd", "description": "This figure shows two plots of meta-training curves.  Each plot displays six curves representing the loss values for different scenarios during the meta-training process. The scenarios involve learning two tasks simultaneously or sequentially, while enabling or disabling the backward transfer term of the ACL objective. These curves visually illustrate the impact of the backward transfer term on preventing catastrophic forgetting. The plots provide insights into the dynamics of learning and forgetting in continual learning settings.", "section": "4.2 Analysis: Emergence of In-Context Catastrophic Forgetting"}]
