Existing approximation methods either compromise quality or offer limited efficiency gains. This is a major bottleneck for researchers needing to use MBR decoding on larger datasets.\nThis research introduces a novel approach, Probabilistic Minimum Bayes Risk (PMBR), leveraging low-rank matrix completion algorithms to approximate MBR decoding. PMBR significantly reduces computational costs by 1/16, matching the translation quality of full MBR decoding, demonstrated empirically on machine translation tasks using COMET and MetricX metrics.
