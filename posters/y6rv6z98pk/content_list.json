Existing defenses in MLaaS are limited by their reliance on training samples or white-box model analysis, highlighting the need for a black-box backdoor purification method. In our paper, we attempt to use diffusion models for purification by introducing noise in a forward diffusion process to destroy backdoors and recover clean samples through a reverse generative process. However, since a higher noise also destroys the semantics of the original samples, it still results in a low restoration performance. To investigate the effectiveness of noise in eliminating different types of backdoors, we conducted a preliminary study, which demonstrates that backdoors with low visibility can be easily destroyed by lightweight noise and those with high visibility need to be destroyed by high noise but can be easily detected. Based on the study, we propose SampDetox, which strategically combines lightweight and high noise. SampDetox applies weak noise to eliminate low-visibility backdoors and compares the structural similarity between the recovered and original samples to localize high-visibility backdoors. Intensive noise is then applied to these localized areas, destroying the high-visibility backdoors while preserving global semantic information. As a result, detoxified samples can be used for inference even by poisoned models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SampDetox in defending against various state-of-the-art backdoor attacks.

However, since users cannot guarantee the trustworthiness of service providers, they face serious threats of backdoor attacks [10, 11, 12]. Typically, adversaries inject backdoors into deep models on numerous occasions, especially when the training samples are collected from unreliable sources, or the pre-trained deep models are obtained from untrusted third parties. During the inference phase, when fed clean samples, the backdoored models behave normally with satisfactory classification performance. However, when processing poisoned samples containing trigger patterns, the backdoored models will be fooled into predicting attack target categories with high confidence.

Since in MLaaS-based applications users are not allowed to access the original training data and parameters of models, these backdoor defense methods are strongly limited. In contrast, black-box backdoor defense methods do not have such requirements. So far, black-box backdoor defense methods can be classified into three categories, i.e., model detection-based [16], sample detection-based [7, 17], and sample purification-based [18, 19] defense methods. The basic idea of the first two categories is to simply discard training samples or deep models once they are identified as poisoned. In this case, the usability and performance of classification tasks are greatly affected. As an alternative, sample purification-based approaches strive to destroy backdoor trigger patterns in samples. However, existing sample purification-based approaches are based on the strong assumption that trigger patterns are small and only located in the corners of samples, which is not always true in practice. As a result, such methods can only be used to defend against specific types of backdoor attacks. Worse still, most of the above defense methods need to repetitively feed samples to deep models and get their continuous feedback, resulting in extra non-negligible computation overhead. Therefore, how to effectively mitigate the impacts of all possible backdoor attacks without deteriorating the overall inference performance is becoming a great challenge in black-box defense.

To preserve the semantics of the original sample while removing the backdoor, the diffusion model [20, 21] serves as an effective solution to restore the sample. However, different backdoors exhibit varying levels of robustness to noise, which requires different noise amplitudes for effective disruption. In addition, the amplitude and range of noise will affect the quality of samples restored by the diffusion model. We performed a preliminary study on various backdoor attacks to explore the robustness of different types of backdoors. We found that: i) invisible triggers with low robustness (to random noise) can be easily destroyed, and ii) backdoor triggers with high robustness are easily detectable due to their high visibility.

To counteract the effects of such added noises, we then restore the samples by denoising them using diffusion models. Note that for a poisoned sample, its poisoned regions with high visibility, compared with clean regions, will be different from their counterparts in the restored version (see the proof in Theorem 4.2), making them identified easily. Based on our second observation, the second stage can quickly locate such robust triggers and destroy them using our dedicatedly designed noises. Similar to the first stage, the second stage then leverages diffusion models to restore the samples.

Existing backdoor attacks can be mainly classified into two categories, i.e., visible attacks and invisible attacks, based on the visibility of trigger patterns during the inference phase. Specifically, visible attacks do not consider the concealment of trigger patterns. For example, BadNets [22] uses visible trigger patterns in the form of fixed pixels patched in the corner of the images. Although there exist various visible attacks (e.g., training set corruption without label poisoning [23], label-consistent backdoor attacks [24], attacking pre-trained models [25], and specificsample triggers [26]), few of them can be applied in real scenarios, since the triggers on samples are conspicuous and can be easily detected by manual inspection. To make attacks stealthier, more and more backdoor attacks (e.g., Blended [27], WaNet [28], and ISSBA [29]) adopt invisible triggers. For example, BPP [30] uses image quantization and dithering as imperceptible backdoor triggers to avoid manual inspection.

According to the capabilities of defenders in manipulating the training and inference processes on deep models, backdoor defense methods can be classified into two categories, i.e., white-box and black-box defenses. Typically, white-box methods defend against backdoor attacks by changing training processes [31, 32], extract gradients [33], and fine-tuning and -pruning of poisoned models [34, 35]. However, these methods require access to model parameters, which strongly restricts their usage (e.g., MLaaS applications) in practice. For black-box defenses, such as model detection-based [16], sample detection-based [7, 17], and sample purification-based [18, 19] approaches, defenders only can rely on the predictions of input samples. For example, as a model detection-based approach, CBD [36] can effectively identify whether models are poisoned by analyzing their predictions. However, simply discarding the suspicious model/sample does not apply to real-world classification tasks. Rather than ignoring poisoned samples, sample purification-based methods aim to destroy the triggers on samples. For example, Sancdif i[37] measures saliency maps and purifies the specific areas of samples. BDMAE [19] reconstructs the local area of the samples using its AutoEncoder. ZIP [18] transforms and reconstructs samples independently of models through zero-shot image purification. However, all these purification-based methods can handle only small triggers within specific regions.

To the best of our knowledge, SampDetox is the first attempt to consider the correlation between the visibility of backdoor triggers and the robustness of poisoned samples.

To defend against backdoor attacks, the findings in [38] show that transforming or perturbing samples will achieve defensive effects against locally patched triggers. However, according to the observations in [18, 19], these operations are unsuitable for defending against other types of triggers. This is mainly because locally patched triggers are unremarkable and susceptible to disturbance, while other triggers are robust (i.e., not sensitive) to such backdoor defenses.

The implementation of SampDetox consists of two stages. The first stage strives to destroy triggers globally on a given sample in a coarse manner, while the second stage tries to identify fine triggers and remove them locally. To examine the impacts of these two stages, we consider a variant (i.e., \u201cStage 1\u201d) of our approach, which does not take stage 2 of SampDetox into account. Meanwhile, to evaluate the impact of the denoising operations, we considered another variant of SampDetox (i.e., \u201cNoise\\*\u201d), where denoising is not applied to restore the samples in both stages.

Although \u201cNoise\\*\u201d can achieve comparable ASR results to SampDetox, SampDetox outperforms \u201cNoise\\*\u201d in both CA and PA significantly. It means that simply adding noises to samples can effectively destroy the backdoor triggers of the samples. However, the noises themselves will also result in a sharp decline in the inference accuracy of clean and poisoned samples. If we merely adopt the first stage of SampDetox due to the denoising operation by diffusion models, both CA and PA can be improved. However, since the first stage only coarsely applies the perturbation on samples, most subtle backdoor triggers still survive. As an example in SIG attack, \u201cStage 1\u201d can only achieve a PA of $9.48\\%$ but with an ASR of $92.33\\%$ . By combining both Stages 1 and 2, SampDetox can effectively identify such undetectable triggers and destroy them without affecting the inference of original samples, leading to a better PA and ASR.
