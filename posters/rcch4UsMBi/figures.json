The inputs of FLAN, Self-Instrct and Eovlve-Instruct are either seed examples or existing datasets, which limits the scope of domains of instructions that these methods can generate. GLAN takes the taxonomy of human knowledge & capabilities as input to ensure the broad coverage of generated instructions in various domains. This taxonomy is then broken down into smaller pieces and recombined to generate diverse instruction data.", "description": "The figure compares GLAN with three other instruction tuning methods: FLAN, Self-Instruct, and Evolve-Instruct.  It highlights that unlike the other methods which rely on seed examples or existing datasets (limiting their scope), GLAN uses a taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities. This allows GLAN to generate a broader range of instructions across various domains. The figure illustrates how GLAN breaks down this taxonomy into smaller components and recombines them to create diverse instruction data.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "rcch4UsMBi/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparing GLAN with FLAN, Self-Instruct and Evolve-Instruct.
