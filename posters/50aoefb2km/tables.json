The comparison focuses on several key aspects: the success rate of localized editing, the preservation of image quality (measured by LPIPS and SSIM), the ability to transfer the editing style to new images, computational efficiency (learning time and transfer edit time), and the need for training data or supervision. It highlights that LOCO Edit is superior in terms of localized editing success and transferability while being significantly more efficient and training-free.  The table also emphasizes LOCO Edit's unique properties: being a one-step method, requiring no additional supervision, and having a strong theoretical foundation.", "section": "5.2 Comprehensive Comparison with Other Image Editing Methods"}, {"figure_path": "50aOEfb2km/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparisons with existing methods.

These metrics evaluate the methods' ability to perform precise local edits, transfer their edits to new images, the time required for training and editing, whether or not the methods require supervision (training), and whether they have a sound theoretical basis.  LOCO Edit shows superior performance in localized editing, transferability, and efficiency, along with the advantages of being a one-step method requiring no supervision and having a strong theoretical foundation.", "section": "5.2 Comprehensive Comparison with Other Image Editing Methods"}]
