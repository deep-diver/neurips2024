Despite its role in exploring and learning, the function and neural basis of this variability is still not well understood. Given the coupling between neural activity and behavior, we ask what type of neural variability does not compromise behavioral performance. While previous studies typically curtail variability to allow for high task performance in neural networks, our approach takes the reversed perspective. We investigate how to generate maximal neural variability while at the same time having high network performance. To do so, we extend to neural activity the maximum occupancy principle (MOP) developed for behavior, and refer to this new neural principle as NeuroMOP. NeuroMOP posits that the goal of the nervous system is to maximize future action-state entropy, a reward-free, intrinsic motivation that entails creating all possible activity patterns while avoiding terminal or dangerous ones. We show that this goal can be achieved through a neural network controller that injects currents (actions) into a recurrent neural network of fixed random weights to maximize future cumulative action-state entropy. High activity variability can be induced while adhering to an energy constraint or while avoiding terminal states defined by specific neurons\u2019 activities, also in a context-dependent manner. The network solves these tasks by flexibly switching between stochastic and deterministic modes as needed and projecting noise onto a null space. Based on future maximum entropy production, NeuroMOP contributes to a novel theory of neural variability that reconciles stochastic and deterministic behaviors within a single framework.

Despite that, natural behaviors, including repetitive movements from expert athletes [1, 2, 3, 4], exhibit variability [5, 6, 7]. The mechanisms governing the emergence of this variability from the central and peripheral nervous systems remain unclear. Variability of neural activity in motor cortex [8, 9, 10] and subcortical structures [11, 12] controlling muscle movements, as well as state changes of the effectors due to, e.g., fatigue [13, 14], might contribute to the observed behavioral variability. However, as behavioral variability is also observed at longer time scales during perception [15, 16], decision making [17, 6, 5, 18] and planning [19], neural fuctuations in most parts of the brain [20, 21, 22] might be involved in the generation of variable behavioral repertoires as a whole.

These proposed mechanisms are predominantly designed to describe variability during spontaneous activity - in the absence of sensory stimuli - [22, 20] or in response to simple stimuli [29, 30], most frequently outside a complex task. In other theoretical studies where the goal is to maximize network performance in a task, variability is typically suppressed after learning [31, 32, 33]. If anything, the initial noise or activity variability is used as means to regularize and promote exploration during learning [34, 35], but they are considered to be unnecessary thereafter. This approach is also the one taken in state-of-art reinforcement learning, where variability is added during learning, but during task execution policies are forced to be deterministic [36, 37]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Given these two coexisting sides of natural behavior - namely, high task performance in spite of large variability - we ask whether it is possible to have neural networks generating maximal variability while at the same time being able to fexibly switch to deterministic behavioral modes when needed. We surmise that generating neural variability is a fundamental goal of the nervous system, as it enables the exploration of its entire dynamical range. This idea parallels the one that neural activity should be variable to generate the vast behavioral repertoires [38, 8, 39, 40, 41] as the ones empirically observed [5, 18, 42, 11]. The sought neural variability needs to be highly structured in order to avoid non-adaptive behaviors. One relevant example comes from reaching tasks, where neural activity is indeed found to be confined in null spaces as to avoid undesired movements [43]. To address the above question, we build on the maximum occupancy principle (MOP) developed for behavior [44, 45], which posits that agents ought to occupy action-state space by generating all sorts of action-state paths compatible with the dynamical and environmental constraints. Applied to neural activity, we introduce NeuroMOP, which puts forward the hypothesis that the brain should generate maximum entropy in the neural activity paths. Importantly, this entails avoiding the terminal states where further entropy cannot be generated. This principle aligns with a broad body of Reinforcement Learning (RL) literature on reward-free algorithms based on purely-entropic objectives [37, 46, 47]. By optimizing the cumulative sum of future action-state entropy, NeuroMOP emphasizes seeking future variability to the extent that does not compromise performance. By properly defining terminal states as absorbing states where no more entropy can be generated, this principle seeks variability while also generating behaviors that guarantee future \u2018survival'.

The input current generator (the agent) is designed to maximize the entropy - hence, the variability - of the series of currents (a function of the actions) it injects in the RNN (the environment). As expected, variable currents lead to variable neural activities, but this variability becomes structured in order to avoid dangerous (terminal) states. To bridge neural variability with functionality, we test our architecture in a series of different problems. First, we show that the NeuroMOP network learns to satisfy energy constraints, while generating large neural variability. Second, a subset of RNN neuron activities can be confined within complex regions while remaining free within the region, thereby \\*drawing? different symbols, also in a context dependent manner. Crucially, the NeuroMOP network not only learns to effectively solve tasks, but it maintains a high dimensionality of action signals whenever possible, allowing the visitation of a wide range of activity patterns. By fexibly reducing its dimensionality when close to terminal states, we show that low dimensionality is an emergent property under constrained tasks where higher dimensionality is the defaultmode.

In other words, the network occupies all the space allowed by the terminal states after learning. The NeuroMOP network can confine the activities of the two readout neurons even within very small regions of the activity space (Fig. 3b, magenta lines).

We have explored this theory by introducing a mechanism for maximizing and controlling variability in a highly-dimensional RNN in the chaotic regime. Contrary to the common idea that excessive variability may impede performance, our model showcases that injecting maximal controlled variability into RNNs actually permits to solve different \u2018tasks', indirectly defined by the structure of terminal states. By allowing for a diverse array of actions according to the state, this variability enables the network to explore a wider solution space, potentially leading to more effective adaptations [50, 51, 52]. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "We tested our network in a series of scenarios. First, we introduced an energy threshold on the network activity. Energy constraints may have been likely selected by evolution, as brain activity is costly both during information processing and at rest [53, 48]. By observing that the network always keeps energy consumption close to the threshold without exceeding it, our results align with the idea that sustained, controlled energy consumption could actually be beneficial [54]. In a second series of problems, we showed that the NeuroMOP network can avoid terminal states in the readout space while increasing the variability in the subspaces where no boundaries are set. Therefore, long lifetime is achieved by fexibly switching between deterministic and stochastic dynamical regimes when needed. Additionally, we show that our algorithm is capable of solving problems often tackled through extrinsic rewards, such as balancing a cartpole (Appendix G), or scenarios where more deterministic behavioral modes are required, like traversing a narrow corridor in neural space (Appendix H). In addition, we show that introducing extrinsic rewards in the MOP framework largely reduces the variability of the network behavior (Appendix I). ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "When comparing MOP with other systems that also generate variability, like a reward-maximizing (R) network with epsilon-greedy noise, we find that R networks can only avoid terminal states after extensive training and only by quenching the source of randomness. We remark that MOP agents face as well the drawback of stochasticity as their policy follows a Boltzmann distribution (Eq. 4), and thus a non-zero probability is assigned to all actions regardless of the state. Despite that, MOP agents overcome this tendency by adapting their randomness via the computation of the value function, which trades-off immediate with future variability. This is in contrast with R agents, where the stochasticity parameter $\\epsilon$ is state independent. These results suggest that state adaptation of stochasticity is a relevant property we might expect in intelligent systems. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "By keeping the weights of the RNN fixed, we depart from the common practice of training networks. Weights training usually leads to activities exploiting the saturation state of the neurons [35, 33]. We conjecture this dynamics to be unrealistic, as biological neurons largely display activities that are well below their maximum values [55, 56, 49]. Analogously, saturation is undesirable even in artificial neural networks due to the vanishing curvature of the loss landscape. By favoring states and actions with low probability, the NeuroMOP network leads to the more uniform occupation as possible, avoiding saturation and encouraging neurons to stay in a \u201chealthy\u2019 regime, i.e., a regime suitable for computation [57]. As well, we have demonstrated that NeuroMOP can control high-dimensional chaotic RNNs. Future research should investigate how MOP-driven input currents affect the RNN's regime. We anticipate that MOP currents will stabilize neural trajectories, consistent with operating at the edge of chaos [58]. Characterizing chaoticity as a function of the input properties (e.g., magnitude) [59] is a promising direction.

The idea of specialized circuits serving the role of stochastic input generator is not novel. In songbirds, for instance, the LMAN brain region, part of the neural circuit controlling songs? production, has been largely postulated to fulfill the function of injecting variability into the downstream motor pathways [60, 61]. Allegedly, increased variability in the motor neural activity favors behavioral exploration in the songs\u2019 production. Remarkably, it has also been shown that, during courtship, adult birds significantly reduce their vocal variability compared to their solitary singing [60, 62].

", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Finally, NeuroMOP offers several testable predictions regarding the nature of neural variability we should expect in the brain. Firstly, it predicts that neural variability will persist even after extensive training, which aligns with studies reporting large spiking variability even in well-trained non-human primates [21, 29]. Despite this persistence, our model also suggests that neural variability may decrease when terminal states are sufficiently close, as the network is expected to transition into a more deterministic mode to avoid those states [30, 63]. Finally, our model predicts that reward signaling systems in the brain will also signal intrinsic motivation rewards. This is partially supported by recent studies demonstrating that spontaneous movements elicit dopamine release [11]. Further, we postulate that the visitation of all activity states may increase flexibility and help generalization. Consistent with that, certain activity states are observed to be replayed in the absence of any stimulation in the brain, and several mechanisms in RNNs have been proposed for this phenomenon [64, 65]. NeuroMOP predicts the deterministic reactivation of activity patterns and memories that are relevant for generating higher future behavioral entropy, but the more stochastic reactivation of less relevant memories.

Our model could be extended to include a neural network to also approximate the policy $\\pi$ using actor critic approaches [66]. Therefore, we do not delve in the process of learning the policy itself. Exploring the policy learning process represents a significant direction for future work. Despite relying on the exact policy, the input current selection has still a high computational cost. In order to partially mitigate this, we introduced the random matrix $K$ , which transforms low $M$ -dimensional binary actions into high $N$ -dimensional currents. Via this matrix, we were able to reduce complexity from $\\sim\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{N}\\right)$ to $\\bar{\\sim}\\,\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{M}\\right)$ , thereby significantly speeding up the computation, without compromising the convergence of the algorithm. The extension of NeuroMOP to more realistic spiking and Poisson-like variability is another major possible direction.

Our work highlights a significant limitation in classical neuroscience studies, where limited behavioral repertoires are promoted by the task design and experimental trials terminate upon reaching the goal. In ecological settings, in contrast, agents continuously generate interim goals and elicit new behaviors. NeuroMOP offers a powerful model of neural activity underlying natural behavior.

To test the effect of introducing the state entropy term, we define for each neuron $i$ the activity \u2018jumps\u2019 $\\Delta x_{i}$ as the difference in activity between two consecutive time points, i.e., $\\Delta x_{i}(t)=x_{i}(t+1)-x_{i}(t)\\;\\forall i=1,\\ldots,N.$ . Therefore, we introduce the standard deviation of these series averaged across neurons, i.e., $\\langle\\sigma_{\\Delta x}\\rangle$ , and find that it increases with the contribution of the (approximated) state entropy (Fig. 6f). Conversely, the average standard deviation remains roughly constant (Fig. 6g). To drive neurons towards the highly sensitive region of the transfer function, the NeuroMOP network reduces its effective action dimensionality even when far from the threshold, deviating from the maximum available dimensionality when $\\beta=1.5$ (Fig. 6h).
