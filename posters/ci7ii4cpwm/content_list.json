A middle ground between observational and experimental approaches is to fuse data from both types of studies [Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016, Athey et al., 2020].

Blood pressure and cardiovascular health are closely linked. The antihypertensive therapy $v_{1}$ directly influences the need for renal function modulators $v_{3}$ , and $v_{3}$ in turn directly affects blood pressure w. Additionally, anti-diabetic medications $v_{2}$ reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease $y$ by controlling blood sugar levels, while blood pressure w directly impacts $y$ . Unmeasured factors confound these relationships: shared health conditions can influence the prescription of both $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ ; lifestyle factors affect both $v_{1}$ and $w$ ; and common conditions like metabolic syndrome can impact both $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ .

Instead, we can intervene on $v_{1}$ , which is a feasible and safer approach due to the broader range of treatment options and more manageable risks associated with adjusting antihypertensive therapy.

In this context, a \u201ccore\u201d refers to an unsatisfiable subset of clauses within the CNF formula that cannot be satisfied simultaneously under any assignment. These algorithms relax the unsatisfiable soft clauses in the core by adding relaxation variables and enforce cardinality constraints on these variables. By strategically increasing the bounds on these cardinality constraints or modifying the weights of soft clauses based on the cores identified, the algorithms efficiently reduce the search space and converge on the maximum weighted set of satisfiable clauses, thereby solving the WPMAX-SAT problem optimally.

For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
