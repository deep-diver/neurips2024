Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps. Prior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at the cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional parameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we propose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular structural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the embedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers several beneftis. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize different subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural dependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input and output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of structural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2.

Secondly, our method freely selects the width for each layer without considering architecture dependence. With dramatically increased flexibility, our method outperforms other structural pruning and semi-structural pruning methods given similar pruning ratios.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
