Moreover, note that MPJPE and consistency metrics are not positively correlated for single-hypothesis methods. As predicted in Section 4.1, our empirical results show that MPJPE improvements achieved by MixSTE come at the cost of poorer consistency compared to previous models. In contrast, the only singlehypothesis constrained model, Anatomy3D [4], achieves good consistency at the expense of inferior MPJPE. Those results empirically validate the theoretical predictions of Sections 4.1 and B, further confirming what we have shown, intuitively, in the simplified 1D-to-2D setting (Section 4.2).

Table 2 shows that they require up to two orders of magnitude more hypotheses than ManiPose to reach competitive performance (see, e.g., the performance of GFPose). This property is expected. Indeed, optimization based on Winner-Takes-All theoretically leads to an optimal coverage of the modes of the conditional distribution with a fixed number of samples [23], in contrast to generative-based approaches. This is reflected in the oracle metric, which approximates the so-called quantization (or Distortion) error, as defined in (27), when the number of data points is large.
