Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) offer an automatic approach, but existing NeRF methods often struggle to disentangle lighting from material properties, hindering efficient and realistic scene reconstruction.  High-frequency illumination is also challenging to represent accurately in these methods.\nSplitNeRF addresses these limitations by incorporating the split sum approximation, commonly used in real-time image-based lighting, into NeRF pipelines. This approximation splits the rendering equation into two parts: one for pre-integrated illumination and one for material properties.  The method models scene lighting with a single scene-specific MLP, accurately representing pre-integrated lighting through a novel regularizer based on efficient Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, a novel method supervises self-occlusion predictions. Experiments show that SplitNeRF achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality and efficiently estimates scene geometry, material properties, and lighting with under an hour of training on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.
