While these models acquire strong capabilities, they may not follow the user\u2019s intent to output the desired results in certain aspects, e.g., visual aesthetic, preferred style, and responsibility. In this paper, we target the realm of visual aesthetics and aim to align vision models with human aesthetic standards in a retrieval system. Advanced retrieval systems usually adopt a cascade of aesthetic models as re-rankers or fliters, which are limited to low-level features like saturation and perform poorly when stylistic, cultural or knowledge contexts are involved. We find that utilizing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) to rephrase the search query and extend the aesthetic expectations can make up for this shortcoming. Based on the above findings, we propose a preference-based reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes the vision models to distill the knowledge from both LLMs reasoning and the aesthetic models to better align the vision models with human aesthetics. Meanwhile, with rare benchmarks designed for evaluating retrieval systems, we leverage large multi-modality model (LMM) to evaluate the aesthetic performance with their strong abilities. As aesthetic assessment is one of the most subjective tasks, to validate the robustness of LMM, we further propose a novel dataset named HPIR to benchmark the alignment with human aesthetics. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the aesthetic behaviors of the vision models, under several metrics.

They are trained on very large image-text pair datasets, e.g. LAION [43] and DataComp [8], rather than the traditional ImageNet [6]. These datasets contain noisy labels, and exhibit diverse data quality. As a result, though models trained on such datasets demonstrate strong capabilities on semantic matching in the wild, they may prefer samples that violate the intents from users, as shown in Fig. 1. For example, using a vision-language model as an one stage retrieval system, with a huge amount of images in the database, the model may pick the images that exactly match the search query but with unappealing visual appearance. Moreover, it may provides harmful results that disrupt the principle of responsible AI (RAI). Existing retrieval benchmarks [25, 63] also lack evaluation for aesthetics and RAI.

Existing aesthetic models do well to differentiate high and low quality images when they have a great quality gap, but when the gap is small, LMMs surpass all of them significantly via reasoning (Table 13 and 10 in Appendix). This indicates that to make further development of aesthetic understanding, reasoning is essential.

The image encoders of CLIP and DataComp are ViT-L/14 models, trained on a private 400M dataset and on the DataComp-1B dataset, respectively. We report their performance on classic retrieval benchmarks (ImageNet1K [6] zero-shot classification, MSCOCO [25] T2I retrieval Recall $@1$ , and Flickr30K [63] T2I retrieval Recall $@1$ ) and on the proposed HPIR in Table 1. It is not surprising that our model performs worse to DataComp on MSCOCO and Flickr30K, since our training budget is much smaller than DataComp. We can further observe that our alignment fine-tuning does not significantly impact the retrieval capability, but it greatly enhances the aesthetic scores of the retrieval results, surpassing both original CLIP and DataComp. While fine-tuning on the CLIP and DataComp, a similar increase is observed in aesthetic ability, demonstrating the generalization of our method.

Subsequent works [61, 65, 44] have expanded image-text contrastive to a wider scope. BeiT3 [52], CoCa [64] and BLIP [20] further explore other pretraining methods. More recently, several large multi-modal models have emerged [26, 53, 12].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
