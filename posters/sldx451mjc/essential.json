Existing techniques, predominantly built on EG3D, often prioritize near-frontal views, limiting their ability to synthesize comprehensive 3D scenes. This paper addresses these limitations. \nThis research introduces a novel dual encoder system built upon PanoHead, which excels at synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspective.  The system includes a first encoder focusing on high-fidelity reconstruction of the visible input image and a second encoder specializing in generating realistic representations of occluded regions. A key innovation is the use of a novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator, trained to enhance the realism of generated triplane structures, and a stitching framework that seamlessly integrates outputs from both encoders.  Experiments show that this dual-encoder approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both fidelity and realism, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "affiliation": "Bilkent University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "SlDx451MjC/podcast.wav"}
