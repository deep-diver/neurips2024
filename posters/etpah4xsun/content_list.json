Among existing SSL methods, there are generally two ways to utilize augmentations, either through invariant learning or equivariant learning. In invariant learning, two random augmentations of the example are drawn and their representations are pulled together during feature learning to be invariant to the data augmentations as shown in Figure 2(a). Instead, in equivariant learning, the features are learned to be sensitive to data augmentations.\\* Formally, for a representation $Z$ , one can use $H(A|Z)$ as a measure of the degree of feature invariance or equivariance: if $H(A|Z)$ is relatively small, the representation $Z$ is nearly equivariant to the augmentation $A$ ; otherwise, if $\\dot{H}(A|Z)$ is very large (close to $H(A)$ ), $Z$ is invariant to $A$ . Recent SSL methods [22, 16, 35, 13, 12] have shown that enforcing equivariance can often lead to better representations compared to enforcing invariance, for two key reasons: 1) Invariance restricts the expressive power of the features learned as it removes information about features or transformations that may be relevant in fine-grained tasks [32, 43]; 2) contrastive learning benefits from partial invariance through implicit equivariance of the projection head [29].

Therefore, the learned representations, either invariant or equivariant to these augmentations, are tailored to the specific symmetry imposed during pretraining. However, in real world scenarios, there is no single symmetry that is universally applicable across all tasks. For example, object recognition (e.g., a chair) often requires invariance to image color, while certain tasks, e.g., flower recognition, need sensitivity to color information instead. Either to include or not to include color information as part of the augmentations can lead to suboptimal performance in certain tasks, causing a fundamental dilemma in existing SSL.

This next state prediction task captures the inherent mechanisms of the system and facilitates decision making. Traditionally applied in RL, the benefits of world modeling in vision have been largely unexplored. Recently, Image World Models (IWM) [15] established a parallel between world models and the image-based SSL by considering data transformations as actions, the representation of input data as world state at time $t$ and that of the transformed input as next world state. However, IWMs have two key drawbacks: 1) similar to previous SSL approaches, they rely on a predefined set of data augmentations, such as color, which are not tailored to specific downstream tasks and influence the learned features; 2) they lack the memory module of world models that tracks previous experience in terms of past states, actions and corresponding next states and provides context to fully define the current state.

We begin by baking symmetries in the context \u2014 $(x,a,y)$ using positive pairs $x$ and $y$ transformed by a series of different augmentations. The key intuition behind our approach is selective inclusion of augmentation parameters for specific transformation groups: excluding parameters enforces invariance, while including them enforces equivariance.

For example, each data augmentation, e.g., rotation, translation, as well as their compositions, can serve as different transformation groups. Each group $\\mathcal{G}_{c}$ can be represented through the joint distribution $P(x,a,y|\\mathcal{G}_{c})$ , where $x$ is the input sample (sampled from an unlabeled dataset), $a$ represents the parameters of the transformation drawn from $\\mathcal{G}_{c}$ and applied to $x$ , and $y$ is the transformed input. In principle, $x$ can be transformed by a composition of augmentations drawn from multiple transformation groups. For instance, in self-supervised learning, it is common to enrich the learning process by transforming an input image through rotations, crops, and blurring. In such a case, $a$ represents a subset of the transformation parameters belonging to the group $\\mathcal{G}_{c}$ , applied to $x$ to produce $y$ .

However, this shift toward generalization has been conspicuously absent in the vision domain. This is largely because self-supervised approaches for vision still heavily rely on inductive priors strongly introduced by enforcing either invariance or equivariance to data augmentations. This renders representations brittle in downstream tasks that do not conform to these priors and necessitates retraining the representation separately for each task. This work forgoes any notion of pre-defined symmetries and instead trains a model to infer the task-relevant symmetries directly from the context through what we term Contextual Self-Supervised Learning (CONTEXTSSL). The ability of our model to learn selective equivariances and invariances based on mere context opens up new avenues for effectively handling a broader range of tasks, particularly in dynamic environments where the relevance of specific features may change over time. However, we limit our scope of symmetries to hand-crafted transformations in the data and do not explore naturally occurring symmetries. Nonetheless, CONTEXTSSL lays the groundwork for models that can potentially discern and adapt to the underlying patterns of tasks, recognize shortcuts, and more effectively generalize across unseen scenarios. Through this work, we hope to contribute to a broader understanding of how machines can learn more like humans \u2014 contextually, adaptively, and with an eye toward the infinite variability of the real world.

Existing SSL methods generally belong to two categories: invariant learning [9, 6, 11, 26, 46, 20] and equivariant learning. The representative method for invariant learning is contrastive learning, which draws the representations of positive samples together in the latent space such that the representations are invariant to data augmentation. Contrastive learning can learn highly discriminative features at the cost of losing certain image information due to the invariance constraint [42]. Motivated by this limitation, recent works explore merging contrastive learning with equivariant learning tasks by separate embedding [42, 16], augmentation-conditioned predictor [13, 17], and explicit equivariant transformation [22]. However, existing works still inherit the limitations of contrastive learning: its symmetry prior is built on a given set of manual augmentations and is not adaptive to downstream tasks. In contrast, our method enables the contextual world model to adapt its symmetry to the contextual data, which is more flexible and generalizable to various tasks.

Specifically, Masked Image Modeling approaches [27, 4, 14, 44] consider masked pixels and target pixel reconstruction as their action and next state. Other equivariant learning approaches [13, 35, 16] consider data transformations and representation of the target image as their action and next state pair.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
