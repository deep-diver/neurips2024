This poses challenges for real-time applications and long-horizon predictions. Existing neural-based models often depend on such computationally intensive methods, resulting in performance bottlenecks. \nThe proposed Decomposable Transformer Point Process (DTPP) model avoids this issue by employing an intensity-free approach.  **DTPP decomposes the problem, using a mixture of log-normals to model inter-event times and a Transformer-based architecture to model marks.** This strategy greatly enhances computational efficiency.  Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate DTPP's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on next-event prediction and the more challenging long-horizon prediction tasks with a fraction of the inference time required by existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "OesteJF0ls/podcast.wav"}
