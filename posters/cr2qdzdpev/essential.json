This unreliability significantly hinders the performance and robustness of RLHF systems.  Existing methods are often limited in addressing this critical challenge.\n\nThis paper introduces R\u00b3M, a robust RLHF approach that models unreliable labels as sparse outliers.  It uses an l1-regularized maximum likelihood estimation method and an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to learn a robust reward model while identifying and mitigating the impact of these outliers.  Experiments on robotic control and natural language generation demonstrate R\u00b3M's superior robustness and performance compared to standard RLHF methods, especially in scenarios with significant label corruption.  **R\u00b3M's versatility allows for extensions to various preference optimization methods, further enhancing its applicability and impact.**", "affiliation": "Georgia Tech", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cR2QDzdpEv/podcast.wav"}
