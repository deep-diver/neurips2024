Traditional methods have limitations in producing visually pleasing results, particularly when subjective human preferences come into play. Deep learning, especially diffusion models, have made progress, but the generated images often lack alignment with human aesthetic standards, leading to unnatural and discordant reconstructions. \nPrefPaint addresses this issue by using reinforcement learning to align a pre-trained diffusion model with human aesthetic preferences.  **The core method involves training a reward model on a large dataset of human-annotated images and then using reinforcement learning to fine-tune the diffusion model toward generating higher-reward (more aesthetically pleasing) images.** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the reward model's accuracy and demonstrates significant improvements in various inpainting tasks, including image extension and 3D reconstruction.  **The publicly available code and dataset further enhance the impact and reproducibility of this work.**", "affiliation": "City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "fVRCsK4EoM/podcast.wav"}
