This is particularly relevant in dynamic settings such as disaster recovery or online content management where step-by-step changes are crucial.  The paper explores this concept within computational social choice using multi-winner elections, focusing on how to smoothly transition between committees (subsets of alternatives). This problem, termed multi-winner reconfiguration, presents significant computational challenges.\nThe paper analyzes the complexity of multi-winner reconfiguration under four different approval-based voting rules. It finds that the problem exhibits computational intractability under some rules but polynomial solvability under others.  Furthermore, a detailed parameterized complexity analysis is provided, highlighting the existence of efficient algorithms under specific conditions. These findings provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for tackling real-world reconfiguration problems.", "affiliation": "TU Wien", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "kZfxICBXd1/podcast.wav"}
