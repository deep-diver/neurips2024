This indicates a negative trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy in general deep learning models. Visual prompting is a novel model reprogramming (MR) technique used for fine-tuning pre-trained models, achieving good performance in vision tasks, especially when combined with the label mapping technique. However, the performance of label-mapping-based visual prompting (LM-VP) under adversarial attacks and MIAs lacks evaluation. In this work, we regard the MR of LM-VP as a unified entity, referred to as the LM-VP model, and take a step toward jointly evaluating the adversarial robustness and privacy of LM-VP models. Experimental results show that the choice of pre-trained models significantly affects the white-box adversarial robustness of LM-VP, and standard AT even substantially degrades its performance. In contrast, transfer AT-trained LM-VP achieves a good trade-off between transferred adversarial robustness and privacy, a finding that has been consistently validated across various pre-trained models.

In addition to the deep learning models, training samples are also the key to this success. Consequently, attacks targeting the relationship between training samples and models have emerged, such as adversarial attacks [23, 14, 43, 37] and membership inference attacks (MIAs) [25, 28, 30, 32]. Adversarial attacks are gradient-based methods that introduce imperceptible perturbations on inputs, generating adversarial examples (AEs) that cause the target models to give incorrect predictions. Adversarial training (AT) [23], proposed by Szegedy et al. has been recognized as one of the most effective defenses against such attacks. The basic idea of AT is to incorporate AEs into the training process, resulting in significantly improved performance under adversarial attacks compared to standard training (ST).

These issues result in a negative trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy. As illustrated in Fig.1, while AT significantly enhances adversarial robustness, it is more susceptible to MIAs, especially after robust overfitting, i.e., between 100-150 epochs in Fig.1d, where the MIA success rate increases significantly.

Compared to traditional transfer learning methods like fine-tuning [33] and linear probes [1], VP does not modify the parameters of the pre-trained model. Instead, it alters the original image by adding prompts, i.e., introducing additional pixels, enabling task-specific and input-agnostic adjustments. During VP training, only the prompts and output transformation are updated. VP exhibits strong performance across various datasets and significantly reduces the training parameters compared to traditional transfer learning methods. Output transformation, or label mapping (LM), is another key technique contributing to VP\u2019s performance.

An attack model is then trained to recognize the relationship between the members of the shadow models\u2019 training data and the shadow models\u2019 outputs, which turns out to be a binary classification. This attack model can subsequently infer the membership of the target model\u2019s training dataset.

We find the choice of pre-trained models significantly influences the white-box adversarial robustness of LM-VP, making it hard to draw consistent conclusions. Therefore we focus more on its transferred adversarial robustness and its interaction with MIA-based privacy. To address both concerns, we propose the transfer AT method for LM-VP models to enhance performance on both fronts. Experiments across various pre-trained models demonstrate that: (1) Both standard-trained and transfer AT-trained LM-VP models show a positive correlation between transferred adversarial robustness and pre-trained model size, and (2) Transfer AT significantly boosts the transferred adversarial robustness of LM-VP models while also enhancing its training data privacy. These findings indicate the advantage of LM-VP models trained with transfer AT in AI security. However, the analysis of the LM-VP model currently lacks theoretical support and interpretability. In our future work, we intend to integrate relevant theories from related domains to delve deeper into LM-VP models\u2019 security implications.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
