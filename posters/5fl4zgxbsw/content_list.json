However, just improving the accuracy of ability estimation is far from satisfactory in the real-world scenarios, since an accurate ranking of students is usually more important (e.g., in high-stakes exams). Considering the shortage of existing CAT solutions in student ranking, this paper emphasizes the importance of aligning test outcomes (student ranks) with the true underlying abilities of students. Along this line, different from the conventional independent testing paradigm among students, we propose a novel collaborative framework, Collaborative Computerized Adaptive Testing (CCAT), that leverages inter-student information to enhance student ranking.

As we know, Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) and gradient descent (GD) methods can estimate the IRT parameter $a_{i},b_{i}$ . In this experiment, we respectively employ the IRT model, estimated by both the GD and MCMC methods, and conduct question selection and student estimation. In terms of the question selection algorithm, we select the following SOTA algorithms as the baseline: Random Randomly select a question for students each step, which is a benchmark to evaluate the improvement of other selection algorithms. FSI [32] and KLI [33] select the question with the highest Fisher/KL information, which measures how much information of students\u2019 abilities $\\theta$ can be obtained by answering a question. MAAT [34] utilizes active learning methods to measure the information each question brings to testing. BECAT [40] regards CAT question selection as a coreset selection problem and provides an approximate solution strategy. BOBCAT [35] proposed a Bilevel Optimization-based framework to synchronously optimize the question selection algorithm and estimation model. NCAT [36] respectively utilizes the ideas of reinforcement learning, and uses data-driven methods to directly optimize the accuracy of CAT test results.

Furthermore, when comparing Method X-C, whether employing MCMC or GD methods for estimating IRT model parameters, our CCAT algorithm demonstrates superior performance in ranking consistency across two public datasets. Particularly, CCAT shows more significant improvement when fewer questions are tested, outperforming other methods. As the number of test steps increases, the FSI-C method improves ranking consistency more rapidly, ultimately achieving a high level of consistency. This is attributed to the FSI method\u2019s ability to select questions with higher discrimination and uncertain responses, enabling the FSI-C method to promptly adjust students with inconsistent ranking. However, due to the FSI method\u2019s sensitivity to current abilities, it performs inadequately when fewer questions are tested. These results confirm that the CCAT framework is generally effective in ranking for CAT, whether in terms of test duration or estimation model.

After each baseline selection algorithm is completed, we replace the original results obtained by directly using IRT for parameter estimation with the ranking results obtained from collaborative ability estimation.

Figure 3 displays the metrics (ACC, AUC) obtained through various question selection algorithms on IRT, as estimated by different methods. It is evident that CCAT, when compared to other CAT question selection algorithms, does not significantly differ in terms of ACC and AUC indicators. This suggests that CCAT maintains the accuracy of CAT test results while enhancing ranking consistency. Furthermore, IRT estimated by MCMC significantly outperforms that estimated by GD and BOBCAT. This also explains why the same question selection algorithm in Table 1 performs better on the IRT model obtained through MCMC. Additionally, question selection algorithms proposed on GD, particularly those such as NCAT that utilize data-driven methods, are not efficient for IRT estimated by MCMC. This implies that these methods may not be effective, but can compensate for the drawbacks of using GD to estimate IRT. However, methods like BOBCAT, which concurrently train the IRT model alongside a question selection algorithm, may introduce bias into the IRT model. As depicted in Figure 3, while it outperforms all gradient descent methods in specific optimization objectives $(\\mathrm{ACC}@20)$ , it may impact accuracy at other times and compromise the stability of the IRT model in ability estimation. This can result in suboptimal performance in ranking problems. Given the analysis above and the stability of the MCMC method, we assert that it is more appropriate for IRT parameter estimation than the GD method, particularly when considering the ranking consistency of CAT.

This approach leverages collaborative student interactions to assist in question selection and estimation during testing. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrated that CCAT improves ranking consistency. Despite these promising results, our method has inherent limitations, particularly with longer testing sequences.
