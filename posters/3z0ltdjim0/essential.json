Existing local solvers offer improvements but suffer from limitations such as sequential operation and limited applicability. This research addresses these issues.\nThe paper presents a novel framework for approximately solving GDEs using a local diffusion process. This framework effectively localizes standard iterative solvers via simple, provably sublinear time algorithms suitable for GPU implementation. The approach demonstrates significant speed improvements and applicability to large-scale dynamic graphs, also paving the way for more efficient local message-passing mechanisms in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3Z0LTDjIM0/podcast.wav"}
