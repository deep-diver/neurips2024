Two common approaches are online reinforcement learning (like Proximal Policy Optimization, or PPO) and offline contrastive methods (like Direct Preference Optimization, or DPO).  Prior work treated these as equivalent, but this paper challenges that assumption.  It highlights a critical limitation: the diversity and coverage of the offline preference data significantly impact the performance of DPO, while online methods (PPO) are less affected.\nTo address this limitation, the researchers propose a hybrid method called Hybrid Preference Optimization (HyPO). HyPO combines the efficiency of DPO with the robustness of PPO by utilizing both offline preference data for contrastive optimization and online unlabeled data for KL regularization.  Theoretically and empirically, HyPO outperforms DPO, showcasing its effectiveness in various benchmark tasks. **The core contribution is the introduction of HyPO, a novel algorithm that bridges the gap between offline and online approaches, offering improved performance and efficiency.**", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "HBj86RMdZ8/podcast.wav"}
