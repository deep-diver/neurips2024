The comparison focuses on texture quality and is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. The table also indicates whether methods were fine-tuned on the training dataset and whether they require per-instance optimization.  Higher PSNR and SSIM scores, and lower LPIPS scores, indicate better texture quality.", "section": "4.2 Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "JBAUg7o8Yv/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study of several proposed designs on 2K2K [109] evaluation dataset.

It compares the performance with various configurations, such as different reconstruction spaces (pixel space vs. latent space using VAE), the impact of geometric prior initialization (using ground truth SMPL parameters, estimated SMPL parameters, or no SMPL parameters at all), and different projection methods (projection-only versus using a window of size 2). The metrics used are PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, reflecting the quality of the generated 3D Gaussian Splatting representations.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "JBAUg7o8Yv/tables/tables_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study of several proposed designs on 2K2K [109] evaluation dataset.

It compares the model's performance (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) across three key aspects:\n\n(a) **Reconstruction Space:**  Evaluates whether reconstructing in pixel space or latent space is more effective.\n(b) **Geometric Prior Initialization:** Assesses the influence of using Ground Truth SMPL parameters versus estimated parameters.\n(c) **Different Projection Methods:** Compares the performance when using different methods for projecting 3D tokens onto the 2D feature grids during the geometry-aware interaction.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}]
