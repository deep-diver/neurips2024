Recently, there has been a remarkable progress in machine learning and AI, due to the wide adoption of the transformer architecture and foundation models (FMs) [26, 30]. FMs have allowed both academia and industry to perform several data-demanding tasks, ranging from image and text analysis to multi-modal content generation and human-like visual perception [18, 20, 11, 4]. This is achievable due to the selfsupervised nature of the FMs, their ability to easily generalize and the large amounts of data available online [29]. The aforementioned properties make FMs distinguishable in specific general pre-training tasks such as next-word prediction, compared to traditional ML architectures that use supervised learning [2]. This recent surge in using large FMs has led to increased demand for computing power, which is projected to grow even more in the next few years [16]. This is due to the need for more advanced model training processes and the continuous expansion of model parameters [26, 6]. It is clear that as FMs become increasingly complex, they demand vast computational resources not only for training but also for fine-tuning and inference tasks. This surge in computational demand underscores the necessity for managing the available hardware more effectively.

With neural networks evolving towards larger models, heterogeneous and multi-device computing has played a critical role in their implementation. Device placement emerges as a pivotal factor determining the performance of an implementation of a model. Strategically allocating neural networks across multiple devices can significantly reduce the runtime of a model and the overall energy consumption [9]. The current process of device placement typically involves converting a neural network into a computation graph, where each node corresponds to an operation within the neural network. The computation graph is then partitioned and its nodes are allocated to the appropriate devices for processing. The effectiveness of device placement directly impacts the deployment performance of neural networks.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been proposed to provide effective device placements with full automation [31, 1, 21]. Two different DRL architectures for device placement currently exist in the literature: the \u2018grouper-placer\u2019 model that reduces the action space by merging operations into groups; and the \u2018encoder-placer\u2019 that encodes the features of the operations to capture the topological properties of the computational graph [15, 31].

In addition, most of them are not designed to train all of their components simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion and they fail to capture higher-order interactions among the operations of a computation graph.

There is a list of different graph-based representations of neural network models including abstract syntax trees, contextual flow, control, data flow and LLVM IR graphs [17]. Although such graphs may contain valuable information and capture the latent information flow of a program, they tend to add unnecessary complexity to the overall process. Instead, for the experiments of this paper, we opt for representing the code of a neural network model $c_{i}$ as a computation graph, due to its expressiveness, simplicity, and practicality. A computation graph is generally smaller than its counterparts and could be easily allocated to specific devices. For instance, one can use several popular libraries to produce the computation graph $G_{i}$ of a given neural network model $c_{i}$ . In this paper, we use the OpenVINO toolkit to generate the computation graphs as it generates smaller, already coarsened graphs compared to those of TensorFlow or PyTorch. Further information about the OpenVINO toolkit and examples of computation graphs are available in Appendix F. Even though it is optional, further coarsening can be performed using common co-locating operations or heuristics [22]. Such co-locating heuristics eliminate certain execution failures due to placement rule violations. In our experiments, we apply a simple algorithm for co-location to further condense the model into a smaller computation graph [22].

These methods can be categorized as (1) heuristic methods or (2) methods relying on RL techniques and deep learning. Heuristic methods are able to identify relatively optimal device placement solutions in a short time, but they require ad-hoc adjustments on different devices. Furthermore, they often fail to achieve the best outcomes [21]. In contrast, using RL for device placement generates better placement schemes for various devices. ", "page_idx": 12}, {"type": "text", "text": "The work in [22] first proposed an RL framework trained with the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize device placement, utilizing an attentional sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM and a contentbased attention mechanism. Building on [22], the authors in [21] introduced a feed-forward neural network as a \u2018grouper\u2019, transforming the simple sequence-to-sequence model into a hierarchical model. This hierarchical model enhances the grouping ability of the RL framework, facilitating the rapid identification of more suitable placement solutions.

The proposed approach used the structural information of the graph to better understand the interdependencies and communication costs, leading to more informed placement decisions. However, its node-by-node placement methodology might lead to longer training times and difficulties in scaling to very large computational graphs. The work in [33] combined graph neural networks and sequence-to-sequence models into an RL framework, initially encoding the computation graphs using GraphSAGE [8], then placing operations onto devices in one shot with the Transformer-XL model [5]. Leveraging the combination of GNNs and sequence-to-sequence models, the authors in [15] adopted contrastive learning as a pretraining method for GNNs, potentially impacting the training process of the RL framework. They introduced a GNN model that incorporates both the graph structure of the computation task and the characteristics of the hardware devices. Their model predicts the execution time of various operations across different devices, providing a holistic view that guides the placement algorithm.

According to [33], all device placement frameworks relying on RL can be split into two main categories: \u2018grouper-placer\u2019 and \u2018encoder-placer\u2019. The former structure initially divides the entire computation graphs into multiple groups and then allocates devices for each group. The latter learns features of computation graphs in the first phase and then predicts the device for each operation within the computation graphs based on the extracted features. The authors in [33] stated that the \u2018encoder-placer\u2019 structure offers more flexibility and generality than traditional \u2018grouperplacer\u2019 designs. The two structures share the same concept of grouping computation graphs with their main difference being that the \u2018grouper-placer\u2019 structure explicitly defines group partitioning, whereas the \u2018encoder-placer\u2019 structure achieves the concept of grouping through feature grouping encoding. Therefore, previous works essentially employed the technique of grouping and achieved encouraging results. Following a similar direction, our framework builds on the concept of grouping and utilizes a GNN as an agent to learn a policy for the device placement problem.
