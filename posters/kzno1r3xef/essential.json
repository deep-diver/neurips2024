Device placement, the task of optimally allocating computational tasks across heterogeneous devices, is crucial for performance. However, existing approaches have limitations: either simplifying the problem by grouping operations before placement ('grouper-placer') or solely focusing on encoding node features ('encoder-placer'), both resulting in suboptimal solutions.  These methods often lack end-to-end training and fail to fully leverage the underlying structure of the computation graphs.\nThis paper introduces HSDAG, a novel Hierarchical Structure-Aware Device Assignment Graph framework to overcome these issues.  HSDAG addresses the device placement problem with an end-to-end trainable architecture that incorporates graph coarsening, node representation learning, and a policy optimization step using reinforcement learning. It combines the strengths of both 'grouper-placer' and 'encoder-placer' methods by jointly learning node embeddings and group assignments. Experiments on benchmark models demonstrate significant improvements, achieving speedups of up to 58.2% compared to CPU-only execution and up to 60.24% compared to other baseline methods.", "affiliation": "Intel Labs", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Kzno1r3Xef/podcast.wav"}
