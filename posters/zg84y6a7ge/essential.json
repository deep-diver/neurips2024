Existing compression methods require extensive data, resulting in a trade-off between model size and performance.  This creates a significant hurdle for deploying SAM on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or embedded systems.\nThis paper introduces SlimSAM, a novel approach to compressing SAM.  SlimSAM uses a data-efficient technique called **alternate slimming** which involves iteratively pruning and distilling different parts of the model. It also introduces **disturbed Taylor pruning** to address inconsistencies between the model's pruning and distillation targets. The results show that SlimSAM achieves performance close to the original SAM while using **only 0.1% of the training data**, reducing model size and computational costs significantly. This opens the door for using SAM in a wider range of applications.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "ZG84y6a7ge/podcast.wav"}
