This paper focuses on determining the minimum embedding dimension needed to accurately capture distance relationships within datasets. The authors tackle this problem in two scenarios: contrastive learning and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search.  Both involve comparing distances between points, but with different types of information.  A key challenge is that directly preserving all distance information often requires high dimensionality.\nThe study leverages the concept of graph arboricity to derive tight bounds on embedding dimensions for both contrastive learning and k-NN in various lp-spaces.  For instance, it shows that preserving the relative order of nearest neighbors in l2 space only requires O(k) dimensions. This work introduces novel theoretical frameworks and analytical tools to understand embedding dimensionality, offering practical guidance for model development and optimization in machine learning.", "affiliation": "Northwestern University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "H0qu4moFly/podcast.wav"}
