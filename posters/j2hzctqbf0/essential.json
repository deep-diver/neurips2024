Traditional methods often struggle with accuracy and steadiness issues, leading to inaccurate and jittery pose estimations. \nThis research introduces a novel Sequence Structure Module (SSM) to address these limitations. The SSM utilizes the inherent structural information of fixed-length IMU sequences to improve accuracy and steadiness in pose estimations.  Experiments using spatial and temporal SSM variations demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing the efficacy of their approach in handling fixed-length sequential data.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "j2hzCTqbF0/podcast.wav"}
