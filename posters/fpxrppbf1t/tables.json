For each model and string type, the table shows the SI-SDR (scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio), SDR (signal-to-distortion ratio), MSS (multi-scale spectral distance), and Pitch (pitch difference in Hz).  Higher SI-SDR and SDR values indicate better sound quality, while a lower MSS value indicates better spectral similarity to the ground truth. Lower Pitch values represent better pitch accuracy. The results highlight the superior performance of DMSP and DMSP-Hybrid, particularly in the nonlinear string case, in terms of both sound and pitch accuracy.", "section": "4.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "fpxRpPbF1t/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Ablation Study", "description": "This table presents the ablation study results, comparing the performance of DMSP-Hybrid and DMSP models with and without the pitch loss (Lfo).
