Figure 9 clearly demonstrates that without IVM assistance, the LCBC robot agent suffers from severe performance drop when noticeable distractions are applied. With IVM assistance, however, the agent consistently pays close attention to correct instruction-related image regions, performing robustly against diverse distractions such as human disturbances and numerous task-irrelevant objects of various colors and shapes. This demonstrates promising potentials of using IVM to enhance embodied agents to follow complex instructions in unseen scenes with plenty distractions.

This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-empowered Mixture-of-Expert pipeline in generating reliable data for IVM training. 2) Figure 10 (a) also reveals that incorporating human annotations significantly boosts training efficiency (red and blue v.s yellow line), highlighting the critical role of introducing human preferences in IVM-Mix-1M dataset, despite its relatively small volume compared to machine-annotated data (only 1:100).

The results demonstrate that DWSL effectively leverages both human- and auto-annotated data, particularly as the volume of machine-annotated data increases, enjoying higher asymptotic performances. This is expected as machine-annotated data often contain inaccuracies and training naively using all these data can lead to suboptimal results. Meanwhile, the limited human data alone cannot provide satisfactory outcomes. DWSL, however, addresses these challenges by dynamically prioritizing good samples and discarding misleading ones, resulting in stable and improved results.

Note that the IVM generated heatmaps cannot provide exact semantic object segmentation with clear contours like reasoning segmentation [31] offers.

For this task, the ground truth heatmaps are mostly less semantic-meaningful for annotations as discussed in 3.1. So, we ensemble the annotation proposals from different visual grounding methods for data annotation, which will make the trained IVM model robust to include instructionrelevant image areas, rather than being aggressive to exclude some instruction-sensitive pixels like reasoning segmentation [31] does illustrated in Figure 2.
