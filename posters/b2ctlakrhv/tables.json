The metrics used to evaluate the performance are Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), False Discovery Rate (FDR), True Positive Rate (TPR), and F1-score. The results show that the proposed method with a single-chained ordering containing different numbers of nodes outperforms the baseline method in terms of SHD, FDR, TPR, and F1-score across all sample sizes.", "section": "4.2 Real-world data"}, {"figure_path": "B2cTLakrhV/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison of path absence- and augmented acyclicity-based partial ordering constraints for structure learning in terms of run time t (s) and output quality F1-score.", "description": "This table compares the performance of two methods for integrating partial order constraints into structure learning: a path absence-based approach (Equation 8) and the proposed augmented acyclicity-based approach.
