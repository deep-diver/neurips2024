Among them the approximate gradient method has demonstrated strong performance in practical applications compared with other methods. The approximate gradient method can be described as a two-stage algorithm, which loops through the following two processes: first sample points to decrease the uncertainty of the local area according to a local exploration acquisition function, and then moving to the next point with a trustworthy high reward through a local exploitation acquisition function. M\u00fcller et al.

This includes the Additive and ANOVA Models [4], in which the kernel of Gaussian process is defined through the summation of univariate kernels. This essentially decompose the original Gaussian process into a sum of low dimensional Gaussian processes, which facilitates computations and convergence [9, 37, 13]. Another approach along these lines assumes that the objective function depends only on low dimensional subspace, and examples include hyperparameter optimization for neural networks [3]. Most of these methods suppose a subspace is a linear subspace of the original Euclidean space. Wang et al.[34] apply random linear embeddings to approximate this subspace and propose REMBO.

This involves adjusting nine parameters, with a limit of 500 evaluations for the optimization process. The second function addresses a cosmological issue[24], where the objective is to fine-tune a cosmological model or physical simulator to match observational data from the cosmos. The focus is on maximizing the log likelihood of the model, which is influenced by various physical constants. We follow the setting in Eriksson et al.[7], which presents a harder optimization problem with 12 parameters and much larger bounds, and set the budget at 2000 evaluations. The third function concerns rover trajectory planning [33]. It involves optimizing the placement of 100 points in a 2D space to plot the rover\u2019s trajectory and reduce costs, creating a 200-dimensional optimization problem with a budget of 1000 function evaluations.

The experiment showed that the performance of the traditional UCB was very limited across these three types of problems, struggling to find the maximum value of the function, and this issue became more severe as the data dimension increased. In contrast, our method exhibited good scalability with respect to dimensions, achieving favorable results across various dimensions.

Conversely, when $\\beta$ is set to 5, the algorithm tends to be more conservative, favoring the search for points that are very likely to have function values less than the current best point. We list the experimental results on synthetic function defined in Section 8.1 under these three $\\beta$ values in Figure 6,7 and 8. The results show that when $\\beta$ is small, both MinUCB and LA-MinUCB are more likely to achieve better results in the initial search phase. This is because a smaller beta value allows for a broader search range, increasing the chances of finding relatively good results early on. However, in the later stages of finding the optimal point, it may be weaker than when $\\beta$ is larger. This is because an overly aggressive strategy can cause the algorithm to hover around the optimal point without getting close. This can also be seen from the Theorem 2, which states that a larger $\\beta$ is a necessary factor for the algorithm to approach the extreme point. When $\\beta$ is set to 3, it represents a more balanced outcome, achieving a good convergence rate while the optimal point is also close to that when $\\beta$ is set to 5, making it a better choice.
