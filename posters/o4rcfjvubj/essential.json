This significantly limits their adaptability and real-world applicability. The models usually need to store all old personalized concepts for fine-tuning, leading to high computational cost and privacy concerns.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Concept-Incremental text-to-image Diffusion Model (CIDM). CIDM employs a **concept consolidation loss** and an **elastic weight aggregation module** to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates a **context-controllable synthesis strategy** to prevent concept neglect. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDM outperforms existing models, offering a significant improvement in both single and multi-concept image generation, and in custom image editing and style transfer.", "affiliation": "Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "O4RCFjVUBJ/podcast.wav"}
