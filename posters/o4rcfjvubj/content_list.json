Specifically, Finetuning aims to optimize LoRA layers to learn multiple personalized concepts in a concept-incremental manner. To address catastrophic forgetting, EWC [20] applies an elastic regularizer to penalize the network parameters. Besides, LWF [25] stores the old training data to perform knowledge distillation on the current task, while RPY [25] replays the old concepts [20] to tackle the CIFC setting. CLoRA [45] proposes a self-regularized low-rank adaption to continually learn new personalized concepts. L2DM [47] builds a long-term memory bank to reconstruct old personalized concepts, and performs knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Specifically, for image-alignment (IA), we use the image encoder of CLIP [34] to evaluate the feature similarity between the synthesized image and original sample. For text-alignment (TA), we utilize the text encoder of CLIP [34] to compute the text-image similarity between the synthesized image and its corresponding prompt. As shown in Fig. 9, we roughly categorize prompts into three categories according to the learned concepts. To analyze quantitative comparisons between our model and SOTA methods, inspired by [11, 22, 45, 47], we input an evaluation prompt and a unify negative prompt to sample 50 images.

For fair comparisons with existing methods, we apply the region-aware cross-attention module proposed in Mix-of-Show [11] into all comparison methods. The quanlitative comparisons in Fig. 12 demonstrate the superior performance of our model in multi-concept customization, when continually learning new personalized concepts under the CIFC setting. Particularly, given an initial text prompt (ITP) and some region text prompts (RTP) with users-provided bounding boxes, all comparison methods exhibit significant concept neglect and they are difficult to perform multi-concept customization. On the one hand, it is evident that all comparison methods fail to preserve the identity of learned concepts due to catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, these methods neglect some important object concepts during the synthesis process. For example, users may want to generate an image of a V1 dog and a V7 dog drinking a cup of beer, but none of the comparison methods can generate the V1 and V7 dogs, as shown in Fig. 12.

This can foster innovation and creativity by providing customized suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.
