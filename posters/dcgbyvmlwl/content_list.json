Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions.

Among them, reinforcement learning (RL)-based constructive NCO methods [5, 6] can generate near-optimal solutions for small-scale instances (e.g., TSP instances with no more than 200 nodes) without the requirement of expert knowledge [7]. These solvers usually adopt a single-stage solution generation process, constructing the solution of CO problems node-by-node in an end-to-end manner.

BQ-NCO [14] and LEHD [8] develop a sub-path construction process [15] and employ models with heavy-decoder to learn the process. Nevertheless, training such a heavyweight model necessitates supervised learning (SL), which limits their applicability to problems where high-quality solutions are not available as labels.

As another category of large-scale NCO, neural divide-and-conquer methods have attracted increasing attention. Inspired by the common divide-and-conquer idea in traditional heuristics [18, 19], these methods execute a two-stage solving process, including a dividing stage for overall instance partition and a conquering stage for sub-problem solving.
