Subfigure (a) shows the intra-community and inter-community compression ratios in the low noise, significant noise, and high noise settings. It demonstrates that the intra-community compression ratios are higher than the inter-community compression ratios, particularly in low-noise settings.  As the noise increases, the gap between them decreases, indicating that the compression ratio is a useful metric even with heavy noise. Subfigure (b) presents the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) scores of the variance-based outlier removal method compared to other popular outlier detection methods (LOF, KNN-dist, Isolation Forest, and ECOD) across the three noise levels. The results show that the variance-based method is competitive with the other methods and outperforms them in the low noise setting.", "section": "3 Simulations for outlier detection"}, {"figure_path": "a4J7nDLXEM/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Simulation results for compression ratio and outlier detection", "description": "This figure presents simulation results to validate the proposed compression ratio metric and outlier detection method.
