The results are shown for three different patterns of distributional sensitivity (random, ascending, and descending) under three types of system dynamics (almost surely stable, almost surely unstable, and general). It illustrates the convergence of the RSGD algorithm towards the PSC solution and the impact of system stability and sensitivity patterns on the convergence rate.
