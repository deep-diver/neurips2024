The table is split to show these two metrics independently and demonstrates superior performance of the proposed method across all datasets in both quality of image generation and accuracy of mask segmentation. The results are further broken down to specify metrics for different image resolutions (64x64 and 128x128) across different datasets, providing a comprehensive comparison.", "section": "4.2 Image and Mask Generation"}, {"figure_path": "7G362fgJFd/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparisons on Flower.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the proposed method's performance on the Flower dataset against several other methods for unsupervised image segmentation.
