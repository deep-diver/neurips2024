Estimating the gradient of the solution with respect to these parameters is critical for hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning and other tasks. A common approach is to differentiate through the iterations of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, which is conceptually simple but requires careful analysis due to noise from SGD's stochastic nature.  Prior work has often focused on asymptotic convergence guarantees. \nThis research delves into the dynamics of SGD derivative estimates, showing that the convergence of the derivative iterates can be analyzed as a perturbed SGD recursion.  The authors provide strong convergence results for strongly convex objective functions, determining convergence rates based on step-size schedules. This work presents rates of convergence for derivative estimates of SGD, particularly addressing constant step sizes and the practically relevant case of diminishing step sizes. The mathematical framework developed for the analysis provides further insights into inexact SGD recursions, potentially impacting the convergence analysis of other machine learning algorithms.", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "7WoOphIZ8u/podcast.wav"}
