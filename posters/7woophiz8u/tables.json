[{"figure_path": "7WoOphIZ8u/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Technical Lemmas", "description": "This table summarizes the results from four different lemmas (C.1 to C.4) used in the convergence analysis of inexact SGD. Each lemma provides convergence results under different assumptions about step sizes, error terms, noise levels, and resulting convergence rates for the sequence (Dk)k\u2208N which represents the root of the mean squared error of the iterates. Lemma C.1 gives a result for constant step sizes, Lemmas C.2 and C.3 provides sublinear rates with vanishing step sizes, and Lemma C.4 shows an exponential convergence rate in the interpolation regime. The table helps to organize and understand the different convergence scenarios explored in the paper.", "section": "Technical Lemmas"}]
