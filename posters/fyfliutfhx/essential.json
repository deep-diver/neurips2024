Many prioritize invariance, losing valuable temporal information.  The problem is that many standard methods for video analysis are not robust and struggle to generalize well, limiting their real-world applications. \nThis research introduces a novel SSL approach that directly addresses this problem by explicitly optimizing for the \"straightness\" of temporal trajectories in the learned representations.  By encouraging smoother, more linear representations, the method obtains significantly more robust neural embeddings that show improved performance on various tasks including object recognition and prediction, even surpassing previous invariance-based methods in tests with noisy or adversarial data. The key is a novel objective function that quantifies straightness and serves as a regularizer, which can be applied broadly to improve existing SSL techniques.", "affiliation": "Center for Neural Science, New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fYfliutfHX/podcast.wav"}
