Existing methods like FedAvg train a single global model which is ineffective when clients have significantly different data, while others use clustering, which lacks flexibility. Personalization approaches exist, but they are often computationally expensive or lack adaptability. \nThe paper introduces CoBo, a novel approach that models client selection and model training as interconnected optimization problems. It uses a bilevel optimization framework where the inner level dynamically selects helpful clients based on gradient alignment and the outer level trains personalized models.  CoBo, an SGD-type algorithm, enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with diverse datasets distributed among many clients.", "affiliation": "EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "SjQ1iIqpfU/podcast.wav"}
