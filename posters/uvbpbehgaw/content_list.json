Increasing evidence suggests that alignment finetuning methods expose and amplify aspects of the behavior distribution already implicit in the base pretrained model [e.g., 43, 21]. In this paper we build on this insight: We hypothesize that pretrained base models already have a weak statistical connection between behavioral principles, described in natural language, and the behavior that would realize them. We can encourage this connection by optimizing the conditional mutual information between principles and model responses given queries from a dataset. Finetuning the base model in this way requires no human preferences or examples yet yields a model which follows principles.

We restricted our experiments to two do  \nmains: dialogue and summarization, using a small set of behavioral principles for summarizing Reddit posts or helpful and harmless norms for responding to a wide range of user queries sourced from HH-RLHF. To further evaluate how well SAMI scales, future work should include more diverse constitutions and tasks, featuring multi-turn interactions, multiple principles, and personas with a wider range of preferences [11, 9, 13, 1]. Training on a broader range of tasks and constitutions is likely to improve a SAMI-trained model\u2019s ability to follow constitutions more consistently and effectively across various domains and scenarios. This could then be evaluated against more capable instruction-following models such as llama3-70b-instruct using benchmarks like MT Bench [42]. A current limitation is that the SAMI loss (Figure 6) requires regularization. Training for too long or failing to regularize can result in forgetting and the model outputting \u201cgibberish\u201d, a problem faced by RLHF more generally and usually regularized against using a KL-divergence penalty [e.g., 31]. Moreover, SAMI suffers from a length bias similar to other methods, such as DPO. While our experiments on TL;DR have shown that this length bias can be regularized against by explicitly stating that responses should be concise, future extensions could explore incorporating length penalties [26]. Furthermore, for SAMI to be effective, the principle-generating model must provide sufficient coverage for contrasts to work, and there must be at least a weak initial connection between the principles and appropriate behavior. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Conclusion. SAMI represents progress in teaching a pretrained language model to follow behavioral principles without the use of preference labels, demonstrations, or human oversight. By iteratively finetuning a language model to increase the conditional mutual information between constitutions and self-generated responses given queries from a dataset, SAMI enables the model to connect principles to behavior preferences. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach: after a small number of gradient updates on self-generated data, the SAMI-trained model outperforms both the initial model and a strong instruction-finetuned baseline on dialogue (Experiment 1). On summarization, it surpasses the initial model and performs at parity compared to the instructionfinetuned baseline (Experiment 2). Moreover, SAMI benefits from stronger models and more diverse principles, generalizing to principles not seen during training (Experiment 3). This success provides evidence that alignment can leverage the behavioral regularities implicitly learned by the base model.

I don\u2019t know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she\u2019s not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She\u2019s pretty comfy where she\u2019s at now and doesn\u2019t want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn\u2019t want to do that type of thing. It\u2019s pretty understandable. She has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She\u2019s a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad!
