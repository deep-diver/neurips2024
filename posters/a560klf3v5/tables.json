While restricted, this suffices for the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.", "description": "This table lists the instructions supported by the Stravinsky programming language, a domain-specific language created for implementing cryptographic functions as transformer modules.  Although the instruction set is limited, it provides sufficient functionality for implementing SHA-256, which is crucial for the unelicitable backdoor design presented in the paper.  Each instruction describes an operation on registers within the transformer model.", "section": "A.1 Constructing a transformer model that computes SHA-256"}]
