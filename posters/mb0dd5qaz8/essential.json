This leads to pessimistic performance bounds, especially when the actual data is easier to learn.  **This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel approach that incorporates predictions about future data points, enhancing the algorithm's adaptability and effectiveness.**\nThe paper introduces online learners that use black-box access to a predictor, a forecasting algorithm.  The performance of these algorithms gracefully adapts to the quality of the predictor's predictions. **The key findings demonstrate that online learners can significantly outperform worst-case bounds when accurate predictions are available, matching optimal offline learners in ideal scenarios, while gracefully degrading to the standard worst-case bounds under poor prediction quality.**", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Online Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MB0DD5qAz8/podcast.wav"}
