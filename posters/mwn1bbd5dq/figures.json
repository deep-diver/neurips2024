It shows that the number of samples per class is highly imbalanced, with a few head classes dominating the dataset, while many tail classes have very few samples.  The figure also demonstrates that common model adaptation methods like fine-tuning and LoRA struggle with the long-tailed distribution, resulting in significantly weaker performance on tail classes compared to head classes. This highlights the challenge of learning unbiased representations from imbalanced datasets, which is the problem addressed in the paper.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "mwN1bbD5DQ/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Two key steps of debLoRA: feature clustering and calibration. (a) The baseline LORA feature space is biased towards head classes. Red crosses X represent head class samples, and blue triangles A represent tail class samples. The blue star indicates the center of tail class samples. Dashed blue triangles show the validation samples of the tail class wrongly embedded in the head class region, indicating the model bias towards head classes. (b) We cluster all features (clusters denoted by gray dotted boundaries) regardless of class labels. A, B and C are cluster centers used to generate a de-biased center D, as in Eq. 2. (c) We calibrate the tail class features by \u201cmoving", "description": "This figure illustrates the two key steps in the debLoRA method: feature clustering and calibration.  Panel (a) shows the biased feature space of the baseline LoRA model, where features of head classes dominate, misrepresenting tail classes.  Panel (b) shows how K-means clustering is used to group features irrespective of class labels. The cluster centers represent shared attributes between classes. Panel (c) depicts the calibration step, where tail class features are moved toward a de-biased center, calculated from the cluster centers using a weighting scheme. This results in a de-biased feature space that better represents tail classes. Panel (d) shows examples of real samples and their corresponding positions in the biased and de-biased feature spaces.", "section": "4 De-biased LoRA (debLoRA)"}, {"figure_path": "mwN1bbD5DQ/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of validation samples and clusters.

Fine-tuning and LoRA methods, commonly used for adapting pre-trained models, exhibit weak performance in tail classes.
