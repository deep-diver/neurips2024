Specifically, we introduce CAT, an innovative model that Coordinates Anatomical prompts derived from 3D cropped images with Textual prompts enriched by medical domain knowledge. The model architecture adopts a general query-based design, where prompt queries facilitate segmentation queries for mask prediction. To synergize two types of prompts within a unified framework, we implement a ShareRefiner, which refines both segmentation and prompt queries while disentangling the two types of prompts. Trained on a consortium of 10 public CT datasets, CAT demonstrates superior performance in multiple segmentation tasks.

This is particularly evident in medical domains, where variations in imaging protocols, noise/artifacts, and patient-specific pathologies pose significant challenges [8, 9, 10]. To tackle these challenges, there have been some efforts within the community to develop promptable models for segmenting objects in medical images: 1) One type of such effort focuses on textual-prompted models [11, 12, 13], which show profound competencies in segmenting a specific organ or tumor referenced by arbitrary text phrases. These approaches involve distilling knowledge from language models like CLIP [14] or BERT [15] to facilitate the alignment between visual and textual representations; 2) Another direction in promptable segmentation research aims to visual-prompted models [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], which rely on visual examples or visual landmarks (e.g., boxes and points). Recently, the trend toward visual-prompted segmentation models in the medical domain mainly focuses on fine-tuning SAM [22] with lightweight, plug-and-play adapters or modifying SAM into 3D-based architecture.

As illustrated in the left part of Figure 1, the distribution of medical datasets often follows a long-tail pattern, where an increase in the diversity of detectable anomalies corresponds with a sharp decline in the number of available cases. Textualprompted methods utilize textual representations from referred text phrases to guide the segmentation process, requiring alignment between visual and textual representations. Although descriptive texts can cover intricate and rare anomalies with domain knowledge, data scarcity due to long-tailed distribution hinders the effective learning of alignments between textual and visual representations. This issue is particularly significant in the medical domain, where numerous corner cases (e.g., tumors with variations in shape, size, density distribution, and blurring boundaries) need to be addressed. Conversely, visual prompts are not constrained to the need for cross-modal alignment, providing a more intuitive and direct method to enhance the segmentation process. Nonetheless, visual prompts fail to convey the general concept of each object, leading to a performance drop when confronted with various scenarios in medical domains, especially for tumors. For instance, colon tumors range from different cancer stages [23] and have significant inter- and intra-patient in tumor sizes and shapes, as shown in the right part of Figure 1. Moreover, tumors at the same stage can exhibit varying densities. Given the inherent diversity in tumors, there is a necessity to provide comprehensive knowledge of each tumor type via textual descriptions.

For the comparison of SAM-based methods [40, 39], it is worth noting that only one point derived from the ground truths is utilized as the prompt during the inference time since tumors of small sizes are difficult to identify but can be easily segmented with the provided prompts. Without using information from labels, $c A T$ still achieves better performance except for the colon tumor segmentation, as evidenced by a $5\\%$ improvement in the DSC of the pancreas tumor. These results validate the proposed PromptRefer module (i.e., attending to specific organs when segmenting tumors). Moreover, we compare $c A T$ with textual-prompted methods. $C A T$ surpasses the previously across four tasks by $4\\%$ in the average DSC. As our model is an extension of textualprompted methods, these results demonstrate that incorporating the anatomical prompts can produce higher-quality masks for tumors.

It is noted that the higher the number after the \u201cT\u201d, the larger the tumor or the more extensively it has grown into nearby tissues. We can observe that SAM-derived methods perform well in segmenting relatively small T1 tumors with point prompts. However, SegVol [39], which achieves the best results in MSD colon tumor segmentation, struggles to handle tumors that invade nearby organs or tissues. It is evident from the performance gap between T3 and T4 tumors. In these cases, tumors in each instance can present with varying densities and show distinct shapes at different locations. Only using visual prompts without comprehensive descriptions to cover all abnormal parts proves challenging. Such scenarios are vital in the medical field, highlighting the need for further research in applying visual prompts for tumor segmentation. In this paper, we coordinate anatomical and textual prompts along with the predefined attention mask to alleviate this problem. CAT outperforms other models by at least absolute $7\\%$ DSC in T4 and $3\\%$ DSC on average, demonstrating much better generalizability and robustness. This result suggests that leveraging anatomical prompts together with medical domain knowledge is an alternative way to address intricate scenarios in the medical domain.

The results in the second and third rows reveal that textual-prompted models are prone to misclassification and overlook key details due to the lack of intuitive context, underscoring the importance of visual prompts. However, these only relying on visual prompts struggle with tumors of intricate shapes without the support of medical domain knowledge, as shown in the fourth row, where SegVol exhibits a high number of false positives on normal CT scans. When tumors invade other tissues, existing models often fail due to segmentation target incompleteness and misclassification of normal regions as tumors. In contrast, CAT can precisely identify most abnormal regions and consistently generate results that are more consistent with the ground truth compared to all other models.

We start from a basic query-based segmentation architecture without any extra prompts, and then we ablate the effectiveness of using different prompts for different tasks.

The observed declines in the third row indicate that textual features, which are rich in semantics but lack appearance features, may not generalize well to objects with intricate structures or small sizes. It is evidenced by a performance reduction of $6\\%$ in Esophagus segmentation and $4\\%$ in Hepatic Vessel tumor segmentation. Moreover, we can observe from the second row that the tumor segmentation capability is inadequate when relying solely on anatomical prompts. This issue stems from the diversity and variance of tumors. For instance, every example the model encounters is drastically different as it tries to identify the location and nature of pancreas tumor. Although tumors can be regarded as anomalies, the lack of consistent context poses a challenge for the model in establishing a general concept solely with the cropped volumes. The coordination of anatomical and textual prompts improves the performance of the promptable model. This confirms the efficacy of our joint prompts schema, which is designed to help the model form more stable and generalizable masks in the medical field.

As presented in the last five rows in Table 3, we evaluate the impacts of the module designs in our ShareRefiner and PromptRefer. The comparison of results between the seventh and last rows demonstrates that employing the hard assignment for refining the anatomical queries can boost performances, especially for tumor segmentation. However, applying the paradigm to the other two queries (i.e., the \u2018Hard\u2019 column is marked as $\\checkmark$ ) will decrease the performance of segmentation. This decline can be attributed to the entanglement of the three query types. Such a phenomenon further reinforces that anatomical and textual prompts contribute from different perspectives. Using a one-hot hard assignment ensures that each query feature remains exclusive to the others, allowing queries to focus on distinct visual regions without overlap. We hypothesize that anatomical queries could attend to features and distinguish between different categories based on inherent appearance characteristics. Additionally, we remove the mask mechanism in the PromptRefer and utilize a vanilla cross-attention layer to update $\\mathbf{Q}_{S}^{\\prime}$ . As illustrated in Table 3, this variant leads to reduced performance in tumors that invade other organs (e.g., StageIV).

Our findings indicate that the initial prompt features are not well-separated in the feature space. For instance, the anatomical features of the right kidney and left kidney (categories 1 and 2) are entangled. Therefore, different refined paradigms need to be applied to update both queries simultaneously. With our ShareRefiner, prompt features are separated in the feature space. Moreover, we can observe that the distribution of refined anatomical prompt queries is more structured than textual prompts, which further verifies that the anatomical prompt is more intuitive. Contrastive alignment is utilized to further push segmentation queries to be close to the referenced prompt for segmenting the corresponding category. To validate the effectiveness, we trained without utilizing contrastive alignment. We also use t-SNE to visualize the distribution of decoded segmentation query features $\\mathbf{O}_{S}$ in the right part of Figure 4. We can observe that segmentation queries are more separated in the feature space with contrastive alignment.

Extensive experiments indicate that the coordination of these two prompt modalities yields competitive performance on organ and tumor segmentation benchmarks.

Moreover, there may also be mistakes in the segmentation results, especially when the test sample contains rare types of lesions or undergoes radical resection surgeries that cause large variations in the anatomical structures.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
