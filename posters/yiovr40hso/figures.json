The single-view model takes text prompts as input and generates a single panoramic image. The multi-view model builds upon the single-view model, incorporating spherical epipolar constraints to ensure consistency across multiple viewpoints generated from the same text prompt.  The framework is designed for both single-view and multi-view panorama generation.  Input text prompts and camera poses are processed through the models to output generated panoramic images, which can then be used in various applications.", "section": "4 Proposed Method: DiffPano"}, {"figure_path": "YIOvR40hSo/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: DiffPano allows scalable and consistent panorama generation (i.e., room switching) with given unseen text descriptions and camera poses.
