Multi-modal image fusion encompasses Visible-Infrared image Fusion (VIF) and Medical Image Fusion (MIF).

Despite numerous methods being proposed, research on dynamic fusion and its theoretical guarantees remains significantly lacking. To address these issues, we derive from a generalized form of image fusion and introduce a new Test-Time Dynamic (TTD) image fusion paradigm with a theoretical guarantee. From the perspective of generalization error, we reveal that reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the fusion weight and the uni-source component reconstruction loss. Here the uni-source components are decomposed from fusion images, reflecting the effective information of the corresponding source image in constructing fusion images. Accordingly, we propose a pixel-level Relative Dominablity (RD) as the dynamic fusion weight, which theoretically enhances the generalization of the image fusion model and dynamically highlights the changing dominant regions of different sources. Comprehensive experiments with in-depth analysis validate our superiority. We believe the proposed TTD paradigm is an inspirational development that can benefti the community and address the theoretical gap in image fusion research.
