Current Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods often struggle with efficient representation learning and fine-grained control. This research tackles these issues by proposing a novel contrastive, goal-conditioned training approach for reward models (RMs).  This method increases the similarity of representations for preferred trajectories and decreases similarity for dispreferred ones.  This improves both performance and steerability. \nThe proposed method significantly improves RM performance on challenging benchmarks (up to 0.09 AUROC improvement). This enhanced RM performance translates to better policy LM alignment. Further, the method's ability to evaluate the likelihood of achieving goal states enables effective trajectory filtering (discarding up to 55% of generated tokens), leading to significant cost savings and improved model steerability.  Fine-grained control is also achieved by conditioning on desired future states, demonstrating significant improvements in helpfulness and complexity compared to baselines. **The research demonstrates a simple yet effective approach for improving both performance and controllability of LMs in RLHF, addressing critical challenges in the field.**", "affiliation": "Scale AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Swh8LxuycA/podcast.wav"}
