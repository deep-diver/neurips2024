Current methods often employ approximations or subsampling, compromising accuracy or requiring specialized hardware. This limitation significantly restricts the applicability of GNNs to many real-world problems, such as analyzing social networks or spatiotemporal data. \nThis work introduces Intersecting Community Graphs (ICGs) as a new approach to address this issue. ICGs represent graphs as a combination of intersecting cliques. The key innovation is a new constructive version of the Weak Graph Regularity Lemma, which efficiently constructs ICG approximations.  Using ICGs, the proposed algorithm operates directly on the ICG, resulting in linear time and memory complexity with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on node classification and spatiotemporal data processing tasks, surpassing the performance of existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "pGR5X4e1gy/podcast.wav"}
