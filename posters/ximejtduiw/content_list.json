Key problems in genomics intrinsically involve multiple modalities, but it remains unclear how to adapt general-purpose sequence models to those cases. In this work we propose a multi-modal model that connects DNA, RNA, and proteins by leveraging information from different pre-trained modality-specific encoders.

When gene DNA sequences are transcribed into mRNA molecules to produce proteins, they generally do not express it in just a single way producing a single protein isoform. After DNA sequences are transcribed, pre-mRNA transcripts undergo a process called RNA alternative splicing where they are cut and re-assembled to form different variants of mature mRNA molecules that can be translated into proteins. This process allows for the generation of multiple RNA and protein isoforms from a single gene DNA sequence, that can differ in structure, function, localization, or other properties (Fig. 2a).

Moreover, the Enformer is a model that can handle sequences of large context (up to 196k nucleotides), enabling it to capture long-range dependencies, known to be relevant for expression. We also tried the Borzoi model $[]$ as an enocder for DNA model. Borzoi is a model pre-trained on sequences up to $512\\mathrm{kb}$ nucleotides to predict RNA-seq coverage which directly relates to RNA transcript isoform exression. These results demonstrate that our multi-modal framework can be improved by leveraging more domain-specific encoders. As our best model for isoform prediction is achieved using the Enformer as DNA encoder, we will use it as DNA encoder by default for all the following experiments. We make the weights of this IsoFormer model available on HuggingFace5.

IsoFormer obtains similar performance across tissues despite tissues having different distributions of expression levels. To gain additional insights about the representations learned by IsoFormer, we analysed the attention layers inside the RNA encoder as it is the one providing stronger improvement on this task. Specifically, we compared how the attention distribution within each layer and head changes when we finetune the RNA encoder alone versus finetuning IsoFormer altogether. We report changes in attention scores at each layer and head of the RNA encoder for three genomics elements known to have a strong effect on the isoform splicing and gene expression processes, namely the 3UTR, 5UTR and CDS sequence, see Fig. 3-right (additional details on these scores are in Appendix Section C.1). The results show that, when finetuning using the three modalities, different layers specialize to capture specific features relative to isoform splicing and expression. Notably, the middle set of layers put higher attention weights to 3UTR regions whereas the top layers of NT attributes higher attention weights on CDS and 5UTR. We assume that this RNA encoder specialization during finetuning is key to achieve a strong representation towards the prediction of its tissue-specific expression.

This block learns a fixed number of tokens for each modality, thus reducing the cost of the subsequent cross-attention layer. (ii) Linear Projection: a strategy that linearly projects the embeddings of the three modalities into a common representation space and concatenates all tokens. This concatenated sequence is fed to a Perceiver Resampler to learn a fixed number of tokens which are then used in the head of the model.

Similarly, C-Abstractor does not confer any benefit over cross-attention; therefore we consider this latter strategy as the optimal aggregation strategy for our method.

However, we observed that when we randomly initialized only the DNA or RNA encoders, the drop in performance is smaller (0.41 for DNA and 0.48 for RNA). This suggests that IsoFormer not only leverages intra-modalities pre-training but also inter-modalities transfer.
