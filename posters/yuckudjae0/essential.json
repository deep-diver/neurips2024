Existing adversarial training (AT) techniques, which aim to improve model robustness, also suffer from limitations in handling these corruptions.  The LP-norm, commonly used, doesn't consider semantic similarity and thus often fails to correctly identify similar images. \nThis paper proposes a novel method to learn Bregman divergences directly from pixel space to measure semantic similarity. This approach learns divergences that consider real-world corruptions as close to the originals, unlike traditional LP-distances.  By replacing projected gradient descent in AT with the mirror descent associated with the learned divergences, they achieve state-of-the-art robustness, particularly for contrast corruption. This method shows improvement on datasets of human perceptual similarity judgments and demonstrates the learned divergences' effectiveness in distinguishing between corrupted and noisy images.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "yUckuDjAE0/podcast.wav"}
