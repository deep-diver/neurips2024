However, while it is possible to collect data from new scenarios, the annotations are not always available. Existing Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) works usually report their performance by selecting the best model on the validation set or even the test set of the target domain, which is highly impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised model selection approach for domain adaptive object detection, which is able to select almost the optimal model for the target domain without using any target labels. Our approach is based on the flat minima principle, i.e., models located in the flat minima region in the parameter space usually exhibit excellent generalization ability. However, traditional methods require labeled data to evaluate how well a model is located in the flat minima region, which is unrealistic for the DAOD task. Therefore, we design a Detection Adaptation Score (DAS) approach to approximately measure the flat minima without using target labels. We show via a generalization bound that the flatness can be deemed as model variance, while the minima depend on the domain distribution distance for the DAOD task. Accordingly, we propose a Flatness Index Score (FIS) to assess the flatness by measuring the classification and localization fluctuation before and after perturbations of model parameters and a Prototypical Distance Ratio (PDR) score to seek the minima by measuring the transferability and discriminability of the models. In this way, the proposed DAS approach can effectively represent the degree of flat minima and evaluate the model generalization ability on the target domain. We have conducted extensive experiments on various DAOD benchmarks and approaches, and the experimental results show that the proposed DAS correlates well with the performance of DAOD models and can be used as an effective tool for model selection after training.

This is because the training set (i.e., source domain) and the test set (i.e., target domain) have distinct domain distributions.

As shown in Fig. 1 (a), DAOD methods usually suffer from a performance drop during training (marked as purple in Fig. 1 (a)).

ATC [22] learns a threshold on the confidence of the model and predicts accuracy as the fraction of unlabeled examples for which model confidence exceeds that threshold. In object detection, however, the evaluation involves not only classification but also precise localization of objects within an image. This crucial distinction renders these methods ineffective in fully assessing an object detection model. A recent work [60] proposes a BoS metric to evaluate the generalization of the detection model by measuring the stability of the box under feature dropout.

Object detection [23, 47, 54, 46, 39] is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves identifying and locating multiple objects within an image or video. The object detection approaches can be roughly divided into two categories: one-stage and two-stage. The one-stage methods [54, 46, 39, 19] directly estimate the categories and the location of the objects, such as FCOS [54], CenterNet [19], and YOLO series [46]. The two-stage methods [23, 47, 3] first generate region proposals for objects and then classify the category and regress the bounding box coordinates based on the proposal features, e.g., Faster RCNN [47] and Cascade RCNN [3]. Recently, an endto-end object detection model based on Transformer (i.e., DEtection TRansformer, DETR) [5] has been proposed to eliminate the complex anchor generation and post-processing operations such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). Many successive works [67, 63] further improve the training efficiency and accuracy of DETR. With the strong representation of deep neural networks, the object detection model has achieved promising results in many object detection benchmarks.

Previous works can be roughly categorized into two aspects: domain alignment and selftraining. The domain alignment [11, 50, 8, 66] directly minimizes the domain discrepancy between the source and target domains. They minimize the feature distribution mismatch via adversarial training [11, 50, 66, 16], prototype alignment [58], graph matching [35, 36, 37], etc. The self-training approaches [14, 38, 4, 15, 10] follow a Mean Teacher (MT) framework and generate pseudo-labels from the teacher network to supervise the training of the student network. UMT [14] leverages the style transfer algorithm to eliminate the MT model bias towards the source domain. Adaptive Teacher (AT) [38] combines adversarial training and self-training to improve the accuracy on the target domain. CMT [4] introduces contrastive learning to improve the instance feature representation. HT [15] reveals that the consistency between classification and localization is crucial for pseudo-label generation and proposes a reweight strategy based on the harmony measure between the classification and localization.

In this work, we test our method on four classical DAOD models in the two main DAOD streams (i.e., adversarial training and self-training): DA Faster RCNN (DAF) [11], MeanTeacher (MT) [52], Adaptive Teacher (AT) [38], Contrastive Mean-Teacher (CMT) [4]. DAF [11] is a typical DAOD framework extending the Faster RCNN architecture by incorporating domain adaptation techniques. It employs adversarial training to align the feature distribution across domains at both image and instance levels. MT [52] leverages a teacher-student paradigm to generate pseudo labels to provide extra supervision for the student model on the target domain. The teacher model is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model and thus can provide more accurate pseudo-labels for the student model. This approach helps in leveraging unlabeled data by enforcing consistency between the predictions of the teacher and student models. AT [38] improves upon the Mean-Teacher framework by employing an adversarial learning module to align the feature distributions across two domains, reducing domain bias and improving pseudo-label quality. CMT [4] enhances the Mean-Teacher framework with contrastive learning techniques by encouraging similar instances to be closer in the feature space while pushing the features of dissimilar instances apart.

We reproduce these approaches on the classification branch of object detection models. Besides, we also use the Fr\u00e9chet Distance (FD) [17] to measure the domain distance on backbone features as a compared method.

Domain adaptation methods can be highly sensitive to the hyperparameters.

We evaluate our DAS in hyperparameters tuning by leveraging the weights of adversarial loss (denoted as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{dis.}}$ ) for the domain discriminator and of unsupervised loss (denoted as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{unsup}})$ for self-training in AT [38]. For a model with a specific hyperparameter setting, we obtain the last three checkpoints of its training process and calculate their average performance to represent the model. The final DAS of the specific model is defined as the average DAS of these obtained checkpoints. The experimental results are conducted on the weather adaptation and summarized in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, we can observe that the model with higher DAS presents better improvement after adaptation. The proposed DAS can correlate the detection performance without any labels on the target domain. We further compare our DAS with the unsupervised model evaluation methods and summarize the results in Table 3. The proposed DAS consistently outperforms the previous baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in hyperparameter tuning.

On the other hand, we can explore methods that extend beyond the constraints of labeled data by leveraging few-shot labeled data in the target domain to help model evaluation.
