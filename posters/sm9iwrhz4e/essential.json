The challenge lies in balancing exploration (learning the environment) and exploitation (acting optimally based on current knowledge) while handling the uncertainty inherent in unknown environments.  A key measure of performance is regret, which quantifies the difference between an optimal agent's performance and the learning agent's performance.\nThis paper introduces a new algorithm, PMEVI-DT, that overcomes these limitations. **PMEVI-DT is the first tractable algorithm to achieve minimax optimal regret**, meaning it performs as well as theoretically possible, given the challenges involved.  The algorithm's tractability stems from a novel subroutine, PMEVI, which efficiently computes bias-constrained optimal policies.  Remarkably, PMEVI-DT does not need prior information about the environment's complexity, making it more practical for real-world applications. ", "affiliation": "Univ.
