Parallel-in-time (PinT) methods offer a solution by parallelizing the time domain, but existing PinT methods like Parareal often suffer from slow convergence or scalability issues.  Learning the discrepancy between coarse and fine solutions is crucial for efficient PinT methods. \nThis paper introduces RandNet-Parareal, a novel PinT solver that utilizes Random Neural Networks (RandNets) to learn this discrepancy. RandNets are simpler and faster to train than other machine learning models like Gaussian Processes, used in previous PinT approaches. The results show RandNet-Parareal achieves significant speedups (up to x125) compared to traditional Parareal and nnGParareal, demonstrating excellent scalability even with massive spatial meshes (up to 10<sup>5</sup> points). This is achieved using a relatively small number of neural network neurons and training is very efficient. The approach shows improvement across various PDE systems, including real-world problems such as the viscous Burgers' equation and shallow water equations.", "affiliation": "Department of Statistics, University of Warwick", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "974ojuN0jU/podcast.wav"}
