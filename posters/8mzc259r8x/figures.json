Panel (a) depicts the Gomory fractional cut function (CGf), which is a simple piecewise linear function.  Panel (b) illustrates the Gomory mixed-integer cut function (GMIf), another piecewise linear function but with a different structure than the CGf. Panel (c) displays a more complex piecewise linear function (\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1f,s1,s2) that generalizes the previous two, demonstrating its greater flexibility in generating cuts for integer programming problems.  The parameter f is a fixed real value in (0,1), and s1, s2 are additional parameters that allow for a wider range of cut generation.", "section": "One-dimensional cut generating functions"}, {"figure_path": "8mZc259r8X/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Three cut generating functions on [0, 1), where \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1f,81,82 is defined in Section 3.", "description": "This figure shows three examples of one-dimensional cut generating functions on the interval [0,1).
