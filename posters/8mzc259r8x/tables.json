The tree sizes are shown for different cutting plane strategies: Gomory's mixed integer cut (GMI), a 1-row cut using a one-dimensional cut generating function, k-row cuts (k=2, 5, 10) using k-dimensional cut generating functions, and the best 1-row cut (representing the optimal performance achievable using this approach).  The results compare the effectiveness of the proposed cut generating functions against the traditional GMI cut in reducing the branch-and-cut tree size, which directly correlates to the solution time.", "section": "Numerical experiments"}, {"figure_path": "8mZc259r8X/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Average tree sizes on 100 instances, after adding a single type of cut at the root.", "description": "This table presents the average sizes of branch-and-cut trees for various problem instances (Knapsack and Packing problems with different parameters) and cutting-plane strategies. The cutting-plane strategies include the classical Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cut, one-dimensional cut generating functions (1-row cut), and k-dimensional cut generating functions with varying k (2-row, 5-row, 10-row cuts).  The 'best 1-row cut' column shows the performance when the best parameter for each instance is chosen (not practical but provides an upper bound). The table demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed cut generating functions, particularly the multi-row cuts (k>1), in reducing the branch-and-cut tree size compared to the GMI cut, especially for larger instances.", "section": "6 Numerical experiments"}]
