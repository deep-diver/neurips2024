A key ingredient of branch-and-cut is the use of cutting planes which are derived constraints that reduce the search space for an optimal solution. Selecting effective cutting planes to produce small branch-and-cut trees is a critical challenge in the branch-and-cut algorithm. Recent advances have employed a data-driven approach to select good cutting planes from a parameterized family, aimed at reducing the branch-and-bound tree size (in expectation) for a given distribution of integer programming instances. We extend this idea to the selection of the best cut generating function (CGF), which is a tool in the integer programming literature for generating a wide variety of cutting planes that generalize the well-known Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cutting planes. We provide rigorous sample complexity bounds for the selection of an effective CGF from certain parameterized families that provably performs well for any specified distribution on the problem instances. Our empirical results show that the selected CGF can outperform the GMI cuts for certain distributions. Additionally, we explore the sample complexity of using neural networks for instance-dependent CGF selection.

The method of choice for solving integer programming problems is the well-known branch-and-cut paradigm [Schrijver, 1986, Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988, Conforti et al., 2014]. This procedure has two critical ingredients: branching, which is a way to subdivide the problem into smaller subproblems, and the use of cutting planes which is a way to reduce the feasible region of a (sub)problem by deriving additional linear constraints that are implicitly implied by the integrality of the decision variables. To get to a concrete algorithm from this high level framework, one needs to make certain choices (such as how to branch, which cutting plane to use etc.) Thus, at a high level, the branch-and-cut method is really a collection of algorithms equipped with a common set of \u201ctunable parameters\". Upon a specific choice of values for these parameters, one actually obtains a well-defined algorithm that one can deploy on instances of the problem. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "There is a substantial amount of literature on the mathematical foundations of cutting planes and branching, and many of their theoretical properties are well understood. Nevertheless, current theory does not give very precise recipes for making these parameter choices in branch-and-cut for getting the best performance on particular instances. There are some general insights available from theory, but a large part of the actual deployment of these algorithms in practice is heuristic in nature. This state of affairs has prompted several groups of researchers to explore the possibility of using machine learning tools to make these parameter choices in branch-and-cut; see [Scavuzzo et al., 2024] for a survey and the references therein. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this paper we focus on some foundational aspects of the use of machine learning to improve algorithmic performance of branch-and-cut. One can formalize the problem as follows. Given a family of instances of integer programming problems, one wishes to select the parameters of branch-and-cut that will perform well on average, and one wishes to do this in a data-driven manner. More formally, one assumes there is a probability distribution over the family of instances and the goal is to find the choice of parameters that gives the best performance in expectation with respect to this distribution. The probability distribution is not explicitly known, but one can sample instances from the distribution and use these samples to guide the choice of parameters. This puts the problem in a classical learning theory framework and one can ask questions like the sample size required to guarantee success with high accuracy and high probability (over the samples). This perspective was pioneered in a recent series of papers [Balcan et al., 2021a,c,b, 2022, 2018] with several important insights and technical contributions. The broader question of selecting a good algorithm from a suite of algorithms for a computational problem, given access to samples from a distribution over the instances of the problem, is generally called data-driven algorithm design and has received attention recently; see [Balcan, 2020, Balcan et al., 2021a] and the references therein.

In [Balcan et al., 2021c,b, 2022], the authors focus on the classical cutting plane families of Chv\u00e1tal-Gomory (CG) and Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cutting planes. These are actually two very special cases of a much more general framework for deriving cutting planes for integer programming problems, which is called cut generating function theory. The idea behind cut generating functions goes back to seminal work by [Balas, 1971] and [Gomory and Johnson, 1972a,b] from the 1970s, and there has been a tremendous amount of progress in our understanding of this theory in the past 15 years. The main point is that cut generating functions give a parameterized family of cutting planes to choose from, which vastly generalizes the CG and GMI cuts. We provide sample complexity results for cut selection from this larger family. This requires new understanding of the structure of these cutting planes and their interplay with learning theory tools.

We believe an important factor behind this is that the cut selection problem for this much larger class is very hard. Thus, while they promise significant gains over traditional ideas like GMI cuts, it has been difficult to utilize them in practice. Using modern machine learning tools to help with the cut selection could be the key to deploying these powerful tools in practice. Thus, we believe our results to be significant in that they are the first of their kind in terms of establishing a rigorous foundation for using machine learning to solve the cut selection problem for cut generating functions.

Cut generating function theory also allows the use of information from multiple rows of the tableaux, which will naturally result in stronger cutting planes because more information from the problem is used to derive these cuts. Our second result (Theorem 4.4) gives sample complexity results for a parameterized family of cut generating functions that uses information from $k$ rows, for any fixed natural number $k\\geq2$ .

Sections 3, 4 and 5 achieve aims 1) and 2). Section 6 gives evidence for 3) by showing that our choice of cut generating functions can indeed improve performance of branch-and-cut, especially with the use of instance dependent cutting planes. Our performance criteria is the overall tree size (number of nodes explored by the solver) for solving the problem.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
