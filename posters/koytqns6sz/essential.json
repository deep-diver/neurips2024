However, **existing methods struggle with the vastness of the pricing curve space** and **the asymmetric feedback mechanism** where buyer types are only revealed upon purchase.  Prior work on discretization schemes for finding optimal pricing strategies suffers from poor scaling with approximation parameters, hindering efficient online learning algorithms.\nThis work introduces **novel discretization schemes** tailored for data pricing, exhibiting better dependence on the approximation parameter than existing methods, significantly enhancing online learning.  The paper develops online learning algorithms for both **stochastic and adversarial settings**, achieving provably low regret bounds while efficiently handling the asymmetric feedback.  These **algorithms are computationally feasible** and provide a significant advancement in managing the complex pricing dynamics in the data marketplace.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Finance"}, "podcast_path": "KoyTqNs6SZ/podcast.wav"}
