Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) alternative, initially demonstrated promising results but later studies revealed its underperformance compared to Transformers in standard benchmarks, especially regarding few-shot learning and downstream learning tasks like in-context learning. This paper focuses on these shortcomings.\nThis research tackles Mamba's limitations by demonstrating that mixed-precision training (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques can significantly improve its performance.  The researchers leverage dynamical systems theory to show that Mamba is robust to minor input changes due to mixed-precision. Furthermore, they demonstrate the effectiveness of PEFT by targeting key memory buffers in Mamba's custom CUDA kernels for low-rank adaptation. The results show significant speedups and reduced memory usage compared to full fine-tuning, achieving comparable performance to fine-tuned Transformers.
