The benchmark assesses the models' ability to generate images that accurately reflect attributes (color, shape, texture), object relationships (spatial and non-spatial), numeracy (correct number of objects), and complex compositions.  RealCompo achieves the highest scores across all four categories, indicating superior performance in compositional generation.", "section": "4.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "R8mfn3rHd5/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Evaluation results about compositionality on T2I-CompBench [21].
