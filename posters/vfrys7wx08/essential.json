However, these inferred reward functions often fail to capture the true task objective, leading to suboptimal policies. This paper addresses the critical issue of **task-reward misalignment** by introducing a novel framework that emphasizes task alignment over conventional data alignment.\n\nThe proposed framework, called PAGAR (Protagonist Antagonist Guided Adversarial Reward), is a semi-supervised approach.  It uses expert demonstrations as weak supervision signals to identify a set of candidate reward functions that align with the intended task.  An adversarial training mechanism is employed to validate the learned policy's ability to achieve the task across these diverse reward functions, improving robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that PAGAR outperforms existing methods in complex scenarios and transfer learning, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the critical challenge of task-reward misalignment.", "affiliation": "Boston University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VFRyS7Wx08/podcast.wav"}
