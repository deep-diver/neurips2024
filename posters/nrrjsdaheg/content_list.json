We introduce a novel approach to self-supervised learning, multi-task-masking (MtM), which is able to learn population-level, region-level, and single-neuron level structure from neural population activity. We validate this approach on neural recordings taken from a large, diverse dataset (39 mice across multiple brain regions). We find that MtM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art masking modeling schemes for neural data prediction, and enables multi-task generalization. We also provide scaling results demonstrating that MtM is a promising approach for large-scale pre-training on neural population data across animals and sessions.

First, the data diversity, while higher than other neural pre-training datasets [3, 42], is still significantly lower than a full brain-wide map of neural population activity [17]. Training MtM on the IBL brain-wide map dataset, which contains 300 brain regions and hundreds of animals, is an exciting future direction. Second, our current architectures, NDT1 and NDT2, are simple time-series transformers that utilize basic tokenization schemes, i.e. temporal tokens. Recent work has demonstrated that learning global dependencies across temporal tokens leads to poor forecasting results on multivariate time-series datasets [21] and that more sophisticated architectures can outperform the NDT architectures on behavior decoding from neural data [3]. Therefore, improving the underlying architecture of MtM is another direction that should be explored.

For both $R^{2}$ metrics, the performance shows a positive correlation with the mean firing rates.
