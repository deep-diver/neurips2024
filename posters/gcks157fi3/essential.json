Existing methods often rely on indirect approaches, such as converting to intermediate representations like point clouds or voxels, which can lead to information loss or inefficiency.  Furthermore, scaling up these methods for large-scale pre-training is often difficult. \nThis paper presents MeshXL, a family of generative pre-trained models that directly generates high-quality 3D meshes. MeshXL utilizes a novel Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF) representation, which effectively represents the explicit 3D coordinates with implicit neural embeddings. This allows for a simple yet effective sequence representation of 3D meshes, facilitating autoregressive generation and pre-training. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of 2.5 million 3D meshes, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating scalability.", "affiliation": "Tencent PCG", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "Gcks157FI3/podcast.wav"}
