Researchers have long sought for accurate and efficient methods to represent 3D data. Point Cloud [54, 57, 58, 89] captures the spatial positions of discrete points in the Euclidean space, which is preferred by various 3D sensors [15, 87, 66, 3, 7]. Mesh [53, 2, 65, 12] represents the 3D structure with graphs. By connecting the vertices with edges, mesh can also be interpreted into a set of polygons in the 3D space. Similar to point clouds, 3D Gaussians [38, 68] also record the discrete Euclidean distribution in 3D space. However, each point is represented by a 3D Gaussian distribution function parameterized by its covariance matrix, color, and opacity. Given their fast convergence and rendering speed, 3D gaussians are often utilized for 3D reconstruction. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [51, 5] constructs a learnable volumetric function $f$ using neural networks trained on multi-view images. Due to its derivability and flexibility, NeRF is also favored for 3D generative models [46, 99, 76, 56]. Additionally, there are other 3D representations such as multi-view images [74, 90, 100], voxel fields [61, 13, 45], and signed distance fields [94], among others [64, 88, 63]. In this paper, we consider the Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF), an explicit spatial representation with implicit neural embeddings, and investigate its potential for scalable 3D asset generation.

With the exploration of various 3D representations and the collection of large-scale 3D datasets [17, 9, 16], researchers have also put much effort exploring the generation of high-fidelity 3D assets [42, 39]. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [25, 80, 1, 33] produces synthetic 3D data with a generator $\\mathcal{G}$ , and train a discriminator network $\\mathcal{D}$ to distinguish the generated and real data. Additionally, the potential of diffusion models [54, 28, 62] in the direct generation of 3D data is also widely explored [97, 2, 54, 50, 47]. The key idea behind diffusion is to transform the desired data distribution into a simpler distribution (e.g. gaussian) and learn a desnoising model for the reverse process. Besides, researchers have also explored the potential of diffusion models in generating multi-view images [46, 16, 82, 43], and reconstruct them into 3D structures. In this paper, we mainly explore the auto-regressive methods for 3D generation. AutoSDF [52] and MeshGPT [65] learn to generate discrete tokens and reconstruct them into 3D representations with a VQVAE model [72]. PolyGen [53] adopts two decoder-only transformers that predict the location and connectivity of vertices, sequentially.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
