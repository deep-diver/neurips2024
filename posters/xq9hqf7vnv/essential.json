Traditional methods often rely on simple image priors, limiting their ability to reconstruct complex images accurately.  Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown their potential in generating realistic images, suggesting that they could improve image reconstruction in inverse problems. However, previous attempts to use diffusion models in this context have relied on approximations that can lead to inaccuracies. \nThis research introduces a novel method, Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (PnP-DM), that uses diffusion models as image priors within a Bayesian framework.  The key innovation is an algorithm that reduces the problem to a simpler Gaussian denoising problem which is then solved using a general formulation that encompasses a variety of state-of-the-art diffusion models.  The results show that PnP-DM significantly improves the accuracy and fidelity of image reconstructions compared to existing methods, especially in challenging problems like black hole imaging.", "affiliation": "Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Caltech", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "Xq9HQf7VNV/podcast.wav"}
