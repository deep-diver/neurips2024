LLMs are language models with a large number of parameters trained on web-scale text corpra [5, 1, 43, 10, 27]. LLMs have exhibited emergent capabilities that can be broadly applied in a task-agnostic manner, such as in-context learning [5], chain-of-thought reasoning [46], and mathematical reasoning [25]. These capabilities are largely attributed to aligning LLMs with expected human values and intentions, which involves training the model to follow instructions and being helpful, truthful, and harmless [35, 24, 40]. Specifically, harmless is achieved by safety alignment that empowers the LLM with safety guardrails so that the model can refuse harmful instructions. Common safety alignment techniques are instruction tuning [45], RLHF [35], DPO [39], rejection sampling [33], and self-alignment [41]. However, these techniques are not designed to cover the safety risks that may arise from the subsequent custom finetuning and jailbreak attacks.

Comparing the results of finetuning on 10, 50, 100 harmful examples, the ASRs continue to increase as expected. We also discover that different LLMs have varying rates of vulnerability to finetuning, and our VISAGE safety metric can successfully measure the risks in finetuning before actual finetuning. Comparing LLaMA2 with Vicuna, LLaMA2 has a higher VISAGE score than Vicuna, meaning that when both are finetuned on the same user data, LLaMA2 shows a lower ASR than Vicuna when evaluated on safety benchmarks. Our evaluation results on both 80 prompts and full 520 prompts verify that the safety in finetuning is reflected by our VISAGE safety metric. Since the VISAGE definition does not make assumptions on the downstream finetuning dataset, LLM-VISAGE serves as a task-agnostic safety metric that measures finetuning risks.

Previous work have observed that projecting on random directions fail to capture the variation in optimization trajectory because the trajectory lies in an extremely low dimensional spaces, and a random sampled direction is nearly orthogonal to this subspace. A potential solution is applying principal component analysis (PCA) on all saved model checkpoints, but the $n$ -epoch finetuning on LLaMA2-7B-chat will lead to a feature matrix of size $n\\times7B$ , which makes it expensive to compute with existing PCA libraries. Therefore, we set the projection direction as the interpolated direction between the initial and the final finetuned model weights. By projecting all saved checkpoints onto this direction, we successfully capture the optimization trajectory.

In this section, we evaluate the impact of system prompt design on LLaMA2, LLaMA3, Vicuna, and Mistral, using each LLM\u2019s default system prompt as the baseline. We collect different types of system prompts from both an attacker\u2019s or a defender\u2019s perspective. From an attacker\u2019s standpoint, we apply two types of prompts: (1) removing the default system prompt (Empty), and (2) using roleplaying prompt to attach a new charater to the LLM, hoping to make the LLM forget its safety responsibilities (Roleplay). From a defender\u2019s perspective, we also employ two types of prompts: (1) LLaMA2\u2019s default system prompt that explicitly includes safety concerns (LLaMA2), and (2) safety prompts that are directly optimized for a specific LLM [49] (Safety). The details of the system prompts used in our experiments are listed in Appendix A. For each type of the system prompt, we compute its mean VISAGE score from three random directions.

We find that roleplaying prompts are generally less effective in breaking an LLM\u2019s safety across different models. Among the six LLMs tested with the default system prompt, LLaMA2 has the highest VISAGE score, aligning with the observation that LLaMA2 tends to be conservative and may even refuse harmless input prompts [49].

We find that the performance drops for both models when removing the system prompt. As shown in Fig. 3b, removing the system prompt reveals that the original Vicuna model is a local maximum in the safety landscape, indicating that there exist slightly perturbed model weights more resistant to harmful inputs than the fine-tuned model. This suggests that the safety alignment of Vicuna is not optimal, possibly because the fine-tuning process rarely encountered inputs with an empty system prompt.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
