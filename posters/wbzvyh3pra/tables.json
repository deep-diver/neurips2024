The methods include using LLMs without any additional techniques, using LLMs with self-debugging, using LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and using LLMs in combination with the proposed FACTORSIM approach.  The table compares the performance of different LLMs such as Llama-3 and GPT-4, highlighting the effectiveness of FACTORSIM in improving code generation accuracy.", "section": "4.1 RL Game Generation"}, {"figure_path": "wBzvYh3PRA/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Percentage of system tests passed by different methods of generating 2D RL games.", "description": "This table presents the success rate of various methods in generating 2D reinforcement learning games, as measured by the percentage of system tests passed.  The methods include several large language models (LLMs) with and without different prompting techniques (Chain-of-Thought, self-debugging), and the proposed FACTORSIM method.  The results are shown for eight different games, offering a comparison across various approaches in generating functional and accurate game code.", "section": "4.1 RL Game Generation"}]
