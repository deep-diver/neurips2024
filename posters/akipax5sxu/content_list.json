For MwE, the well-known EXP4 algorithm [Auer et al., 2002] achieves $\\dot{O}\\left(\\sqrt{K T\\log N}\\right)$ -regret, where $K$ , $T$ and $N$ represent the numbers of arms, rounds and experts. This bound is, however, not always optimal for certain parameter settings of $K$ and $N$ . In fact, as discussed by Seldin and Lugosi [2016], when $N=K$ , the problem is reduced to the standard $K$ -armed bandit problem, for which the minimax regret is $\\Theta({\\sqrt{K T}})$ [Audibert and Bubeck, 2009]. This means that the regret bound of EXP4 has a gap of an $O({\\sqrt{\\log K}})$ -factor when $N=K$ On the side of upper bounds, Kale [2014] addressed this issue by providing an algorithm achieving $O\\left(\\sqrt{K T\\log_{+}\\frac{N}{K}}\\right)$ ,1 where we denote $\\log_{+}x:=\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{\\log x,1\\right\\}$ . This is minimax optimal for the case of $N=O(K)$ . However, the minimax optimal bound for arbitrary settings of $K$ and $N$ has been an open question. The best known lower bound $\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{K T\\frac{\\log N}{\\log K}}\\right)$ is shown by Seldin and Lugosi [2016], who conjectured that this lower bound is minimax optimal. This paper provides a solution to this open question by providing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{K T\\log_{+}\\frac{N}{K}}\\right)$ , which, together with the upper bound by Kale [2014], implies that the minimax regret is $\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{K T\\log_{+}\\frac{N}{K}}\\right)$ . This lower bound is shown for the problem setting in which the player need to choose an expert before observing the advices in each round. As noted in Remark 1 below, though this problem setup is more challenging than the \u201cclassical\u201d setting where the player can observe all expert advice before selecting an arm, almost all known existing algorithms, including those in Table 1, work for this setting.

In particular, this paper considers the problem setting of the stochastic-context and adversarial-loss model [Neu and Olkhovskaya, 2020, Liu et al., 2024], i.e., problems with stochastic $X_{t}$ and adversarial $\\theta_{t}$ .

This paper shows that the regret bounds can be further improved by not fixing $\\alpha$ to 1 but by adjusting it appropriately. Similar approaches have been used successfully in various online learning problems including multi-armed bandits [Audibert and Bubeck, 2009], bandits with expert advice [Kale, 2014], graph bandits [Eldowa et al., 2024], and sleeping bandits [Nguyen and Mehta, 2024].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
