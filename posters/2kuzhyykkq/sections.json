[{"heading_title": "Long Seq. Training", "details": {"summary": "The research paper section on \"Long Seq. Training\" delves into the challenges and advancements in training large language models (LLMs) with extremely long input sequences.  It highlights the **memory constraints** imposed by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, a critical bottleneck in processing lengthy sequences.  The paper introduces and analyzes **MINI-SEQUENCE TRANSFORMER (MST)**, a novel methodology that partitions sequences into smaller mini-sequences, reducing intermediate memory usage.  MST, in combination with activation recomputation, demonstrates significant improvements in training efficiency for LLMs without compromising accuracy or convergence.
