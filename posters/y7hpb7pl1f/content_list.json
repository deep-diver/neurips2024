By fine-tuning the pre-trained clustering model leveraging user feedback, IDC remarkably improves the performance of various state-of-the-art deep clustering methods. For future studies, one potential direction is to consider the mistakes in user feedback, and correspondingly improve the robustness of IDC. Another possible direction is to design a more advanced interaction pipeline, for aligning clustering results with the user\u2019s personalized partition criterion.
