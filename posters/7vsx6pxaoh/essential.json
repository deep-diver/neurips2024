They also face challenges in multi-objective optimization under a unified representation. This paper addresses these issues by focusing on joint human-machine vision. Existing approaches struggle with balancing performance and efficiency across diverse tasks, hindering seamless transitions between human-centric and machine-centric reconstruction.\nThe proposed method, Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA), integrates into existing coding models. MPA uses a predictor to allocate latent features among task-specific paths, maximizing the use of shared features while preserving task-specific ones. A two-stage optimization strategy leverages feature correlations to ease multi-task performance degradation.  **Experimental results demonstrate that MPA achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, supporting seamless transitions between human and machine vision tasks with minimal parameter overhead.**", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Coding"}, "podcast_path": "7vsx6PxAOH/podcast.wav"}
