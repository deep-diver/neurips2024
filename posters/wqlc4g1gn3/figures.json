In a probabilistic sampler, the model relies on an approximation x0 \u2248 x0 to guide each step (left).

The left side shows a probabilistic posterior sampler which estimates the initial state (x0) and uses this approximation to guide the sampling process.

This results in better accuracy and stability across different number of steps.
