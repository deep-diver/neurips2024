These methods often suffer from sensitivity to discretization and approximation errors, hindering their accuracy and robustness. \nThis research proposes an innovative solution by transforming the generative process into a discrete optimal control problem. A diffusion-based optimal controller, inspired by iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR), is developed, capable of handling diverse forward operators (super-resolution, inpainting, etc.).  The resulting algorithm is shown to overcome prior limitations by accurately recovering the idealized posterior sampling equation. The method demonstrates significant improvement in solving various inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art image reconstruction results.", "affiliation": "Yale University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "wqLC4G1GN3/podcast.wav"}
