With the advent of the NISQ era [65, 10] and the improved deployment capability [77], the exploration of new VQAs has accelerated, as these algorithms have shown promise in delivering quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices [17]. However, despite their potential, commonly used VQAs such as the QAOA [27] for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and UCCSD [67] for ground state energy estimation are not inherently designed to handle hard constraints. Typically, these constraints are modeled as soft penalty terms within the objective function, which may not be the most efficient approach. Addressing the natural incorporation of symmetries and hard constraints directly into VQAs remains an open and critical challenge for advancing the field.

The HWP ansatz, operating in a constrained subspace, utilizes parameterized gates that maintain the number of non-zero elements in the quantum state. Recent work [78] has thoroughly analyzed the expressivity and trainability of the HWP ansatz, demonstrating its outstanding performance in capturing fundamental symmetries, such as total spin conservation. Meanwhile, quantum LDPC code [53, 13] and surface code [29] have been widely widely adopted in quantum error correction through the use of stabilizers to detect and correct qubit errors. However, a significant challenge remains in identifying quantum ansatze that naturally facilitate error correction mechanisms. In response, we propose a combined framework that integrates the HWP ansatz with parity check operations. Since the HWP ansatz inherently preserves the number of non-zero elements in quantum states, it offers a promising foundation for enhancing parity check performance in mitigating errors. By employing parity checks as projective measurements, quantum states can be constrained directly to the problem subspace, thereby introducing a robust mechanism for error mitigation while expanding the utility of parity checks beyond their conventional role. This approach allows for more effective error correction and constraint enforcement within quantum circuits.

By repeatedly inserting parity check blocks in the quantum circuit we can mitigate the influence of unexpected bit-flip errors. The results on noiseless simulator demonstrate that the proposed universal HWP ansatz is able to exceed UCC ansatz with single, double, and even triple excitation. We also test the performance of parity checks with HWP ansatz against other symmetry verification (SV) methods [38, 70] with UCC ansatze. Under the simulated noise, we observe that only verifying the number of non-zero elements at the end of the circuit is not enough to determine whether there is an occurrence of error, so constantly parity checks in the circuit are essential for detecting bit-flip errors.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
