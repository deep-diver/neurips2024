Current methods often use penalty terms, which can be inefficient. This research addresses this by combining the Hamming Weight Preserving (HWP) ansatz with a parity check mechanism. The HWP ansatz keeps the number of non-zero elements in the quantum state constant, while parity checks detect and correct errors, improving accuracy and robustness. \nThis combined approach significantly outperforms existing VQA methods on both quantum chemistry and combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., Quadratic Assignment Problem).  The researchers tested their method on both simulators and superconducting quantum processors, confirming its effectiveness and demonstrating its potential for solving more realistic, constrained problems.  The method uses a cascade of CNOT gates for the parity check, making it suitable for NISQ devices. The results showcase a promising path towards achieving quantum advantage in the NISQ era by directly incorporating hard constraints into the algorithm.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "aIuByRyHhV/podcast.wav"}
