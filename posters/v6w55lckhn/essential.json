Existing NAS methods don't consider the varying carbon intensity across different geographical locations and time periods. This results in high energy and carbon consumption, hindering sustainable AI development.  \n\nThe proposed CE-NAS framework tackles this issue by dynamically allocating GPU resources based on predicted carbon emissions. **It leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the balance between energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation of model architectures**. CE-NAS integrates a time-series transformer to predict carbon intensity and a multi-objective optimizer to reduce the search space. The results demonstrate that CE-NAS significantly reduces carbon emissions while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on various image classification benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "v6W55lCkhN/podcast.wav"}
