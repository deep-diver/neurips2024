{"importance": "This paper is important because it presents a novel and flexible online selection rule called II-COS that effectively manages both individual and interactive constraints simultaneously.  This addresses a crucial gap in real-time decision-making, particularly in big data applications like online recruitment and recommendation systems. **The theoretical guarantees and extensive empirical evaluations make II-COS a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners**. It opens new avenues for research into more sophisticated constraint handling and adaptive online selection methods.", "summary": "II-COS: a novel online sample selection method effectively controls individual and interactive constraints in real-time via predictive inference, improving efficiency and addressing various practical limitations.", "takeaways": ["II-COS efficiently handles both individual and interactive constraints in online sample selection.", "Predictive inference is used to quantify uncertainty and guide efficient sample selection.", "Theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate II-COS's effectiveness."], "tldr": "Real-time decision-making under constraints is crucial for many applications, such as online recruitment and recommendation systems. Existing methods often struggle with managing multiple constraints or lack theoretical guarantees. This paper introduces II-COS, a novel online sample selection rule.  It addresses this by incorporating two types of constraints: individual (e.g., cost and FSR) and interactive (e.g., diversity).  The method uses predictive inference to assess the uncertainty in response predictions.\nII-COS achieves simultaneous control of both individual and interactive constraints with theoretical guarantees. This is demonstrated through simulations and real-world applications, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods in scenarios with diverse constraints.  **The II-COS framework is flexible, model-agnostic, and provides valuable tools for real-time decision-making under diverse practical limitations.**", "affiliation": "Nankai University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wblxm5zdkE/podcast.wav"}
