It shows the FID (Frechet Inception Distance), IS (Inception Score), and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) scores for several methods, including the proposed HiCo model. Lower FID and LPIPS scores, and higher IS scores, generally indicate better image quality and perceptual similarity to real images.", "section": "4.3.2 Fine-Grained Open-ended Text2Img Generation"}, {"figure_path": "i9QpRjUAhv/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative comparison of spatial location dimensions on HiCo-7K.

The metrics used are LocalCLIP Score (measuring the consistency between generated objects and their textual descriptions), LocalIoU Score (measuring the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes), and standard object detection metrics like AR, AP, AP50, and AP75.
