Subfigure (a) displays the density of noisy instances in a 2D feature space defined by the loss and renormed entropy (Er). Subfigure (b) shows the sampling probabilities assigned by the SS sampler to the same instances. The comparison reveals that SS accurately identifies noisy instances (primarily located in areas with high loss and low Er) and significantly reduces their sampling probability.", "section": "4.1 CIFAR Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "MLhZ8ZNOEk/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visualization of the sampler searched on ImageNet ILSVRC12: (a) The cropped images (in yellow boxes) with the least sampling probability in the sampler from SS.

Panel (a) shows example image crops that were assigned the lowest sampling probabilities by the learned sampler. These crops often contain irrelevant objects or are poorly positioned. Panel (b) presents a plot showing the relationship between the sampling probability and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the loss values for different ResNet model sizes.  The plot demonstrates how the sampler prioritizes training examples with intermediate loss values, avoiding both easy and extremely difficult examples.", "section": "4.2 ImageNet Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "MLhZ8ZNOEk/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Verification of the efficiency of BO and the effectiveness of cgf in smoothing the OF.
