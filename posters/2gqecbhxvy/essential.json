Existing data-driven approaches often lack theoretical grounding, hindering the development of more efficient and robust algorithms. This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on a specific family of regularizers, namely, gauges of star-shaped bodies. These regularizers are both expressive enough to represent various types of regularizers and sufficiently tractable for rigorous analysis. \nThe authors leverage tools from star geometry to develop a framework for analyzing the geometry of regularizers learned from data. They show that optimizing critic-based loss functions, derived from variational representations of statistical distances, is equivalent to solving a dual mixed volume problem. This allows the derivation of exact expressions for the optimal regularizer in certain cases, providing valuable insights into the structure of regularizers learned via these critic-based losses. Furthermore, they identify neural network architectures which induce these star-shaped regularizers and discuss the useful optimization properties they enjoy.", "affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2GQeCbhxVy/podcast.wav"}
