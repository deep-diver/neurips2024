Recent works along these lines learn task-dependent regularizers. This is done by integrating information about the measurements and ground-truth data in an unsupervised, critic-based loss function, where the regularizer attributes low values to likely data and high values to unlikely data. However, there is little theory about the structure of regularizers learned via this process and how it relates to the two data distributions. To make progress on this challenge, we initiate a study of optimizing critic-based loss functions to learn regularizers over a particular family of regularizers: gauges (or Minkowski functionals) of star-shaped bodies. This family contains regularizers that are commonly employed in practice and shares properties with regularizers parameterized by deep neural networks. We specifically investigate critic-based losses derived from variational representations of statistical distances between probability measures. By leveraging tools from star geometry and dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we illustrate how these losses can be interpreted as dual mixed volumes that depend on the data distribution. This allows us to derive exact expressions for the optimal regularizer in certain cases. Finally, we identify which neural network architectures give rise to such star body gauges and when such regularizers have favorable properties for optimization.

Well-known examples of hand-crafted regularizers to promote structure include the $\\ell_{1}$ -norm to promote sparsity [23, 16, 26, 88], total variation [74], the nuclear norm [29, 15, 70], and more generally, atomic norms [18, 12, 87, 78, 64].

Our analysis focused on learning approaches that optimize a critic-based loss function derived from variational representations of probability measures. Utilizing tools from dual Brunn-Minkowski theory and star geometry, we precisely characterized the optimal regularizer in specific cases and provided visual examples to illustrate our findings. Overall, our work underscores the utility of star geometry in enhancing our understanding of data-driven regularization. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and future work: There are numerous exciting directions for future research. While our analysis concentrated on formulations based on the Wasserstein distance and $\\alpha$ -divergence, it would be valuable to extend the analysis to other critic-based losses for learning regularizers. Additionally, it would be interesting to give a precise characterization of global minimizers for the Hellinger-inspired loss (5). Relaxing the assumptions in our results is another significant challenge. For instance, Theorem 2.4 hinges on a \u201ccontainment\u201d property of the distributions, and finding ways to relax this assumption could broaden the applicability of our theory. Moreover, many of our results assume a certain regularity in the densities of our distributions. Addressing this would involve extending dual mixed volume inequalities to operate on star-shaped sets rather than star bodies. Finally, it is crucial to assess the performance of these regularizers in solving inverse problems. This includes studying questions regarding sample complexity, algorithmic properties, robustness to noise, variations in the forward model, and scenarios with limited clean data [22, 45, 32, 51, 85, 86, 21, 31].

Early approaches in this area leveraged \u201cpush-forward\u201d generators such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [35] and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [46]. In some cases, generative models can serve as traditional regularizers by providing access to likelihoods, which can be incorporated as penalty functions into the objective [8]. Alternatively, they can constrain reconstructions to lie on the natural image manifold, ensuring that solutions are realistic and consistent with the underlying data distribution.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
