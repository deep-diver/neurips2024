In the pursuit of achieving efficient learning in RL, most existing works [e.g., 21, 42, 15, 23, 14, 50, 46, 17, 58, 25] adopt the (approximate) realizability assumption. This assumption allows the learner to have access to a function class that (approximately) captures the underlying model, optimal policy, or optimal value function, contingent upon the specific algorithm type in use. However, justifying the complexity of such a function class, with the capacity to represent the underlying model, optimal policy, or optimal value function, has remained largely unaddressed in these works. To the best of our knowledge, two exceptions are the works of [13] and [62], which consider the representation complexity in RL. As mentioned earlier, by using the number of linear pieces of piecewise linear functions and circuit complexity as metrics, these two works reveal that the representation complexity of the optimal value function surpasses that of the underlying model. Compared with these two works, our work also demonstrates the separation between model-based RL and value-based from multiple angles, including circuit complexity, time complexity, and the expressive power of MLP, where the last perspective seems completely new in the RL theory literature. Moreover, our result demonstrates a more significant separation between model-based RL and value-based RL. In addition, we also study the representation complexity of policy-based RL, providing a potential hierarchy among model-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL from the above perspectives.

Consequently, our findings do not contradict previous classical results and cannot be directly compared to them.

In the domain of RL, there are distinct paradigms that guide the learning process: model-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL, each with its unique approach. In model-based RL, the primary objective of the learner is to estimate the underlying model of the environment and subsequently enhance the policy based on this estimated model. Most work in tabular RL [e.g., 19, 5, 55, 57, 56] fall within this category \u2014 they estimate the reward model and transition kernel using the empirical means and update the policy by performing the value iteration on the estimated model. Additionally, some works extend this approach to RL with linear function approximation [4, 61] and general function approximation [42, 17, 58, 51]. Policy-based RL, in contrast, uses direct policy updates to improve the agent\u2019s performance. Typical algorithms such as policy gradient [44], natural policy gradient [26], proximal policy optimization [38] fall into this category. A long line of works proposes policy-based algorithms with provable convergence guarantees and sample efficiency. See e.g., [33, 1, 2, 8, 39, 59, 9, 49, 48, 29, 60, 34, 40] and references therein. In value-based RL, the focus shifts to the approximation of the value function, and policy updates are driven by the estimated value function. A plethora of provable value-based algorithms exists, spanning tabular RL [22], linear RL [53, 24], and beyond [21, 14, 23, 58, 10, 35].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
