Existing tokenized graph Transformers often overlook valuable information from nodes with low similarity scores, hindering optimal representation learning.  This limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies within graphs, especially in datasets with heterophily (where connected nodes have dissimilar labels). \nGCFormer tackles this by introducing a hybrid token generator that creates both positive and negative token sequences. This method ensures that information from diverse nodes, regardless of similarity, is incorporated.  A tailored Transformer-based backbone then processes these sequences, and contrastive learning further enhances representation learning by maximizing the distinction between positive and negative sequences.  Extensive experiments across various graph datasets demonstrate that GCFormer significantly improves node classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "u6FuiKzT1K/podcast.wav"}
