This paper introduces new algorithms that significantly accelerate convergence in distributed optimization by cleverly using variance reduction and enhanced majority voting.", "takeaways": ["Sign-based Stochastic Variance Reduction (SSVR) improves the convergence rate of signSGD to O(d^(1/2)T^(-1/3)) for stochastic problems and O(m^(1/4)d^(1/2)T^(-1/2)) for finite-sum problems.", "SSVR, combined with heterogeneous majority voting, achieves superior convergence rates, outperforming previous methods in distributed settings with non-uniform data distributions.", "Extensive numerical experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, validating theoretical improvements."], "tldr": "Training large machine learning models efficiently is a major challenge, especially in distributed settings where communication bandwidth is limited.  Traditional methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be slow and communication-intensive.  SignSGD offers a communication-efficient alternative by transmitting only the sign of gradients, but its convergence rate can still be slow. Variance reduction techniques offer one path to improved convergence speed, but haven't been effectively combined with SignSGD previously.  \nThis research tackles these limitations by proposing novel sign-based algorithms incorporating variance reduction. These methods significantly improve convergence rates in both centralized (single machine) and distributed settings, handling both the standard stochastic optimization and finite-sum scenarios.  The improved convergence speed is achieved through innovative variance reduction estimators combined with the use of gradient signs for parameter updates and a refined approach to majority voting in distributed settings.  The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive experimental evaluation on various machine learning tasks.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "uaNZvF1VFe/podcast.wav"}
