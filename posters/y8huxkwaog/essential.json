Current methods often focus on finding just one optimal subset of variables, limiting insights and potentially leading to misleading conclusions.  Existing approaches also struggle to scale efficiently to high-dimensional data. This paper addresses these limitations. \nThe paper introduces ChronoEpilogi, a novel algorithm that efficiently discovers *all* minimal-size subsets of variables that optimally predict a target variable.  It handles hundreds of variables effectively, significantly reducing model complexity.  The algorithm is rigorously proven sound and complete under mild assumptions, and experiments confirm its efficiency and accuracy on both real-world and synthetic datasets.  The multiple solutions provided allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the data and reduced risk of making flawed predictions.", "affiliation": "University of Cergy Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "y8HUXkwAOg/podcast.wav"}
