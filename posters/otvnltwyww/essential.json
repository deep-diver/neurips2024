This paper provides a theoretical framework and empirical evidence demonstrating that self-correction arises from in-context alignment, revealing the roles of key transformer components. ", "takeaways": ["Self-correction in LLMs emerges from in-context alignment.", "Softmax attention, multi-head attention, and MLP blocks are crucial for self-correction.", "Checking-as-Context (CaC) effectively mitigates social bias and defends against LLM jailbreaks."], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a human-like capacity for self-improvement through self-correction; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.  Existing research on self-correction in LLMs often lacks a theoretical grounding and utilizes oversimplified models. This presents a challenge in understanding how self-correction emerges in realistic LLM architectures, hindering the development of effective strategies to enhance and control this behavior. \nThis research paper addresses this gap by providing a theoretical analysis of self-correction from an in-context learning perspective. It demonstrates that self-correction can be viewed as a form of in-context alignment and shows how key components of LLMs (softmax attention, multi-head attention, and MLP blocks) contribute to this ability. The findings are validated through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, and a novel self-correction strategy, 'Checking as Context' (CaC), is introduced, showcasing its efficacy in reducing social bias and mitigating LLM jailbreaks.  These findings provide crucial insights for developing more robust, aligned, and trustworthy LLMs.", "affiliation": "MIT CSAIL", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "OtvNLTWYww/podcast.wav"}
