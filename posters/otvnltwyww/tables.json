The defense methods include no defense, Self-reminder [80], RAIN [40], ICD [78], and the proposed CaC method. The table shows the ASR for each attack and defense method on two different language models: Vicuna and Llama2.

It compares the ASR when no defense is used, and when different defense mechanisms are employed: Self-reminder, RAIN (from a prior publication), ICD, and three versions of the Checking-as-Context (CaC) approach.
