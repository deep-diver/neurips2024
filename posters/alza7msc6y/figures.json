The nodes in the tree represent subsets of a larger set, and the partition respects the hierarchical relationships within the tree.  Children of the same node are grouped together in the same subset of the partition.  This example demonstrates that partitions with a hierarchical structure, like those arising from ordered trees, can have subexponentially sized collections, making them a relevant class to study for model selection in the context of the paper's analysis.", "section": "4 The Case of Hidden Subgroups with Subexponential Size"}, {"figure_path": "aLzA7MSc6Y/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Regret of EMC (Algorithm 1) and of ESTC proposed in [23], in cases of sparsity, non-crossing partitions, and non-nesting partitions.", "description": "This figure compares the cumulative regret of the proposed Explore Models then Commit (EMC) algorithm (Algorithm 1) with the ESTC algorithm from [23] across three different scenarios: sparsity, non-crossing partitions, and non-nesting partitions.
