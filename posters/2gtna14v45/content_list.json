Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These techniques are later verified to significantly improve the generation quality. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multisubject generation and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a $4\\times$ faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid increasing the inference time. Furthermore, our method can be naturally utilized to pre-train a consistent subject generation network from scratch, which will implement this research task into more practical applications.

Designers can simply describe a subject (e.g. a character, an object, an art style) that they desire and then obtain high-quality images of the subject. However, relying on the random sampling, diffusion models fail to maintain a consistent appearance of the subject across the generated images. Taking Fig. 1(a) as an example, ordinary diffusion models denoise a random noise from the noise space to a clean latent code guided by the given prompt, where the clean code corresponds to a salient image in the image space. As shown, if given 4 different prompts of the same subject \u201chobbit\u201d and random noises, ordinary models will generate 4 hobbits with different identities.

As diffusion models prevail, many works try to harness the diffusion models to generate consistent content through the following paths. Personalization [8, 33, 42, 39] learns to represent a new subject from several given images and thus generates images of that. Storybook visualization [23, 30] manages to generate consistent characters throughout a story. However, they require external data to function, either a given image set or a specific storybook dataset. Such a requirement not only complicates practical usage, but also limits the ability to illustrating imaginary, fictional or novel subjects. More recently, consistent subject generation [4] is first proposed to generate consistent images of the same subject only driven by prompts. Thus, artists can easily describe the subject and start their creation, which is a more intuitive manner. Despite the pioneering work, their repetitive tuning process of the backbone model leads to expensive computation cost and possible quality degradation. Later, a tuning-free approach [37] equips the backbone model with handicraft modules to eliminate the tuning process. Yet, the extra modules double the inference time and exhibit inefficiency when generating a large number of images.

Motivated by this, we believe all the ordinary model needs is a learned semantic guidance to tame its internal potential. To this end, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed as OneActor. We start from the insight that in the latent space of a pre-trained diffusion model, samples of different subjects form different clusters [4, 41], i.e. base cluster. In a specific base cluster, samples that share common appearance gather into the same sub-cluster, i.e. identity sub-cluster. In the latent space of Fig. 1, for example, a \u201chobbit\u201d base cluster contains four different identity sub-clusters. Ordinary generations spread out into four different sub-clusters, causing subject inconsistency. While in our paradigm of Fig. 1(b), users first choose one satisfactory image from the generated proposals as the target. Then after a quick tuning, our OneActor quickly learns to find the denoising trajectories towards the target sub-cluster, generating images of the same subject.

Apart from the tuning-based methods above, encoder-based methods [9, 5, 2, 42, 39] carefully encode the given subject into a representation and manage to avoid user-tuning. While multi-concept composition [19, 6] goes a step further to display multiple custom subjects on the same generated image via specially designed attention mechanisms.

The semantic control starts from classifierfree guidance [14], which first proposes a text-conditioned denoising network to perform text-to-image generation. It entangles the semantic and latent space so the prompt can guide the denoising trajectory towards the expected destination. Since then, many works manage to manipulate the semantic space to accomplish various tasks. For personalization, they either learn an extra semantic token to guide the latent to the subject cluster [8] or push the token embedding to its core distribution to alleviate the overfitting [45]. For image editing, they calculate a residual semantic embedding to indicate the editing direction [27, 24]. Besides, previous works [40, 21] utilize the semantic interpolation of two conditional embeddings for a mixed visual effect. These works repeatedly confirm that solely manipulating the semantic space is an effective way to harness diffusion models for various goals.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
