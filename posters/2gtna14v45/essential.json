Existing methods often rely on external data or require extensive model tuning, which is computationally expensive. This paper introduces OneActor, a novel one-shot tuning paradigm that addresses these limitations by leveraging a learned semantic guidance. Instead of tuning the entire model, OneActor efficiently guides the generation process towards a consistent subject appearance using only prompts.\nOneActor formalizes consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, creating a cluster-conditioned model.  To mitigate overfitting, it augments tuning with auxiliary samples and employs semantic interpolation and cluster guidance techniques.  Experimental results demonstrate that OneActor outperforms existing methods in terms of subject consistency, prompt conformity, and image quality while achieving a 4x faster tuning speed and minimal inference time increase.  Furthermore, OneActor's flexibility makes it adaptable to multi-subject generation and various diffusion model extensions.", "affiliation": "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2gtNa14V45/podcast.wav"}
