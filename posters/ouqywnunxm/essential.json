However, traditional REC algorithms suffer from extremely long encoding times, limiting their practical use.  Existing acceleration methods also have limited applicability to specific settings.\nThis research introduces a novel REC scheme that leverages **space partitioning** to greatly reduce encoding time.  The method involves dividing the search space into bins, enabling more targeted and efficient sample generation for encoding. Experiments using synthetic data and real-world image compression datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, achieving **significant runtime improvements and bitrate reductions** compared to existing techniques.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "OuQYWNuNxm/podcast.wav"}
