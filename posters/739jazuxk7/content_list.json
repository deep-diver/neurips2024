Augmentation-based methods like Pointmixup [6] and PointCutMix [59], though adapted for multi-domain learning, exhibit limited performance in multi-task generalization. Despite incorporating task-specific heads, these methods still fall short compared to our unified model, which excels across all tasks due to our Automatic Prototype Mixture (APM) and Gaussian Splatted Feature Shifting (GSFS) modules. While PIC [11] performs well in multi-task scenarios, its transferability is limited, often failing with changing target data. Our PCoTTA addresses this by aligning the target data with source prototypes and dynamically updating learnable prototypes at test time, effectively narrowing the domain gap.

While these methods handle continuously changing targets, they struggle with multi-task aspect in our challenging setting. Even when equipped with multi-task capabilities, these methods still underperform compared to our PCoTTA. Our success is attributed to three main factors: (1) Usually, these methods heavily rely on the student-teacher architecture to realize consistency regularization. As a result, they would inevitably introduce pseudo-label noise, leading to error accumulation. Although they use symmetric cross-entropy or other techniques to alleviate the pseudo-label noise, such problems still exist and cannot be fundamentally addressed. In contrast, our PCoTTA framework does not use any online or offline pseudo-labeling techniques, which inherently avoids the risk of error accumulation. (2) These methods are specifically designed for CoTTA in 2D images and perform well on 2D images. However, compared to 2D images, 3D point cloud data is disordered, unstructured, and sparsely distributed, making these 2D image-based CoTTA methods less effective or even inapplicable. Our method involves specific designs for 3D point cloud data, e.g., Gaussian Splatted-based Graph Attention for comprehensive, patch similarity-based adaptation, well-suited for 3D data, and achieves better performances than these methods. (3) These methods often focus on single tasks and all lack specialized design in multi-task learning, which may lead to gradient conflicts in the optimization process of continual test-time adaptation. Instead, our PCoTTA devises task-specific prototype banks where individual source-learnable prototype pairs are used for different adaptations in each task, thus favoring the multi-task learning in our setting.

By adding GSFS, we achieve better performance. This is because Model B uses the similarity between targets and prototypes as weights during aggregation, and meanwhile, our attention mechanism in GSFS also enables dynamic updating of these weights, offering greater weights to prototypes closer to the current sample. Finally, adding CPR (Ours) enables the prototype bank\u2019s learnable prototypes to be more distinct, achieving the best performance.

We choose 5 representative methods in point cloud learning, i.e., PointNet [34], DGCNN [47], PCT [15], Pointmixup [6], and PointCutMix [59], reproducing them for multi-task multi-domain learning. In this setting, these methods share a backbone network while incorporating independent taskspecific heads designed for different tasks. To ensure a fair comparison, we also devise a multi-task learning framework for these compared methods utilizing a shared backbone network and head to simultaneously learn all 3 tasks in a unified model. Aligning with our method, we replicate the augmentation-based methods Pointmixup and PointCutMix as a domain adaptation model, where each sample is mixed with another sample from a randomly selected source domain. The rest methods are trained directly on multiple different sources. (2) In-Context Learning (ICL) Methods. We select PIC [11] which handles multi-task point cloud learning but lacks domain adaptation capability. In our benchmark, we treat all sources as an expanded dataset for PIC training, allowing it to integrate multi-domain information. During the testing stage, we transfer the trained model to the target domain for inference, thus enabling multi-domain learning. Following PIC, we evaluate its baseline that utilizes the prompt target point cloud for prediction. (3) Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CoTTA) Methods. We implement several advanced CoTTA methods, utilizing PIC as the backbone network, including AdaBN [23], TENT [43], CoTTA [45], ViDA [25], RMT [10], and SANTA [4]. For teacher-student model-based 2D CoTTA methods, we replace test-time augmentations for 2D images like resizing and filpping with typical 3D data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and scaling. We follow the official settings of forward times for teacher model training. Furthermore, given the Chamfer Distance (CD) loss is used in our point cloud understanding tasks (essentially regression tasks), we optimize the teacher-student model using the typical CD loss as a consistency loss instead of a cross-entropy loss which is typically used in classification tasks, to keep consistency. To ensure fairness in reproduction, we update the LayerNorm parameters for Transformer-based models, like AdaBN, TENT, and SANTA. All methods (including ours) conduct 3 independent evaluation rounds, with samples shuffled randomly in each round.

For CoTTA methods, following CoTTA [45], we adopt multiple continual adaptation rounds. Regarding other methods, we conduct three individual evaluations for comparison. Notably, our method consistently surpasses all others by a large margin, demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks among multiple domains. Our unified model adeptly bridges the gaps between the source and target domains at test time even when the targets are continually changing, showing strong adaptation capabilities in this challenging multi-domain multi-task setting.

Conventional point cloud learning methods like PointNet [34], DGCNN [47], and PCT [15], often face challenges in generalizing to unseen data, leading to significant performance drops. On the other hand, we enable augmentation-based methods, such as Pointmixup [6] and PointCutMix [59], multi-domain learning by mixing samples from different sources. However, they still exhibit limited performance in multi-task generalization. Notably, despite incorporating individual heads for these methods to handle diverse tasks in a task-specific scheme, they still fall short compared to our method which excels across all tasks. Meanwhile, they also demonstrate inferior performance with a shared network in a multi-task scheme, whereas our PCoTTA is a fully unified model that effectively bridges domain gaps in the multi-task and multi-domain setting. This success is largely due to our proposed APM to estimate the prototype bank generalized across sources and targets, and GSFS to adaptively align the testing sample toward source domains.

ICL methods such as PIC [11] excel in multi-task scenarios using a unified model, but their generalization across various domains is limited. They struggle with unseen data, often failing to perform the specified task well using the prompts provided in existing source domains. In contrast, our PCoTTA effectively tackles this challenge by aligning test data features with familiar source prototypes and dynamically updated learnable prototypes. By utilizing the most similar source sample as the prompt pair, our method effectively narrows the gap between source and target domains, enabling our unified model to enjoy multi-domain generalizability. In addition, to simulate a continuously changing target domain, we performed three independent validations of the compared methods (each time the test target domain would be shuffled), showing a fluctuating performance. Conversely, our method demonstrates strong continuous online learning abilities to attain progressively improved results, thereby verifying the capability of our method in alleviating catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation.

To ensure a fair comparison, we adjusted these methods with using PIC as their backbone, equipping them with multi-tasking and multi-domain learning capabilities. As shown in Table 1, our method still outperforms them significantly, consistently demonstrating the ability of our method to continue learning across multiple validation rounds. This success highlights the effectiveness of our feature shifting module (GSFS), which uses Gaussian Splatted Graph Attention to dynamically align unseen samples closer to both the source and learnable prototypes with adaptive weights, enabling our model to handle unfamiliar targets effectively.
