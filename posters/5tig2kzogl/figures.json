For exact settings and further discussion see Sec. 5.1.", "description": "This figure compares the mean squared error (MSE) performance of Nadaraya-Watson (NW) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) estimators using different kernel choices for compression using Kernel Thinning.  For NW, three kernels were tested:  `k(x1, x2)` (using only the input features),  `k((x1\u2295y1),(x2\u2295y2))` (concatenating input features and response variable), and  `kNW((x1,y1),(x2,y2))` (the proposed kernel in equation 14 combining  `k(x1,x2)` and `k(x1,x2)y1y2`).  For KRR, the same three kernels were compared, except the proposed kernel is equation 15: `k\u00b2(x1,x2) + k(x1,x2)y1y2`. The x-axis shows the input sample size (n), while the y-axis presents the MSE.  The results indicate that the proposed kernels (`kNW` and `kRR`) significantly outperform the base kernels.", "section": "3.3 Supervised kernel thinning"}, {"figure_path": "5tIG2KZogL/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Simulated data.", "description": "This figure displays simulated data generated for the simulation studies in Section 5.1.
