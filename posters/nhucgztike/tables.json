Iteratively telescoping out the updates using fe, (x) improves upon the lazy approximation around the initialization by orders of magnitude.", "description": "This figure compares the approximation error of two models: the telescoping model and a linear model linearized around initialization. It shows that iteratively using the telescoping model significantly improves the approximation compared to using just the linear model. The improvement is substantial, especially in later optimization steps.", "section": "D.1 Additional results on approximation quality (supplementing Fig. 2)"}]
