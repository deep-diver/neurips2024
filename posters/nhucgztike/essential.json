Existing methods for analyzing neural networks, such as those based on tangent kernels, often fail to capture the dynamic complexities during training. This lack of understanding poses significant challenges for advancing deep learning research and engineering robust models. \nThis paper introduces a new \"telescoping model\" to overcome these issues.  By incrementally approximating neural network training as a sequence of first-order updates, the model provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the entire learning process.  Using this model, the researchers gained new empirical insights into double descent, grokking, and gradient boosting, revealing unexpected connections between these phenomena and offering valuable insights for improved model design and optimization.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "NhucGZtikE/podcast.wav"}
