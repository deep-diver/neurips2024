However, obtaining sufficient clean data to effectively train prior distributions, such as diffusion models, can be extremely difficult.  Existing methods for training diffusion models typically require large amounts of high-quality data, limiting their applicability in many real-world situations where data is scarce or noisy.\nThis paper introduces a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to effectively train diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations. Unlike previous methods, this approach generates proper diffusion models crucial for downstream applications.  Additionally, the paper proposes an improved posterior sampling method, enhancing the accuracy of inference results. Through experiments using various datasets, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing its ability to generate high-quality results even with limited and noisy data.  **The core contribution is a practical and efficient method to train diffusion models in data-scarce environments.**", "affiliation": "University of Li\u00e8ge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7v88Fh6iSM/podcast.wav"}
