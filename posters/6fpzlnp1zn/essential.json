Traditional methods often struggle with these, and robust average cost MDPs are designed to handle such complexities. However, finding efficient and reliable algorithms for robust average-cost MDPs is challenging. Existing approaches often lack guarantees of convergence to the globally optimal solution.\nThis paper introduces a robust policy mirror descent algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm cleverly handles the non-differentiability inherent in robust average cost MDPs using a sub-gradient approach and guarantees global convergence.  The authors prove that it converges linearly with increasing step size and with a complexity of O(1/\u03b5) for constant step sizes.  Simulation results demonstrate the method's effectiveness on various benchmark problems.", "affiliation": "University at Buffalo", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6FPZLnp1Zn/podcast.wav"}
