An MDP consists of a set of states, a set of actions, a transition kernel describing the dynamics of the environment, and a cost function of state-action pairs. The agents aim to minimize the cumulative cost obtained over time under a given transition kernel. However, real-world environments often exhibit uncertainties and non-stationarity that challenge the assumptions of traditional RL approaches. When there is a mismatch between the training environment and the real environment, minimizing the cumulative cost under the training environment may lead to poor performance under the real environment.

The average cost MDPs offer several advantages over discounted cost MDPs, including better stability and applicability to infinite-horizon tasks. However, achieving robust and efficient learning in average cost settings remains a significant challenge. Since the cost is discounted exponentially with time in discounted cost MDPs, establishing a contraction only requires a discount factor strictly less than one. Compared with discounted cost MDPs, average cost MDPs depend on the long-term performance of the underlying MDPs as it assigns equal weight to both immediate and future costs. Research on robust average cost MDPs is relatively scarce in the existing literature, with only a few notable studies, such as those by [36, 22, 39, 40, 12].

Therefore, in this paper, we first develop the Fr\u00e9chet sub-gradient of the robust average cost with general uncertainty sets, which serves as a foundation of the policy-based algorithm. The robust policy gradient under the discounted setting was derived in [42, 21].

In both [48] and [45], the authors show that the projected gradient descent converges to a global optimum with a less iteration complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ . For average cost MDPs, [18] presents a sublinear convergence bound for projected gradient descent, where the bound involves the parameter that characterizes the complexity of the underlying MDP. In all the above works, the convergence analysis depends on the smoothness of the value function. However, since the smoothness may not hold for the robust value function, the methodologies applied in [1, 48, 45, 18] can not be extended to our case. The policy mirror descent with increasing step size was shown to achieve linear convergence in [45]. The policy mirror descent with constant step size was also proved to converge with iteration complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ for discounted cost MDPs in [45].

In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n\u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "3.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
