The non-private lower bound on E(\u03b8 \u2013 Eh(X1, ..., Xk))2 for all unbiased is Var(Un), which our private algorithms nearly match.", "description": "This table compares the private and non-private error rates of different algorithms for estimating U-statistics, including a naive approach, an all-tuples approach, the main algorithm proposed in the paper, and lower bounds for private algorithms.  It shows that the main algorithm achieves nearly optimal private error for non-degenerate U-statistics, matching the non-private lower bound (Var(Un)). The table also provides results for bounded, degenerate kernels, indicating near-optimality in that case as well. The comparison highlights the sub-optimality of simpler methods when applied directly to private U-statistic estimation.", "section": "Lower Bounds and Application of Off-the-shelf Tools"}]
