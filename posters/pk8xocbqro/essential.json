Existing methods often struggle to handle these challenges effectively, leading to suboptimal estimation of target networks.  This research addresses this problem by focusing on latent variable network models, leveraging information from related source networks to enhance the estimation of target networks. \nThe proposed approach utilizes a novel algorithm that leverages the ordering of a suitably defined graph distance. This algorithm achieves vanishing error under specific conditions and does not rely on restrictive assumptions about the network structures.  Furthermore, this paper provides a minimax lower bound and demonstrates that a simpler algorithm attains this rate in the specific case of stochastic block models. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using simulations and real-world datasets, showing significant performance gains over existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PK8xOCBQRO/podcast.wav"}
