The highest absolute value in each group is reported in bold.", "description": "This table presents the Pearson correlation coefficients between the non-linearity signature (a novel metric proposed in the paper to quantify the non-linearity of deep neural networks) and several other commonly used metrics for evaluating deep neural networks.  These metrics include Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Frobenius norm (NORM), sparsity, entropy, and R-squared (R2). The table shows the correlation for various families of deep neural network architectures, including VGGs, ResNets, DenseNets, MNASNets, EfficientNets, ViTs, Swins, and Convnexts. The highest absolute correlation value for each metric across all architecture families is highlighted in bold, providing insights into which metrics have the strongest relationships with the proposed non-linearity signature.", "section": "Uniqueness of the affinity score"}, {"figure_path": "lTUXlmjcva/tables/tables_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Pearson correlations between the affinity score and other metrics, for all the architectures evaluated in this study.

The goal is to demonstrate the uniqueness of the affinity score by showing that no other single metric consistently captures the same information about the models' characteristics.  A strong correlation with the affinity score would suggest that another metric captures similar information about the models' non-linearity.", "section": "G Detailed comparisons between architectures"}]
