It adds Laplace noise to each query and checks if it exceeds the noisy threshold. If so, it outputs T and halts; otherwise, it outputs 1 and continues to the next query. This algorithm is used to ensure differential privacy.", "section": "C Additional Preliminaries"}, {"figure_path": "Cqr6E81iB7/figures/figures_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Algorithm 7: DP-OPE against adaptive adversaries", "description": "This algorithm addresses the online prediction from experts (OPE) problem with differential privacy against strong adaptive adversaries. It uses a combination of techniques, including sparse vector and report-noisy-max mechanisms, to control the privacy leakage while maintaining a sublinear regret. The algorithm iteratively samples experts, monitors their cumulative losses using a differentially private mechanism, and removes poorly performing experts. This adaptive approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and utility in the OPE setting.", "section": "F.4 Online Prediction from Experts Against Adaptive Adversaries"}]
