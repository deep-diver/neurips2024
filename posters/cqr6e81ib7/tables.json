It shows whether a finite number of mistakes is achievable and whether the hypothesis class is learnable against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries.  The results highlight the differences in learnability between pure DP and approximate DP, especially when facing adaptive adversaries, and the significant gap between private and non-private online learning.", "section": "1.1 Main Results"}]
