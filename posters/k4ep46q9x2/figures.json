[{"figure_path": "k4EP46Q9X2/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The stacked bar chart showing the distribution of the selected estimator's rank for each evaluation metric across rank intervals: [1-3], [4-11], [12-19], [20-27], and [28-36]. The greener (or redder) color indicates that the selected estimator ranks higher (or lower). For example, the dark red (or green) indicates the percentage of cases (out of 100 experiments) where the selected estimator ranks among the worst 9 estimators, specifically as ranks 28, 29, ..., or 36 (or among the best 3 estimators, specifically as ranks 1, 2, or 3).", "description": "This figure presents a stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of selected estimator ranks across different ranking intervals ([1-3], [4-11], [12-19], [20-27], [28-36]) for each evaluation metric.  The color intensity represents the frequency of a given rank within the interval. Darker green indicates higher ranking (among the best 3), while darker red signifies lower ranking (among the worst 9). This allows for a visual comparison of how frequently different selectors choose estimators of varying quality, assessing their robustness and ranking accuracy across various experimental settings.", "section": "5.2 Experimental Results"}]
