It measures the diversity using two metrics: mean base pair entropy and mean Hamming distance. The mean base pair entropy reflects the diversity of nucleotide usage at each position across the designed sequences, with a maximum value of 2 indicating maximum diversity (uniform usage of all four bases). The mean Hamming distance measures the average pairwise differences between sequences, ranging from 0 (identical sequences) to 250 (maximum possible distance for 250 bp long sequences). Higher values indicate higher sequence diversity.", "section": "5.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "F8DWffLkYG/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantifying the diversity of designs.
