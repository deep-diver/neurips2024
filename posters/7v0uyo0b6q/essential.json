{"importance": "This paper is important because it **significantly improves Thompson sampling**, a widely used algorithm in contextual bandits, by enabling the use of more expressive diffusion model priors. This **addresses limitations of Gaussian priors**, paving the way for better exploration and exploitation in online learning problems.

Thompson Sampling (TS) is a popular approach, but its efficiency is often limited by using simple Gaussian priors that can't represent complex relationships in data.  This restricts exploration and the speed of learning. \n\nThis research addresses these limitations by proposing a novel algorithm that utilizes diffusion models as priors within Thompson sampling.  The key innovation is an efficient method for approximate posterior sampling leveraging the Laplace approximation at each diffusion stage.  The resulting algorithm is computationally efficient, asymptotically consistent (meaning it gets more accurate with more data), and shows superior performance across various experiments, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on likelihood scores that tend to become unstable with large datasets.", "affiliation": "Adobe Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7v0UyO0B6q/podcast.wav"}
