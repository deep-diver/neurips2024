Each dataset contains true and false statements about a particular topic (e.g., locations of cities, Spanish-to-English translations).

The categories are unambiguous truthful reply, unambiguous lie, ambiguous truthful reply, ambiguous lie, and other.  The table shows that the TTPD classifier performs significantly better than the LR classifier for all categories except for 'other' where it was not applicable.", "section": "F More details on the real-world scenarios"}]
