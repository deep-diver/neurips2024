The excellent generative capabilities of diffusion models suggest that informative representation is learned during the generative training and strong visual priors are captured by the backbone models [9, 43, 6]. Therefore, recent work has explored leveraging the image diffusion models for image understanding tasks, including image recognition [9, 8], object detection [7, 57], segmentation [55] and correspondence mining [39].

Prior work either views the diffusion models as frozen feature extractors [9, 55, 39], or deconstructs them for new tasks while sacrificing their original generation capability [8]. One major challenge comes from their distinct training and inference processes. Diffusion models are typically optimized using corrupted inputs, optionally augmented with a single conditioning frame, to achieve unconditioned or image-conditioned generation during inference [27, 1]. In contrast, video recognition models require access to multiple frames to reason about temporal relationships and expect clean inputs during inference [49, 51, 48].

However, instead of conditioning on the same image across all video frames, we propose to condition on a random subset of frames while masking the remaining ones (see Figure 2). This simple random-frame conditioning process effectively bridges the gap between the learning processes of the two tasks. On the one hand, the generation capability of SVD is extended to handle arbitrary frame prediction, which provides more flexible and unambiguous video generation. On the other hand, conditioning on a random subset of frames allows the model to learn more discriminative and robust features for the recognition task.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
