Existing methods often lack theoretical guarantees, hindering their reliability and applicability to diverse datasets.  Moreover, accurately measuring alignment performance is also problematic, requiring careful consideration of appropriate metrics like Euclidean transport cost. \nThis paper addresses these issues by introducing a planted model for the Procrustes-Wasserstein problem.  **Information-theoretic results are derived for both high and low-dimensional regimes**, shedding light on the fundamental limits of alignment.  A novel algorithm, the 'Ping-Pong' algorithm, is proposed, which iteratively estimates the optimal orthogonal transformation and data relabeling, improving upon the state-of-the-art approach.  **Sufficient conditions for the method's success are provided**, and experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to the existing methods.", "affiliation": "DI ENS, CRNS, PSL University, INRIA Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4NGlu45uyt/podcast.wav"}
