[{"figure_path": "4NGlu45uyt/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Influence of the parameters (dimensions d, number of points n, and noise level \u03c3) on the accuracy (in terms of overlap) of three different estimators: the relaxed QAP estimator (12) projected on the set of permutation matrices (blue curve), the output of Alg. 1 (red curve), and the output of Grave et al. [2019]'s algorithm (purple curve). Each dot corresponds to averaging scores over 10 experiments. Figure 1a: \u03c3 = 0.34, n = 100. Figure 1b: \u03c3 = 0.34, d = 5. Figures 1c and 1d: n = 200, d = 2 and d = 60 respectively.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of three different algorithms for solving the Procrustes-Wasserstein problem across different parameter settings.  The x-axis of each subplot varies a different parameter (dimensionality, number of points, noise level), while the y-axis shows the overlap, a measure of alignment accuracy. The three algorithms compared are: the relaxed QAP estimator, the Ping-Pong algorithm (proposed in the paper), and the algorithm from Grave et al. (2019). The plots illustrate how the accuracy of each algorithm changes depending on the dimensionality of the data, the number of points, and the level of noise present.", "section": "3.3 Numerical experiments"}]
