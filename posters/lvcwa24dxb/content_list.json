We noted that the proposed MCFA strategy partially solved this, but a better solution could be attending to all the previous generated frames (albeit resulting in a memory and run-time complexity increase). Moreover, MOTIONCRAFT depends on the optical flow derived from physics simulations but there are some dynamics that may be difficult to simulate (e.g. the motion of a dancer), thus limiting the generality of the generated videos. However, we speculate that it might be possible to devise a generative model of optical flows conditioned on a starting frames and a prompt, while also being constrained by a physics simulator. This could readily provide inputs to MOTIONCRAFT and have the advantage of disentangling learning of motion from learning of content. A future direction could also employ a better interaction between the image generator and the physics simulator, in order to have a closed feedback-loop framework leading to more physical fidelity in the generated frames. In this work we have shown videos generated by different physical simulations, but as future work we could also combine them to generate more complex scenes with different physics mixed together.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
