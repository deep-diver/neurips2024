Traditional SQL is inflexible for these complex, semantic queries.  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential but are computationally expensive for large datasets. \n\nThis paper introduces a Universal Query Engine (UQE) that addresses these issues. UQE uses LLMs for semantic understanding and integrates sampling and compilation techniques to improve efficiency and accuracy.  The engine uses a dialect of SQL (UQL) that allows natural language query flexibility. Experiments demonstrate that UQE significantly outperforms baseline approaches on accuracy and cost across various datasets and query types, making it a significant advancement in unstructured data analytics.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "t7SGOv5W5z/podcast.wav"}
