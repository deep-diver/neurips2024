However, the precise impact of these balancing techniques on model training and performance has remained unclear. The effectiveness of such methods is often attributed to factors like preventing model collapse or improving representation quality, but these explanations are limited. This paper tackles this knowledge gap by demonstrating that data balancing offers an unexpected yet significant advantage: variance reduction.\nThe authors introduce a new theoretical framework that provides a non-asymptotic statistical bound quantifying the variance reduction effect due to data balancing. This bound connects the variance reduction to the eigenvalue decay of Markov operators that are constructed from the conditional means given X and Y. By employing this framework, they demonstrate how various forms of data balancing in contrastive multimodal learning and self-supervised clustering can be better understood, and potentially improved upon, through the lens of variance reduction.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "vJMMdFfL0A/podcast.wav"}
