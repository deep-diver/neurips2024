However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance. Project page: https://hamadichihaoui.github.io/BIRD.

In addition to their data generation capabilities, these models also provide an implicit representation of the distribution of the data they train on, which can be used for other applications, such as image restoration (IR). Indeed, several approaches have emerged to solve inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models [8, 11, 21]. Those approaches start from a random noise vector as the diffusion input and introduce a projection after each diffusion reverse step to enforce the consistency with the corrupted image. As shown by Chung [3] this procedure alters the original diffusion sampling process, and may cause the generated image to leave the data manifold during the iterative denoising process, which ultimately results in unrealistic image samples. Moreover, most of these methods are non-blind as they assume to have full knowledge of the degradation model, which is not practical in real-world applications.

In this work, we show that having a strong image prior and ensuring that the restored image never leaves the data manifold during the reconstruction process are fundamental properties to generalize to a wide range of image degradation problems. As shown in Figure 1, BIRD (see (f) to (i)) reconstructs realistic images at each iteration, while BlindDPS (see (b) to (e)) may initially reconstruct non realistic images. We observe that even though we have a more primitive blur reconstruction procedure (we directly regress the motion blur kernel), the reconstructed image is still more similar to the ground truth one (see column (l)) than the final image estimate from BlindDPS (see (e) top), which uses a quite accurate blur kernel estimate (see (e) bottom).

In contrast to prior work, we do not alter the reverse sampling, i.e., all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled.

More general methods that assume only knowledge of the type of degradation (e.g., blurring), but not the values of its parameters, are instead called blind. Some recent examples of non-blind methods are [3] and DPS [2].

Some recent examples of blind methods are GDP [6] and BlindDPS [1]. GDP leverages DDPM and solve inverse problems via hierarchical guidance and a patch-based method. BlindDPS proposes an extension of [2] to the case of blind deblurring. They train a score-based diffusion model for the blur operator. At test-time, they jointly optimize for both the sharp image and blur operator by running the reverse diffusion process. However, training a model for each new degradation operator can be time-consuming. Fast Diffusion EM [9] proposes a method for blind image deblurring. It applies the Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm after each reverse diffusion step to jointly update the image latent and blur kernel. Gibbsddrm [13] extends DDRM [8] to the blind case by adopting a Gibbs sampler to enable efficient sampling from the posterior distribution. In contrast to these works, in BIRD we introduce a blind image restoration method based on a novel diffusion inversion for DDIM. Our method is computationally efficient, as it requires only a few reverse diffusion steps, and generates realistic samples by only estimating the initial noise. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Methods based on GAN inversion. Since our proposed method is based on inverting a diffusion process, we also briefly review related work in the literature and discuss how it differs from our approach. Because Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were among the best image generation models, a number of methods [14, 15, 22, 23] inverts pre-trained GANs to solve image restoration problems. DGPGAN [14] performs the GAN inversion on a single new corrupted image. The authors shows that the inversion is not easily obtainable just with the direct optimization of the latent input to the frozen GANs model. Thus, they propose to also fine-tune the (unfrozen) GAN, while optimizing for the latent vector. [23] instead train an encoder to invert a pre-trained GANs on a dataset of corrupted images (through masking). At test time they directly apply the trained encoder and the GANs on a new corrupted image without further training. BIRD shares the aim of inverting a generative model with the above prior work. However, as demonstrated in the literature for inverting GANs models, the inversion of generative models is far from a straightforward task. Moreover, the inversion of GANs and diffusion models are fundamentally different in nature. For example, while GANs generate samples in \u201cone forward pass\u201d diffusion models require multiple (denoising) steps. Also, all IR methods based on GAN inversion either optimize the intermediate layers of the generator [4], train an auxiliary network (e.g., an encoder), or fine-tune the pre-trained GAN network. In our method, the diffusion model is not fine-tuned/trained.

Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "3.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
