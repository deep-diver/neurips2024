It evaluates the performance of various techniques across four tasks: motion deblurring, Gaussian deblurring, 8x super-resolution, and denoising.  The metrics used are PSNR (higher is better) and LPIPS (lower is better), which measure image quality and perceptual similarity, respectively.  The best and second-best performing methods for each task are highlighted.", "section": "4.

The performance of each method is evaluated using two metrics: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity). Higher PSNR values and lower LPIPS values indicate better image quality. The best-performing method for each metric and task is highlighted in bold and underlined.", "section": "4.

The step size is a hyperparameter that directly affects the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.  Smaller step sizes generally result in higher accuracy but longer processing times, while larger step sizes lead to faster processing but potentially lower accuracy. The table showcases the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) metrics, which are used to quantify the quality of the reconstructed images, along with the runtime for each step size. The results help determine an optimal step size that achieves a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.", "section": "4.4 Ablations"}]
