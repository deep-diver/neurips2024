BIRD yields always natural images at every iteration of the reconstruction procedure. Finally, notice that despite recovering a suboptimal blur kernel, the image reconstructed with BIRD is more similar to the ground truth image than with BlindDPS thanks to the robustness of our image generation procedure.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed BIRD method against the BlindDPS method on a blind image deblurring task.

Although some of the generated degraded images use Gaussian blur, BIRD recovers a generic blur kernel (without making any Gaussianity assumption).", "description": "This figure shows the results of applying the BIRD method to four different blind image restoration tasks: Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, super-resolution, and denoising.
