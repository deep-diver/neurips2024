Their performance hinges on memory set quality, causing suboptimal retrieval accuracy.  This paper addresses the limitations of MHMs by introducing Kernelized Hopfield Models (KHMs). \nKHMs address the issues through a novel framework leveraging spherical codes from information theory.  The optimal memory capacity is achieved when the memories form an optimal spherical code.  The authors propose U-Hop+, a sublinear time algorithm to reach this optimal capacity.  This approach leads to improved retrieval capability and representation learning in transformers.  The findings are further validated with empirical results.", "affiliation": "Northwestern University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4UReW4Ez6s/podcast.wav"}
