Since AdaSCP requires specific indicators with a large magnification factor, identifying candidate indicators and flitering outliers through comparison could enhance efficiency and effectiveness in defending against DataStealing. Third, the durability experiment in Appendix A.2 demonstrates that backdoors diminish after 100 rounds of continued training with clean data, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy for future work [65, 12].

It then trains and magnifies critical parameters, allowing for the seamless integration of backdoor gradients into the global model. Our extensive experiments not only confirm the efficacy of existing FL Trojan attacks and defenses but also highlight the superior performance of AdaSCP in circumventing advanced distance-based defenses. This work serves as a critical reminder of the vulnerabilities in FL and underscores the necessity for continuous advancement in defensive strategies to safeguard against evolving threats in the realm of generative models.

Recently, the defense methods against Trojan attacks have achieved great progress. These methods can be broadly categorized into two types according to their algorithms. The first type is distance-based defenses [2, 60, 17, 44, 24, 26]. They try to distinguish the malicious updates from uploaded gradients according to distance or scores and then aggregate updates that have undergone flitering. The second type of defenses [43, 42, 50] is based on differential privacy algorithm [13], which use clipping and adding noise to defense backdoor attacks. However, we notice that these techniques will lead to the diffusion model collapsing or failing to converge. Hence, we utilize several advanced distance-based methods [2, 17, 44, 24] as the defense strategies in this paper. ", "page_idx": 25}, {"type": "text", "text": "Data Reconstruction Attack. Despite only sending updates in FL, prior works have demonstrated that attackers can still obtain information about private training data through various techniques [8, 40, 47, 56, 4, 19, 61, 68, 3, 16, 66]. Membership inference attacks [8, 40, 47, 56, 4] involve determining whether a specific data sample was part of the model\u2019s training dataset by analyzing the model\u2019s outputs. However, they require a large amount of model output data for training and the original data for analysis. A more common and potentially more dangerous methods are the gradient-based reconstruction approaches. Gradient Inversion attacks [19, 61, 68, 23] in FL involve reconstructing the original training data from the gradient updates shared between clients and the server. Linear Layer Leakage (LLL) attacks [3, 16, 66] exploit the gradients of fully connected layers to infer and reconstruct the input data. Gradient-based attack methods, which rely entirely on the gradient information, are explored on deterministic models and suffer from low data recovery quality. Unlike these attack methods, our work focuses on diffusion models and can accurately and efficiently reconstruct large amounts of specified training data through numerous Trojans.

Designing better triggers may reduce the impact of the multi-backdoor attack on the FID, making the attack more covert. Some defense mechanisms, such as norm clipping or differential privacy methods, can render our indicator-based attacks ineffective. These methods compromise the indicators\u2019 effectiveness. However, such approaches are not suitable for training diffusion models, as they can easily lead to non-convergence or model collapse.
