However, single-cell sequencing technologies are inherently destructive and can only measure a limited array of data modalities simultaneously. This limitation underscores the need for new methods capable of realigning cells. Optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a potent solution, but traditional discrete solvers are hampered by scalability, privacy, and out-of-sample estimation issues. These challenges have spurred the development of neural network-based solvers, known as neural OT solvers, that parameterize OT maps. Yet, these models often lack the flexibility needed for broader life science applications. To address these deficiencies, our approach learns stochastic maps (i.e. transport plans), allows for any cost function, relaxes mass conservation constraints and integrates quadratic solvers to tackle the complex challenges posed by the (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem. Utilizing flow matching as a backbone, our method offers a flexible and effective framework. We demonstrate its versatility and robustness through applications in cell development studies, cellular drug response modeling, and cross-modality cell translation, illustrating significant potential for enhancing therapeutic strategies.

Due to the destructive nature of single-cell sequencing technologies, it is fundamental to realign distributions of sequenced cells. Discrete optimal transport (OT) has proven useful in this task. For example, it is standard practice to leverage the framework of OT to reconstruct cellular trajectories across developmental time points [72] and to study the response of cells to external perturbations like drugs or gene knockouts [18]. In these settings, both distributions, i.e. earlier and later time point and before perturbation and after perturbation, respectively, live in the same space, a setting which we refer to as linear OT. In contrast, most applications of OT in single-cell genomics require maps across (partially) incomparable spaces, the setting which we refer to as quadratic OT. For example, analysis of spatial transcriptomics datasets requires the quadratic formulation of OT as the coordinate systems of two different slices are warped and rotated, thus not living in the same coordinate space [60]. Similarly, adding spatial information as a prior has been shown to improve the performance of modeling the trajectory of cells in the discrete setting [39]. Analogously, adding information from lineage tracing readouts [89] recovers the evolution of cells more faithfully [42]. Another prevalent task in single-cell genomics which is commonly approached with quadratic OT solvers is the alignment of cells across modalities [17]. Most single-cell technologies capture only one modality, which is insufficient to obtain a comprehensive representation of the cellular state. As single-cell datasets grow larger [65], traditional OT solvers become less applicable to tasks in single-cell genomics due to their high computational complexity. Thanks to recent advancements in low-rank OT [69, 70, 71], the aforementioned OTbased algorithms are more accessible to single-cell biologists [39]. Yet, the non-parametric nature of discrete OT solvers entails issues with respect to data privacy and prevents their application to large scale single-cell atlases capturing millions of cells [65]. Moreover, out-of-samples estimation is limited to very specific scenarios [63].

To overcome these limitations, neural OT solvers have been leveraged to study cellular perturbations [7, 8, 86] and to model cellular trajectories [21, 83]. Yet, these methods estimate Monge maps, i.e., deterministic maps, contradicting the assumption that cells evolve stochastically [19]. Stochastic formulations are also favorable as they can produce a conditional distribution that can be used to quantify uncertainty [25]. In the discrete setting, stochastic maps can be obtained from entropy-regularized OT (EOT) [13]. Recently, a number of works have addressed learning EOT plans [29, 41, 76, 84, 85] in the neural setting. Yet, all of these methods are limited in the choice of the cost function, with most of them being restricted to the squared Euclidean cost. Single-cell genomics data is known to be non-Euclidean [57] and thus requires a flexible choice of the cost function in OT applications as demonstrated in the discrete OT setting in Demetci et al. [17], Huguet et al. [35], Klein et al. [39]. The third requirement for applying OT to single-cell genomics is the option to lift the mass conservation constraint, allowing for unbalanced optimal transport [11, 24, 74]. Unbalanced OT is crucial to model cellular growth and death as well as for automatically discarding outliers, which are prevalent in highly noisy measurements in single-cell genomics. Eyring et al. [20], L\u00fcbeck et al. [50], Yang and Uhler [94] proposed ways to incorporate unbalancedness into deterministic linear OT maps, while unbalanced formulations for entropic neural OT have barely been explored. The most severe shortcoming of the existing plethora of neural OT estimators is their limitation to the linear OT scenario, i.e., to learning maps within spaces. Yet, most applications in single-cell genomics require the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) [54] or the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) [88] formulation. To the best of our knowledge, the only neural formulation for GW proposed thus far learns deterministic, balanced maps for the inner product costs, using a min-max-min optimization procedure, severely limiting its applications [58].

Following the notations in $\\S\\ 3.3$ , RNA (source $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}$ ) and ATAC (target $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal{D}})$ carry the structural information, while features $\\mathbf{u}\\in\\Omega$ and $\\mathbf{v}\\in\\Omega$ are obtained from the VAE embedding. Fig. 21 shows that the additional linear penalty on the feature term helps to obtain a better alignment compared to GENOT-Q. Fig. 4 visualizes the learned fused coupling compared to GENOT trained with batch-wise independent couplings. When aligning multiple cell modalities, the proportions of cell types in the two modalities often differ (N3). We simulate this setting by removing cells belonging to certain cell types Tab. 4 shows that U-GENOT-F preserves high accuracy while learning meaningful rescaling functions.

Motivated by applications in single-cell genomics, we introduce GENOT, a versatile neural OT framework to learn cost-efficient stochastic maps, within the same space or across incomparable spaces.

As discussed in S\u00e9journ\u00e9 et al. [75], the choice of these parameters is mostly empirical.   \n\u2022 While GENOT is motivated by the extensive use of optimal transport in single-cell genomics, there is no evidence that cells evolve exactly according to an entropic OT plan.   \n\u2022 Evaluations of learnt transport plans for tasks in single-cell genomics experiments are task-specific, and do not necessarily reflect to what extent the learnt coupling is an entropic OT coupling. In effect, we rely on prior biological knowledge (CT error, Fig. 2) or on common downstream trajectory inference methods in single-cell genomics to evaluate the learnt velocity field (TSI score, Fig. 2) when computing EOT plans for trajectory inference. Similarly, we can only assess learnt EOT plan on a cluster level, and not a single data point level when studying cellular perturbations (3). For the task of modality translation (Fig. 4), we know the ground-truth coupling. Yet, the ground-truth coupling is deterministic and one-to-one, and hence is not a valid solution of an entropy-regularized Gromov-Wasserstein OT plan with $\\varepsilon>0$ .

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
