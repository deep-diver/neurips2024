Existing neural OT solvers often lack flexibility and struggle with scalability and out-of-sample estimation. Discrete OT solvers suffer from scalability and privacy issues. This paper introduces GENOT (Generative Entropic Neural Optimal Transport), a novel framework designed to address these challenges. \nGENOT learns stochastic transport maps (plans), allowing flexible cost function choices, relaxing mass conservation constraints, and integrating quadratic solvers to handle the complexities of (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problems.  It leverages flow matching for efficient computation and demonstrates improved versatility and robustness across various single-cell applications, showcasing significant potential for advancements in therapeutic strategies.  The approach is evaluated in different single-cell scenarios and surpasses existing neural OT solvers.", "affiliation": "Helmholtz Munich", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hjspWd7jvg/podcast.wav"}
