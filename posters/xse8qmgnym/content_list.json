When applying BDC, we introduce four 1D convolution layers at the end of VPose [24] to estimate parameters such as root depth, 2D pose, bone length, and binary depth. In the case of the multi-hypothesis model [45], we create four fully connected layers to estimate the same parameters: root depth, 2D pose, bone length, and binary depth. The training loss remains consistent with the losses used in the original models. Specifically, VPose [24] employs Mean Squared Error Loss (MSELoss), while the multi-hypothesis model [45] uses Mixture Density Network (MDN) loss.

The Adam optimizer is utilized with an initial learning rate of 3e-4, which decreases linearly during the training process.

Figure 6 shows that our synthesized poses occupy a significantly larger area compared to the existing dataset. However, this did not immediately translate into performance improvement; rather, it resulted in a performance decline. To identify the cause of this decline, we examined the perframe performance of the baseline model\u2019s poses in Figure 5.A. The results indicated that performance degradation occurred in most scenarios. Nonetheless, there was a promising aspect: in environments where the baseline model failed, our approach showed performance improvement. Furthermore, when integrating the BDC into the baseline model, we observed performance enhancement across almost all regions. In Figure 5.B, the visualization of the areas where performance declined after pose augmentation revealed that the results of complex poses appeared with flattened depth. This indicates that the increased pose diversity led to heightened depth ambiguity, causing predictions to average towards the center. However, by utilizing our BDC, we observed robust predictions even with increased pose diversity, indirectly mitigating depth ambiguity.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
