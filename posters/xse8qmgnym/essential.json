Existing approaches using data augmentation from limited datasets haven't fully resolved these issues.  The lack of diverse training data leads to poor generalization to real-world scenarios, while depth ambiguity reduces accuracy, especially in complex poses.\nThis paper introduces two novel techniques to overcome these limitations. The Biomechanical Pose Generator (BPG) uses biomechanical principles to create a wide array of plausible 3D poses without relying on existing datasets, addressing the data diversity issue. The Binary Depth Coordinates (BDC) simplify depth estimation into a binary classification, significantly reducing ambiguity. Experimental results demonstrate that these methods consistently improve the accuracy and robustness of HPE models, especially in challenging scenarios with high pose diversity and depth ambiguity.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "xse8QMGnyM/podcast.wav"}
