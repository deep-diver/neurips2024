Called programmatic weak supervision, a wealth of literature has shown how to aggregate rules, often called \u201clabeling functions\u201d, into individual pseudolabels that can be used to train a model [e.g., 51, 49, 63, 21]. In typical pipelines, this consists of fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network [71]. This method has met with a huge amount of empirical success in natural language processing [51, 43, 28, 36, 70] computer vision [74, 62], and verticals such as healthcare [25, 26, 20, 67].

Empirical results suggest that adversarial training has fairly limited value for improving coverage expansion and pseudolabel correction [38], and that these two effects still occur for student models that are not adversarially trained [71, 10].

There are simply some points that deterministically get the wrong labels and some points with no label.

Since each $f\\in\\mathcal F$ generates a set $U(f)\\in\\mathcal{M}$ , given a training sample $\\boldsymbol{S}$ , we can compute $f={\\mathcal{A}}(S)$ , then use our \u201ctest\u201d sample $S_{A},S_{B}$ to compute $\\hat{c}(U(f))$ . Repeating this procedure for many samples $\\boldsymbol{S}$ and choosing the smallest value approximates $\\mathrm{min}_{U\\in\\mathcal{M}}\\,\\hat{c}(U)$ . Table 1 shows the expansion measurements for different hypothesis classes on a weakly-supervised classification task inspired by the example in Section 3. Appendix 6 contains more results and a much more detailed description of the setup and process of checking expansion, but these results indicate that expansion is present and correlates with performance.

We explore training linear classifiers on top of the contrastively-fine-tuned SentenceBERT embeddings2 [52]. As shown in Muennighoff et al. [44], training simple classifiers on top of these complex pretrained representations leads to very competitive performance. We study binary sentiment prediction for movie reviews on the IMDb dataset [41], continuing with the example from Section 3. For the teacher model, we use a very coarse rule [49] based on the presence of the unigrams \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201chorrible\u201d. Let $C(w,x)$ be the number of times word $w$ appears in input $\\textbf{\\em x}$ . The weak label $\\tilde{y}(\\pmb{x})$ is 1 when $C({\\mathrm{incredible}},x)>C({\\mathrm{horrible}},x)$ , 0 when $C(\\mathrm{horrible},x)>C(\\mathrm{incredible},x)$ , and $\\mathcal{Q}$ otherwise. This counts the occurrences of \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d and assigns the binary label corresponding to the word that occurs strictly more often, and abstains otherwise.

We set $\\mathcal{N}(\\pmb{x})$ to be the examples obtainable from $\\textbf{\\em x}$ by sampling from a pretrained paraphrase model.

Our results require us to measure expansion between $(S_{i}^{g o o d},T_{i})$ , $(S_{i}^{b a d},T_{i})$ , and $(S_{i}^{b a d},S_{i}^{g o o d})$ . For x \u2208Sigoo d(resp. x \u2208Sibad), we generate a target point $\\pmb{x}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{N}(\\pmb{x})\\cap T$ by rejection sampling from a pretrained paraphrase model. Because $\\tilde{y}$ takes a simple form, we can efficiently approximate this step by setting the logits of tokens \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d to $-\\infty$ during decoding so they are never generated. For $x\\,\\in\\,S_{i}^{b a d}$ , to generate a neighbor $\\pmb{x}^{\\prime\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{N}(\\pmb{x})\\cap S_{i}^{g o o d}$ , we prompt GPT-4 to paraphrase a randomly chosen sentence from $\\pmb{x}^{\\bar{\\prime}}\\in\\mathcal{N}(\\pmb{x})\\cap T_{i}$ and include the correct word in its paraphrase, so that ${\\pmb x}^{\\prime\\prime}\\in S_{i}^{g o o d}$ .

Table 1 measures the expansion of the set family $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}(S_{i}^{g o o d},\\mathcal{F})$ on the sets $(S_{i}^{b a d},S_{i}^{g o o d})$ using the procedure from Section 5. Theorem 4.1 shows this is related to pseudolabel correction. For the SentenceBERT model, the measured expansion is high and the student fits the weak labels well, but doesn\u2019t overfit to the teacher labels (i.e., $\\mathrm{err}(f,\\tilde{y}|S_{i})>0)$ . For label 0, our bound indicates that pseudolabel correction should be present, since the value for our error bound is less than $\\alpha_{i}$ . There is indeed pseudolabel correction on this label: $\\mathrm{err}(f,y|S_{0})<\\alpha_{0}$ . For label 1, our bound indicates that pseudolabel correction may not occur\u2014the bound value is greater than $\\alpha_{i}$ since the the measured expansion is lower for this label and the error of the student on the weak labels is higher. As suggested by the bound, there is no pseudolabel correction: $\\mathrm{err}(f,y|S_{1})>\\alpha_{1}$ . Our expansion-based theory can therefore differentiate between cases where pseudolabel correction does and does not occur. Table 4 (appendix) shows the measured expansion values between the set pairs $(S_{i}^{g o o d},T_{i})$ and $(S_{i}^{b a d},T_{i})$ , which Theorem 4.2 shows are related to the amount of coverage expansion. For example, for label 1, Ti expands to both Sigood $\\!\\;\\!c=0.75)$ and to $S_{i}^{b a d}$ $(c=0.55)$ . The fact that both expansions are nonzero gives evidence for the structure assumed Theorem 4.2. In this case, our coverage expansion bounds show that the student model has nontrivial performance on the uncovered sets $T_{i}$ \u2014for example, for label 1, the worst-case value of $\\mathrm{err}(f,y|\\bar{T}_{1})$ in all the training runs is 0.29, and the value of our bound is 0.33.

Our empirical procedure for finding the worst-expanding set generated by our hypothesis class is ultimately still a heuristic, and our experiments are limited in scope. However, Sections 5 and 6 go beyond prior work by testing our assumptions more carefully. Finally, this work contains no new weak supervision algorithms (e.g., new training methods) for improving weak-to-strong generalization. While our work does not propose new weak supervision algorithms, we believe our theory suggests a framework for encouraging weak-to-strong generalization effects: find a neighborhood structure and student hypothesis class pair that expands, then find the student model $f\\in\\mathcal F$ that minimizes the error on the weak labels while staying as robust as possible on the neighborhoods. Both expansion and contrastive pre-training are related to spectral properties of the underlying neighborhood graph [22]. Can we improve the performance of weakly-supervised learning by imbuing the contrastive pretraining objective with knowledge of the pseudolabeler $\\tilde{y}?$ Burns et al. [10] show that weak-tostrong generalization effects are much stronger in classification problems than in other settings such as reward modeling. Adapting our analysis techniques to reward modeling and using our results to design algorithms for weak-to-strong reward model training are interesting directions for future work.

Unlike our work, they assume expansion with respect to the empirical sample graph and study the performance of a particular learning algorithm (label propagation). Chen et al. [13] show how to propagate weak labels using the embeddings of a strong pretrained model to provably improve performance, but they also focus on the empirical graph, and not on guarantees for the classifiers trained on the weak labels. Unlike most other work on weak supervision, which tries to give separate algorithms and guarantees for (i) the procedure for creating a pseudolabel out of multiple labeling functions and (ii) the student training, Sam and Kolter [55], R\u00fchling Cachay et al. [54] consider direct end-to-end weak supervision. However, they do not give theoretical error guarantees for the student models. Cabannnes et al. [11] give theoretical guarantees for a different flavor of weak supervision, when the \u201cteacher\u201d gives a set of labels that contains the ground-truth but may also contain other incorrect labels.

What we call \u201ccoverage expansion\u201d is very related to some work on domain adaptation that can still apply when the source and target distributions do not overlap, such as BenDavid et al. [4], Blitzer et al. [5]. Our expansion assumptions for coverage expansion, which require the expansion of certain families of sets (generated by the student hypothesis class), are qualitatively very related to the ${\\mathcal{F}}\\Delta{\\mathcal{F}}$ distance [4]. Assuming the ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\Delta}{\\mathcal{F}}$ distance is small essentially says that the mistake set of any hypothesis in $\\mathcal{F}$ must have similar probability in both the source and target distribution, so the target error can\u2019t be much higher than the source error. Kifer et al. [31] showed that this distance can be statistically estimated from a finite sample. In an imprecise sense, our results suggest that the ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\Delta}{\\mathcal{F}}$ distance is small when every hypothesis $f\\in\\mathcal F$ is robust on the neighborhoods $\\mathcal{N}$ and the distribution has good expansion. We also have one unified set of assumptions that leads to guarantees for both coverage expansion/domain adaptation and pseudolabel correction, and our coverage expansion bounds account for the error of the teacher model on the source domain.

[10] calls weak-to-strong generalization) goes back at least to Bucilu\u02c7a et al. [9]. In the context of knowledge distillation, Stanton et al. [58] show that even when student models have the capacity to match the teacher, they don\u2019t match them exactly. They give empirical examples of this phenomenon and argue that it can be due to optimization issues during student training. Clearly, this effect is critical for weak-to-strong generalization, and our expansion and robustness assumptions effectively try to capture the structure (whether implicit, due to the optimization process, or explicit, due to the choice of student hypothesis class) that rules out this exact-teacher-fitting behavior. In the context of self-training, Chen et al. [14], Kumar et al. [32], Oymak and Cihad Gulcu [47], Frei et al.

In contrast, like other work with expansion assumptions [3, 69, 12, 22], our results do not assume the input data follows any specific distributional form. Indeed, Wei et al.

[37]: first, the population error on the clean labels is related via structural assumptions to the population error on the weak labels. Second, and almost orthogonally, off-the-shelf concentration/finite-sample arguments are applied to the weak label population error.
