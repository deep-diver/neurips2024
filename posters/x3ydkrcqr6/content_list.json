Recently, multi-vector (MV) representations, introduced by the late-interaction framework in ColBERT [29], have been shown to deliver significantly improved performance on popular IR benchmarks. ColBERT and its variants [17, 21, 32, 35, 42, 44, 49, 54] produce multiple embeddings per query or document by generating one embedding per token. The query-document similarity is then scored via the Chamfer Similarity (\u00a71.1), also known as the MaxSim operation, between the two sets of vectors. These multi-vector representations have many advantages over single-vector (SV) representations, such as better interpretability [15, 50] and generalization [16, 36, 51, 55]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite these advantages, multi-vector retrieval is inherently more expensive than single-vector retrieval. Firstly, producing one embedding per token increases the number of embeddings in a dataset by orders of magnitude. Moreover, due to the non-linear Chamfer similarity scoring, there is a lack of optimized systems for multi-vector retrieval. Specifically, single-vector retrieval is generally accomplished via Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) algorithms, which have been highly-optimized over the past few decades [18]. However, SV MIPS alone cannot be used for MV retrieval. This is because the MV similarity is the sum of the SV similarities of each embedding in a query to the nearest embedding in a document. Thus, a document containing a token with high similarity to a single query token may not be very similar to the query overall. Thus, in an effort to close the gap between SV and MV retrieval, there has been considerable work in recent years to design custom MV retrieval algorithms with improved efficiency [12, 21, 42, 43].

The basic version of this approach is as follows: in the initial stage, the most similar document tokens are found for each of the query tokens using SV MIPS. Then the corresponding documents containing these tokens are gathered together and rescored with the original Chamfer similarity. We refer to this method as the single-vector heuristic. ColBERTv2 [44] and its optimized retrieval engine PLAID [43] are based on this approach, with the addition of several intermediate stages of pruning. In particular, PLAID employs a complex four-stage retrieval and pruning process to gradually reduce the number of final candidates to be scored (Figure 1). Unfortunately, as described above, employing SV MIPS on individual query embeddings can fail to find the true MV nearest neighbors. Additionally, this process is expensive, since it requires querying a significantly larger MIPS index for every query embedding (larger because there are multiple embeddings per document). Finally, these multi-stage pipelines are complex and highly sensitive to parameter setting, as recently demonstrated in a reproducibility study [37], making them difficult to tune.
