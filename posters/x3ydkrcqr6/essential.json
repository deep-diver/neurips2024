However, these multi-vector models introduce significant computational challenges due to the complexity of similarity scoring. This research paper tackles this issue by proposing a new approach.\n\nThe proposed method, MUVERA, cleverly transforms multi-vector retrieval problems into single-vector problems. It achieves this by generating fixed dimensional encodings (FDEs) for both queries and documents.  These FDEs maintain the essential information while enabling the use of efficient single-vector search algorithms (like maximum inner product search or MIPS). Experiments show that MUVERA outperforms existing approaches by achieving better accuracy with significantly reduced latency and memory footprint.  The paper also provides theoretical justification for MUVERA's accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Information Retrieval"}, "podcast_path": "X3ydKRcQr6/podcast.wav"}
