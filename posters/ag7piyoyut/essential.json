The core idea involves learning a surrogate model of the black-box function using existing data, but these surrogates often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, leading to inaccurate predictions outside the original data regimes. Current solutions often involve problem-specific conditioning techniques, limiting their generalization to other models or tasks. \nThis research proposes IGNITE, a model-agnostic method that incorporates a model sharpness regularizer into surrogate training. This regularizer, based on surrogate gradient norm, is theoretically shown to reduce generalized sharpness on unseen data.  Extensive experiments demonstrate IGNITE's effectiveness across diverse tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 9.6%. This model-agnostic approach addresses limitations of existing techniques by offering a more generic and broadly applicable solution to the OOD problem in offline optimization.", "affiliation": "Washington State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ag7piyoyut/podcast.wav"}
