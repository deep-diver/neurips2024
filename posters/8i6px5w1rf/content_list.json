In these tasks, both human participants and neural networks successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalisation. We found that while training dataset size was a core determinant of alignment with human choices, contrastive training with multi-modal data (text and imagery) was a common feature of currently publicly available models that predicted human generalisation. Intrinsic dimensionality of representations had different effects on alignment for different model types. Lastly, we tested three sets of human-aligned representations and found no consistent improvements in predictive accuracy compared to the baselines.

To study this, we measured how well different neural network representations predict human choices in two newly developed learning tasks. Of the 86 tested representations, all but one predicted human choice above chance level. We furthermore identified several important factors for human alignment, such as large model size, training regime, and low intrinsic dimensionality. These results expand on previous work in both human alignment and cognitive modelling. From an alignment perspective, we considered more challenging tasks compared to previous studies. Previous work has predominantly focused on simple image exposure and similarity judgments. We believe our findings complement this research by addressing unexplored aspects of alignment, which are generalisation and information integration across an extended horizon. From a cognitive modelling perspective, we demonstrated that off-the-shelf pretrained neural networks can serve as representations for cognitive models [77], which allows to push cognitive models into more naturalistic domains.

First, previous research has shown that CLIP representations align well with human representations using brain imaging [78, 9, 79] and similarity judgments [3]. In line with this, we also found that the contrastive language-image loss improved alignment when controlling for data size and architecture. We furthermore found that training on large datasets generally improved alignment. Yet, it remains unclear whether supervised training on massive datasets alone can achieve high alignment similar to that of CLIP models. For example, Muttenthaler et al. [3] showed that models trained in a supervised manner on the JFT-3B dataset [61] can outperform CLIP in predicting human similarity judgments. However, since this is a proprietary dataset, we could not make this comparison. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "We observed some findings that diverge from previous studies using different experimental paradigms. Muttenthaler et al. [3] and Conwell et al. [9] found no consistent correlation between a model\u2019s number of parameters and its alignment with human similarity judgments and visual cortex activity. In contrast, we found that models with more parameters were more predictive of human choices. Another significant divergence is how intrinsic dimensionality relates to alignment.Elmoznino and Bonner [72] found that vision models with higher latent dimensionality better predict visual cortex activity, Conwell et al. [9] found no correlation. In contrast to this, we observed that lower intrinsic dimensionality led to increased alignment for CLIP models. We hypothesize that both of the observed discrepancies are due to the higher cognitive demands required by our tasks, highlighting the importance of studying alignment in more complex settings. That being said, an alternative explanation for the latter discrepancy could be due to differences in measuring latent dimensionality. Both Elmoznino and Bonner [72] and Conwell et al. [9] use the squared sum of the eigenvalues of principal components divided by the sum of squares of eigenvalues, assuming representations lie on a linear manifold. However, previous work shows that later layers in vision models lie on a curved manifold [66]. Thus, using principal components might not be the best method for this estimation. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Lastly, we found that two methods designed for increasing human alignment, Harmonization [11] and DreamSim [12], actually hurt alignment in our tasks. On the other hand, gLocal [10] improved both performance and human alignment for some models but not all of them. However, the gLocal transform heavily utilises the THINGS dataset, as it made use of the triplet odd-one-out similarity judgement data [27], making it difficult to interpret how well it generalises to other settings. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of studying how well different alignment methods transfer across tasks, as we have done in this work.

The main limitation concerns the interactions between factors in the tested neural networks, making it difficult to isolate specific factors. For example, we would like to test the influence of loss function keeping all other factors equal. Ideally, we would train all combinations of architectures, model sizes, loss functions, and datasets, but this is computationally infeasible.

For instance, it\u2019s not straightforward to compare the information content of image-text pairs used in CLIP training to image-only data used in other models. Text-image pairs might inherently carry more information than single images, potentially giving multimodal models an advantage that\u2019s difficult to quantify. This and other subtle differences in training paradigms could influence our results in ways that are challenging to isolate and measure. Lastly, there can also be other families of models that may outperform CLIP models we haven\u2019t considered, such as video models, generative models, or image segmentation models. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "We furthermore tested only two experimental paradigms. Future research should explore whether the considered representations predict human behaviour with nonlinear task rules and extend to other paradigms. In particular, one should also consider tasks beyond those generated through the embedding from Hebart et al. [27]. Previous work has shown that it is possible to automatically generate a large set of text-based category learning problems using large language models [80]. It might be interesting to test whether these methods can be extended to generate tasks involving visual stimuli and use these tasks to test whether our findings generalise to a wider setting. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Finally, we only measured human alignment by looking at behaviour.

For machine learning, our task and modelling approach offers a new way to measure the human alignment of neural network representations and use this as a metric while building human-aligned neural networks. Alignment at this level can pave the way for artificial systems that can generalise across semantically rich tasks, making them more robust and powerful. For cognitive science, our findings create the opportunity to study several other problems in naturalistic settings by showing that people can do learning tasks with naturalistic stimuli and that pretrained neural networks can be used to extract representations for cognitive models. This could open up the door for a whole new cognitive science that uses naturalistic tasks and environments and thereby increase the validity of the cognitive sciences more generally.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
