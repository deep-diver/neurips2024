In Section 3.2, we present a detailed comparison of our proposed tokenization method to the previous KNN-based approach. As shown in the red circle, the KNN-based method may inadvertently group points from different SAM regions into the same tokens, leading to potential confusion within the 3D network. In contrast, our method effectively employs SAM masks in tokenization to ensure seamless region-level knowledge distillation, thereby avoiding these issues.", "description": "This figure compares three different tokenization methods for 3D point clouds: patch-based 2D tokenization, KNN-based 3D tokenization, and the proposed SAM-guided 3D tokenization.  It highlights how the KNN method can incorrectly group points from distinct regions (as indicated by the red circles), while the SAM-guided method leverages segmentation masks to ensure accurate region-level alignment. This accurate alignment is crucial for effective knowledge distillation in 3D scene understanding.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "F9i1avQTla/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overall framework of the proposed method. Our method introduces a two-stage masked token prediction framework for learning from foundation models. In the first stage, we input complete point clouds and leverage SAM masks to guide the point cloud tokenization, thereby seamlessly aligning the 2D and 3D region-level features for dense prediction. A group-balanced weight is applied during distillation to prevent bias towards the head representations. In the second stage, we freeze the models trained in the first stage and have the student models predict instance-level features and masked tokens obtained from the teacher models.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two-stage process of the proposed SAM-guided masked token prediction framework. Stage 1 focuses on region-level dense distillation using SAM masks for tokenization to align 2D and 3D features.  A group-balanced weight is used to address class imbalance. In Stage 2, a teacher-student model setup is used for masked token prediction to refine feature representation learning. The teacher model, trained in Stage 1, provides global and token-wise local embeddings, which the student model learns to predict.", "section": "3 Methodology"}]
