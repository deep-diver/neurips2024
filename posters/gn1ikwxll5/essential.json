Learning-based approaches offer the potential for faster solutions, but often lack strong theoretical guarantees.  This paper addresses the challenges by focusing on learning *dual* solutions.  Existing learning methods typically focus on learning primal (feasible) solutions.  The need for dual solution methods is to validate the learned primal solutions and gain stronger theoretical support.\nThe proposed Dual Lagrangian Learning (DLL) method systematically leverages conic duality theory and machine learning to learn dual-feasible solutions.  **It introduces a novel dual conic completion procedure, differentiable conic projection layers, and a self-supervised learning framework based on Lagrangian duality.** DLL provides closed-form dual completion for many problem types, eliminating the need for computationally expensive implicit layers. Empirical results show that DLL significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method and achieves 1000x speedups over traditional interior-point solvers with optimality gaps under 0.5% on average.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "gN1iKwxlL5/podcast.wav"}
