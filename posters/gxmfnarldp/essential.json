Existing quantization methods often fail to optimize performance due to neglecting cross-layer dependencies in the model, leading to suboptimal results. This often involves a significant search overhead, further complicating the optimization process. \nQ-VLM tackles these issues by introducing a novel post-training quantization approach. This method leverages the correlation between activation entropy and cross-layer dependency to guide efficient block-wise quantization. By optimizing the visual encoder, the search space is further reduced, leading to improved accuracy and speed.  The results demonstrate significant memory compression (2.78x) and a speed increase (1.44x) on a 13B parameter model without performance degradation.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "gxMfNArldP/podcast.wav"}
