A key challenge lies in simultaneously minimizing regret across various loss functions, a problem addressed by U-calibration.  However, determining the optimal U-calibration error remained an open problem. This research focuses on improving online multiclass prediction by developing a better understanding of U-calibration error.  Previous works show that existing methods have limitations in achieving low U-calibration error, particularly for a large number of classes.\nThis research makes significant strides in resolving this challenge.  By employing a modified Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithm and constructing specific proper loss functions, the authors prove that the minimax optimal U-calibration error is indeed \u0398(\u221aKT). Furthermore, they demonstrate that logarithmic U-calibration error is achievable for specific classes of losses such as Lipschitz and decomposable losses, significantly improving upon previous results. These findings offer significant improvements and a better theoretical understanding to the existing algorithms for online multiclass prediction.", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "7aFRgCC8Q7/podcast.wav"}
