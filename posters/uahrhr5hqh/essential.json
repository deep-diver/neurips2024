Flow Matching (FM) offers efficiency but lacks flexibility. These limitations hinder the development of scalable and high-performing generative models for such data. \nThis paper introduces **CatFlow**, a novel approach to graph generation that overcomes these limitations. CatFlow leverages **Variational Flow Matching (VFM)**, a new variational inference framework which provides a computationally efficient way to train CNFs for categorical data.  The method demonstrates significantly improved performance on several benchmark graph and molecule generation tasks, exceeding the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods.  The key is in parameterizing the vector field of the flow in terms of a variational approximation of the posterior probability path, leading to a highly efficient closed form objective function for categorical data.
