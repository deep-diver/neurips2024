[{"figure_path": "XkMCKoHNCD/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Regression coefficients for each possible character pairs for the TV series The Big Bang Theory. For each pair, we conduct a logistic regression to predict if the dialogue line is more likely to be said by a character1 such that P (character1 = 1|the line is said by character1 or character2). We use the first 300 principal components in the logistic regression. Then, we assess the absolute value of each coefficient to determine their magnitude. Following this, we select the top ten coefficients for each linear predictor function. We report in this figure those coefficients, along with their corresponding dimensions. The coefficients are in decreasing order from left to right: the left side have the coefficient with the highest magnitude, the right side have the coefficients with the lowest magnitude.", "description": "This table displays the top ten most influential principal components (PCAs) for distinguishing between pairs of characters in the TV show *The Big Bang Theory*.  Each row represents a character pair, and the columns show the PCAs ordered by the magnitude of their regression coefficients (most influential to least influential). The sign indicates whether a higher PCA value makes a character more or less likely to have said the line. The analysis helps understand which dimensions of character dialogue (as captured by the PCAs) are most important for distinguishing between characters.", "section": "3.2 Character prediction"}]
