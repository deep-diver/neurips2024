This research addresses this issue by proposing \"amortized eigendecomposition.\" The existing methods perform full eigendecomposition at each iteration, which is computationally expensive.  The paper reviews existing methods and demonstrates their limitations and problems. \nThe proposed solution replaces the computationally expensive eigendecomposition with a more affordable QR decomposition, introducing an additional loss term to ensure the desired eigenpair is attained as optima of the eigen loss.  The results of experiments on various tasks show significant improvement in training efficiency, producing outcomes comparable to traditional approaches.
