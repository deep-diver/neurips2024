The Rand index measures the agreement between the detected change points and the true change points. A higher Rand index indicates better performance of the change point detection method. The results show that a window size of 30 yields the best performance in this experiment.", "section": "C Choices of the tuning parameters"}, {"figure_path": "FAuFpGeLmx/tables/tables_24_2.jpg", "caption": "Table C.2: Results (computational time in hours and rand index values) for different choices of T when B = 20.", "description": "This table presents the computational time (in hours) and Rand index values obtained for various numbers of permutations (T) in the change point detection method. The window size (B) is fixed at 20.  The Rand index measures the agreement between the detected change points and the true change points, with higher values indicating better performance. The computational time increases linearly with T, while the Rand index remains relatively consistent, suggesting that the method's performance is stable across different choices of T.", "section": "C Choices of the tuning parameters"}]
