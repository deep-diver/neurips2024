It shows the diffusion paths\u2014trajectories in the feature space\u2014of samples from two different datasets (CIFAR10 and SVHN) as they are progressively transformed into a standard normal distribution via the DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models) process.  The key observation is that these paths exhibit varying rates of change and curvatures. The authors propose to use these path characteristics as features to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, forming the basis of their OOD detection method.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "tTnFH7D1h4/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Histograms of various statistics of the respective training sets. The NLL is calculated using a diffusion model trained on CIFAR10, while the other two statistics are calculated with a model trained on ImageNet.", "description": "This figure displays histograms of three different statistics calculated for CIFAR10 and SVHN training sets.  The first statistic is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) calculated using a diffusion model trained on CIFAR10. The other two statistics involve the L2 norm of the score and the L2 norm of the derivative of the score (curvature), both computed along the diffusion path from data points to the standard normal distribution using a diffusion model trained on ImageNet.  The histograms visualize the distribution of these statistics for each dataset, illustrating how they differ between in-distribution (CIFAR10) and out-of-distribution (SVHN) samples.", "section": "3 Diffusion Models for OOD Detection"}, {"figure_path": "tTnFH7D1h4/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration of the forward integration of Eq. 7 on samples from CIFAR10, SVHN and CelebA. Both the ImageNet and CelebA models are able bring the samples approximately to standard normal. Other than the case where the CelebA model is used to integrate CelebA samples (last row of the right figure), the samples shown here have not been seen by the models during training. While in certain cases the end result appears to contain features of the original image, thus deviating from an isotropic Gaussian (e.g., first row of the right figure), empirically we find that the scores remain accurate enough for outlier detection; see Sec. 5 for quantitative results.", "description": "This figure shows the forward diffusion process of samples from different datasets (CIFAR10, SVHN, CelebA) using two different pre-trained diffusion models (ImageNet and CelebA). The forward process aims to transform the samples into a standard normal distribution.  Even though the models were not trained on these specific samples, they manage to bring samples close to the standard normal distribution, even though some residual features from the original image may remain. This visual demonstration supports the authors' claim that the characteristics of these diffusion trajectories can be used as an effective indicator for out-of-distribution detection.", "section": "3.2 Scores as an OOD Statistic"}]
