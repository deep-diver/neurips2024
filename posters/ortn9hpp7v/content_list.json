We do not claim that all forms of normalizations are harmful. Our claim in principle c) only extends to normalization layers that explicitly standardizes the mean and standard deviation of the activation maps. This has been verified by prior studies [31, 34, 65]. The harm of normalization layers extends to the adjacent field of image restoration [43, 88]. To the best of our knowledge, EDM2 [34] is currently the strongest diffusion UNet and it does not use normalization layers. However, it does apply normalization to the trainable weights and this improves performance considerably. We expect that applying the normalization techniques in EDM2 would improve our model\u2019s performance.   \n\u2022 We tried removing the activation function after the $3\\!\\times\\!3$ grouped convolution in each residual block as modern architectures [48, 97] typically do not apply non-linearity after depthwise convolution. This worsened FID performance.   \n\u2022 We tried Pixel-Shuffle/Unshuffle [71] for changing the resolution of the activation maps, and found that without low-pass filtering, this led to high frequency artifacts similar to checkerboard artifacts even though Pixel-Shuffle does not have the uneven overlap problem that transposed convolution does. Note that bilinear resampling is equivalent to applying channel duplication/averaging with Pixel-Shuffle/Unshuffle in conjunction with a [1, 2, 1] low-pass kernel. It might be interesting in future studies to explore inplace resampling fliters that apply a low-pass flitered Pixel-Shuffle/Unshuffle operation on top of a learned function that changes the number of channels.   \n\u2022 We tried scaling up our model size. We found that allocating more model capacity to lower resolution stages generally did not improve FID, but contributed to more rapid overfitting. Increasing model capacity at higher resolution stages always improves FID in our experiments, however scaling up higher resolution stages is very computationally expensive. Capacity distribution for each resolution stage of the model might be an important topic to explore in future studies.   \n\u2022 For model simplicity, we did not conduct any experiment with a transformer architecture or attention mechanism in general. We are interested to see whether adding attention blocks to a convolutional network (similar to BigGAN [3] and diffusion UNet [20, 33, 34]) or using a pure transformer architecture (similar to DiT [58]) will result in stronger performance.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
