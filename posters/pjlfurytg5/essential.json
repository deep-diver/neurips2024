However, existing safe MARL methods often rely on a centralized value function and global state information, which limits scalability and applicability in resource-constrained systems. These methods struggle to manage the exponential growth of the state-action space and the communication overhead associated with global state sharing.\nThis paper introduces a novel, scalable, and theoretically-justified multi-agent constrained policy optimization method, termed Scalable MAPPO-Lagrangian (Scal-MAPPO-L). This method addresses the limitations of existing methods by employing a decentralized approach using local interactions and k-hop policies. By integrating rigorous bounds from the trust region method and the truncated advantage function, the method guarantees both safety constraints and improved reward performance.  Empirical evaluation on various benchmark tasks demonstrates its effectiveness and validates the theoretical findings, showing that decentralized training with local interactions can significantly improve reward performance and maintain safety.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "pJlFURyTG5/podcast.wav"}
