For details, see section 4.3.", "description": "This figure shows the workflow of integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs) to estimate the interactions between entities in collective motion. The initial state is fed into a neural ODE, which interacts with a GNN at each time step.  The GNN defines the edges based on a distance function and calculates interactions between connected entities (F\u00b2) and self-generated forces (F\u00b9). These forces are fed back into the neural ODE, allowing it to update the state and repeat the process until the end of the time series. This iterative process effectively estimates the two-body interactions by learning the dynamics of individual entities and their interactions within the collective system.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "qwl3EiDi9r/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Snapshots of the simulation results in the harmonic interaction model with friction constants.
