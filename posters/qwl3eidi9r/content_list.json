With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years.

Here, we present a novel deep learning framework for estimating the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model with non-reciprocal forces that mimic the collective dynamics of the cells of slime molds.

Starting with the Vicsek model (10), the collective behavior in active matter is described based on the centroids, velocities, and orientations of each individual. A unique aspect of active matter is that it allows for spontaneous generation of forces and torques, which is justified by the ability to extract and utilize energy from the external environment (11). The Vicsek model itself is a multi-particle model in discrete time, where each individual possesses a velocity along its orientation and adjusts its direction based on interactions with nearby individuals. This model assumes that interactions among individuals are local and can be represented using a dynamical graph structure (12). Stemming from this model, numerous other models have been proposed, differing in the nature of interactions between individuals and the forms of their equations of motion. Particularly models with continuous-time motion equations often use Langevin equations where the motion of individuals is described by the summation of pairwise interactions (13). Furthermore, since active matter can utilize energy from the external environment, focusing solely on moving agents categorizes it as an open system. This implies that the conservation of the total system energy is not guaranteed, making these systems inherently unsuitable for Hamiltonian descriptions. Given this background, the formulation of collective motion in active matter typically involves direct descriptions of forces rather than using free energy.

System identification aims to estimate the equations of motion of a system from data. One well-known method for estimating differential equations is Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) (14). SINDy estimates nonlinear differential equations from data using LASSO regression to sparsely estimate the terms of the equations. However, when applying this method to many-body systems with pairwise interactions, the number of parameters to estimate increases exponentially with the number of individuals, which raises computational costs and leads to potential instabilities. Other system identification methods use Bayesian optimization (15; 16; 17), e.g. representing the functions in the motion equations through basis function expansion, and estimating their coefficients via Bayesian optimization. This method has been successfully used in Vicsek model, reproducing its formation of orientational order. However, the effectiveness of this approach for more complex systems, such as mixedspecies systems, remains unclear. Deep learning approaches to analyzing collective motion have also been proposed (18; 19; 20). These incorporate Attention mechanisms to analyze behaviors limited to turning right or left (18), systems that limit the scope to Vicsek-type models to estimate orientational order parameters (19), or to estimate two-body interactions by expressing forces as neural networks (20). Another possibility is to express Hamiltonians (21) or Lagrangians (22) as neural networks, in order to preserve known symmetries of the studied system. Some proposed including knowledge or assumptions about the physical context into the loss function (23). So far, none of these methods have been applied to systems in which multiple species interact with each other in unknown ways.

This approach requires a fully or almost fully connected graph for collective motion where the adjacency changes drastically over time, and causes memory inefficiency. On the other hand, some introduced a given time series of edge structure (29), making the system difficult to be extrapolated. Thus we resolved these issues by setting a rule to define edges at each time point instead of explicitly giving graph structure time series.

This method combines dynamic GNNs with neural ODEs to estimate interactions among individuals. We demonstrated that this method was able to estimate interactions in both simple models and complex mixed-species collective motion models. In models with simple harmonic interactions, the proposed method identified the relevant interactions effectively. Importantly, the method successfully inferred the non-reciprocal interactions between the different species in the complex mixed-species model for the collective dynamics of slime molds. For the latter case, the continuous updating of the edge structures in our approach substantially reduces memory needs. In our simulations of 400 bodies with an edge density of $2\\%$ , the required memory of $200\\,\\mathrm{GB}$ for a fully connected graph is reduced to 30GB thus making them feasible on off-the-shelf GPUs. Nevertheless, we should note that this approach is limited due to the long time required for estimation. Moreover, the method currently estimates deterministic motion equations and only considers pairwise interactions, thereby not accommodating interactions among three or more bodies or the effects of noise. Future research is expected to extend this approach to estimate more general interactions and develop methods for stochastic motion equations. Applying the present methods to real data in systems such as immune cells should help clarify the complex rules behind their migration stategies.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
