The first pocket prediction stage is specialized for blind docking, where a binding pocket is identified from a set of candidates through a novel contrastive pocket-ligand alignment module CPLA. Then in the second stage, within the pockets predefined or selected by CPLA, binding structures are predicted in a bi-level coarseto-fine iterative refinement module Bi-EGMN. This module prioritizes the residue-level structure covered by a large outer box (Fig.4) for pose positioning and coarse structure prediction. And the atom-level structure, within a relatively small radius from the coarse structure, is characterized for more refined predictions. In particular, the module incorporates (i) a GPU-accelerated pose sampling algorithm generating high-quality initial structure, (ii) a training objective imposing penalties for steric clashes and constraints on ligand mobility, and (iii) a rapid post-processing step composing torsional alignment and energy minimization for structure correction.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
