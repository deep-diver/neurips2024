It iteratively optimizes a sequence of surrogate training objectives, replacing the empirical risk with a projection onto a lower-dimensional space.  This makes the optimization more computationally tractable, particularly for models with expensive risk evaluations.", "section": "4.2 Framework implementation: SuPAC-CE"}]
