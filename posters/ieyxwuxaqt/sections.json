[{"heading_title": "Surrogate PAC-Bayes", "details": {"summary": "The core idea behind \"Surrogate PAC-Bayes\" is to address the computational challenges of directly optimizing PAC-Bayes generalization bounds.  **Traditional PAC-Bayes methods often involve computationally expensive calculations**, such as repeatedly evaluating the empirical risk. This approach cleverly introduces surrogate training objectives that approximate the original bound but are significantly more tractable.  **The key strategy is to project the empirical risk onto a lower-dimensional functional space**, making it far easier to query. This enables the development of iterative learning algorithms where each iteration optimizes a surrogate, leading to a more efficient optimization of the original PAC-Bayes bound.  **Theoretical guarantees are provided** to ensure that optimizing these surrogates implicitly optimizes the original bounds.  The framework's versatility is highlighted through its application to meta-learning, demonstrating its adaptability to various machine learning scenarios.
