However, even this simplified minimisation problem might prove computationally difficult for Gradient Descent (GD) based algorithm. This is especially the case when evaluating the empirical risk is costly, e.g. when the prediction model involves solving stiff ODEs or PDEs. As PAC-Bayes bounds depend on the $\\pi$ -mean of the empirical risk, each gradient estimation rely on numerous new evaluations of the empirical risk. For ODEs $\\dot{S}=F(S,\\bar{t},x)$ where $F$ is very sensitive with respect to $S$ , numerous evaluations of $F$ are required to obtain adequate numerical solutions in a given range $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ . These evaluations must moreover be performed iteratively, and hence can not be parallelized. Moreover, implementing the ODE solver in a way to benefit from GPU speed up when simulating for multiple parameters $x{\\mathbf s}$ simultaneously might not be practicable, since most ODE solver use a varying step size which will depend on $x$ . This will result in typically long model calls which can not be massively parallelised.

As a consequence, the surrogate bound solution can be reasonably allowed to be much further away from the current posterior estimation than is the case for GD. A key implementation difficulty remains picking the range of validity, i.e. how far away from the current posterior the surrogate solver can be allowed to choose a distribution.

The second factor is that the \"generation agnostic\" weighing approach described in Section 4.2.1 is unlikely to give adequate performances if $\\mathcal{H}$ is high dimensional.

Concrete fields of application of SuPAC-CE include, but are not limited to, fluid dynamics simulations with dimension reduction [Callaham et al., 2021], metabolic models for microbial communities [Cerk et al., 2024] and greenhouse gas emission inverse problems [Nalini et al., 2022]. We remark that, as of now, PAC-Bayes has not been much used outside of the learning community. While this can be vastly attributed to a lack of awareness of PAC-Bayes theory outside of the learning community, the use of PAC-Bayes was also hampered by the fact that previous PAC-Bayes algorithm required a prohibitive number of simulations and hence computation time.
