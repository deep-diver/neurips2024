The methods are compared using four metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Trace, Fraction Of Samples Closer Than the True Match (FOSCTTM), and Trace. Lower MSE and FOSCTTM values are preferred, while higher Trace values are better.  The results show the performance of propensity score-based matching (PS) compared to the performance of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based approach for each alignment method and dataset.", "section": "6.2 Experiment 2: CITE-Seq Data"}, {"figure_path": "hT4y7D2o2T/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Cross-modal prediction results using CITE-seq data and PerturbSeq/single cell image data including an out of distribution distance evaluation for PerturbSeq/single cell images.", "description": "This table presents the results of cross-modality prediction experiments using two datasets: CITE-seq and PerturbSeq/single cell image data.  It evaluates the performance of different matching methods (Random, VAE+OT, PS+OT) using two different loss functions (MSE and Unbiased Loss) for the CITE-seq data. For the PerturbSeq/single cell image data, it assesses the performance using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a metric, both for in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.  The results are expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (Q1, Q3). The table also includes the performance of using true pairs for comparison.", "section": "Experiment 2: CITE-Seq Data"}, {"figure_path": "hT4y7D2o2T/tables/tables_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Alignment metrics results using synthetic interventional image dataset and CITE-seq data.", "description": "This table presents the results of applying different matching methods on two datasets: synthetic interventional images and CITE-seq data.  The methods compared include propensity score matching with optimal transport (PS+OT), propensity score matching with shared nearest neighbors (PS+SNN), VAE-based matching with optimal transport (VAE+OT), VAE-based matching with shared nearest neighbors (VAE+SNN), SCOT, GLUE+SNN, GLUE+OT, and a random matching baseline. For each method and dataset, the median, first quartile (Q1), and third quartile (Q3) of two evaluation metrics are reported: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Trace. Lower MSE values and higher Trace values indicate better performance.  The results show that propensity score matching with optimal transport consistently outperforms other methods across both datasets.", "section": "6.2 Experiment 2: CITE-Seq Data"}]
