However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the estimation bias in ECE was previously lacking, hindering accurate calibration evaluations.  Existing research mainly concentrated on one common binning approach, leaving a gap in knowledge for another frequently used approach. Furthermore, generalization error analysis for ECE was also absent, making it difficult to predict performance on unseen data.\nThis paper addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive analysis of ECE's estimation bias for both uniform mass and uniform width binning strategies. The researchers derived upper bounds on the bias, offering improved convergence rates, and identified the optimal number of bins.  Their analysis was extended to generalization error using an information-theoretic approach, leading to upper bounds facilitating the numerical evaluation of ECE's accuracy for unseen data.  Experiments confirmed the practicality of their approach.", "affiliation": "Osaka University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "yltJAlwtW9/podcast.wav"}
