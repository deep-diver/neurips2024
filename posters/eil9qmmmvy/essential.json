However, existing model-free methods often struggle due to extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution actions and the difficulty of handling multi-modal policy distributions.  Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods offer an implicit regularization technique but are limited by unimodal Gaussian policy extraction.\nThis paper introduces Diffusion-DICE, a novel offline RL approach that tackles these limitations.  It views DICE methods as a transformation from behavior to optimal policy distributions and leverages diffusion models to perform this transformation directly.  By carefully selecting actions using a value function, it minimizes error exploitation and outperforms existing diffusion-based and DICE-based methods in benchmark evaluations.  The in-sample learning objective further enhances its robustness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "EIl9qmMmvy/podcast.wav"}
