This is problematic as many real-world datasets exhibit high coherence.  Additionally, these methods often rely on assumptions such as Gaussian noise which are not always met in real-world applications.\nThis paper introduces a novel method that significantly improves eigenvector estimation by mitigating the issue of high coherence. It leverages a carefully selected subset of the observed matrix entries, effectively filtering out noise. Under mild conditions, the method is provably free from coherence dependence and achieves optimal estimation rates under Gaussian noise.  Furthermore, the new method showcases improved performance under non-Gaussian noise, demonstrating robustness in real-world conditions.  Importantly, new metric entropy bounds are provided which improve understanding of singular subspaces and yield tighter bounds for the general rank-r case.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "CiuH7zOBCQ/podcast.wav"}
