Existing methods often struggle with either efficiency or focus solely on sequence design, neglecting the crucial 3D structure.  Furthermore, current diffusion models aren't well-suited for full-atom peptide representations and variable binding site geometries. \nThis work introduces PepGLAD, a generative model using geometric latent diffusion.  PepGLAD tackles these challenges by employing a variational autoencoder to handle the full-atom detail, and uses a receptor-specific affine transformation to normalize binding geometries.  The results show that PepGLAD generates significantly more diverse and higher-affinity peptides compared to existing methods, improving both sequence-structure co-design and the generation of binding conformations.  **The benchmark dataset and the proposed method offer a significant advancement in peptide design, potentially speeding up drug discovery and therapeutic development.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "IAQNJUJe8q/podcast.wav"}
