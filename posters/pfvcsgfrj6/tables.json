The table visually illustrates the forward and backward phases of each algorithm, showing how edge additions and deletions are handled differently in the modified method to account for deterministic relationships. The original GES fails to obtain the correct CPDAG because it incorrectly removes an edge, while the modified approach produces the correct CPDAG. ", "section": "A3 Method Details"}]
