Furthermore, existing neural approaches often lack the ability to explicitly incorporate these costs, limiting their accuracy and applicability.  The difficulty lies in the NP-hard nature of GED calculation.\n\nThe paper introduces GRAPHEDX, a neural GED estimator that addresses these limitations.  It leverages a novel combination of techniques: formulating GED as a quadratic assignment problem, employing neural set divergence surrogates to approximate QAP terms, and utilizing a Gumbel-Sinkhorn permutation generator for node and edge alignment.  The results demonstrate that GRAPHEDX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several datasets and various cost configurations, showcasing its accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "u7JRmrGutT/podcast.wav"}
