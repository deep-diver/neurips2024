However, conventional methods train DNNs with a fixed bit-width, leading to high retraining costs when deploying on hardware with varying precision demands.  Previous work either stored larger models for higher accuracy or smaller models with lower accuracy due to sharing quantization parameters. This poses significant challenges for efficient deployment of DNNs.\nThis paper introduces a novel method called Double Rounding to achieve nearly lossless bit-switching.  It leverages the full quantized range to represent different precisions, reducing storage.  To mitigate the competitive interference between precisions during one-shot joint training, the authors propose ALRS, dynamically adjusting learning rates to balance the training.  Furthermore, a HASB strategy is developed for one-shot mixed-precision training, improving training efficiency.  Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that the methods significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "kOp0kiXZ3a/podcast.wav"}
