Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) is a powerful technique to enhance VLM performance by adapting them during testing.  Existing methods, like prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization (MEM), are computationally expensive. \nThis paper introduces ZERO, a novel TTA method that leverages a hidden property within MEM. **ZERO is incredibly simple**: it augments the input image multiple times, makes predictions, keeps the most confident ones, and then sets the softmax temperature to zero before marginalizing. This requires only a single forward pass, making it much faster and more memory-efficient than existing TTA methods.  Experiments show that ZERO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets.", "affiliation": "University of Trento", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "eQ6VjBhevn/podcast.wav"}
