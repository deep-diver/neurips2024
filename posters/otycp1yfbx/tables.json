Each of the first \u03bb levels represents a cluster, where \u03bb is less than or equal to k.  Each cluster is a ball of radius 4r centered at a point c<sub>i</sub>. The last level (\u03bb+1) represents the outliers, i.e., the points that are not covered by any of the first \u03bb clusters.

It shows how the algorithm constructs at most k+1 levels. Each of the first k levels represents a cluster, while the last level (k+1) contains the outliers that are not covered by the k clusters.  Each level i contains a cluster Ci, built iteratively in the i-th iteration of the algorithm.  The algorithm stops either when k clusters have been created or when all points are clustered.
