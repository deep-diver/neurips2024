Existing algorithms often struggle with efficiency or are limited to specific data types and dimensions, making real-world applications challenging. This paper addresses these issues. This paper presents a novel fully dynamic algorithm that addresses the limitations of existing methods. It provides a (4+\u03b5)-approximate solution to the k-center clustering problem with outliers in general metric spaces.  This algorithm significantly improves upon previous work by achieving a much better approximation ratio and an efficient update time that is independent of the number of outliers and the dataset size.  The algorithm's ability to operate efficiently on general metric spaces further enhances its value for handling real-world datasets.", "affiliation": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "OtYCp1yfbX/podcast.wav"}
