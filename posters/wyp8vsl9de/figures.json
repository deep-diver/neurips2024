It first calls the PROJECTOR algorithm to compute an approximate spectral projector \u03a0 on the invariant subspace associated with the k smallest eigenvalues of the GEP. Then, it computes the inverse of S, using the INV algorithm from [39]. Finally, it computes the density matrix P using the formula P = \u03a0S\u207b\u00b9\u03a0*. The algorithm ensures that ||P - P|| \u2264 \u03b5 with probability at least 1 - O(1/n), where P is the true density matrix.", "section": "F DFT background"}]
