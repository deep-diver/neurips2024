However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. This inspires us to explore such an order to decouple and remove these degradation factors while training the NeRF.

The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information.

Since we are the first to tackle the NeRF reconstruction from lowlight images captured with camera motions, we design several baseline methods by combining existing state-of-the-art image-based and NeRF-based methods: (1) Low-light image enhancement [54, $^{49]+}$ Image deblurring method $[60,59]+\\mathrm{NeRF}$ [31]; (2) Joint low-light image enhancement and deblurring method $[67]+\\mathrm{NeRF}$ [31]; (3) Low-light image enhancement [13, $54]+$ deblurring NeRF [19]; and (4) Image deblurring [59, $60]+$ low-light NeRF enhancement [47]. All the selected models have been shown to achieve SOTA performances on their individual tasks. PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [63] metrics are used to evaluate the performance difference of the rendered images between LuSh-NeRF and the combination of other state-of-the-art methods. Due to the significant variations in color contrast ratio and image brightness of the restored low light images by different methods, we consider LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), which can reasonably assess perceptual image quality and visual differences rather than the pixel-level difference, as the key metric.

Fig. 4 presents qualitative comparison of the rendering results from the above three combined methods with those of our LuSh-NeRF in our real low-light scenarios. We can see that the results from LEDNet [67] are still dark, which significantly limits the learning capability of the NeRF. While PairLIE [13] combined with DP-NeRF [19] can reconstruct clear rendering results, they are rather unnatural. The color contrast is severely shifted, resulting in unrealistic images with some lost details and incomplete blur removal. In addition, we can also observe that first deblurring on low-light images and then applying the LLE method, as in Restormer $[59]+\\mathrm{LLNeRF}$ [47], is less effective, and there is still substantial blurring in the results. In contrast, our approach can recover detailed scenes with natural colors, resulting in a sharp and clean novel view visualization.

As we can see from the given visualizations on realistic and synthesized data, higher PSNR and SSIM metrics of the methods (e.g., LEDNet $^+$ NeRF) do not entirely represent better performances on the NeRF results in our proposed task.

In addition, incorrect kernel predictions have a negative impact as they make it difficult to align the multi-view images rendered by S-NeRF and the SND module cannot obtain accurate viewpoint consistency supervision (Fig. 6(c)). When the CTP module is utilized, the blur of the image is alleviated, but the noise problem is still serious (Fig. 6(d)). First sharpening the image with CTP and then removing noise with SND can somewhat suppress the noise problem, but the noise may be reconstructed to the various viewpoints and is not completely removed (Fig. 6(e)).

Besides, noise that is relatively similar across views may be difficult to remove due to the reliance on viewpoint consistency. (Refer to Appendix A.8 for details.)

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
