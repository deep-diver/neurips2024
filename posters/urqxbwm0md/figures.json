The top row shows scatter plots of samples from the distributions, illustrating how the distribution changes from a clear pancake structure to a more Gaussian-like distribution as \u03c3 increases. The bottom row shows the probability density functions along the secret direction u, comparing the Gaussian Pancakes with the standard Gaussian.", "section": "Introduction"}]
