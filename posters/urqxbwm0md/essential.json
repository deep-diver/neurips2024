Recent work shows that sampling from an unknown distribution can be reduced to accurate score estimation, but this leaves open the question of how computationally hard it is to estimate these scores.  Estimating score functions for complex high-dimensional distributions is challenging and computationally expensive; this makes it impossible to efficiently implement this process for certain distributions. \nThis paper addresses this issue by demonstrating that L\u00b2-accurate score estimation is computationally hard, even when ample samples are available.  The authors achieve this by creating a reduction from the Gaussian Pancakes problem (known to be computationally hard under reasonable assumptions) to the score estimation problem.  **This provides a new understanding of the computational limits of score estimation**, and suggests that future research should focus on alternative approaches to sampling or on stronger assumptions about data distributions to make score estimation feasible.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "URQXbwM0Md/podcast.wav"}
