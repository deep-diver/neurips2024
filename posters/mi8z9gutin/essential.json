This leads to inaccurate gradient estimations and limits the applicability of BLO in large-scale applications. Existing approaches either suffer from memory issues (gradient unrolling), approximation errors (implicit function methods), or both, hindering their performance in large-scale settings.\nThe paper introduces Forward Gradient Unrolling with Forward Gradient ((FG)\u00b2U), a novel algorithm to address these challenges.  (FG)\u00b2U achieves an unbiased stochastic approximation of the meta-gradient, significantly improving gradient estimation accuracy.  Its inherent support for parallel computing leads to substantial gains in computational efficiency.  Extensive empirical evaluations across various large-scale tasks demonstrate (FG)\u00b2U's superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in dealing with the memory and approximation challenges associated with large-scale BLO.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MI8Z9gutIn/podcast.wav"}
