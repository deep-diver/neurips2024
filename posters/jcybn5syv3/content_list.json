Synthetic data generation is a promising alternative to harvest annotated training data, which brings realistic images and notable performance improvements across tasks like object detection [10] and semantic segmentation [75]. Besides the realism of the generated images, there are two necessary conditions to consider for a practical synthetic data generator for autonomous driving: 1) Appearance diversity, which ensures the synthetic data can cover a spectrum of weather, environmental, and geographical conditions. 2) Layout diversity, namely the distribution of objects, should cover different traffic scenarios, including safety-critical situations that are rare to collect in the real world.

They are confined to learning on small-scale datasets [29, 32, 44, 71] with limited scenarios such as only urban streets [5] or restricted weather conditions [52]. In addition, the driving behaviors in the available driving datasets like nuScenes are tedious and lack complex or safety-critical situations. Another option for collecting synthetic data is from driving simulators, which can effortlessly generate scenes encompassing various behaviors with its physics and graphics engines [16, 36, 58, 61, 66]. Simulators also provide accurate control over all objects and their spatial locations, thus can easily generate a huge amount of traffic layout maps. However, open-source simulators usually only contain a limited amount of 3D assets, and they lack a realistic visual appearance. Thus, the models trained on simulator-generated data can easily overfit, also known as the Simulation to Reality (Sim2Real) gap.

One na\u00efve approach is to guide an image generation model with the depth and semantic images from the simulator via training a control branch through ControlNet [81]. Yet, as the simulator has limited assets and cannot fully capture the variations in the real world, the simulated conditions and the underlying real-world conditions that guide a diffusion model to generate real-world images might have conflicts. To tackle this, SimGen adopts a cascade design. The model first injects noise-added simulated conditions such as depth and semantic images into the intermediate sampling process of a pre-trained text-to-real-condition diffusion network. The network then converts simulated conditions into more realistic conditions via continuous denoising, free of additional training on simulated conditions beyond this diffusion network.
