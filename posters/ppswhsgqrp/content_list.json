", "page_idx": 18}, {"type": "text", "text": "Since many LLMs are now available off-the-shelf, recent works study how routing mechanisms can be applied at inference time to trained models. Some works involve training task or domain-specific expert models and then learning a router. The router can be a nearest neighbors algorithm [38], a neural network [96] that classifies among the different domains corresponding to the experts, or an extra gate learned when training the expert models [60]. These approaches do not explicitly require labels, but they require knowledge of what domain is used to train each expert and assume that each expert is the best model for its corresponding domain, therefore effectively using this mapping as a form of labels. In contrast, our setting focuses on routing among pre-trained LLMs where we do not know what models are optimal on what tasks and their samples. ", "page_idx": 18}, {"type": "text", "text": "A second category of inference-time routing works studies how to choose among a collection of pretrained LLMs, which is the setting that SMOOTHIE focuses on. Several approaches involve training a meta-model that either scores or ranks how a LLM will perform on a sample [41, 74, 79], all of which required labeled data to train. MoRE [87] involves training a simpler random forest classifier, using the rate of agreement among LLMs as one of the features, which is similar to how Smoothie estimates scores; however, it also requires labeled data to train the classifier. Some approaches [48, 86] do not require training routers and simply use nearest neighbor methods. However, these nearest neighbor methods still use labeled data to determine what training samples each LLM performs the best on. [55] invokes a trained reward model for the routing mechanism. [21] trains a classification-based router using the BARTScore metric on LLM generations as pseudolabels; this avoids using manually labeled data, demonstrating that while a majority of routing methods require labeled data, there exist some alternatives that do not. We leave it to future work to compare and integrate SMOOTHIE with other unsupervised approaches.

Though recently applied in the context of modern LLMs, the concept of fusion traces back to older work on summarization [5, 46, 47, 75]. Some techniques combine or switch among multiple outputs at inference time [34, 36, 59, 83, 97], while others involve averaging in weight space [35, 38, 95]. Lastly, ensembling can also be approximated by randomly selecting a model to be used in multi-turn settings [56]. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "Other LLM Selection Algorithms Beyond the setting of selecting among multiple LLMs, other works have explored how to select the optimal prompt template from a collection of candidate prompts. These works can be grouped into two categories. The first category assumes that engineers have access to labeled data. In the naive case, this labeled data can simply be used to select the best performing prompt [45, 67, 77]. Another subset of this category focuses on the setting where new prompts can be generated by selecting in-context demonstrations from a set of labeled samples (typically a small training set) [22, 53]. Prior work has proposed different methods for identifying the optimal in-context demonstrations to use, depending on the sample for which the LLM is being used to produce a prediction for [11, 77, 90, 101, 105, 106]. The second category focuses on zero-label prompt selection methods, but solely for classification tasks [52, 89, 103]. Prior work here selects prompts on the basis of mutual information [89], agreement rates between predictions produced by different prompts [52], and various probability based measures [28, 57, 103]. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "Weak supervision SMOOTHIE utilizes techniques inspired by weak supervision literature. Weak supervision aims to programmatically generate labels on an unlabeled dataset by aggregating the predictions of several weak \u201cvoters\u201d, such as heuristics, pre-trained models, and knowledge graphs [71, 73]. It assumes a particular latent variable graphical model and uses its structure to estimate latent quantities, such as the accuracy of each voter (in our setting, the quality score of each LLM). Typically, this graphical model is a binary Ising model, as weak supervision has generally been studied in classification settings [26, 72], where embeddings have been utilized as auxiliary signal but not modeled explicitly [15, 29]. Weak supervision has been applied to broader settings, such as for learning rankings, graphs, and manifolds [85, 94]. We derive our estimation procedure from the Gaussian model in [85], applying it to LLM embeddings. While both SMOOTHIE and [85] use a multivariate Gaussian model, in SMOOTHIE we apply it to model routing with SBERT embeddings on natural language datasets, whereas [85] conducts synthetic experiments in hyperbolic spaces and metric spaces induced by synthetic graphs. Moreover, SMOOTHIE uses nearest neighbor kernel smoothing to allow for sample-dependent weights\u2014critical for routing\u2014while [85] calculates one global set of weights over the dataset. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "Consistency-based selection Consistency is central to unsupervised selection and aggregation methods, the simplest being majority vote. While weak supervision methods [26] and SMOOTHIE heavily rely on notions of voter agreement as depicted in a graphical model, there are several other consistency-based methods. Minimum Bayes Risk methods [6, 44] selects the generation that has the highest average similarity (i.e., cosine) with other generations. This is similar to SMOOTHIE, which routes to the lowest value of (3). If we ignore the subtraction of $\\delta_{j k}(x)$ in (3) and average over more than just $\\delta_{i j}(x)$ and $\\delta_{i k}(x)$ , then SMOOTHIE with $n_{0}=1$ is equivalent to [44] Therefore, SMOOTHIE can be considered as a slightly modified and more general version of this approach. Another approach [10] relies on consistency between a \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d embedding for each generation. They solve an optimization problem that estimates each generation\u2019s quality score by constructing a loss that enforces that the similarity between the estimated true generation (produced by a weighted average of candidates) and the candidate generation should be the same according to both global and local embeddings. In contrast, SMOOTHIE uses one embedding space, relies on a multivariate Gaussian structure among embeddings, and does not require gradient descent to learn the quality of each generation.
