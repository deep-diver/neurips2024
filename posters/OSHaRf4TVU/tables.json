It shows the values for learning rate, batch size, replay buffer size, L2 penalty, gradient clipping norm, learning updates, rollout discount factor (gamma), critic ensemble size, and target network update tau.  Each setting is specified for five different environments: Meta-World, POPGym, Procgen (easy and memory-hard modes), Atari, and BabyAI.  Note the variation in parameters between environments, particularly the difference in the replay buffer size.", "section": "Implementation Details"}, {"figure_path": "OSHaRf4TVU/tables/tables_17_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Agent Architecture Details.", "description": "This table details the architectures of the agents used in the experiments across different environments.  It specifies the components of the Transformer-based actor-critic architecture, including the timestep encoder, transformer dimensions and layers, number of transformer heads, context length, actor and critic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers, and the number of critic output bins used for classification in the indirect critic loss variation. The timestep encoders vary based on the input modality (e.g., image for Atari and Procgen, multi-modal for BabyAI, and fully connected for Meta-World and POPGym).", "section": "Implementation Details"}]
