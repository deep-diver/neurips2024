{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers studying recommender systems, fairness, and algorithmic collective action.  It demonstrates a novel approach to address the popularity bias problem, offering insights into strategic user behavior and its impact on algorithmic outcomes.  The findings open new avenues for research into user-driven manipulation of algorithms and the design of more robust and equitable systems.", "summary": "Fans can massively boost an artist's song exposure on music streaming platforms by strategically placing it in their playlists, achieving up to 40x more recommendations.", "takeaways": ["Small groups of users can significantly amplify an underrepresented artist's song recommendations by strategically placing their songs in playlists.", "The proposed strategies exploit statistical properties of recommendation algorithms and the long-tail nature of song distributions, offering a data-driven approach for achieving amplification.", "The strategies' externalities are minimal: overall recommendations remain largely unaffected, and gains are distributed across various artists."], "tldr": "Music recommendation systems often suffer from popularity bias, disproportionately promoting popular artists and hindering the discovery of lesser-known artists.  This creates an unfair and imbalanced environment within the music industry.  Many artists have limited opportunities for gaining exposure. Existing approaches, such as data poisoning or shilling, are often adversarial and can negatively impact system performance. This paper explores a novel approach to promote visibility.\nThe research introduces two strategies for algorithmic collective action, allowing a group of fans to significantly increase an artist's song recommendations by strategically inserting songs into their playlists.  The strategies leverage discontinuities in recommendations and the long-tail nature of song distributions, achieving impressive results: even small collectives can achieve a disproportionate increase in recommendations. The approach is demonstrated using a real-world music recommender system, showing significant improvements while causing minimal disruption to the overall system performance and user experience. This provides a powerful method for users to exert influence on algorithmic outcomes.", "affiliation": "University of Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Music"}, "podcast_path": "wGjSbaMsop/podcast.wav"}
