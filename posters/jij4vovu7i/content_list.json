To improve the efficiency while keeping the high performance, we present a novel perspective centered on per-segment classification. By harnessing the capabilities of Transformers, we tokenize each video segment as an instance token, endowed with intrinsic instance segmentation. To realize efficient action segmentation, we introduce BaFormer, a boundaryaware Transformer network. It employs instance queries for instance segmentation and a global query for class-agnostic boundary prediction, yielding continuous segment proposals. During inference, BaFormer employs a simple yet effective voting strategy to classify boundary-wise segments based on instance segmentation. Remarkably, as a single-stage approach, BaFormer significantly reduces the computational costs, utilizing only ${\\sim}6\\%$ of the running time compared to the state-of-the-art method DiffAct, while producing better or comparable accuracy over several popular benchmarks.

It has extensive applications in surveillance [11, 12], sports analytics [20], and human-computer interaction [38]. Despite its critical importance, existing TAS models often grapple with high computational costs and lengthy inference times, limiting their applicability in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The inefficiency of TAS arises from two primary factors:1) Long-form Input: Untrimmed videos in TAS often include tens of thousands of frames containing multiple action segments that ideally should be sparse in terms of action semantics. However, most approaches [15, 32, 21, 43] maintain frame-wise processing throughout the model to preserve dense information, aiming to enhance framewise prediction accuracy yet at the cost of efficiency. Conversely, the straightforward downsampling method [28] fails to achieve the desired accuracy for dense predictions. 2) Heavy Model Structure: The adoption of multi-stage refinement models and various time-consuming post-processing techniques further contribute to the slow runtime of TAS models. For instance, although a previous method [3] employs a single-stage model with transcripts to mitigate the heavy model structure, the algorithms used during post-processing remain time-intensive, as shown in Fig. 1.

Additionally, we aim to employ a single-stage model coupled with an appropriate post-processing method to minimize the running time. Benefiting from the query-based model, which allows information to be compressed into a limited number of queries, segments can be effectively represented as queries. By enabling each query to predict the corresponding class, start, and end, action segmentation can be seamlessly reframed as an action detection task. However, this significant compression of the long-form input adversely impacts the accuracy of dense predictions, as noted in [3]. To address the limitation, we draw inspiration from recent advances in mask classification-based image segmentation, particularly MaskFormer [10]. In TAS, rather than predicting frame-wise results directly, we propose using a set of queries to represent segments by decoupling their binary masks and their classes. The decoupling approach effectively conveys sparse information through limited queries, while preserving dense information via binary masks. Furthermore, the continuous nature of features in the temporal dimension introduces discontinuities in learning frame-wise masks. To address the issue of discontinuity, we introduce an additional query to learn boundaries, capturing global information with minimal computational overhead. The additional query should also facilitate efficient post-processing.

Despite these innovative efforts improving the performance, the reliance on multistage networks as the backbone structure leads to increased computation costs. Building on recent advancements, UVAST [3] introduces a query-based network [40] to predict transcripts, transitioning from a multi-stage to a single-stage network for frame-wise prediction, which results in a reduction of FLOPs compared to earlier methods.

We evaluate the impacts of different matching strategies as summarized in Table 1. We explored three matching approaches: Ordered Class Matching, Transcript Matching, Instance Matching. Instance\u2020 utilizes the minimum feasible query count (26) to align computational costs with the other methods. In the ordered class matching model, deterministic query-to-class assignments provide a transparent optimization trajectory during training. Its commendable performance reflects its effectiveness. Instance\u2020, which employs bipartite matching to correlate queries with unique segment instances, displays a slight decrease in performance relative to ordered class matching, with accuracy, F1 $@10$ , and Edit distance decreased by $1.8\\%$ , $2.8\\%$ , and $2.9\\%$ , respectively. This modest divergence implies that fixed query-to-class mappings may benefit training. However, unlike static class numbers, increasing the number of queries from 26 to 100 enhances the performance of the instance-based method. In contrast, the transcript matching strategy underperforms, evidenced by its considerable performance metric deficits. This technique, which encodes only the sequential information into each query, predisposes the queries towards positional grouping rather than convergent model learning, indicating that this is insufficient for coalescing actions into meaningful query clusters. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Effectiveness analysis of different kinds of global query. The global query generates boundaries that offer class-agnostic segment proposals essential for the query-based voting mechanism. We explore two approaches for deriving the global query: a class token and an average pooling token. The class token, like a class token in ViT [14], is learned at the beginning of the Transformer decoder, whereas the average pooling token is aggregated from instance queries by an average pooling operation. The comparative results of these approaches are presented in Table 2. When evaluating different strategies, it demonstrates that the class token is inferior to the average pooling token. We speculate that the superior performance of the average pooling token can be attributed to its benefti from intermediate, query-based supervision, unlike the class token, which relies exclusively on boundary supervision. This intermediate level of supervision likely results in finer temporal resolution and a more integrated global context, significantly improving the model\u2019s predictive accuracy.

BaFormer efficiently compresses videos into sparse representations, thereby reducing computational demands. To derive the final frame-wise results from the predictions of query classes, masks, and boundaries, we employ two voting strategies: frame-based, and query-based voting. These strategies correspond to voting on boundaries by queries, and frames, respectively (details are provided in supplemental material). The results of these voting strategies are presented in Table 3. Specifically, the query-based voting mechanism identifies the query contributing most significantly to a segment, treating each query as an integral unit. Conversely, the frame-based voting method, detailed in the supplemental material, determines the segment\u2019s class label based on the majority class across frames within the segment. According to the comparison detailed in Table 3, query-based voting significantly surpasses frame-based voting, showcasing improvements in running time and evaluation metrics. Specifically, accuracy obtains an enhancement of $1.8\\%$ . The edit score is increased by $5.6\\%$ , and $\\mathrm{F}1@50$ is improved by $6.7\\%$ . ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Further, we identify the reasons why query-based voting enhances the results and why it is superior to frame-based voting in Figure 6. Figure 6 comprises two parts.

Thus, the positions with a value of 1 indicate the presence of actions corresponding to the query class. Next, we apply different colors to these positions and each color represents a single action. Then query masks are stacked to form the top part. In the bottom part, we present video segment results of frame-based and query-based voting, along with the ground truth. The red arrow points towards a specific query within a segment proposal, illustrated between two vertical black dashed lines. The red dashed box shows the segment results within the proposal. Query-based voting can identify new action segments, in contrast to frame-based voting, which is limited to recognizing only the predefined action classes within a segment. As demonstrated in Figure 6, we highlight intervals where new actions are discerned that would not be apparent through smoothing of frame-wise results. We hypothesize that this is due to the voting process among segmental candidates, which is independent of class probability and focuses instead on the number of frames. This approach can rectify misclassifications inherent in frame-wise analysis that overemphasizes class probability.

To obtain boundaries quickly, we experiment with two techniques: Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and peak choice, with the corresponding results presented in Table 4.
