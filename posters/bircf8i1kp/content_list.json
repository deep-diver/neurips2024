Comparing the three vision models, we found that UniGarmentManip (UGM) have the best performance on Large-piece of garments.

As model have the understanding of deformation on garments, it is easier to detect keypoints required in Folding tasks and Fling tasks in diverse garment states. (2) The explicit design of cross-object representation consistency. UniGarmentManip use skeleton(a graph of keypoints) as the shared bridge for different garments with similar structures, which makes model have the ability to understand the topology of the 3D object in the same category. However, we found that this result is not as good as the original paper using PyFlex. This could be because we introduced the robot and the scene here, so some invalid selection points, such as those beyond the robot\u2019s reach or causing collisions, were considered unsuccessful. Additionally, while the original paper used only T-shirts, our study included jackets and other garments with front openings, this wider variety of clothes also increased the complexity of our task. For Affordance, we found that it performs well in Hanging tasks possibly because of its task-specific designed which makes it chooses the grasp points more accurately. In contrast, DIFT has poor performance on these three tasks especially on unfolding tasks due to the unawareness of garment deformations on 2D pretrained correspondence. This is reasonable because most objects in world for training do not have garment-level deformations. However, DIFT perfors better with small-piece garments like hats and gloves due to their minimal deformation, Besides, the pretrain model based on large diffusion model are more robust to rotation, which is crucial for handling small clothes.
