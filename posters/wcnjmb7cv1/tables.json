It compares the performance of the proposed Empowerment via Successor Representations (ESR) method against three baselines: Reward Inference, AvE (Assistance via Empowerment), and a random agent. The comparison is done across three different layouts of the Overcooked environment: Asymmetric Advantages, Coordination Ring, and Cramped Room.  The numbers represent the average reward achieved (\u00b1 standard error) by each method in each layout, illustrating the effectiveness of ESR, particularly in more complex scenarios.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
