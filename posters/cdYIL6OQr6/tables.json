The objective is to minimize the empirical risk as defined in Equation 1. We report the mean training loss (Rs) and mean test loss (RT), averaged over ten runs, along with their associated standard deviations.", "description": "This table presents the results of experiments conducted on four binary classification datasets (Ads, Breast Cancer, Heart, and MNIST) using mixtures of experts with different levels of local differential privacy (LDP). It shows the mean training and test losses (Rs and RT respectively) for a model without LDP and models with varying levels of LDP (epsilon values of 0.5, 2, 4, 5, and 10). The results are averaged over 10 runs and include standard deviations.", "section": "5 Experiments and results"}]
