In this work, we propose bit2bit, a new method for reconstructing high-quality image stacks at the original spatiotemporal resolution from sparse binary quanta image data. Inspired by recent work on Poisson denoising, we developed an algorithm that creates a dense image sequence from sparse binary photon data by predicting the photon arrival location probability distribution. However, due to the binary nature of the data, we show that the assumption of a Poisson distribution is inadequate. Instead, we model the process with a Bernoulli lattice process from the truncated Poisson. This leads to the proposal of a novel self-supervised solution based on a masked loss function. We evaluate our method using both simulated and real data. On simulated data from a conventional video, we achieve 34.35 mean PSNR with extremely photon-sparse binary input $(<\\!0.06$ photons per pixel per frame). We also present a novel dataset containing a wide range of real SPAD high-speed videos under various challenging imaging conditions.

Quanta image data is different from traditional digital images. The QIS raw data often consists of sparse detection events described in 1-bit arrays (Fig. 1). In each frame, pixels only indicate the presence or absence of a photon without intensity information [7]. This makes the data non-interpretable or usable as traditional images. A common approach to make effective use of the binary data is to bin the image in the time domain[8]. While this can provide clear images (Fig. 1c), it comes at the cost of losing the valuable high-temporal-resolution information offered by QIS.

Noise2Noise (N2N) demonstrated that it is possible to minimize the MSE loss between a pair of noisy images and still get quality denoising results without knowing the noise-free prior [25]. However, N2N still requires real data pairs with the same underlying signal, which are often not obtainable.

The methods create input and target training pairs from the original noisy image by assuming the augmentations minimally affect the underlying signal. Noise2Void (N2V)(2) predicts the value of random pixels in a noisy image by hiding these pixels during training and only using the surrounding context to minimize loss only from the hidden pixels [26, 27].

Subsequently, we can model the compound processes and the sub-processes within the framework of point process statistics and differentiate between photon counting and sector activation events (e.g., binary activations in each frame).

When we create a training pair and largely preserve the original information, we could either keep a positive in one image or move it to another image. Then, the sampling method essentially describes the spatial rule of splitting. For example, GAP uses binomial sampling to randomly drop out some photons. Self2Self [38] uses random binary masks to drop out some pixels, which is equivalent to GAP in 1-bit. N2S and N2V both select some pixels in the input and use them as a target [28, 27]. The pixels are replaced by a new value using various strategies, such as median, random, and random dropout, which usually remove the selected positive pixel and very occasionally create new positive pixels. If a fixed grid is used, the operation becomes spatial-dependent. In the cases of neighboring pixel-based methods [30, 31], image pairs are created by sub-sampling from a 2x2 grid, equivalent to a balanced spatial-dependent selection followed by downsampling.

Further analysis indicates that these three examples share a common issue: the input of the model is approximately a fixed binary pattern. In N2N, there is no variation between the input and target data. In N2V, we used a random grid to select the training target, but the grid size was relatively small, and most selected pixels were 0.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.   \n(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).   \n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
