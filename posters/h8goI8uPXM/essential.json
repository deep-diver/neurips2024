However, existing PTQ methods suffer from significant accuracy loss at low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit).  These methods often rely on heuristics to handle outliers or sensitive channels, which limits their generalizability and efficiency.\nThe proposed decoupleQ method tackles this issue by introducing a novel approach. It decouples model parameters into integer and floating-point parts, reformulating quantization as a mathematical constrained optimization problem.  This method is then solved using standard optimization techniques.  decoupleQ outperforms existing methods in accuracy, particularly at 2-bits, while offering hardware-friendliness due to its linear and uniform nature.  Its superior performance on large speech models demonstrates its practical value.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "h8goI8uPXM/podcast.wav"}
