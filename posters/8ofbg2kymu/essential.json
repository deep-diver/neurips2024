Neighborhood attention offers a solution by limiting each token's attention to its nearest neighbors, thereby reducing the quadratic complexity. However, existing neighborhood attention implementations have been hampered by limitations in infrastructure and performance, particularly in higher-rank spaces (2-D and 3-D). This has made it challenging to fully leverage its potential benefits.\nThis paper addresses these limitations by presenting two novel methods for implementing neighborhood attention. First, it demonstrates that neighborhood attention can be efficiently represented as a batched GEMM problem, leading to significant performance improvements (895% and 272% for 1-D and 2-D, respectively) compared to naive CUDA implementations.  Secondly, by adapting fused dot-product attention kernels, they develop fused neighborhood attention, allowing for fine-grained control over attention across spatial axes. **This reduces both the quadratic time and constant memory footprint associated with self-attention**.  The fused implementation shows dramatic speedups in half-precision (1759% and 958% for 1-D and 2-D, respectively) and improvements in model inference and training.", "affiliation": "SHI Labs @ Georgia Tech", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "8Ofbg2KYMu/podcast.wav"}
