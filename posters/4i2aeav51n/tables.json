It begins by computing approximate lower and upper bounds for variance estimations given a dataset, then utilizes the `AboveThreshold` algorithm (described elsewhere in the paper) to select an output close to the true variance. The output is scaled by a parameter, \u03b2, as part of the algorithm.  Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4, referenced in the algorithm, provide the methods for calculating the upper and lower bounds, respectively.", "section": "5 Private Variance Estimation"}]
