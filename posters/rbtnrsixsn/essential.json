These often utilize a one-query-one-trajectory approach, which may yield suboptimal results. This paper introduces the problem of the limitation of existing approaches. \n\nThe proposed DeMo framework addresses these challenges by decoupling multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries (capturing directional intentions) and state queries (tracking dynamic states).  It leverages combined attention and Mamba techniques for efficient information aggregation and state sequence modeling, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. This significantly improves the accuracy and detailed representation of future trajectories for autonomous driving.", "affiliation": "School of Data Science, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "rbtnRsiXSN/podcast.wav"}
