We study this question in the spiked cumulant model, where the statistician needs to recover a privileged direction or \u201cspike\u201d from the order- $p\\geq4$ cumulants of $d$ -dimensional inputs. We first discuss the fundamental statistical and computational limits of recovering the spike by analysing the number of samples $n$ required to strongly distinguish between inputs from the spiked cumulant model and isotropic Gaussian inputs.

In a classification task, the differences between inputs in different classes arise at different statistical levels of the inputs: two different classes of images will usually have different means, different covariances, and different higher-order cumulants (HOCs), which describe the non-Gaussian part of the correlations between three or more pixels. While differences in the mean and covariance allow for rudimentary classification, Refinetti et al. [1] recently highlighted the importance of HOCs for the performance of neural networks: when they removed the HOCs per class of the CIFAR10 training set, the test accuracy of various deep neural networks dropped by up to 65 percentage points. The importance of higher-order cumulants (HOCs) for classification in general and the performance of neural networks in particular raises some fundamental questions: what are the fundamental limits of learning from HOCs, i.e. how many samples $n$ (\u201csample complexity\u201d) are required to extract information from the HOCs of a data set? How many samples are required when using a tractable algorithm? And how do neural networks and other machine learning methods like random features compare to those fundamental limits?

Furthermore, all the higher-order cumulants (of order $p\\geq3\\,$ ) of the inputs are identically zero. Inputs in the second class are also isotropic, except for one special direction $u\\,\\in\\,\\mathbb R^{d}$ in which their distribution is different. This direction $u$ is often called a \u201cspike\u201d, and it can be encoded in different cumulants: for example, we could \u201cspike\u201d the covariance by drawing inputs from a Gaussian with mean zero and covariance $\\mathbb{1}+\\beta u\\hat{u}^{\\top}$ ; the signal-to-noise ratio $\\beta>0$ would then control the variance of $\\lambda=\\langle u,x\\rangle$ . Likewise, we could spike a higher-order cumulant of the distribution and ask: what is the minimal number of samples required for a neural network trained with SGD to distinguish between the two input classes?

Our LR analysis of the corresponding hypothesis test confirmed that data sampled from the spiked cumulant model could be statistically distinguishable (in the sense that it passes the second moment method for distinguishability) from isotropic Gaussian inputs at linear sample complexity, while the number of samples required to strongly distinguish the two distributions in polynomial time scales as $n\\,\\gtrsim\\,d^{2}$ for the class of algorithms covered by the low-degree conjecture [5\u20138], suggesting the existence of a large statisticalto-computational gap in this problem.

In the future, a key challenge will be extend this framework to null hypotheses that go beyond isotropic Gaussian distributions.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
