However, many real-world applications suffer from data scarcity, causing issues like overfitting and poor generalization. Existing methods that address this issue often rely on randomly selected parameter subsets and fixed masks, leading to suboptimal results. This research introduces Dynamic Neural Regeneration (DNR), a novel iterative training framework inspired by neurogenesis in the brain. \n\nDNR employs a data-aware dynamic masking scheme to identify and remove redundant connections, dynamically adapting the mask throughout training. By selectively reinitializing weights, DNR increases the model's learning capacity and enhances generalization. Experimental results on multiple datasets showcase DNR's superior performance compared to existing methods, highlighting its robustness and potential for solving real-world problems with limited data.", "affiliation": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qCpCy0EQAJ/podcast.wav"}
