Existing DAOD methods often struggle with domain shift, resulting in reduced performance on unseen data.  A common approach uses a domain-agnostic adapter to learn domain-invariant features, but this can lead to a bias towards the source domain and limit generalization.\n\nDA-Ada addresses this limitation by introducing a novel domain-aware adapter.  This adapter cleverly separates and integrates both domain-invariant and domain-specific knowledge.  This approach effectively reduces source domain bias, enabling significant performance improvements in DAOD tasks.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-Ada surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.**", "affiliation": "Intelligent Software Research Center, Institute of Software, CAS, Beijing, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "hkEwwAqmCk/podcast.wav"}
