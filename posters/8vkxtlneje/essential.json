However, existing methods often struggle with multi-class settings and high computational costs.  Single-class approaches require separate models for each class, leading to increased training and memory needs. While some multi-class methods exist, they often compromise accuracy or efficiency. \n\nMambaAD addresses these issues by utilizing the Mamba architecture, offering superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency. It comprises a pretrained encoder and a Mamba decoder with multi-scale Locality-Enhanced State Space modules.  These modules integrate Hybrid State Space blocks and multi-kernel convolutions, enabling effective capture of both long-range dependencies and local patterns.  Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University Youtu Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Anomaly Detection"}, "podcast_path": "8VKxTlnejE/podcast.wav"}
