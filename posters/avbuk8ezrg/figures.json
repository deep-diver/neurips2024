It uses two branches: one for topological detour (TD-MHSA) and one for functional connectivity (FC-MHSA).  Both branches employ multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture multi-modal features from structural and functional connectivity data. The TD-MHSA branch focuses on identifying neural pathways, while the FC-MHSA branch processes functional connectivity information.  A consistency constraint loss (LTD) ensures that both branches learn consistent representations.
