Existing approaches often lack the necessary biological grounding, limiting their ability to provide deeper insights into cognitive processes and disease mechanisms.  Furthermore, existing methods often struggle with the high degree of variability in brain functional connectivity data across subjects. \nNeuroPath addresses these challenges with a novel biological-inspired deep learning model. It uses a transformer-based architecture with a multi-head self-attention mechanism that explicitly considers multi-hop neural pathways, thus linking brain structure and function more effectively.  The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on large datasets, demonstrating improvements in cognitive task recognition and disease diagnosis.  Crucially, NeuroPath offers better explainability, visualizing these neural pathways to aid in understanding the underlying biological mechanisms.", "affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "AvBuK8Ezrg/podcast.wav"}
