The experiments use different numbers of clients, all sampling non-overlapping masks from the same distribution for training, and then test on unseen masks randomly sampled from all clients. The results show the average PSNR and SSIM values across multiple trials, demonstrating the relative effectiveness of each method.", "section": "3.2 Performance"}, {"figure_path": "zxSWIdyW3A/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 5: Performance comparison between FedAvg and FedHP on CACTI (e.g., C = 3).", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the performance of FedAvg and FedHP algorithms on the CACTI dataset with 3 clients.

The results indicate a slight performance improvement of FedHP over FedAvg on this specific dataset.", "section": "A.3 New Hardware"}]
