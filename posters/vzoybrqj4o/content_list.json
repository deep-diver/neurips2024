(1) In the first stage, we use Grounded-Segment-Anything [36], which combines state-of-the-art detection and segmentation models. We set the BOX_THRESHOLD and TEXT_THRESHOLD to 0.3 and 0.25, respectively, following the recommendations of the official code. We use \u201csky\u201d and \u201cwatermark\u201d as text prompts. All pixels with these labels are set to False to form our valid mask for the second stage of training. (2) In the second stage, each batch consists of an equal mix of labeled and unlabeled data. We follow the backbone model\u2019s official settings for batch size, learning rate, optimizer, augmentation, and other hyperparameters, changing only the loss function to affine-invariant loss. Unlike Depth Anything, which sets invalid sky regions to zero disparity, we ignore these invalid pixels during loss calculation, consistent with ground truth training settings. We average the loss for ground truth and pseudo ground truth during updates. All our experiments are conducted on a single RTX 4090, both offline and online. However, if future 360-degree state-of-the-art methods or perspective foundation models require higher VRAM usage, the computational resource requirements may increase.
