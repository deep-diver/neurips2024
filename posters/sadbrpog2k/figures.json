It shows how the points are arranged in a two-dimensional space to represent subsets of classifiers. Points closer to the origin correspond to smaller subsets. The key element is that the point corresponding to the hidden subset (S*) is uniquely positioned closer to the origin than other points of the same size. This unique position allows the reduction to work.", "section": "Missing Proofs of Section 3"}]
