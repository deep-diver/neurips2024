Existing algorithms either lack efficiency or fail to achieve the optimal regret.  This problem is further complicated by variations in reward structures across different algorithms.\nThis paper introduces OFU-MNL+, a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a matching upper bound to the established lower bound, demonstrating near-minimax optimality.  This is done by establishing tight regret bounds for both uniform and non-uniform reward scenarios. The algorithm's efficiency stems from an online parameter estimation technique coupled with an optimistic assortment selection approach. The findings show that the algorithm is efficient and improves regret as the assortment size K increases, unless the attraction parameter for the outside option vo scales linearly with K, providing valuable insights into assortment selection problems and efficient learning algorithms.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Q4NWfStqVf/podcast.wav"}
