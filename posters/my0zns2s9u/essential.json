Traditional methods either lack accuracy (analytical methods) or are too slow (Monte Carlo simulations).  This creates a critical need for efficient and accurate DRR generation techniques.\n\nThe paper proposes DDGS-CT, a novel method that combines physics-inspired X-ray simulation with efficient 3D Gaussian splatting.  **DDGS-CT disentangles the radiosity contribution into isotropic and direction-dependent components**, effectively modeling complex anisotropic interactions without intricate runtime simulations.  The **method also optimizes the 3D Gaussian splatting initialization** to account for tomography data properties, further enhancing accuracy and efficiency.  Experimental results demonstrate that DDGS-CT outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both image accuracy and runtime performance, paving the way for its use in real-time intraoperative applications.", "affiliation": "United Imaging Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "mY0ZnS2s9u/podcast.wav"}
