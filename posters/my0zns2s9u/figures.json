The process involves initialization, generating isotropic and anisotropic 3D Gaussian splatting point sets, then uses DDGS rendering to produce the final image.  This image is then used for intraoperative 2D/3D registration. This highlights the workflow from pre-operative CT scan data to the final 2D/3D registration step using the DDGS method.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "mY0ZnS2s9u/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of the different sampling strategies for 3DGS initialization.", "description": "This figure illustrates four different sampling strategies used to initialize the 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) representation for X-ray image generation.  It compares uniformly random sampling, evenly spaced sampling, marching cubes algorithm-based sampling which focuses on the surfaces between different materials, and a novel radiodensity-aware dual sampling (RADS) method which combines marching cubes and density-weighted sampling. RADS is the proposed method in the paper, aiming for better accuracy and efficiency by considering the properties of tomography data.", "section": "3.3 Initialization via Radiodensity-Aware Dual Sampling (RADS)"}, {"figure_path": "mY0ZnS2s9u/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Visualization of the Gaussian cloud optimization for different methods.", "description": "This figure visualizes the Gaussian cloud optimization process for three different methods: DDGS (Ours), 3DGS, and X-Gaussian.

It shows a simplified scenario with two isotropic Gaussians (giso) and two anisotropic Gaussians (gdir) along a ray.  The figure demonstrates that if the Gaussian sets are rendered separately, the anisotropic Gaussian (gdir1) behind the isotropic Gaussian (giso2) would incorrectly contribute to the overall ray absorption. Joint rasterization ensures that the correct occlusion relationships are accounted for, resulting in a more accurate representation of X-ray image formation.", "section": "Supplementary Material"}]
