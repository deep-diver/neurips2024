The naive approach involves computing the full covariance matrix, resulting in cubic computational complexity.  In contrast, PHYSS-GP uses a state-space representation, which allows for linear-time inference in the temporal dimension. This is illustrated by the different ways spatio-temporal data points are handled: the naive approach handles them in a way that leads to cubic complexity, while PHYSS-GP takes advantage of their structure for linear-time efficiency. The figure highlights the key difference in computational scaling between the two approaches.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "tCf7S75xFa/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Curl free synthetic example.
