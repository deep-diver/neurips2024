Current data-driven physics-informed models either lack computational efficiency or focus solely on temporal settings, limiting their application. This necessitates efficient methods for integrating physical constraints into models while maintaining scalability.\nThis paper introduces PHYSS-GP, a variational spatio-temporal state-space Gaussian process.  PHYSS-GP effectively addresses the limitations of current approaches by achieving linear-in-time computational costs while accurately modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and incorporating various physical constraints.  This is shown empirically across various tasks.  The method is highly flexible and recovers existing state-of-the-art methods as special cases.", "affiliation": "University of Warwick", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "tCf7S75xFa/podcast.wav"}
