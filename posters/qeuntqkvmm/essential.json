Traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods struggle with the accuracy and efficiency in such scenarios. This paper focuses on policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, specifically investigating the effectiveness of temporal difference (TD) learning, a powerful algorithm for sequential data analysis.  The study delves into the theoretical comparison between TD and MC, demonstrating that TD offers significant advantages, particularly in the context of rare event prediction. \nThe core of the research lies in proving a central limit theorem for the least-squares TD (LSTD) estimator in finite-state Markov chains.  The authors provide an upper bound on the relative asymptotic variance of the LSTD estimator, revealing that it scales polynomially with the number of states, contrasting sharply with the exponential scaling observed in MC methods.  This suggests that LSTD can achieve much higher accuracy with much less data than MC, especially when dealing with rare events. The paper further supports this theoretical analysis with detailed experiments on two specific problems (mean first passage time and committor function), which confirm the superior performance of LSTD, showcasing significant advantages in efficiency and accuracy.", "affiliation": "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QEUntqKvmm/podcast.wav"}
