The scores measure the correlation between ground-truth angles and angles computed from topologically optimized latent spaces.  The table compares these scores for experiments with and without diffeomorphic interpolation, demonstrating the improvement in correlation achieved using diffeomorphic interpolation.", "section": "4 Numerical experiments"}]
