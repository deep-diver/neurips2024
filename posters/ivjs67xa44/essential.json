However, these preferences are often unknown and need to be learned. Existing online matching algorithms primarily focus on welfare optimization (minimizing regret), overlooking crucial game-theoretic properties like stability.  Stable matchings are essential for long-term system reliability, as they prevent participants from seeking secondary markets.\nThis research introduces novel algorithms that leverage the structure of stable solutions to improve the probability of finding stable matchings. The study initiates a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity needed to find a stable matching and provides corresponding bounds.  Furthermore, experiments highlight the interesting interplay between stability and optimality, offering valuable insights for practical algorithm design.  **These contributions significantly advance the understanding and design of online two-sided matching markets.**", "affiliation": "Penn State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "IVjs67Xa44/podcast.wav"}
