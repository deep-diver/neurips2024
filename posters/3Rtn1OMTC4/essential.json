Current self-supervised pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) often only focus on static content, neglecting crucial temporal motion clues.  This limitation hinders effective robotic motor control. \nThis paper introduces STP, a novel visual pre-training framework that jointly performs spatial and temporal prediction using dual decoders.  By asymmetrically masking current and future frames, STP efficiently captures both static content and dynamic motion information.  Extensive experiments on 21 tasks (real-world and simulated) demonstrate STP's superior performance, generalizability, and data efficiency compared to existing PVRs.  The method shows the significant benefits of leveraging temporal cues and addresses previous limitations of solely relying on static features in robotics research.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "3Rtn1OMTC4/podcast.wav"}
