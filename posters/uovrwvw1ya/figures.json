The x-axis represents the tuning parameter (\u00b5) for the weighted auxiliary score approach, while the y-axis represents the average tree size.  The plot demonstrates that the neural network approaches significantly reduce the average tree size compared to the weighted auxiliary score method, suggesting superior cut selection performance. The results highlight the potential of neural networks in improving branch-and-cut efficiency.", "section": "A.2 Empirical results"}]
