This table presents the total time in seconds for 100 runs on a test set of 1,000 instances.", "description": "This table compares the computation time for three different cut selection methods: using a ReLU neural network on a GPU, using a ReLU neural network on a CPU, and using Gurobi to solve the required linear programs.  The results highlight the significantly faster computation time of the neural network approaches, particularly on a GPU, compared to solving linear programs.", "section": "A.2 Empirical results"}]
