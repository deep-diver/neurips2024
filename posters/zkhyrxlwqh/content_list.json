When image pairs are unaligned, or if the identity matrix is used as the homography, MACE typically exceeds $23\\,\\mathrm{px}$ . Thus, any method yielding MACE above this threshold can be considered unsuccessful in training. Most conventional unsupervised methods fail to train effectively on the benchmark datasets. UDHN [9], which directly compares $I^{B}$ and $\\widetilde{I}^{A}$ in pixel space, is highly sensitive to modality changes, resulting in failed training on most data sets except Google Earth [11]. Although the Google Earth dataset is multimodal, its image pairs have similar intensity distributions, allowing only limited training in pixel space. Similarly, CAU [36], which addresses only minor lighting variations, suffers from modality gaps and large displacements, leading to consistently low performance across all datasets, including Google Earth. biHomE [10], structurally similar to our method, uses an ImageNet [22] pre-trained ResNet-34 [21] as the encoder, which struggles with images outside the ImageNet distribution.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
