Existing methods often prioritize one over the other, leading to less-than-ideal results.  Non-rigid isometric and non-isometric transformations further complicate the process.\n\nHOPE tackles this by utilizing k-hop neighborhoods as pairwise descriptors, providing unique signatures for accurate matching. It combines this with local map distortion (LMD) to refine the initial match iteratively, focusing on poorly matched vertices.  The use of different k-hop neighborhoods aids smoothness, leading to a significant improvement over existing methods that rely solely on vertex-wise descriptors and handle various transformation types more effectively.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "1ziIqFo4Tj/podcast.wav"}
