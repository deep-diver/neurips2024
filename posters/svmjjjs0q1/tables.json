It shows the impact of controlling for confounding variables (identified using the proposed methods) on the accuracy of causal effect estimations.  Two causal graphs (G3 and G4) with varying sample sizes (1000-5000) are used to compare causal effect estimations with and without controlling for confounding factors. The difference between the true and estimated causal effects is measured, demonstrating the effectiveness of confounding control in improving the accuracy of causal effect estimations.
