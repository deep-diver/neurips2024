Relaxing the causal sufficiency and parametric assumptions and leveraging recent advancements in causal discovery and confounding analysis with non-i.i.d. data, we propose a comprehensive approach for detecting and measuring confounding. We consider various definitions of confounding and introduce tailored methodologies to achieve three objectives: (i) detecting and measuring confounding among a set of variables, (ii) separating observed and unobserved confounding effects, and (iii) understanding the relative strengths of confounding bias between different sets of variables.

Research efforts in causal inference hence rely on observational data to study causal relationships [44, 59, 65, 18, 41].

As exemplified with Simpson\u2019s paradox [58] and many other studies [20, 1, 31], the presence of confounding variables is an important quantitative explanation for why correlation does not imply causation. It is challenging to observe and measure all confounding variables in a scientific study [60, 44]. Identifying latent or unobserved confounding variables is even more challenging, and misinterpretation presents various challenges in downstream applications, such as discovering causal structures from observational data. Numerous methods operate under the assumption of causal sufficiency [45, 4, 60, 8, 51, 65], implying the non-existence of unobserved confounding variables. Causal sufficiency presupposes that all pertinent variables required for causal inference have been observed. However, this may not be a practical or testable assumption.

To tackle such challenges, recent endeavors show that using data from different environments helps in improved causal discovery [40, 38, 33, 45, 23], detecting causal mechanism shifts [36], and detecting unobserved confounding [29, 38].

We also study key properties of these measures. Our measures complement each other depending on the available context information. We propose algorithms to compute the proposed measures and empirically verify their correctness. However, for the same confounded pair of variables, our metrics may yield different results depending on the chosen measure. As discussed in the introduction, the measures are intended to assess the relative strengths of confounding rather than for point-to-point comparison. The number of contexts required to evaluate the measure can be large because many contexts without changes in particular mechanisms are discarded. Identifying appropriate real-world datasets and applying the proposed measures to those datasets is an interesting area for future work, as is developing measures that efficiently use context information. Additionally, devising new definitions for confounding and proposing corresponding confounding measures is also an interesting future direction. We aim to pursue these ideas.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
