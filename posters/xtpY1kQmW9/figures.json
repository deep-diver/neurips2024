The left panel displays a classic Rubin vase, where the image can be perceived as either a vase or two faces looking at each other. The right panel shows the same image, but with the colors inverted (black and white swapped). This highlights the ambiguity inherent in the perception of the image, a key concept in the paper's exploration of dual Bayesian decisions. The ambiguity demonstrates how both sender and receiver might have different interpretations, requiring collaboration to establish shared understanding.", "section": "Dual decisions"}, {"figure_path": "xtpY1kQmW9/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: A slightly enlarged example from the MNIST dataset showing a handwritten digit (4).", "description": "This figure shows a single example from the MNIST dataset, which is used in the paper's experiments.  The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits. This particular image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of the digit '4'. It is presented enlarged to better illustrate the characteristics of the data used in the paper's experiments.", "section": "A Appendix / supplemental material"}, {"figure_path": "xtpY1kQmW9/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Grid search results for MNIST", "description": "This figure shows the results of a grid search for optimal hyperparameters (learning rate and momentum weight) using the MNIST dataset. The grid search was performed using 10-fold cross-validation.  Each cell in the heatmap represents the performance (accuracy) of a specific combination of learning rate and momentum weight.  Lighter colors indicate higher accuracy.  The figure helps to visualize the impact of the two hyperparameters on the model's performance, indicating an optimal region within the grid.", "section": "A.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "xtpY1kQmW9/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Grid search results for MNIST", "description": "This figure shows the results of a grid search performed on the MNIST dataset to find optimal hyperparameters for a convolutional neural network (CNN).  The grid search varied momentum weight and learning rate. The color of each cell in the grid represents the accuracy achieved for the corresponding combination of hyperparameters. Lighter colors indicate higher accuracy.  Green rectangles highlight the top ten performing hyperparameter pairs, while a blue rectangle denotes the best-performing pair.  This visual representation aids in identifying the optimal hyperparameters for training CNNs on MNIST.", "section": "A.2 Results"}]
