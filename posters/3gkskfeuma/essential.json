This necessitates efficient alternatives capable of matching the performance of large models.  Existing spatial shift operators, though efficient, suffer from information loss in image restoration, thus limiting their effectiveness.\nThe proposed Deep Fourier Shifting operator addresses this by moving the shift operation into the Fourier domain, achieving information-lossless Fourier cycling.  Two variants\u2014amplitude-phase and real-imaginary\u2014are introduced, demonstrating improved performance on image denoising, low-light enhancement, super-resolution, and deblurring across various datasets.  The operator's plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration into existing networks with minimal parameter increases, reducing computational cost.", "affiliation": "AIRI", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Restoration"}, "podcast_path": "3gKsKFeuMA/podcast.wav"}
