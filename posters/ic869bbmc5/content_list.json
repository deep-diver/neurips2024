Conversely, Gaussians with incorrect geometry learn lower opacity and are subsequently culled during the next maintenance phase.

Therefore, its editing capability is constrained by the underlying diffusion model.

Additionally, ProEdit relies on 3DGS for efficient training, which NeRF-based representations do not support; consequently, it inherits certain limitations of 3DGS, including limited suitability for unbounded outdoor scenes.

There are many promising directions to explore in subtask decomposition beyond the interpolation-based strategy introduced in this paper. One potential way is to explicitly construct intermediate subtasks using semantic guidance. For example, applying \u201cTurn him into a bald person\u201d before \u201cMake him wear a hat\u201d could lead to a more free-form hat independent of the hair, with such intermediate instructions generated by large language models. Another alternative avenue involves leveraging video generation models to \u201canimate\u201d the transition from the original scene to the edited scene, treating this animation process as a series of subtasks. Doing so will enable ProEdit to function as a 3D scene animator, generating high-quality 4D (dynamic 3D) scenes.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
