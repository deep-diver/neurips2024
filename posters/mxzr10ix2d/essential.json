Existing methods often prioritize perception over reasoning, using simple neural networks that struggle with lane detection inaccuracies and endpoint variations.  This leads to unreliable and incomplete lane topology estimations. \nTopoLogic addresses these issues with a novel, interpretable approach. It combines geometric distance calculations between lanes, which are robust to endpoint shifts, with a semantic similarity measure based on lane queries. **This dual-space approach** delivers a more comprehensive understanding of lane connectivity, outperforming existing models significantly on the OpenLane-V2 dataset. The method is also easily integrated into existing systems without extensive retraining, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous driving technology.", "affiliation": "Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "MXzr10iX2d/podcast.wav"}
