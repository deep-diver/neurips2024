However, a major challenge is their unidentifiability\u2014multiple sets of parameters can generate the same data, hindering model interpretation and generalization. Existing studies have primarily focused on improving the learning of these models without addressing this identifiability issue. This paper presents a first theoretical investigation into the identifiability of hybrid DGMs and reveals that the existing methods using unconditional priors fail to guarantee identifiability.\nThe researchers propose a novel solution to this problem: meta-learning. By formulating the learning process as a meta-learning task, they establish the identifiability of hybrid DGMs. This is achieved by enforcing conditional independence among latent variables given few-shot context samples, a method inspired by nonlinear ICA. Their findings are supported by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior identifiability and improved performance in predicting unseen data compared to other methods.  This work contributes a new framework for building identifiable DGMs.", "affiliation": "Rochester Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "SXy1nVGyO7/podcast.wav"}
