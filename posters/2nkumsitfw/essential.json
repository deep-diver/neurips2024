This introduces a significant challenge: noisy labels. Existing methods attempt to estimate the true label posterior but may overlook potential misspecifications, leading to decreased model accuracy. This is especially problematic in high-noise scenarios.\nThis paper tackles this issue by proposing a novel approach: conditional distributionally robust optimization (CDRO).  CDRO minimizes the worst-case risk by considering a range of possible distributions. The paper develops an efficient algorithm for CDRO, including a novel robust pseudo-labeling technique and a method for adaptive Lagrange multiplier selection.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "affiliation": "University of Western Ontario", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2NKumsITFw/podcast.wav"}
