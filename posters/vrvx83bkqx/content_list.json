One key idea behind SACPO, supported by theory, is that the optimal policy incorporating reward and safety can be directly obtained from a reward-aligned policy. Building on this key idea, SACPO aligns LLMs step-wise with each metric while leveraging simple yet powerful alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO).

Finally, Figure 2(c) shows the effectiveness of P-SACPO proposed in Section 6, showing that P-SACPO performs better than the na\u00efve method that simply averages the weights of DPO (H) and DPO (S). Linear model merging allows us to balance helpfulness and harmlessness by averaging reward-aligned and conservatively safety-realigned policies without optimizing new ones.

SACPO takes a stepwise approach that sequentially aligns an LM policy using off-the-self alignment algorithms (e.g., DPO, KTO) and datasets for each metric. This procedure is theoretically justified and provides many practical benefits such as simplicity, stability, and flexibility. Our theoretical results include the upper bounds regarding near-optimality and safety constraint violations. Empirically, SACPO performs better than Safe RLHF in enhancing helpfulness and harmlessness, and we further show the effectiveness of a practical variant called P-SACPO based on linear model merging.

First, while we evaluate SACPO using the models with 7B parameters, there is room for discussion on whether SACPO works well for state-of-the-art models with many more parameters. Second, although this paper focuses on safety alignment from the perspective of RLHF or DPO, it is more desirable to additionally incorporate the standard SFT as well as pre-check and post-check strategies. Finally, although SACPO is more efficient than existing methods, it still requires substantial computational cost or a large amount of high-quality data.

We believe SACPO contributes to the safety or trustworthiness of LLMs and will reduce the barrier to aligning future LLMs to enhance the benefits of AI while minimizing negative impacts.
