These supervised methods rely on manual annotations, i.e. each object instance is indicated by a bounding box and a class label. However, a massive amount of labeled training data is usually required for training those models, while labeling is expensive and laborious. This raises the question of how object detection models can be trained without direct supervision from manual labels.

For camera images, recent work [4, 21] shows that the emergent behavior of models trained with self-supervised representation learning can be used for object discovery, i.e. object localization without determining a class label. The behavior implies that the learned features of those models contain information about the semantic segmentation of an image, and thus, they can be used to distinguish foreground from background. Consequently, the extracted coarse object masks are used to train 2D object detectors [22, 26]. Although these methods perform well for images depicting a few instances with a clear background, they fail to achieve high performance for images with many instances, such as autonomous driving scenes [27].

Hence, temporal information is often exploited to identify dynamic points that most likely belong to mobile objects such as cars and pedestrians. In this context, we define mobile objects as objects that have the potential to move. Consequently, objects such as buildings and trees are considered non-mobile classes. The discovery of static foreground instances (e.g. parked cars and standing pedestrians) is usually achieved by performing self-training. Self-training is based on the assumption that a detector trained on dynamic objects has difficulty discriminating between the static and dynamic versions of the same object type. As a result, when such a detector is used for inference, it will also detect many static instances.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
