Existing iterative self-training approaches are computationally expensive and prone to confirmation bias. The imbalance between static and dynamic object data distribution also degrades model performance. This paper proposes a new approach. \nThe proposed method, UNION, simultaneously leverages LiDAR, camera, and temporal data to overcome these limitations. It uses spatial clustering and self-supervised scene flow to identify object proposals, and encodes their visual appearances. Then it distinguishes static foreground objects from background via visual similarity, using dynamic objects as references. Finally, it trains a multi-class detector using generated pseudo-bounding boxes and pseudo-class labels obtained from the appearance embeddings. This eliminates the need for iterative self-training, leading to increased efficiency and improved accuracy.", "affiliation": "Delft University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "93gz2lmFtm/podcast.wav"}
