(16) and our choice of sub-differentials", "description": "This figure shows a graphical illustration of how the algorithm's dynamics are influenced by equation 16 and the specific sub-differential choices made. Each cell in the grid represents a step in the algorithm's execution, visualizing how the coordinate values change in response to the selected sub-gradients.  The dark-shaded blocks correspond to activated coordinates and their relative magnitudes. The arrows indicate the transitions between steps. The smiley face in the bottom right corner symbolizes the convergence of the algorithm.", "section": "4 Technical Overview"}]
