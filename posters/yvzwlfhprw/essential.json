This issue is particularly prominent in complex tasks and safety-critical domains. Current techniques to address this problem usually employ discretization or penalization, which can limit performance. \nThis research introduces three continuous action masking methods to enhance RL training.  These methods intelligently constrain exploration by only considering relevant actions determined using task knowledge and system dynamics. The generator, ray, and distributional masking methods are evaluated, showcasing their efficiency and effectiveness in reaching higher rewards and converging faster than the baseline without masking.  The paper provides theoretical derivations for integrating the masking methods into the RL process, enhancing the algorithm's predictability.
