Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In this paper, we introduce a spatialspectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition. Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion. Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches. The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method. It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently.

On the WorldView-3 dataset, we evaluate the performance of SSDiff using 20 test images. The results for both reduced-resolution and full-resolution are presented in Table 1. The running time of a single picture during the sampling process is 7.417 seconds under 10 timesteps. We compared our method with three traditional methods and some SOTA DL-based methods. To illustrate the performance of each method more clearly, we presented the fusion result images and error maps of some of these methods in Fig. 5, and zoomed in on a specific location. On average, our method achieves SOTA performance on the reduced dataset, with our SSDiff reaching 2.84 (SAM) and 2.10 (ERGAS) metrics, outperforming all DL-based methods. The error map indicates that the images sampled by SSDiff are closer to the ground truth (GT). SSDiff achieves SOTA performance in obtaining full-resolution images on the WV3 dataset. The HQNR score close to 1 indicates better fusion quality of the full-resolution images. The obtained results demonstrate that our SSDiff can fuse HrMSI, reducing spatial and spectral distortions, thereby proving its excellent generalization ability at full resolution.

V3) Spatial and spectral branch structure and decoupling inputs, only the outputs of the two branches are concatenated without any inter-branch information interaction.

We design a spatial-spectral integrated model architecture, which utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately. By introducing vector projection, the spatial and spectral components in the subspace decomposition are further specified in the proposed APFM. Then, the self-attention mechanism is naturally generalized to the APFM. Furthermore, we propose an FMIM to modulate the frequency distribution between branches. Finally, the two branches of SSDiff can capture discriminating features. It is interesting that, when utilizing the proposed L-BAF method in the APFM, the two branches can be updated alternately, and then SSDiff produces more satisfactory results. We compare our SSDiff with several SOTA pansharpening methods on the WorldView-3, QuickBird, GaoFen-2, and WorldView-2 datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively.
