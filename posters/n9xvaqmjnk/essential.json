Existing approaches to mitigate this vulnerability using vision-language models often suffer from high adaptation costs, suboptimal text supervision, and poor generalization. These issues are particularly pronounced in low-data scenarios like few-shot learning.\nThis research introduces a novel Few-shot Adversarial Prompt learning (FAP) framework that addresses these limitations.  FAP learns adversarially correlated text supervision directly from adversarial examples and uses a new training objective to enhance the consistency of multi-modal features while improving uni-modal distinction. This strategy achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1% of training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for enhancing the robustness of vision-language models in real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Sydney AI Centre\nUniversity of Sydney", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "n9xVaQMJNK/podcast.wav"}
