Existing methods, including dynamic sparse training (DST), often struggle with training convergence and generalization performance, especially at high sparsity levels. This is exacerbated by the **highly skewed label distributions** often found in real-world XMC datasets.\n\nThe researchers introduce SPARTEX, a novel approach that integrates DST with semi-structured sparsity and an auxiliary loss function.  **Semi-structured sparsity** improves computational efficiency, while the **auxiliary loss** stabilizes gradient flow during the initial training phase, mitigating the challenges of poor gradient propagation.  The results demonstrate **significant memory savings** compared to dense models, while maintaining competitive performance, even on datasets with millions of labels.
