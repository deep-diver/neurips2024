Existing methods often fail to generalize well to unseen target domains. This paper explores a novel approach focusing on frequency components of images. It observes that filtering specific frequencies significantly improves segmentation accuracy, sometimes as much as 14%.\nThe researchers propose a lightweight frequency masker comprising an Amplitude-Phase Masker (APM) and an Adaptive Channel Phase Attention (ACPA) module.  APM effectively reduces inter-channel correlation while ACPA enhances channel disentanglement, leading to improved robustness and larger activated regions for segmentation. The method is simple, effective, and requires minimal parameter addition, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.  The lightweight design makes it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "GCmmy4At6i/podcast.wav"}
