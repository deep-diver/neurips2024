The MMC represents the average magnitude of activation across all channels within the feature maps for each image in the datasets.  The graph plots the MMC values against the channel index. By comparing the MMC curves with and without frequency masking, it demonstrates that for datasets where the masking improved performance, the resulting MMC curve is lower, indicating a more uniform activation across channels after filtering. This uniformity across channels suggests a reduction in channel redundancy and improved generalizability.", "section": "2 Interpreting Enhanced Performance from Frequency Filtering"}, {"figure_path": "GCmmy4At6i/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: (a) After masking certain frequency components, the model's attention regions are enlarged with more patterns encompassed.
