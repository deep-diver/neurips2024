Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (ACF) is a defense mechanism that uses adversarial training to improve robustness, but its theoretical understanding and potential for improvement remain unclear.  Previous ACF methods lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation and use a uniform perturbation magnitude for all users.\nThis paper bridges this gap by providing a theoretical analysis showing that ACF can achieve lower recommendation errors compared to traditional CF.  It then proposes Personalized Magnitude Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (PamaCF), which applies personalized perturbation magnitudes based on users' embedding scales to further enhance ACF's effectiveness.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PamaCF effectively defends against various poisoning attacks while significantly improving recommendation performance.", "affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "k8AYft5ED1/podcast.wav"}
