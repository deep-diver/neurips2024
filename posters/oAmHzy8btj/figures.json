It starts with a parent Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph G.  Then, m graphs (G1, G2,... Gm) are created by independently subsampling edges from G with probability s. Finally, graphs G2 through Gm are permuted according to random permutations (\u03c012, \u03c013,... \u03c01m) to create the final set of m correlated graphs.", "section": "Subsampling model"}, {"figure_path": "oAmHzy8btj/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Regions in parameter space.

The orange region indicates where it's impossible to exactly match all m graphs, even with all m graphs available.  The blue region shows the conditions where exact matching of only two graphs is possible using just those two graphs. The striped region highlights a unique scenario: it's impossible to match two graphs only using those two graphs, however, it becomes possible to match all m graphs when utilizing information from all m graphs. This illustrates how leveraging information from multiple graphs can improve the ability to recover the underlying correspondence between them.", "section": "Main Results and Algorithm"}, {"figure_path": "oAmHzy8btj/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Matching through transitive closure", "description": "This figure shows the performance of two graph matching algorithms, GRAMPA and Degree Profiles, when combined with the transitive closure approach for multiple graph matching.  The x-axis represents the number of graphs (m), and the y-axis shows the percentage of correctly matched nodes in graph G1.  Multiple lines are shown for different subsampling probabilities (s).  The plot demonstrates that leveraging information from multiple graphs significantly improves the accuracy of node matching, even when individual pairwise graph matching is inaccurate.", "section": "3.1 Algorithms for exact recovery"}]
