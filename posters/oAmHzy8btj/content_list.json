For instance, the   \n14 network structure of two social networks such as Facebook and Twitter is correlated because users are   \n15 likely to connect with the same individuals in both networks. This wealth of correlated data presents   \n16 both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, information from various datasets can be combined   \n17 to increase the fidelity of data - translating to better performance in downstream learning tasks. On the   \n18 other hand, the interconnected nature of this data also raises privacy and security concerns. Linkage   \n19 attacks, for instance, exploit correlated data to identify individuals in an anonymized network by   \n20 linking to other sources [NS09]. This poses a significant threat to user privacy.   \n21 Graph matching is the problem of recovering the underlying latent correspondence between corre  \n22 lated networks. The problem finds many applications in machine learning: de-anonymizing social   \n23 networks [NS08,NS09], identifying similar functional components between species by matching   \n24 their protein-protein interaction networks [BSI06,KHGPM16], object detection [SS05] and track  \n25 ing $[\\bar{\\mathrm{YYL}}^{+}16]$ in computer vision, and textual inference for natural language processing [HNM05]. In   \n26 most applications of interest, data is available in the form of several correlated networks. For instance,   \n27 social media users are active each month on 6.7 social platforms on average [Ind23]. Similarly,   \n28 reconciling protein-protein interaction networks among multiple species is an important problem in   \n29 computational biology [SXB08]. As a first step toward this objective, many research works have   \n30 studied the problem of matching two correlated graphs.

Pedarsani and Grossglauser [PG11] introduced the subsampling   \n34 model to generate two such correlated graphs. The model entails twice subsampling each edge   \n35 independently from a parent ER graph to obtain two sibling graphs, both of which are marginally   \n36 ER graphs themselves. The goal is then to match nodes between the two graphs to recover the   \n37 underlying latent correspondence. This has been the framework of choice for many works that study   \n38 graph matching. For example, Cullina and Kiyavash studied the problem of exactly matching two   \n39 ER graphs, where the objective is to match all vertices correctly [CK16,CK17]. They identified a   \n40 threshold phenomenon for this task: exact recovery is possible if the problem parameters are above a   \n41 threshold, and impossible otherwise. Subsequently, threshold phenomena were also identified for   \n42 partial graph matching between ER graphs - where the objective is to match only a positive fraction   \n43 of nodes [GML21,HM23,WXY22,DD23]. The case of almost-exact recovery - where the objective   \n44 is to match all but a negligible fraction of nodes - was studied by Cullina and co-authors: a necessary   \n45 condition for almost exact recovery was identified, and it was shown that the same condition is also   \n46 sufficient for the $k$ -core estimator [CKMP19]; the estimator is described formally in Section 3. This   \n47 estimator proved useful to uncover the fundamental limits for graph matching in other contexts such   \n48 as the stochastic block model [GRS22] and inhomogeneous random graphs [RS23]. Ameen and   \n49 Hajek [AH23] showed some robustness properties of the $k$ -core estimator in the context of matching   \n50 ER graphs under node corruption. The estimator plays an important role in the present work as well.   \n51 A sound understanding of ER graphs inspires algorithms for real-world networks. Various efficient al  \n52 gorithms have been proposed, including algorithms based on the spectrum of the graph adjacency ma  \n53 trices [FMWX22], node degree and neighborhood based algorithms [DCKG19,DMWX21,MRT23] as   \n54 well as algorithms based on iterative methods [DL23] and counting subgraphs [MWXY23,BCL $^+19]$ .   \n55 Some of these are discussed in Section 5 in relation to the present work.   \n56 Incorporating information from multiple graphs to match them has been recognized as an important   \n57 research direction, for instance in the work of Gaudio and co-authors [GRS22]. To our knowledge,   \n58 the only other papers to consider matchings among multiple graphs are the works of Josephs and   \n59 co-authors [JLK21], and of R\u00e1cz and Sridhar [RS21]. However, these works have different objectives   \n60 and are not concerned with the fundamental limits for matching $m$ graphs. In fact, both works note   \n61 that it is possible to exactly match $m$ graphs whenever it is possible to exactly match any two graphs   \n62 by pairwise matching all the graphs exactly. In contrast, we show that under appropriate conditions, it   \n63 is possible to exactly match $m$ ER graphs even when no two graphs can be pairwise matched exactly.   \n64 Contributions In this work, we investigate the problem of combining information from multiple   \n65 correlated networks to boost the number of nodes that are correctly matched among them. We   \n66 consider the natural generalization of the subsampling model to generate $m$ correlated random graphs,   \n67 and identify a threshold such that it is impossible for any algorithm to match all nodes correctly   \n68 across all graphs when the problem parameters are below this threshold. Conversely, we show that   \n69 exact recovery is possible above the threshold. This characterization generalizes known results for   \n70 exact graph matching when $m=2$ . Subsequently, we show that there is a region in parameter space   \n71 for which exactly matching any two graphs is impossible using only the two graphs, and yet exact   \n72 graph matching is possible among $m>2$ graphs using all the graphs.   \n73 We present two algorithms and prove their optimality for this task. The first algorithm matches all $m$   \n74 graphs simultaneously based on global information about the graphs. In contrast, the second algorithm   \n75 first pairwise matches graphs, and then combines them to match all nodes across all graphs. We show   \n76 that both algorithms correctly match all the graphs all the way down to the information theoretic   \n77 threshold. Finally, we illustrate through simulation that our subroutine to combine information from   \n78 pairwise comparisons between networks works well when paired with efficient algorithms for graph   \n79 matching. Our analysis also yields some theoretical results about the $k$ -core of ER graphs that are of   \n80 independent interest.

It is instructive to   \n184 visualize this using transitivity graphs.   \n185 Definition 6 (Transitivity graph, $\\mathcal{H}(v))$ . For each node $v\\in V$ , let $\\mathcal{H}(v)$ denote the graph on the vertex   \n186 set $\\{g_{1},\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot,g_{m}\\}$ such that an edge $\\{g_{i},g_{j}\\}$ is present in $\\mathcal{H}(v)$ if and only i $f v\\in\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G_{i}^{\\prime}\\wedge G_{j}^{\\prime})$ .   \n187 On the event that each instance of pairwise matching using the $k$ -core is correct, the edge $\\{g_{i},g_{j}\\}$   \n188 is present in $\\mathcal{H}(v)$ if and only if $v$ is correctly matched using the $k$ -core estimator between $G_{i}$ and   \n189 $G_{j}$ , i.e. $\\pi_{1i}^{*}(v)$ is matched to $\\pi_{1j}^{*}(v)$ . Thus, in order for Step 2 to succeed (i.e. to exactly match all   \n190 vertices across all graphs), it suffices that the graph $\\mathcal{H}(v)$ is connected for each node $v\\in V$ . However,   \n191 studying the connectivity of the transitivity graphs is challenging because in any graph $\\mathcal{H}(v)$ , no   \n192 two edges are independent. This is because the $k$ -cores of any two intersection graphs $G_{a}^{\\prime}\\wedge G_{b}^{\\prime}$ and   \n193 $G_{c}^{\\prime}\\wedge\\bar{G}_{d}^{\\prime}$ are correlated, because all the graphs $G_{a},G_{b},G_{c}$ and $G_{d}$ are themselves correlated. To   \n194 overcome this, we introduce another graph $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{H}}(v)$ that relates to $\\mathcal{H}(v)$ and is amenable to analysis.   \n195 Definition 7.

The events $\\{v\\not\\in\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G)\\}$ and   \n399 $\\{\\delta_{G}(v)\\geq k+1/\\alpha\\}$ are highly negatively correlated. However, consider the subgraph $(G-v)$ of   \n400 $G$ induced on the vertex set $V-\\{v\\}$ , and note that the $k$ -core of this subgraph does not depend on   \n401 the degree of $v$ . Furthermore, if $\\dot{v}\\not\\in\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G)$ , then it must be that $v$ has fewer than $k$ neighbors in   \n402 $\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)$ . Intuitively, this event has low probability if $\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)$ is sufficiently large.   \n403 Notice that $(G-v)\\sim\\mathsf{E R}(n-1,\\alpha\\log(n)/n)$ , and so standard results about the size of the $k$ -core   \n404 of Erd\u02ddos-R\u00e9nyi graphs apply. However, we require the error probability that the $k$ -core of $G-v$   \n405 is too small to be $o(1/n)$ - this is crucial since we will later use a union bound over all the nodes   \n406 $v$ . Unfortunately, standard results such as [\u0141uc91] can only be invoked directly to show that the   \n407 corresponding probability is $o(1)$ , which is insufficient for our purpose. Later in this section, we   \n408 refine the analysis in [\u0141uc91] to obtain the desired convergence rate. The refinement culminates in   \n409 the following.   \n410 Lemma 14. Let $\\alpha>0$ and $G\\sim\\mathsf E\\mathsf{R}(n,\\alpha\\log(n)/n)$ . Let v be a node of $G$ .

It remains to study the error event that $v$   \n413 has too few neighbors in $\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)$ . To count the number of neighbors of $v$ in $\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)$ ,   \n414 we exploit the independence of $\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)$ and $v$ as follows: each neighbor of $v$ is considered   \n415 a success if it belongs to $\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)$ and a failure otherwise. Counting the number of successes   \n416 is equivalent to sampling with replacement $\\delta_{G}(v)$ elements, each of which is independently a   \n417 success with probability $\\lvert\\mathsf{c o r e}_{k}(G-v)\\rvert/\\left(n-1\\right)$ . The number of successes then follows precisely a   \n418 hypergeometric distribution. This intuition is made rigorous in the proof below.   \n419 Let us recall some facts about the hypergeometric distribution because it plays an important role in   \n420 the proof. Denote by ${\\mathsf{H y p G e o m}}(N,K,n)$ a random variable that counts the number of successes in   \n421 a sample of $n$ elements drawn without replacement from a population of $N$ individuals, of which   \n422 $K$ elements are considered successes. Note that if this sampling were done with replacement, then   \n423 the number of successes would follow a Bin $(n,K/N)$ distribution.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

", "page_idx": 22}, {"type": "text", "text": "706 \u2022 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,   \n707 call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)   \n708 \u2022 The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).   \n709 \u2022 It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error   \n710 of the mean.   \n711 \u2022 It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should   \n712 preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a $96\\%$ CI, if the hypothesis   \n713 of Normality of errors is not verified.   \n714 \u2022 For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or   \n715 figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative   \n716 error rates).   \n717 \u2022 If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how   \n718 they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.   \n719 8. Experiments Compute Resources   \n720 Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com  \n721 puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce   \n722 the experiments?   \n723 Answer: [NA]   \n724 Justification: The simulations are classical Monte-Carlo simulations that do not require   \n725 extensive runtime or hardware.   \n726 Guidelines:   \n727 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n728 \u2022 The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,   \n729 or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.   \n730 \u2022 The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual   \n731 experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.   \n732 \u2022 The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute   \n733 than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that   \n734 didn\u2019t make it into the paper).   \n735 9. Code Of Ethics   \n736 Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the   \n737 NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?   \n738 Answer: [Yes]   \n739 Justification: The Code of Ethics was strictly adhered to during all stages of this research.   \n740 Guidelines:   \n741 \u2022 The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.   \n742 \u2022 If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a   \n743 deviation from the Code of Ethics.   \n744 \u2022 The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid  \n745 eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).   \n746 10. Broader Impacts   \n747 Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative   \n748 societal impacts of the work performed?   \n749 Answer: [Yes]   \n750 Justification: The potential for graph matching through transitive closure is motivated   \n751 through its application to social network de-anonymization.   \n752 Guidelines:   \n753 \u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n754 \u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal   \n755 impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.   \n756 \u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses   \n757 (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations   \n758 (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific   \n759 groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.   \n760 \u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied   \n761 to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to   \n762 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n763 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n764 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n765 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n766 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n767 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n768 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n769 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n770 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n771 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n772 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n773 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n774 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n775 11. Safeguards   \n776 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible   \n777 release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,   \n778 image generators, or scraped datasets)?   \n779 Answer: [NA]   \n780 Justification: The paper poses no such risks.   \n781 Guidelines:   \n782 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.   \n783 \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with   \n784 necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring   \n785 that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing   \n786 safety filters.   \n787 \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors   \n788 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n789 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n790 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n791 faith effort.   \n792 12. Licenses for existing assets   \n793 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in   \n794 the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and   \n795 properly respected?   \n796 Answer: [Yes]   \n797 Justification: The subroutines for GRAMPA and Degree Profiles have been cited.   \n798 Guidelines:   \n799 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.   \n800 \u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.   \n801 \u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a   \n802 URL.   \n803 \u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.   \n804 \u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of   \n805 service of that source should be provided.   \n806 \u2022 If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the   \n807 package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets   \n808 has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the   \n809 license of a dataset.

New Assets   \n15 Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation   \n16 provided alongside the assets?   \n817 Answer: [NA]   \n18 Justification: The paper does not release new assets.   \n19 Guidelines:   \n820 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.   \n821 \u2022 Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their   \n822 submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,   \n823 limitations, etc.   \n824 \u2022 The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose   \n825 asset is used.   \n826 \u2022 At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either   \n827 create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.   \n828 14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects   \n829 Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper   \n830 include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as   \n831 well as details about compensation (if any)?   \n832 Answer: [NA]   \n833 Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.   \n834 Guidelines:   \n835 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with   \n836 human subjects.   \n837 \u2022 Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu  \n838 tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be   \n839 included in the main paper.   \n840 \u2022 According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,   \n841 or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data   \n42 collector.   \n43 15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human   \n844 Subjects   \n845 Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether   \n846 such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)   \n847 approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or   \n848 institution) were obtained?   \n49 Answer: [NA]   \n850 Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.   \n851 Guidelines:   \n852 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with   \n853 human subjects.   \n854 \u2022 Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)   \n855 may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you   \n856 should clearly state this in the paper.   \n857 \u2022 We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions ", "page_idx": 25}, {"type": "text", "text": "and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. \u2022 For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
