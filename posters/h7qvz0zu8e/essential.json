Existing methods struggle with slow convergence because they need precise hyperparameters, difficult to estimate in decentralized settings.  Conservative choices lead to slow performance or even divergence. \nThis paper introduces a novel decentralized algorithm that addresses this limitation. It employs an operator splitting technique combined with a new variable metric and a local backtracking line-search. This adaptive strategy automatically chooses a suitable step size, removing the need for hyperparameter tuning.  The algorithm guarantees linear convergence for strongly convex and smooth functions, proven both theoretically and through numerical experiments, outperforming conventional methods in both convergence speed and scalability.", "affiliation": "Innopolis University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "H7qVZ0Zu8E/podcast.wav"}
