It shows the training time, number of nodes touched (in millions), and battle results (in BB/100) for both MCCFVFP and MCCFR AI agents in different game configurations with varying numbers of players (3 and 6 players) and different public cards.  The battle result shows the average winnings (in BB/100) of the AI, with confidence intervals to indicate the statistical significance of the results.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "eFD9N5zdFC/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Information sets and node number record for different games", "description": "This table presents the number of information sets and nodes for various game configurations used in the experiments.  The games include different variations of Kuhn poker and Leduc poker, with varying numbers of cards, actions, and raising rounds.
