For each kernel, it lists the regularization function  r(\u03bbp) applied to the eigenvalues \u03bbp and the resulting kernel function Kn(vi, vj) which is used to measure the similarity between combo-nodes vi and vj in the combo-graph. The regularization functions incorporate hyperparameters (\u03b2's and \u03b5) that control the smoothness and complexity of the kernel.", "section": "3.2 Graph Gaussian Processes Surrogate"}]
