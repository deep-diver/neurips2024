Following the previous works [23, 4], we apply DIV2K [1] as the training dataset widely used for image SR, which includes 800 high-quality images with diverse contents and texture details. To verify the model performance under different image content distributions, four datasets are employed for model testing, including B100 [31], Urban100 [16], Test2K, and Test4K. Test2K and Test4K are downsampled from DIV8K [9]. For metrics, we adopt peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) to quantitatively evaluate all methods. Additionally, the FLOPs are calculated as the average results of all patches in the entire test dataset images. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Implementation Details. Our proposed WBSR can be easily incorporated into existing CNN-based SR networks to achieve efficient inference. SRResNet [24] and RCAN [51] are selected as two baselines in our experiments for a fair comparison, we conduct extensive experiments on four datasets of different SR scales to verify the effectiveness of our framework. During training, we set nine subnets $(\\mathrm{i}{=}9)$ ) with different parameters $\\theta_{i}$ in each supernet. For SRResNet, the widths and depths of the subnets are set as ([36, 52, 64]) and ([4, 8, 16]), respectively. As for RCAN, the widths and depths of the subnets are configured as ([36, 52, 64]) and ([5, 10, 20]), respectively. The compared width adaptation algorithms [23, 4] also follow such model width configuration to ensure a fair comparison. All methods are implemented using PyTorch and trained on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 for 100 epochs with 16 batch sizes, where the first 70 epochs are sample-level sampling and the rest are class-level sampling. The former aims to maintain the original data distribution of the entire dataset, ensuring a stable and comprehensive feature representation. The latter focuses on correcting the imbalance of dataset and enhancing the model\u2019s ability to represent difficult texture samples. The training times of SRResNet and RCAN are 25 and 28 GPU hours using a single GPU, respectively The training patch size is set to $128\\,\\times\\,128$ and augmented by horizontal and vertical flipping to enhance its robustness.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
