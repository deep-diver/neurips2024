The test dataset was not used for hyper-parameter tuning. Parameter ranges in Appendix D and y \u2208 [0, 1.5] from Eq. 3 in the manuscript. Ours wins because GliODIL cannot deform brain tissues through its static grid limitations.", "description": "This table presents the results of a comparison between the proposed method and the Static Grid method on synthetic datasets. The RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is used to evaluate the performance of both methods in predicting tumor locations.  The results are shown for different input types, representing varying levels of information available during training.  The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a lower RMSE, particularly with more comprehensive input data, highlighting its superior performance in capturing tumor growth and tissue deformation compared to the Static Grid approach.", "section": "6.

Large deviations account for various sizes of tumors and recurrences, yet the results remain consistent and statistically significant (Table 3). *IoU heavily penalizes the fact that the radiotherapy volumes are equal between baselines and much larger than typical recurrences. Equal volume is to make comparisons with the Standard Plan without volume/recall trade-offs.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study investigating the impact of removing different components of the model's loss function on the performance metrics: recurrence coverage (any and enhancing core) and Intersection over Union (IoU). It compares the performance of the full model with variations where specific regularization terms (physics-based, initial assumptions, imaging data) are removed. The results show that removing different regularization terms has varying impact on both recurrence coverage and IoU.
