This inefficiency is especially pronounced when restoring low-frequency information already present in degraded images. Existing solutions like InDI and DDRM attempt to address this by directly restoring images from degraded inputs but struggle with generalizability and interpretability.  Previous efforts also suffer from inconsistent forward and reverse processes or require complex noise schedules. \nResfusion tackles these issues by incorporating a weighted residual noise term directly into the diffusion forward process, allowing it to start the reverse process directly from the noisy input image.  This novel approach maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules while ensuring consistency between forward and reverse processes through a smooth equivalence transformation. Experimental results show Resfusion achieves competitive performance on standard datasets with significantly fewer sampling steps and strong generalization capabilities across various image restoration tasks, including shadow removal, low-light enhancement and deraining, and readily extends to image generation.", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, Nankai University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "JrIPBXWiS8/podcast.wav"}
