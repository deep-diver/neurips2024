[{"heading_title": "Empirical Fisher Issue", "details": {"summary": "The empirical Fisher approximation, while computationally convenient for natural gradient descent, suffers from a significant limitation: **inversely-scaled projection**.  This issue arises because the loss reduction enforced by EF updates is constant across all samples, regardless of their convergence level.  Consequently, the method is easily biased towards well-trained samples, hindering efficient exploration of the parameter space. The inversely-scaled projection results in distorted update vector fields and inefficient training trajectories, often requiring sophisticated damping schemes to work effectively. **This problem is particularly pronounced in large-scale setups** where calculating the exact Fisher information matrix is computationally prohibitive, yet the limitations of the EF approximation become more apparent. An improved method is needed to overcome this deficiency, enabling better convergence and generalization in deep learning models.  The paper proposes such a method, **iEF**, addressing this limitation while maintaining the simplicity of the EF approach."}}, {"heading_title": "Improved EF (iEF)", "details": {"summary": "The proposed iEF method addresses the limitations of the Empirical Fisher (EF) approximation used in Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) optimization.  **iEF improves EF's approximation of the exact Fisher information matrix**, a crucial component in NGD for accelerating training and enhancing generalization.  The core issue with EF is identified as an inversely-scaled projection problem, where updates disproportionately favor well-trained samples.  **iEF mitigates this by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix**, weighting updates based on sample convergence level.  This generalized NGD approach, motivated by a loss reduction perspective, improves both convergence speed and generalization performance.  Experimental results demonstrate iEF's superior approximation quality to exact NG updates compared to both EF and computationally more expensive sampled Fisher methods.  **iEF's robustness to the choice of damping parameter is a significant advantage**, simplifying optimization and enhancing its practical utility."}}, {"heading_title": "iEF Evaluation", "details": {"summary": "The effectiveness of the improved empirical Fisher (iEF) approximation hinges on its ability to accurately reflect natural gradient (NG) updates, a key aspect addressed in the 'iEF Evaluation' section.  **A robust evaluation framework is crucial**, assessing iEF's approximation quality against both the standard empirical Fisher (EF) and the more computationally expensive sampled Fisher (SF) methods.
