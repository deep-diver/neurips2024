", "summary": "DN-4DGS: Real-time dynamic scene rendering is revolutionized by a denoised deformable network with temporal-spatial aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art quality.", "takeaways": ["DN-4DGS significantly improves dynamic scene rendering quality and achieves real-time performance.", "The Noise Suppression Strategy effectively reduces noise in canonical 3D Gaussian coordinates.", "The Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module efficiently aggregates 4D information."], "tldr": "Current dynamic scene rendering methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are computationally expensive and struggle to achieve real-time performance.  While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers improved speed, it suffers from noise in canonical 3D Gaussian coordinates and lacks effective 4D information aggregation. These issues limit rendering quality and hinder real-time applications.\n\nThe proposed DN-4DGS method tackles these challenges head-on. It introduces a Noise Suppression Strategy to refine the 3D Gaussian coordinates, removing noise before it impacts the rendering process.  Further, it uses a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module to effectively integrate temporal and spatial information, improving overall rendering quality. Extensive experiments show that DN-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality while maintaining real-time performance.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "QQSyNX5s83/podcast.wav"}
