Intuitively, it is beneficial to establish a correlation between the interaction time interval and the model uncertainty to provide effective recommendations. To this end, we formulate a novel Evidential Neural Stochastic Differential Equation (E-NSDE) to seamlessly integrate NSDE and evidential learning for effective time-aware sequential recommendations.

Intuitively, the uncertainty of user behavior should increase along with the length of the interval since the last active interaction. For example, if the user has no activity for a long time, the user\u2019s prior interest tends to decrease. As a result, we become more uncertain about the user\u2019s preference.

MF is further extended with Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) [30] and Factorization Machine (FM) [29]. Recently, deep learningbased recommender systems [8, 15] have achieved impressive performance. DeepFM [15] integrates traditional FM and deep learning to learn low- and high-order feature interactions. Both wide and deep networks are jointly trained in [8] for better memorization and generalization. The dynamic model shifts latent user preference over time to incorporate temporal information. Time $\\mathrm{SVD++}$ [22] considers time-specific factors, which uses additive bias to model user and item-related temporal changes. Gaussian state-space models introduce time-evolving factors with a one-way Kalman fliter [14]. To process implicit data, Sahoo et al. extended the hidden Markov model [31], and Charlin et al. [6] further augmented it with the Poisson emission. Nevertheless, these models grasp the evolving preferences of users, yet they exhibit limited foresight into future interactions, leading to poor recommendations performance.

A graph captures high-order user-item interactions through an iterative process to provide effective recommendations [17].

Similarly, a graph-based framework called Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) [39] explicitly encodes the collaborative signal in the form of high-order connectivities in a user-item bipartite graph via embedding propagation. However, these methods are unable to capture long-term user preferences or deal with cold-start problems.
