We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal mismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of their complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling from these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen domains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering.

Besides general domain generalization approaches [35, 51], self-supervised skeleton representation learning methods [23, 47, 46, 59], while showing good transferability of the learned feature, are still difficult to handle data with large gaps as the generalizability largely comes from seeing handcrafted augmentations in either contrastive learning [62] or auxiliary tasks [46].

We observe that human action sequences start with relatively low feature diversity, which is actually a form that humans perform generally complete actions within large datasets, from rest poses that are less diverse (e.g. stand, sit) to rich-semantic poses that are more diverse. We summarize this pattern as a novel temporal prior named complete action prior. Although this prior can be detected by statistics in a general sense, in terms of individual samples, some exhibit strong action completeness while some are segments of their complete actions. This motivates us to learn an action completion function from the whole training data which can transform incomplete actions into complete ones.

The above differences are majorly caused by different definition of when an action starts and ends in different datasets, as can also be visualized in the Fig. 1 (a) example.

Here the \u201ccompleteness\u201d is the opposite of having uniform diversity over time. Also keep in mind that the curves in Fig. 1 (b) only reflect the statistical pattern for a group of actions in a dataset. For example, although the curve for NTU seems non-symmetric, we can still have approximate symmetry operations in the clustered linear transforms (see Fig. 8).

(1) The complete action prior generally relies on the assumption of clean skeleton data and daily routine pattern of human activities. Relying on this prior, our method is unable to work well when the source data is very noisy and contains very long motions with multiple stages, for example, taking $K12$ as source data. We find that $K12$ does not exhibit such strong prior as is observed in Fig. 1(b). (2) When the target domain does not show strong action completeness or contains high level of noise, the extrapolation module ${\\mathcal{F}}_{N}$ may not have a very strong effect. This is partially shown in $N{\\rightarrow}E$ and $N12{\\rightarrow}K12$ settings.

Discussion ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "Discussion for other baseline methods. We discuss some possible reasons that the alignment-based method is not as competitive as ours in the cross-dataset settings: (1) Given sufficient training data, the nearest neighbour classifier only memorizes training samples compared to network classifier and this in turn hampers its generalizability. Contrastive pre-training for the feature encoder with DTW-based loss may lead to better performance, but at a cost of much more computation. (2) Direct matching via kNN cannot fully take advantage of various types of augmentations, such as random rotation. (3) A better design of dynamic time warping is needed since there is domain shift across training and test datasets for either raw joint features or latent features. In widely-studied few-shot scenarios [3, 53], the training and test data normally come from the same distribution. For aggregation-based method, clips sampled without action completion cannot well handle the partial/full bias. However, these methods and our proposed method are not contradictory and can be combined for further improvement. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "Stochastic action completion. In this paper we actually propose a stochastic action completion method that can be used to augment the training data. This stochastic action completion is more suitable for augmentation than a deterministic one.

In this way, even for the input of a complete action, our approach is still able to output a reasonable complete action by sampling an identical mapping. A supporting evidence is that for $P51{\\rightarrow}N51$ ( $P51$ consists of generally complete actions), our method still improves the baseline ERM and even outperforms the temporal module of ST-Cubism [46].

So the number of new parameters of these two matrices is $\\sim90000$ , which is less than two FC layers (suppose each layer is nn.Linear(256,256)). For other baseline methods, universal domain generalization methods CCSA [35], ADA [51] and handcrafted augmentation methods such as uniform sampling [8], Mixup [61], CropPad [23] and CropResize [47] do not introduce new parameters.

The limitations arising from the complete action prior are discussed in Appendix A5. Other implications on the proposed method. Moreover, we note that direct resampling from a complete action sequence might introduce ambiguity for some actions. For example, standing up and sitting down are two different actions, but both of them can be obtained by sampling from a complete action sequence in which a human stands up from sitting pose and then sits down. However, one should note that this problem also exists when constructing positive samples in contrastive self-supervised learning [11, 47], as resampling or reversing an action may change the semantics for some action categories.
