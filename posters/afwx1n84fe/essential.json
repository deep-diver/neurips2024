However, these methods often lag behind recent advancements in deep learning. This paper addresses this limitation. \nThe paper introduces Neuromap, a novel approach that integrates the map equation, a well-regarded information-theoretic objective function, into a differentiable framework suitable for optimization using gradient descent and graph neural networks (GNNs).  This allows for end-to-end learning, automatic cluster number selection, and the incorporation of node features. **Neuromap's performance is competitive against other deep graph clustering methods**, showcasing the benefits of combining traditional network science techniques with deep learning.", "affiliation": "University of Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aFWx1N84Fe/podcast.wav"}
