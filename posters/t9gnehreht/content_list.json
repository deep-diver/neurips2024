First, SELMA leverages an LLM\u2019s in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts. Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging. Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge confilct from different datasets.

Also, since our fine-tuning works well with a small number of image-text pairs (i.e., for each skill, we only generate 1K text prompts and generating one image per each text prompt), the cost of LLM inference (i.e., $\\mathbb{S}27.78$ for querying GPT-3.5 for generating prompts in all the experiments including ablation studies) and image generation (8s per image for image generation with SDXL on a single NVIDIA L40 GPU with 48GB memory) is minimal.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
