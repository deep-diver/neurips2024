A common approach involves linear structural causal models (SCMs), where the challenge lies in identifying model parameters from observational data and structural assumptions.  Existing approaches using Gr\u00f6bner bases suffer from double-exponential time complexity, hindering scalability and practical use for larger systems. This research tackles these computational challenges head-on.\nThis research presents a novel algorithm that tackles the identification problem in linear SCMs within polynomial space. This substantially improves the efficiency compared to earlier methods.  Beyond the algorithm, the paper also demonstrates the inherent computational difficulty of parameter identification in these models by proving its hardness for a complexity class called \\#R.  This signifies that finding these parameters is fundamentally hard, irrespective of the algorithm used. The new algorithm and hardness results offer significant advancements to the theoretical understanding of identifiability in linear SCMs.", "affiliation": "Saarland University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "bNDwOoxj6W/podcast.wav"}
