The methods are represented as nodes, and arrows indicate that one method subsumes (includes all the identifiable instances of) another.  Green boxes signify methods with known polynomial-time algorithms, red boxes denote methods without such algorithms or proven to be NP-hard, and a blue box highlights the complete methods.  The figure visually represents the relationships and completeness of various approaches to identifying causal parameters in linear SCMs.", "section": "Previous Work"}, {"figure_path": "bNDwOoxj6W/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Left: A single missing edge on the top layer.

The left panel displays a simplified view, showing a single 'missing' edge connecting nodes 'r' and 'i' and the directed edges from nodes '1...n' into 'r'. The right panel presents a more elaborate 'gadget' that represents a variable. This gadget involves adding multiple nodes ('i' and 'j' in the top layer and their corresponding nodes 'i\n and 'j\n in the bottom layer) and their interconnections, reflecting a specific type of mathematical constraint. The 'missing' edges represent equations that need to be satisfied and the purpose of the gadget is to encode the value of the variable 'x\n into the structure of the graph.", "section": "4 Hardness of Numerical Identifiability"}]
