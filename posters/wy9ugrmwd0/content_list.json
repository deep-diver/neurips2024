For off-policy deep value-based RL methods, this phenomenon has been correlated with a decrease in representation rank and the ability to fit random targets, termed capacity loss. Although this correlation has generally been attributed to neural network learning under non-stationarity, the connection to representation dynamics has not been carefully studied in on-policy policy optimization methods. In this work, we empirically study representation dynamics in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on the Atari and MuJoCo environments, revealing that PPO agents are also affected by feature rank deterioration and capacity loss.

Kumar et al. (2021); Lyle et al.

Although this deterioration in representation is more generally attributed to neural networks trained under non-stationarity (Lyle et al., 2023), the connection to representation dynamics has been overlooked in on-policy policy optimization methods. In particular, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), one of the most popular policy optimization methods, makes several minibatch updates over non-stationary data, unlike vanilla policy gradient methods, and optimizes a surrogate loss that depends on a moving old policy. This raises the question of how much PPO agents are impacted by the same representation degradation attributed to non-stationarity. Dohare et al. (2021, 2023a,b) have shown that PPO agents lose plasticity throughout training but have only diagnosed it as a collapse in performance or as an Adam optimization issue. Igl et al. (2021) have shown that non-stationarity affects the generalization of PPO agents (learning speed when training episodes are very different otherwise performance at test time on novel episodes) but not necessarily training, and no connection was made with the feature rank and capacity measures used in the recent value-based works.

We seek to mitigate this effect in a way that is analogous to the PPO trust region, by extending the trust region to the feature space. We apply an $L^{2}$ loss on the difference between the pre-activated features of the optimized policy and the policy that collected the batch, as a way to keep the preactivations of the network during an update within a trust region. We apply this regularization to the pre-activations and not the activations, as dead neurons cannot propagate gradients, and even when they do, depending on the activation function, do so with a low magnitude. The regularization is an additional loss/penalty added to the overall loss. We term this loss the Proximal Feature Optimization (PFO) loss.

The goal is not necessarily to obtain better performance but to see if PFO improves the representations learned by PPO and if, in turn, it affects its trust region and performance. As shown in Figure 6, the regularization of PFO effectively brings the norm of the preactivation down, the number of dead neurons down, the capacity loss down, and the rank up.

"], "img_footnote": [], "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Sharing the actor-critic trunk In deep RL, the decision to use the same feature network trunk for both the actor and the critic is not trivial. Depending on the complexity of the environment, it can significantly change the performance of a PPO agent (Andrychowicz et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022a). We, therefore, attempt to draw a connection between sharing the feature trunk, the resulting representation, and its effects on the PPO objective. In this intervention, we make the actor and the critic share all the layers except their respective output layers and backpropagate the gradients from both the value and policy losses to the shared trunk. Figure 6 shows that the value loss acts as a regularizer, which decreases the feature rank and, depending on the reward\u2019s sparsity, gives two distinct effects. In dense-reward environments such as ALE/Phoenix and ALE/NameThisGame, the ranks are concentrated at low but non-trivial values: the upper tail significantly decreases compared to the baselines while the lower tail increases. This coincides with a lower feature norm, lower excess probability ratio, and, in turn, a high tail for the returns. It also increases performance in some cases. However, the opposite is true in the sparse-reward environment Gravitar: the rank completely collapses, and the feature norms and excess ratios are very high, collapsing the model\u2019s performance. This is consistent with the observations made in the plasticity works studying value-based methods: they show that sparse rewards deteriorate the rank of the value network, and we show that when shared in an actor-critic architecture they, in turn, deteriorate the policy. It is important to note that this distinction using the reward sparsity holds when comparing environments from the same family (e.g., ALE), but may not hold otherwise (e.g., comparing an ALE and a MuJoCo environment). We provide training curves showing the difference in the evolution of the feature rank when sharing the actor-critic trunk in Appendix D. To further strengthen this observation we run an intervention on ALE/Phoenix (a dense reward environment), with a reward mask randomly masking a reward with $90\\%$ chance, comparing the effects of sharing the actor-critic trunk. As expected, while with dense rewards, sharing the trunk is beneficial in ALE/Phoenix (Appendix Figure 21), with the sparse reward, the opposite is true: sharing the trunk is detrimental (Appendix Figure 35).

(2023) argue that as the targets of the value function change with the changing policy rollouts, the old moments accumulated by Adam become harmful to fit the new targets and find that resetting the moments of Adam helps performance in DQN-like algorithms. As the PPO objective creates a dependency on the previous policy, and more generally, in the policy gradient, the advantages change with the policy, the same argument about Adam moments can be made for PPO. Furthermore, Dohare et al. (2023b); Lyle et al. (2023) advocate for decaying the second moment of Adam faster than its default decay of 0.999 when training under non-stationarity and set it to match the decay of the first moment. Therefore, we experiment with both resetting Adam\u2019s moments after each batch collection (to avoid tuning its frequency) and setting the second moment to decay at the (smaller) default decay of the first moment for both the actor and the critic; the moments are thus only accumulated over the epochs on the same batch in the former and over shorter batch sequences in the latter. We observe in Figure 6 and Appendix D that these interventions reduce the feature norm and increase the feature rank on ALE, which also reduces the excess probability ratio and, in some cases, improves performance; however, they are not sufficient to prevent collapse and, like sharing the actor-critic trunk, result in poor performance on ALE/Gravitar.

This brings a novel perspective to previous works that showed that PPO agents lose plasticity throughout training. We show that this is particularly concerning for the heuristic trust region set by PPO-Clip, which fails to prevent collapse as it becomes less effective when the agent\u2019s representation becomes poor. Finally, we present Proximal Feature Optimization (PFO), a simple novel auxiliary loss based on regularizing the evolution of features that mitigates representation degradation and, along with other interventions, shows that controlling representation mitigates performance collapse.

Despite our best attempts, as with any other empirical machine learning work, the generalization of our results to other settings is not fully known. Still, this work should raise awareness about the representation collapse phenomenon observed in PPO and encourage future work to monitor representations when training PPO agents, as it can help diagnose performance collapse. We have focused on simple interventions that regularize non-stationarity and representations to highlight the effects of non-stationarity and the connection between representation, trust region, and collapse, but exploring interventions on plasticity is also valuable, as these may also influence the same dynamics. We believe further studies to analyze this problem, both empirically and particularly theoretically, to understand the reasons driving representation deterioration to be valuable.

(2018) in v5 on Gymnasium (Towers et al., 2023). That is, with a sticky action probability of 0.25 as the only form of environment stochasticity, using only the game-over signal for termination (as opposed to end-of-life signals) with the default maximum of $108\\times10^{3}$ environment frames per episode and reporting performance over training episodes (i.e., with sampling according to the policy distribution as opposed to taking the mode action). We train all models for 100 million environment frames. We use standard algorithmic choices to make our setting and results relevant to previous work. This includes taking only the sign of rewards (clipping) and frame skipping. We use a frame skip of 3, as opposed to the standard value of 4, due to limitations in the ALE-v5 environment, which does not implement frame pooling.11 We use the standard architecture of Mnih et al.
