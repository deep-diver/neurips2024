See Table 1 for their definitions.", "description": "This table summarizes the upper and lower bounds on the regret for stochastic and adversarial linear bandits under two different corruption measures: C and C\u221e.  The C measure represents strong corruption, where the corruption level depends on the learner's action, while C\u221e represents weak corruption, where it does not. The table highlights the gap between the minimax regret under these two types of corruptions, showing how the optimal scaling for the corruption level varies based on the bandit setting.", "section": "3 Two Equivalent Views: On Adversary Adaptivity and Corruption Measure"}, {"figure_path": "wqs2RMq4CW/tables/tables_3_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Regret bounds under corruption measure C and C\u221e.
