Figure 1(b) provides a geometric interpretation of the bonus function, illustrating how it adjusts the covariance matrix to account for corruption and ensure sufficient exploration. The bonus function ensures that the exploration bonus term is always positive semi-definite and is carefully designed to achieve optimal regret bounds.", "section": "5 Adversarial Linear Bandits"}]
