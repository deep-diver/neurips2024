Due to the continuous progression of diseases, i.e., the variability within the same level and the similarity between adjacent stages, accurate grading is highly challenging. Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, models trained on limited source domain datasets should also be capable of handling data from unseen target domains. Due to the cross-domain variants, the feature distribution between source and unseen target domains can be dramatically different, leading to a substantial decrease in model performance. To address these challenges in cross-domain disease grading, we propose a Severityaware Recurrent Modeling (Samba) method in this paper. As the core objective of most staging tasks is to identify the most severe lesions, which may only occupy a small portion of the image, we propose to encode image patches in a sequential and recurrent manner. Specifically, a state space model is tailored to store and transport the severity information by hidden states. Moreover, to mitigate the impact of cross-domain variants, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based state recalibration mechanism is designed to map the patch embeddings into a more compact space. We model the feature distributions of different lesions through the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and reconstruct the intermediate features based on learnable severity bases. Extensive experiments show the proposed Samba outperforms the VMamba baseline by an average accuracy of $23.5\\%$ , $5.6\\%$ and $4.1\\%$ on the cross-domain grading of fatigue fracture, breast cancer and diabetic retinopathy, respectively.

It is more challenging than conventional deterministic classification with distinctive categories (e.g., cat vs. dog), owing to the inherent severity ambiguity within and between levels. This ambiguity arises because the progression of a certain disease or a pathological region is a transitional, continuous and time-growing process (illustrated in Fig. 1a). On the one hand, different medical images within a same severity level can have rather different disease or pathological developments (shown in Fig. 1b). On the other hand, medical images among different severity levels can share similar patterns, as low-level lesions may persist throughout the disease\u2019s progression.

Furthermore, these models usually assume that the medical images used for training and inference are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In practical clinical scenarios, a grading model trained on a number of medical images (source domain) is often required to handle images it has not encountered before (unseen target domains). Due to variations between patients, scanners, imaging parameters, clinic centers, etc., the feature distributions of the source domain and unseen target domains can be dramatically different [32, 68, 23, 8]. When the severity level of a disease is measured by the distribution of lesions, this cross-domain variance can lead to the misdetection of crucial lesions, resulting in grading errors [4, 11]. Especially when the appearance of lesions is significantly affected by the style change, it may be observed that medical images from the same domain instead of from the same grade are clustered in the feature space (illustrated in Fig. 1c).

The key to addressing this problem is accurately identifying the lesions that have a decisive impact on grading [49, 45]. As the disease progresses, multiple lesions may coexist in the image, and the critical aspect of grading is identifying the most severe one among them. However, the most severe lesion may be localized in a small region in the image, exhibiting variable shapes, and being influenced by cross-domain style changes [4, 11]. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a severity-aware recurrent modeling method (Samba). Samba encodes image patches in a recurrent manner and recalibrates the state distributions based on learnable bases.

These small lesions are easily influenced by style variations, which can lead to incorrect grading. Therefore, the model needs to pay sufficient attention to these detailed patches to classify them accurately. To address this issue, we treat the image patches as sequential data and encode them in a recurrent manner. This approach allows the information of decisive lesions to be stored in the hidden states and propagated to subsequent sequences. Furthermore, we adopt bidirectional encoding, enabling critical local information to influence the overall representation. More specifically, we incorporate a bidirectional Mamba [17] layer into the Samba, which supports sequence-to-sequence transformation and efficiently selects data in an input-dependent manner.

When the feature distribution is affected by cross-domain variations, both the update of hidden states and the gating mechanism are disrupted. To resolve this problem, we utilize learnable tokens to capture the lesion representations, which are then used as bases to map the feature embeddings into a more compact space. To preserve the semantic information within this process, we further employ the Expectation-Maximum (EM) algorithm [14] initialized by these bases to estimate the lesion feature distribution for each image and reconstruct the features accordingly.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
