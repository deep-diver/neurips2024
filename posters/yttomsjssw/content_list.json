RLHF has been a popular method in LLM alignment [51, 74, 59]. While effective, RLHF entails a complex process that involves training multiple models and continuously sampling from the LM policy during the learning loop. DPO [46] simplifies the RLHF framework by using a direct optimization objective derived from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO; [48]), reducing the process to supervised training of the policy model alone. However, DPO is memory-intensive and resource-demanded as it requires managing two policies simultaneously. Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO; [69]) mitigates these challenges by utilizing a uniform reference model, which not only reduces memory requirements but also enhances training efficiency. Alternative methods such as [71, 50] simplify model management and parameter tuning in the RLHF framework by adopting a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach. Additionally, RSO [39] and RAFT [18] employ rejection sampling to refine the alignment process. RSO focuses on estimating the optimal policy more accurately, while RAFT uses high-quality samples for iterative fine-tuning of the policy model.

The effectiveness of these approaches confirms that the representations of pretrained LMs are semantically rich. Liu et al.

Controlled Decoding (CD): During the decoding process of LLMs, this method combines token probabilities with reward scores. We consider two versions. The first version [31] directly uses a reward model trained on human preference data, requiring the tokenization strategies of both the reward model and the base model to be the same. The second version [43] trains a prefix scorer to predict the expected reward from partially generated responses. We refer to it as CD prefix.

Our findings can summarized as follows: (1) RE-CONTROL achieves the highest alignment score in terms of the win rate evaluated by GPT-4. Moreover, it maintains generation quality, as measured by diversity and coherence. (2) The strongest baseline is controlled decoding. However, controlled decoding is 20 times slower than RE-CONTROL. This is because controlled decoding needs to evaluate multiple candidate tokens and perform forward passes through the entire reward model repeatedly, while RE-CONTROL only requires optimization through a value function that is a two- or three-layer neural network, making it much faster. Additionally, CD [31] lacks support for batch generation, making it even slower. (3) Combining prompt engineering with RE-CONTROL can further improve alignment performance in terms of both average reward and GPT-4 evaluation. Specifically, it outperforms the strongest baseline by $\\{7.6\\%$ , $19.0\\%$ , $12.4\\%$ , $13.2\\%\\}$ in terms of the GPT-4 win rate. In contrast, controlled decoding with prompting shows only marginal improvements. This might be because RE-CONTROL perturbs the activation space of the LLM, which is more flexible than merely changing the final token probability. (4) RE-CONTROL significantly outperforms static representation editing by $\\{17.6\\%,\\,10.2\\%\\,\\,17.6\\%,\\,24.6\\%\\}.$ .

For RE-CONTROL, we vary the number of iterations when optimizing through the value function at test time, while for CD, we adjust the number of candidate tokens. As shown, the performance of RE-Control initially increases with more computing time but eventually decreases. This decline occurs because a large number of iterations at test time can lead to reward hacking, reducing the quality of the generated sentences. As discussed in Section 6.3, this hyperparameter can be selected based on the validation set. Since CD does not support batch generation, its inference speed is significantly slower than RE-CONTROL. Even when RE-Control does not use batch generation, it outperforms CD when using the same computing resources.

Our method does not require fine-tuning the LLMs and offers more flexibility than existing test-time alignment methods such as prompting and guided decoding. We empirically show that RE-CONTROL outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and exhibits strong generalization ability.

It would be interesting to leverage multi-objective optimization techniques [24] at test time to obtain a Pareto frontier in the representation space for such settings. (3) More advanced training algorithm. Currently, we train the value function using a simple oneiteration policy iteration method.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
