This lack of understanding hinders progress in improving model training and generalization.  Furthermore, the theoretical underpinnings of their excellent empirical performance remain unclear, limiting our ability to design better models.\nThis research addresses these issues by providing a fine-grained non-asymptotic analysis of a one-layer transformer in NTP.  The study introduces a novel mathematical framework and two-stage training algorithm, showcasing sub-linear convergence to near-optimal solutions.  Importantly, it also demonstrates the non-trivial generalization ability of the transformer under dataset shifts. These findings provide valuable insights into transformer training and generalization, paving the way for improved model optimization and design.", "affiliation": "Penn State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "NfOFbPpYII/podcast.wav"}
