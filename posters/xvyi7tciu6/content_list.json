Centralized and decentralized MARL methods have been investigated as the first two extensions from single-agent to multi-agent systems. However, challenges have arisen regarding the curse of dimensionality and non-stationary training as the number of agents increasing [Mao et al., 2022]. To address this issue, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) was developed to disentangle training and execution phases [Foerster et al., 2018]. In the CTDE scheme, the centralized critic provides global information, guiding agents during training but not during execution.

For heterogeneous tasks, such as multijoint coordination in robotic control, they learn distinct policies without sharing parameters and exhibit different behaviors. However, in these scenarios, relying solely on the non-parameter-sharing setting to achieve cooperation is an oversimplification [Bhattacharya et al., 2023]. This is because agents can never learn optimal policies that depend on trajectories from other agents when updating simultaneously. To tackle this problem, sequential updating [Bertsekas, 2021] has been proposed to improve heterogeneity and collaboration. This updating scheme originates from the insight that agents in one rollout update their policies one-by-one, rather than simultaneously, to retain preceding agent information. Several sequential methods have been proposed by leveraging the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma[Kuba et al., 2022], the multi-agent performance difference lemma [Wang et al., 2023a], and rollout policy iteration [Bertsekas, 2021], to not only adapt the sequential updating scheme but also maintain the monotonic improvement property.

Specifically, mutual PDM consists of the intra-agent divergence and the inter-agent divergence. The intra-agent divergence measures the policy discrepancy between episodes, encouraging agents to learn diversified policies. The inter-agent divergence measures the policy discrepancy between agents, enhancing heterogeneity and promoting greater diversity. However, simply applying classical divergence measures to the proposed framework may trap the exploration in local optima due to the lack of positive incentives. To address this issue, we propose to employ conditional Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence to provide entropy-guided incentives.

Policy entropy incentive in MAPPO is one of the most related parts to our method, providing diversified policy learning from an information theory perspective. Li and He [2023] proposed MATRPO to extend Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) to multi-agent tasks through a fully decentralized setting and distributed optimization. However, when the number of agents becomes large, MATRPO may encounter the challenge of the connecting link dimension curse. This is because it relies on communication rather than global information to facilitate cooperation. Guo et al. [2024] proposed MASPG, a trust region-based MARL algorithm in the off-policy manner, to enhance the sample efficiency of trust region methods. However, these methods require homogeneity of agents, i.e. parameter sharing, to ensure monotonic improvement. This homogeneity assumption can impose significant restrictions on agents, limiting their ability to explore the joint policy space adequately [Ding et al., 2022].

To build the multi-agent sequential updating scheme, attempts have been addressed from both joint and individual policy perspectives. For example, Bertsekas [2021] proposed rollout and policy iteration method, which was the first to consider sequential updating in MARL. Kuba et al. [2022] observed the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma and proposed HAPPO. Leveraging this powerful lemma, HAPPO estimates and decomposes the joint advantage function to implement sequential updating and ensure the joint monotonic improvement.

For example, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is the first to maximize the Shannon entropy of policies, promoting randomness and encouraging exploration [Haarnoja et al., 2018]. On-policy methods, such as PPO, MAPPO and HAPPO, embrace the same concept by incorporating entropy regularization into the optimization objective.

To address this limitation, policy divergence regularization between episodes [Su and Lu, 2022, Xu et al., 2023] has been proposed. This regularization method calculates the policy divergence based on a fixed policy and offers more directed guidance compared to entropy alone.

Bi-DexHands is a bimanual dexterous manipulation environment, where agents are in control of fingers, hands or joints. Sub-scenarios in Bi-DexHands require agents to collaborate for more complex bimanual tasks, such as opening a door inward and outward, passing an item from one hand to another.

By leveraging the sequential updating paradigm, MADPO maximizes intra-agent policy divergence to enhance exploration and inter-agent policy divergence to promote heterogeneity. However, maximizing traditional divergence measurements can lead to instability and lack of direction in MARL. To tackle this issue, we propose conditional Cauchy-Schwarz policy divergence to quantify the distance between policies. The conditional Cauchy-Schwarz policy divergence possesses favorable properties and provides a stable entropy-guided incentive for sequential exploration. We evaluate the performance of MADPO on two challenging heterogeneous tasks, MA-Mujoco and Bi-Dexhands. We observe that the proposed Mutual PDM outperforms entropy-based methods since it consider both previous and preceding information. Moreover, we verify the efficiency of the conditional Cauchy-Schwarz policy divergence in terms of stabilizing and guiding the exploration. Totally, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MADPO, achieving state-of-the-art performance in complex multi-agent scenarios. The main limitation of this work is that when the number of agent increases, the proposed method may require more ram to restore previous information. We will investigate effective representation methods for previous information in the future.

The Def. order represents updating agents in the default order in Ma-Mujoco, where agents are grouped according to the legs they belong to. For example, the default updating order can be: right thigh joint, right leg joint, right foot joint, left thigh joint, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . The Spec. order represents updating agents according to their specilization, and can be: right thigh joint, left thigh joint, right foot joint, left foot joint, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . We can observe that the random updating order outperforms the other orders. We believe that this is because our framework can benefit from various updating orders. For example, if the current agent share the same specilization as the preceding agent, maximizing the inter-agent divergence can enhance exploration. On the other hand, if the current agent differs from the preceding agent, maximizing the inter-agent divergence can promote heterogeneity.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
