As mentioned in Sec. 4.6.3, to optimally constrain the kernel learning process and harness the full potential of illumination-invariant information, we further employ a consistency loss, denoted as Illumination Invariant Loss (II Loss). This loss function is specifically designed to align features extracted from pairs of images taken under different lighting conditions. The fundamental concept of the II Loss is to guarantee consistency in the features extracted from these images, regardless of the variations in illumination. This is achieved by leveraging a luminance transformation function $\\sigma$ to adjust the illuminations, as defined as follows: ", "page_idx": 12}, {"type": "equation", "text": "$$\nL=\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}(f_{W_{i}}(I)-f_{W_{i}}(\\sigma(I)))^{2}\\right.\\left.\\right.\\vert f_{W_{i}}(I)-f_{W_{i}}(\\sigma(I))\\vert\\leq\\beta\n$$", "text_format": "latex", "page_idx": 12}, {"type": "text", "text": "In our experiments, we use the gamma transformations as the function for the function $\\sigma$ , setting $\\beta$ empirically to 1, and scaling the II Loss to 0.01 of the other losses. ", "page_idx": 12}, {"type": "text", "text": "As discussed in Sec. 3.1, we obtain illumination-invariant features by assuming neighboring pixels exhibit high similarity of illumination. Specifically, illumination items can be factored out by performing the subtraction among the neighboring pixels, which is accomplished by imposing the zero mean constraint on the convolutional kernels. However, to eliminate the illumination term ideally, it is necessary for the average value of adjacent positions within the kernel to approach zero. The sole constraint of a zero mean does not guarantee that the illumination elimination occurs strictly between adjacent pixels; it can occur between distant pixels as well. For instance, Fig. 5(a) presents an example of a convolutional kernel that satisfies the zero-mean constraint. Even though this kernel has a zero mean, it fails to extract illumination-invariant features due to the relatively large spatial separation between the positive and negative positions. Unfortunately, as the convolutional kernel size increases, this issue becomes more pronounced and leads to a degradation in performance. To this end, the II Loss is proposed to encourage consistency of outputs from IIM across images with different illuminations, preventing trivial solutions within the kernel implicitly. As shown in Fig. 5(b)(c), we visualize the $5\\times5$ kernel with and without the II Loss. For each position in the $5\\times5$ kernel, we compute the mean value using a sliding window of size $3\\times3$ . It can be observed that without the II Loss, the local means within the kernel do not tend towards zero, indicating that the features extracted using this kernel are may not illumination-invariant. In contrast, when the II Loss is applied, the local values of the kernel are significantly constrained. To further validate the effectiveness of the II Loss, we present the results of the II Loss on different convolutional kernel sizes within IIM in rows $3{\\sim}6$ and $8\\!\\sim\\!11$ of Table 6. By comparing the performance gains of different convolutional kernel sizes, we can see that the larger kernel sizes lead to more significant improvements. This strongly suggests the effectiveness of our II Loss in constraining the degrees of freedom in the kernel.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
