This paper investigates if offline methods can be adapted to online scenarios without losing efficiency.  It highlights a critical need for efficient online algorithms, particularly for applications like interactive decision-making where data is inherently sequential and not pre-determined.\nThe researchers propose a new framework, Oracle-Efficient Online Estimation (OEOE), where online learning uses offline estimators indirectly. Their key findings show that near-optimal online estimation is theoretically possible using offline estimators. While computationally efficient conversion isn't always feasible, the study reveals it's possible for specific cases like conditional density estimation. This framework and findings advance both theory and algorithm design in online learning and interactive decision-making.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "sks7x4I8Bh/podcast.wav"}
