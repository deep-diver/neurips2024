Besides, lower-order exercise latent representations obtained in shallow layers are not well explored when learning the student representation. To tackle the issues, this paper suggests a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD (DisenGCD), which learns three types of representations on three disentangled graphs: student-exercise-concept interaction, exercise-concept relation, and concept dependency graphs, respectively. Specifically, the latter two graphs are first disentangled from the interaction graph. Then, the student representation is learned from the interaction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning module; multiple learnable propagation paths in this module enable current student latent representation to access lower-order exercise latent representations, which can lead to more effective nad robust student representations learned; the exercise and concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency graphs by graph attention modules. Finally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to handle three disentangled representations for prediction.

Considering that the simple diagnostic functions of this type of models fail to model complex student interactions, recently, artificial intelligence researchers have tried to employ neural networks (NNs) to enhance and invent novel CDMs. Therefore, the second type of CDMs can be further divided into two sub-types: focusing on inventing novel diagnostic functions and enhancing the input representations of CDMs, respectively. The representatives of the first sub-type of CDMs include the well-known NCD [25], KSCD [15], and so on [44, 16, 12, 36, 38]. For the second sub-type of CDMs, many NN techniques are employed, including hierarchical attention NNs for ECD [48], long short-term memory networks for DIRT [3], graph neural networks (GNNs) for RCD [7], SCD [28], and GraphCDM [21].

In short, existing GNN-based CDMs fail to provide high robustness against student interaction noise. In addition, these CDMs do not explore the use of lower-order exercise latent representations in shallow layers for learning the student representation due to the intrinsic defect of their GNNs.

For NN-based representatives, NCD [25] and KSCD [15] fed student, exercise, and concept vectors to an IRT-like NN as the diagnostic function for prediction; NAS-GCD [44] is similar to NCD, but its diagnostic function is automatically obtained.

Since each node\u2019s information can be propagated to any node, learning regarding three relations can be seen as learning on an implicit unified graph; Similarly, SCD [28] takes the same aggregation manner along the first two relations of RCD for learning student and exercise representations for contrastive learning to mitigate long-tail problems.

They achieved this by mapping the representation into different spatial dimensions and aggregating item information from various edge types within the graph neural network to extract features from different aspects; DcRec [33] disentangles the network into a user-item domain and a user-user social domain, generating two views through data augmentation and ultimately obtaining a more robust representation via contrastive learning.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
