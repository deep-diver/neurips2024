This paper proposes a novel paradigm called Parallel Gated Network (PGN) to address these issues. PGN directly accesses information from previous time steps, reducing the information propagation path complexity and enhancing efficiency.\nTo further improve the performance in long-range time series forecasting, the paper presents a novel temporal modeling framework called Temporal PGN (TPGN).  TPGN employs two branches: one leveraging PGN to model long-term periodic patterns, and another using patches to capture short-term information. This two-branch design comprehensively models time series semantics, with experimental results demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing models.", "affiliation": "Beijing Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ypEamFKu2O/podcast.wav"}
