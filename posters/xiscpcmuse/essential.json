{"importance": "This paper is important because it presents a novel approach to 3D scene editing that simplifies the complex problem of multi-view consistency by framing it as a multi-view 2D inpainting task.  This **significantly reduces the reliance on accurate camera poses**, a major limitation of many existing 3D editing methods, **opening up possibilities for real-world applications**.  Furthermore, the proposed method's high-level optical flow control **improves its scalability and applicability**. It provides a **unified framework for both 2D and 3D editing**, facilitating further research on integrating 2D generative models into 3D scene editing.", "summary": "MVInpainter: Pose-free multi-view consistent inpainting bridges 2D and 3D editing by simplifying 3D editing to a multi-view 2D inpainting task.", "takeaways": ["MVInpainter simplifies 3D scene editing by framing it as a multi-view 2D inpainting task.", "The method achieves multi-view consistency without explicit camera poses, improving scalability and real-world applicability.", "MVInpainter offers a unified framework that seamlessly integrates 2D and 3D editing, opening up new research avenues."], "tldr": "Current novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation methods often struggle with generalization to real-world scenes and heavily rely on accurate camera poses.  This limits their practical applicability for complex 3D scene editing tasks like object removal, insertion, and replacement.  Many existing approaches also suffer from multi-view inconsistencies and high computational costs.\nMVInpainter tackles these issues by reformulating 3D editing as a multi-view 2D inpainting problem.  Instead of generating entirely new views, it partially inpaints multiple views guided by a reference image, significantly reducing complexity.  The method uses video priors for motion consistency, appearance guidance from concatenated reference features, and slot attention for implicit pose control, eliminating the need for explicit camera poses.  Experiments across object-centric and forward-facing datasets demonstrate MVInpainter's effectiveness in diverse tasks, showing improved performance and generalization compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "XIScpCMUse/podcast.wav"}
