It is built upon the existing MaskDINO model, enhancing it with two key modules: De-Imbalance (DI) and Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization (BATO).  The DI module addresses the detection-segmentation imbalance by using a residual double-selection mechanism to generate a balance-aware query (Qbal). The BATO module then uses this query to optimize the initial feature tokens, generating balance-aware feature tokens. These optimized tokens are then fed into the transformer decoder for final prediction. The figure also highlights the different token types and their flow through the model.", "section": "3 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "srQxkSPJLW/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Qualitatively, (a) shows that the detection bounding boxes predicted by the query/feature at the first decoder layer of MaskDINO do not fit well with segmentation masks, and (b) exhibits that the corresponding results of DI-MaskDINO are optimized and the detection bounding boxes closely surround segmentation masks.
