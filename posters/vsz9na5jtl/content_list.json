Given the ubiquitous graph data in real-world applications, link prediction has become a powerful tool in domains such as recommender systems [72] and knowledge graph completion [49, 41]. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to solving this problem. One type of classic research approaches is heuristic-based methods, which infer the likelihood of links based on node similarity metrics [43, 46]. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely utilized for link prediction. For example, Graph Autoencoders leverage Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) representations to predict links [29]. Recently, MPNNs have been combined with structural features to better explore pairwise relations between target nodes [73, 70, 18, 61].

Due to the dynamic and evolving nature of many real-world graphs, ideal link prediction methods should adapt over time to consistently meet the contexts and goals of the serving nodes. For instance, in short-video recommender systems, both video content and user preferences change dynamically over time [28]. Another significant challenge is the dilemma of exploitation and exploration in link prediction. The learner must not only exploit past collected data to predict links with high likelihood but also explore lower-confidence target nodes to acquire new knowledge for long-term beneftis. For example, in social recommendations, it is necessary to prioritize popular users by \u2018exploiting\u2019 knowledge gained from previous interactions, while also\u2018exploring\u2019 potential value from new or under-explored users to seek long-term benefits [7]. Furthermore, while existing works often analyze time and space complexity, they generally lack theoretical guarantees regarding the performance of link prediction.

More specifically, we propose a fusion algorithm named PRB (PageRank Bandits), which combines the exploitation and exploration balance of contextual bandits with the graph structure utilization of PageRank [59, 42]. Compared to contextual bandit approaches, PRB leverages graph connectivity for an aggregated representation. In contrast to PageRank, it incorporates the principles of exploitation and exploration from contextual bandits to achieve a collaborative trade-off. Additionally, we extend PRB to node classification by introducing a novel transformation from node classification to link prediction, thereby broadening the applicability of PRB.

This regret upper bound also provides insights into the relationship between the reward and damping factor, as well as the required realization complexity of the neural function class.

In this setting, each link prediction is made sequentially. In each round, given a serving node, the model is required to choose one target node that has the highest likelihood of forming a link with the serving node. The model then observes feedback and performs corresponding optimizations. The goal is to minimize regret over $T$ rounds (e.g., $T=10,000)$ . We compare PRB with state-ofthe-art (SOTA) bandit-based approaches (e.g., [76, 12]), which are designed for sequential decisionmaking. PRB significantly outperforms these bandit-based baselines, demonstrating the success of fusing contextual bandits with PageRank for collaborative exploitation and exploration. (2) Offline Link Prediction. In this setting, both training and testing data are provided, following the typical supervised learning process. Although PRB is designed for online learning, it can be directly applied to offilne learning on the training data. We then use the trained model to perform link prediction on the testing data, comparing it with SOTA GNNs-based methods (e.g., [18, 61]). The superior performance of PRB indicates that principled exploitation and exploration can break the performance bottleneck in link prediction.

The first line of works studies the linear reward assumption, typically calculated using ridge regression [39, 8, 1, 60, 21, 53]. Linear UCB-based bandit algorithms [1, 9, 40] and linear Tho\u221ampson Sampling [4, 2] can achieve satisfactory performance and a near-optimal regret bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ . To learn general reward functions, deep neural networks have been adapted to bandits in various ways [10, 11]. [54, 47] develop $L$ -layer DNNs to learn arm embeddings and apply Thompson Sampling on the final layer for exploration. [76] introduced the first provable neural-based contextual bandit algorithm with a UCB exploration strategy, and [74] later extended to the TS framework. [22] provides sharper regret upper bound for neural bandits with neural online regression. Their regret analysis builds on recent advances in the convergence theory of over-parameterized neural networks [24, 5] and uses the Neural Tangent Kernel [34, 6] to establish connections with linear contextual bandits [1]. [12, 13] retains the powerful representation ability of neural networks to learn the reward function while using another neural network for exploration. [52, 51] integrates exploitation-exploration neural networks into the graph neural networks for fine-grained exploration and exploration. Recently, neural bandits have been adapted to solve other learning problems, such as active learning[14, 7], meta learning[53]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Link Prediction Models. Three primary approaches have been identified for link prediction models. Node embedding methods, as described by previous work [50, 30, 57, 23, 44, 45, 25], focus on mapping each node to an embedding vector and leveraging these embeddings to predict connections. Another approach involves link prediction heuristics, as explored by [43, 15, 3, 77], which utilize crafted structural features and network topology to estimate the likelihood of connections between nodes in a network. The third category employs GNNs for predicting link existence; notable is the Graph Autoencoder (GAE) [36], which learns low-dimensional representations of graphstructured data through an unsupervised learning process. GAE utilizes the inner product of MPNN representations of target nodes to forecast links but might not capture pairwise relations between nodes effectively. More sophisticated GNN models that combine MPNN with additional structural features, such as those by [71, 70, 18], have demonstrated superior performance by integrating both node and structural attributes. One such combined architecture is SF-then-MPNN, as adopted by [71, 78]. In this approach, the input graph is first enriched with structural features (SF) and then processed by the MPNN to enhance its expressivity. However, since structural features change with each target link, the MPNN must be re-run for each link, reducing scalability. For instance, the SEAL model [71] first enhances node features by incorporating the shortest path distances and extracting $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{k}}$ -hop subgraphs, then applies MPNN across these subgraphs to generate more comprehensive link representations. Another combined architecture is SF-and-MPNN. Models like Neo-GNN [70] and BUDDY [18] apply MPNN to the entire graph and concatenate features such as common neighbor counts to enhance representational fidelity. In addition, [61] has developed the Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC) which utilizes the MPNN-then-SF architecture to achieve higher expressivity and address the graph incompleteness.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
