{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in differential privacy and machine learning. It addresses the challenges of applying differential privacy to non-convex models like ReLU regression, a common task in deep learning.  **The novel algorithms proposed offer better utility than existing methods, especially in high-dimensional settings**,  providing practical guidance for developing privacy-preserving machine learning systems.  **The analysis also extends beyond typical data assumptions**, opening up new avenues for research in this rapidly evolving field.", "summary": "Differentially private ReLU regression algorithms, DP-GLMtron and DP-TAGLMtron, achieve comparable performance with only an additional factor of O(log N) in the utility upper bound compared to the conventional DPSGD, even in high-dimensional settings.", "takeaways": ["DP-GLMtron and DP-TAGLMtron outperform conventional DPSGD in overparameterized regimes.", "DP-TAGLMtron effectively balances privacy and utility using a tree aggregation protocol.", "The utility bound can be independent of the dimension, even in high-dimensional settings where d >> N."], "tldr": "ReLU regression, a fundamental non-convex learning problem, poses significant challenges under differential privacy (DP) constraints, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios. Existing solutions often rely on strong assumptions about bounded data norms, which limit their applicability to real-world datasets. This limitation has motivated researchers to revisit the problem, leading to the development of improved approaches.\nThis paper introduces two novel DP algorithms, DP-GLMtron and DP-TAGLMtron. **DP-GLMtron uses a perceptron-based approach with adaptive clipping and a Gaussian mechanism to enhance privacy**.  **DP-TAGLMtron builds upon DP-GLMtron and further improves the privacy-utility trade-off by employing a tree aggregation protocol**. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that these algorithms perform better than conventional methods like DPSGD, even with high-dimensional data and relaxed assumptions on data distribution.  Empirical results validate these findings.", "affiliation": "KAUST", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "3uUIwMxYbR/podcast.wav"}
