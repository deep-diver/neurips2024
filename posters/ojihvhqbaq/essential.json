A key challenge is efficiently measuring this discrepancy.  Current approaches are often computationally expensive or lack theoretical guarantees.\nThis paper tackles this challenge head-on. It introduces new, efficient algorithms for testing discrepancy, the measure of distance between training and test distributions.  These algorithms are not only efficient but also provide strong theoretical guarantees, improving upon existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ojIhvhQBAQ/podcast.wav"}
