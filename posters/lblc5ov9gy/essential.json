Existing methods like importance weighted forward KL variational inference (IWFVI) can be inefficient as they require numerous model evaluations. This is particularly problematic for models involving complex simulations.\n\nVISA, a novel method developed in this paper, tackles this challenge. It leverages sequential sample-average approximations (SAA), reusing model evaluations across multiple gradient steps. This dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining the accuracy of IWFVI, outperforming other methods across various experiments. **VISA showcases that reusing computations can drastically reduce the computational burden of inference on complex models**, opening up exciting possibilities for high-dimensional inference in various applications.", "affiliation": "Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Variational Inference"}, "podcast_path": "lbLC5OV9GY/podcast.wav"}
