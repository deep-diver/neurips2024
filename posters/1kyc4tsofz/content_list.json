Recent research in FL has increasingly focused on improving the uniformity of model performance across clients, a fairness principle known as egalitarian fairness. However, achieving egalitarian fairness in FL may sacrifice the model performance for data-rich clients to benefti those with less data. This tradeoff raises concerns about the stability of FL, as data-rich clients may opt to leave the current coalition and join another that is more closely aligned with its expected high performance. In this context, our work rigorously addresses the critical concern: Does egalitarian fairness lead to instability? Drawing from game theory and social choice theory, we initially characterize fair FL systems as altruism coalition formation games (ACFGs) and reveal that the instability issues emerging from the pursuit of egalitarian fairness are significantly related to the clients\u2019 altruism within the coalition and the configuration of the friends-relationship networks among the clients. Then, we theoretically propose the optimal egalitarian fairness bounds that an FL coalition can achieve while maintaining core stability under various types of altruistic behaviors. The theoretical contributions clarify the quantitative relationships between achievable egalitarian fairness and the disparities in the sizes of local datasets, disproving the misconception that egalitarian fairness inevitably leads to instability. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the consistency of our theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds with the empirically achieved egalitarian fairness in fair FL settings.

In vanilla FLs, different clients sharing the same global model may experience varying performance (i.e., error) due to differences in the amount of data contributed by each client. As clients may lack access to significant data resources due to objective or unavoidable factors, such as regional specificity and historical inequalities, recent works [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have focused on ensuring that the performance of global model across the clients roughly comparable or even equal, termed as \u201cegalitarian fairness\u201d. In FLs complying with egalitarian fairness, the performance of the global model on clients contributing high data resources may decrease to enhance the performance on other clients contributing lower data resources, particularly when local datasets are heterogeneous. This case could potentially cause higher-resource clients to leave the current grand coalition and form a sub-coalition to achieve desired performance, thereby disrupting the core stability [10, 11] of the FL. In game theory, a coalition is said to be core-stable if no subcoalition exists such that the players of that sub-coalition can obtain a payoff no less than they are allocated in the original coalition and at least one player of that sub-coalition can obtain a payoff greater than it was allocated in the original coalition. Otherwise, the original coalition is said to be blocked.

These works view the FL process as a hedonic game [16] and assume that clients are selfish, with clients\u2019 utility functions being their own performance and only influenced by other individuals in the same coalition. However, in the real world, clients\u2019 behaviors are more complex: clients may form friends-relationships and exhibit altruism towards each other. Various external factors, such as commercial ties, welfare purpose, or shared research interests, etc, influence the relationships between clients. For instance, branches of the same corporation can be considered as friends due to common commercial goals. In contrast, branches from rival companies may be viewed as non-friends. Hospitals collaborating on developing a diagnostic model for welfare purposes can also be regarded as friends. Under altruistic behavior, a player\u2019s utility depends not only on their own performance but also on the performance of their friends. Furthermore, altruistic behaviors in FL, which have been largely overlooked in previous work, are particularly crucial when considering the impact of egalitarian fairness on stability. Altruistic behaviors influence the willingness of clients to sacrifice a certain degree from optimal performance [17, 18]. Considering the friend-relationships, Nguyen et al. [19] introduced altruistic hedonic games (AHGs), wherein players gain utility from their own valuation of the current coalition and the valuation of their friends within the same coalition. However, players who are friends may not be in the same coalition, but they can still influence each other\u2019s utility in the coalitions. For instance, altruistic hospital clients might choose to leave one coalition to join another where their friend hospitals are, aiming to enhance each other\u2019s performance collaboratively. When the FL process is described as AHGs, which excludes some friends\u2019 influence on a player\u2019s altruistic behavior, it may lead to a core-stable coalition in terms of local utilities but non-Pareto optimal in local errors. An alternative coalition structure exists where each client encounters an error not higher than that observed within the core-stable coalition structure, with at least one client experiencing a lower error.

Based on the degree of altruism, we define three types of client behavior: purely selfish (non-altruistic), purely altruistic, and friendly altruistic. Existing research on egalitarian fairness mainly involves two implementations: optimizing the global model towards the worst-performing client [5, 20, 6] or simultaneously to all clients [4, 7, 8]. Correspondingly, we further distinguish altruism into a min-based and a mean-based aggregation of the friends\u2019 performance: welfare altruism and equal altruism. We model the collaborative training involving clients with altruistic behavior as altruism coalition formation games (ACFGs), where clients\u2019 utilities depend on a network of friends via one of the above cases of altruism. We theoretically demonstrate that the ACFGs result in a core-stable grand coalition, which is also Pareto-optimal in local errors.

Existing results on stability in FL mainly focus on a particular aspect of the entire issue. For instance, Donahue et al. [12] have first formulated the model sharing problem as a hedonic game, in which each player derives some cost (error) from the coalition they join. The aim of their research is to identify the conditions when the grand coalition or partitions of players are stable for varying federation aggregation mechanisms. In their subsequent work [15], they have further contributed to calculating an optimal (minimum error) federating arrangement and analyzing the differences between stable arrangements and optimal arrangements using the canonical game-theoretic tools of the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability. Chaudhury et al. [14] have defined a fairness concept based on core stability, which requires that no subset of agents can benefit significantly than in grand coalition, and proposed CoreFed, an FL protocol to implement a core-stable predictor. Blum et al. [21] have proposed a stable and envy-free equilibrium-based collaboration protocol to meet the client\u2019s learning objectives while keeping their local data collection burden low. However, the impact of fairness on FL stability remains unexplored in existing work. Moreover, current research on the stability of FL is limited to the assumption of selfish individuals who compete with each other to win the game and maximize their own profits.

From more background on game theory and social choice theory, altruism [22, 23, 24] has been considered for cooperative games to date, in which the players\u2019 payoffs in the resulting game do not only depend on their individual payoffs but also on the neighborhood graph and the aggregation functions that reflect the social context. Numerous studies [25, 26, 27, 28] have highlighted the ubiquity and rationality of human altruism from economic, neural, and evolutionary perspectives. Rothe [22] has systematically introduced certain notions of altruism into existing game-theoretic models in both non-cooperative and cooperative games. Kerkmann et al. [29] have formally distinguished three degrees of altruism: selfish-first, equal-treatment, and altruistic-treatment preferences and studied both the axiomatic properties and the computational complexity of stability in altruistic hedonic games. In their other work [30], they have additionally studied stability notions and computational analysis of altruism in coalition formation games. These works in game theory, where altruistic players only prefer coalitions with more friends, are constrained in the FL setting when additional model performance on both the player and their friends need to be considered.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
