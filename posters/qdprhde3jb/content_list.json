Tax mechanisms are a common method to alleviate this issue and induce socially optimal behavior. In this work, we take the initial step of learning the optimal tax that can maximize social welfare with limited feedback in congestion games. We propose a new type of feedback named equilibrium feedback, where the tax designer can only observe the Nash equilibrium after deploying a tax plan. Existing algorithms are not applicable due to the exponentially large tax function space, nonexistence of the gradient, and nonconvexity of the objective. To tackle these challenges, we design a computationally efficient algorithm that leverages several novel components: (1) a piece-wise linear tax to approximate the optimal tax; (2) extra linear terms to guarantee a strongly convex potential function; (3) an efficient subroutine to find the exploratory tax that can provide critical information about the game. The algorithm can find an $\\epsilon_{}$ -optimal tax with $O(\\beta F^{2}/\\epsilon)$ sample complexity, where $\\beta$ is the smoothness of the cost function and $F$ is the number of facilities.

Importantly, the objectives of individual players are not always aligned with the system efficiency, and the system designer should take this into consideration. A widely known example is Braess\u2019s paradox, where adding more roads to a network can make the network more congested [Braess, 1968]. Price of anarchy is a notion that measures the inefficiency caused by selfish behavior compared with optimal centralized behavior [Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou, 1999]. Characterizing such inefficiency has been an active research area with applications in resource allocation [Marden and Roughgarden, 2014], traffic congestion [Roughgarden and Tardos, 2004], and others. The inefficiency motivates research on how to design mechanisms to improve performance even when the players are still behaving selfishly.

The goal of tax mechanisms is to incentivize self-interested players to follow socially optimal behavior by applying tax/subsidy. Congestion game is a widely studied class of game theory models characterizing the interactions between players sharing facilities, where the cost of each facility depends on the \u201ccongestion\u201d level [Wardrop, 1952, Rosenthal, 1973]. As a motivating example, in traffic routing games, each facility corresponds to an edge in a network, and each player chooses a path that connects her source node and target node. The cost of each facility corresponds to the latency of each edge, which depends on the number of players using that edge. Then, the tax can be interpreted as the toll collected by the road owner or the government to improve overall traffic efficiency [Bergendorff et al., 1997].

As Nash equilibrium is the only stable state of the system, we study a partial information feedback setting named \u201cequilibrium feedback\", where the tax designer can only observe information about the Nash equilibrium.

We refer the readers to the textbook [Nisan et al., 2007] for a general introduction to congestion games, the price of anarchy and tax mechanisms. Nonatomic congestion games were first studied in [Pigou, 1912] and formalized by [Wardrop, 1952]. Atomic congestion games were introduced by [Rosenthal, 1973] and the connection with potential games is developed by [Monderer and Shapley, 1996]. In contrast to general-sum games without structures, (approximate) Nash equilibrium can be computed efficiently in congestion games due to the existence of the potential function. Recently, various algorithms are developed to learn the Nash equilibrium in congestion games with different feedback oracles [Krichene et al., 2015, Chen and Lu, 2016, Cui et al., 2022, Jiang et al., 2022, Panageas et al., 2023, Dong et al., 2023, Dadi et al., 2024].

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
