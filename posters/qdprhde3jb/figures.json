We can observe that the social welfare converges to the optimal one quickly.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of the proposed algorithm for learning optimal tax design in congestion games, in terms of social welfare. The algorithm is tested under different parameters (c and p), which represent the cost function parameters in the game. The plots illustrate that the algorithm quickly converges to the optimal social welfare value across different parameter settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding near-optimal tax strategies.", "section": "5 Learning Optimal Tax in Nonatomic Congestion Games"}, {"figure_path": "QDprhde3jb/figures/figures_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Estimated Tax Functions at the Last Iteration for various values of c and p. The estimation is not uniformly accurate but they are accurate at the induced Nash equilibrium.", "description": "This figure shows the estimated tax functions learned by the algorithm at the last iteration for different values of parameters c and p in the Pigou's example.  The plots compare the learned tax functions (estimated tax) to the theoretical marginal cost tax (marginal cost tax) for each combination of c and p. The results show that the estimated tax function is not always perfectly accurate across the whole range of edge loads; however, they seem to be accurate near the Nash equilibrium load induced by the tax, which is the critical region for tax design. The accuracy of the estimation varies depending on the values of c and p.", "section": "E Experiments"}]
