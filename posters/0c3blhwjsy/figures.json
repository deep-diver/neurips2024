The graph consists of one common type of online agent (\u03bb\u2080 = n-1) and n rare types of online agents (\u03bb\u1d62 = 1/n for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).  Each rare type connects exclusively to one offline agent, while the common type connects to all offline agents.  This setup highlights the challenge of balancing fairness across different types of agents when an algorithm must make immediate decisions about allocation without complete information.", "section": "Proof of Part (1) of Theorem 2: 1/2-Upper Bound for Non-Rejecting"}]
