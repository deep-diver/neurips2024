Inspired by the human learning mechanism, we introduce LOVA3, an innovative framework named \u201cLearning tO Visual question Answering, Asking and Assessment,\u201d designed to equip MLLMs with these additional capabilities. Our approach involves the creation of two supplementary training tasks GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at fostering the skills of asking and assessing questions in the context of images.

For assessment, we introduce a new benchmark called EvalQABench, comprising 64,000 training samples (split evenly between positive and negative samples) and 5,000 validation and testing samples. We posit that enhancing MLLMs with the capabilities to answer, ask, and assess questions will enhance their multimodal comprehension, ultimately improving overall performance. To validate this hypothesis, we train MLLMs using the $\\mathbf{LOVA^{3}}$ framework and evaluate them on a range of multimodal datasets and benchmarks.

Current MLLMs [42, 84, 3, 95] are excelled in addressing diverse domains of multimodal questions such as mathematics [4], science [42], and commonsense knowledge [17]. However, they predominantly revolve around visual question answering (VQA). As a result, as shown in Fig. 1, current MLLMs, e.g., the representative LLaVA-1.5 [42], suffer from inferior performance on asking questions and self-assess question-answer pairs (QA), which underscores their efficacy as problem-solvers and prohibits holistic multimodal understanding.

We believe that if an MLLM can successfully generate QA pairs for challenging tasks, it indicates a higher level of problem-solving ability [40, 73]. Specifically, we define the GenQA task to include not only generic VQA (e.g., VQAv2 [26] and GQA [30]) but also Multi-Choice VQA (MC VQA), and Multi-Turn VQA (MT) to increase the variety of data formats. Additionally, we incorporate two challenging multimodal grounding tasks into the training process: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation (REG). Learning to generate the data of these grounding tasks forces the MLLM to extract fine-grained visual cues from images, such as explicit object localization and compositional relationships. This, in turn, enhances the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs. During training, we gather the relevant datasets for these tasks and transform them into a generative format using our proposed instruction template. EvalQA, on the other hand, involves tasking the MLLM to predict the correctness of a given visual-question-answer triplet. Recognizing the absence of datasets specifically designed to assess VQA correctness, we have developed a new benchmark called EvalQABench for evaluating VQA data. Rather than asking humans to label such a dataset, we propose a new pipeline for data construction. This benchmark comprises training, validation, and test sets, with each VQA pair accompanied by a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d label indicating correctness, along with a one-sentence explanation as the feedback.

As for the object hallucination benchmarks, our model attains $87.4\\%$ accuracy at an average of its three subsets. Remarkably, these enhancements in VQAv2 and GQA performance are achieved without any extra datasets, underscoring the significant impact of integrating GenQA and EvalQA into our training to promote performance improvements on these generic VQA tasks. Based on the results from smaller LLMs, our LOVA3-1.5B outperforms the baseline LLaVA-Phi-1.5 on VQAv2, GQA, VizWiz, and ScienceQA by $2.6\\%$ , $2.5\\%$ , $3.4\\%$ , and $0.5\\%$ , respectively. This demonstrates a consistent improvement when training with our $\\mathrm{LOVA^{3}}$ framework across varying LLM sizes.

The vision encoder is responsible for processing the input image $X_{I}$ to align the learned visual features with the text input $X_{T}$ . Next, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) adapter projects the visual feature $F_{I}$ to $Z_{I}$ . Finally, the large language model utilizes $Z_{I}$ and the current text embedding $Z_{T}$ to predict the response in a left-to-right manner. During training, the data of the three tasks is mixed.

Possessing this capability would enhance an MLLM\u2019s potential as an intelligent assistant in human-AI interactions by accurately identifying and referring regions of interest. Thus, besides considering the aforementioned multimodal tasks, we also consider involving grounding tasks like REC and REG to enhance the model capability related to positions. For REC, it aims to ground the region of an image with the given referring expression. About REG, the target is to give the corresponding expression when giving the exact coordinates.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
