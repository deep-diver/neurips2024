First, while DIPO also performs gradient ascent on the action, it replaces $a^{t a r g e t}$ with the original $a$ from the buffer rather than retaining an additional $a^{t a r g e t}$ . Therefore, the transition no longer aligns with the current MDP dynamics and reward function due to the replacement of the original $a$ . Given that DIPO is an off-policy algorithm, the reuse of these replaced transitions for training the Q-function could be problematic, as the agent is training values of actions that have not been actually played out in the environment and their true outcome (reward and next state) are unknown. Second, DIPO uses different batches for Q-learning and policy updates, which does not guarantee coherent updates. $Q$ -score matching (QSM) [55] also computes $\\nabla_{a}Q(s,a)$ and matches vector fields of $\\nabla_{a}\\log\\pi(a|s)$ and $\\nabla_{a}Q(s,a)$ .

We discretize the maze and track the cell visitation. To avoid the dominance of high-density areas such as the starting positions, we set a max density threshold of 100, which means the cell has been visited at least 100 times. As shown in Fig. 5, in selected results for AntMaze- $\\nu3$ , DDiffPG explores multiple paths to the two separate goal positions, contrasting sharply with baselines that typically discover only a single path. For state coverage in Fig. 6, we measure the binary coverage of each cell and find that DDiffPG achieves a much higher coverage rate than baselines except RPG, verifying that the continuous exploration capability of DDiffPG helps exploration. While RPG achieves good exploration, it fails to solve the task as shown in Fig. 4. The maps for all AntMaze tasks and baselines are available in Appx. F.

", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "In AntMaze-v1, an ant must circumvent a central obstacle to reach its goal, with two possible routes: over the top or beneath the bottom. The optimal path depends on the ant\u2019s randomized starting position since there is only one shortest path. As shown in Fig. 11, DDiffPG discovers both routes and learns to select the shortest one based on the starting location, while baselines struggle to adjust their paths adaptively. In AntMaze-v2, the ant faces two goals: the top-left goal offers a higher reward, while the right-hand goal is easier to reach. Baseline models often get trapped going for the easier, lower-reward goal. However, we plot the Q-value density maps in Fig. 13, and we find that DDiffPG locates both goals and learns to go either one of them, effectively overcoming the local minima and reaching a higher cumulative return. On the other hand, RPG also explores the top-left goal and overcomes the local minima. However, it cannot consistently solve the task.

Due to the mixed multimodal batch, a larger batch-size helps smooth the learning.

An adaptive approach to the learning rate might be beneficial. Finally, our computational time analysis in Fig.8 reveals that our DDiffPG method is approximately five times slower than both TD3 and SAC, primarily due to the overhead associated with updating target actions.

We replicate the routine path problem described in Sec. 1 in our maze experiments by introducing random obstacles that obstruct certain paths. As discussed in Sec. 4.3, our policy can selectively execute different modes by conditioning the mode\u2019s embedding. To capitalize on this feature, we developed a proof-of-concept planner, which iteratively tests different modes until a successful route is found. Specifically, if the ant remains stationary at a location for 10 consecutive steps, the planner initiates an alternative mode. As shown in Tab. 3, while baseline methods tend to fail, becoming stuck in front of newly introduced obstacles until the end of an episode, our proof-of-concept planner demonstrates a significantly higher success rate. This demonstrates the adaptability and efficacy of our multimodal policy in performing in nonstationary environments.

We parameterized the policy as diffusion model and proposed diffusion policy gradient to enable training diffusion models with RL objectives in online settings. Unlike existing methods that rely on latent conditioning to retain multimodality, we emphasized explicitly discovering, preserving, and improving multimodal behaviors. First, we employed a novelty-based intrinsic motivation to explore different modes and used an unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach over trajectories to identify them. Nevertheless, the RL objective can skew the policy toward a single mode. We addressed the issue by introducing mode-specific Q-functions to optimize each mode, providing the diffusion policy with a multimodal batch to train on. We further achieved explicit mode control by conditioning the policy on a mode-specific latent embedding, which was shown to be useful for online replanning. Our evaluation demonstrated the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness in learning multimodal behaviors in complex control scenarios, such as AntMazes and robotic tasks, and showcased the potential of the multimodal policy to encourage exploration and overcome local minima. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations However, our approach also has some limitations. Clustering knowledge prerequisite: Hierarchical clustering depends on a distance matrix calculated from trajectories. In practice, we compute it over the ant\u2019s 2D positions or the robot\u2019s end-effector (EE) 3D positions, rather than the entire state space. This poses a problem in scenarios like locomotion control, where different gaits may exhibit similar position changes. A possible solution is to encode trajectories into latent embeddings for clustering. Exploration challenges: while our current intrinsic motivation approach is effective, its performance might drop in larger spaces, as our method demands uncovering as many as possible viable solutions. This can be mitigated through different information-based motivation, or by adding a bound on the information contained withing explored modes. Increased computation time: the diffusion process in diffusion models lengthens training and inference wall-clock times compared to simpler MLP models, limiting, for now, the real-time application of diffusion policies in domains such as robotic control. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Future directions Overall, we believe our work paves the way for training multimodal diffusion policies and offers several promising research avenues. Online replanning with long-horizon planners: while our paper demonstrates online replanning using a multimodal policy with a brute-force method, exploring planners that can efficiently orchestrate these modes for complex, long-horizon tasks presents an intriguing opportunity. Offilne-to-online learning: diffusion policy has been widely used in offline settings. However, the offline dataset may contain suboptimal trajectories. Our method is suitable for offline-to-online fine-tuning, allowing the agent to further refine policies without killing the previously learned modes. Open-ended learning on large-scale environments: viewing our method as a form of unsupervised skill discovery opens up possibilities for enabling the acquisition of diverse and useful skills beyond mere goal achievement.
