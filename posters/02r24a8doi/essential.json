However, existing algorithms often suffer from increasing regret (cumulative difference from optimal performance) as the number of learning episodes increases.  A significant challenge in RL is handling model misspecification, where the actual environment differs from the assumed model. This often leads to poor performance and large regret.\nThis paper introduces a novel algorithm, Cert-LSVI-UCB, designed to address the limitations of existing RL algorithms.  The algorithm employs an innovative \"certified estimator\" to accurately estimate the value function and handle model misspecification effectively.  This leads to a constant regret bound, meaning that the regret remains bounded regardless of the number of learning episodes.  The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulations which demonstrates the performance and robustness of Cert-LSVI-UCB.
