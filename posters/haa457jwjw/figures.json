[{"figure_path": "haa457jwjw/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performance comparison of algorithms for piecewise-stationary Bwk", "description": "This figure compares the performance of three algorithms (IRES-CM, Immorlica et al. 2019, and Zhou et al. 2008) on a piecewise-stationary bandit with knapsack problem.  Two scenarios are shown: one where the optimal solution uses a single arm, and one where it uses a mixture of arms. Each line represents the average cumulative reward over 10 simulations, with shaded areas indicating the variance. The dotted lines represent the linear program (LP) benchmark (FA). The results show that IRES-CM generally outperforms the other two algorithms, particularly in the mixed arms scenario, suggesting its effectiveness in this more complex setting.", "section": "Numerical Experiments"}]
