Likelihood-free methods offer an alternative but often lack theoretical rigor and scalability.  Furthermore, applying optimal transport to this problem is challenging due to the computational cost of finding optimal transport plans. \nThis paper proposes a novel simulation-free approach based on a dynamic formulation of conditional optimal transport. By leveraging the geometry of the conditional Wasserstein space and a new method called \"COT flow matching,\" the authors directly model the geodesic path of measures induced by a triangular optimal transport plan, avoiding the need for explicit simulation.  The method shows competitive results on various tasks, including infinite-dimensional problems, highlighting its efficiency and scalability.
