However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.  This limits our ability to design more effective and interpretable LLMs.  Existing research offers limited understanding of CoT's inner workings and conditions for its appearance. \nThis research investigates how CoT reasoning emerges in transformers through controlled experiments. The study introduces iterative tasks and algorithms to analyze the emergence of CoT in a simplified setting.  By examining attention patterns within a two-layer transformer, researchers identified a specialized attention mechanism, named \"iteration heads,\" that facilitates CoT.  The study demonstrates how iteration heads enable the transformer to solve iterative problems effectively, highlighting the importance of attention mechanisms in enabling more complex reasoning. The findings reveal that iteration heads exhibit good transferability between tasks, showcasing the value of data curation strategies for improving LLM performance.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "QBCxWpOt5w/podcast.wav"}
