These conflicts arise when multiple fairness objectives are incorporated via meta-learning; the overall gradient might not align with the best updates for all subgroups, resulting in unstable model performance and potentially unfair results. This paper tackles this challenge head-on. \n\nThe proposed solution is a two-stage meta-learning framework that leverages the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) to resolve these conflicts.  The first stage uses NBS to find a solution that steers the model towards the Pareto front, achieving a balance between different fairness goals. The second stage further optimizes the model based on specific fairness objectives.  The approach is supported by theoretical results, demonstrating Pareto improvement and monotonic improvement in validation loss. Experiments on various benchmark datasets highlight its efficacy in improving both performance and fairness compared to existing one-stage methods.", "affiliation": "Virginia Tech", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "eGJnB3tUgv/podcast.wav"}
