The 'modality gap' between audio and visual elements poses a significant challenge for multimodal representation learning.  This paper addresses these challenges by re-purposing existing image captioning models to perform zero-shot audio captioning.  This innovative approach avoids the need for extensive labeled audio data.\nThe proposed solution involves a novel two-stage methodology. First, it aligns the token distributions of an audio encoder and the image captioner's encoder using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) or Optimal Transport (OT). This alignment enables the image captioner to perform zero-shot audio captioning. Second, it fine-tunes the model using audiovisual distillation, refining the model's ability to generate audio captions based on both audio and visual information.  The research achieves significant improvements in zero-shot audio captioning, showcasing the effectiveness of its approach.", "affiliation": "LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "U6oQEzSp8z/podcast.wav"}
