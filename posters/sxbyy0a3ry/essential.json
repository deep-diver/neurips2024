These methods usually rely on updating noisy images via backpropagation from custom loss functions, which often lack fine-grained control over individual bounding boxes. This paper introduces limitations in previous methods.\nThe paper introduces GROUNDIT, a novel training-free technique that leverages the flexibility of the Transformer architecture in Diffusion Transformers (DiT). GROUNDIT uses a two-stage approach: (1) Global Update, which uses cross-attention maps for coarse alignment, and (2) Local Update, which utilizes a novel noisy patch transplantation technique for fine-grained spatial control.  This method demonstrates improved spatial grounding accuracy across benchmarks and addresses the limitations of prior approaches by achieving more precise spatial control over individual bounding boxes.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "SXbyy0a3rY/podcast.wav"}
