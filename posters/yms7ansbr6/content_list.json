The case is particularly alarming in LipSync fraud, where the audio drives the mouth movements on reconstructed video frames. These DeepFakes are generally exploited by malicious actors in real-world scenarios, such as the widely disseminated fabricated videos of Barack Obama saying things he never said on YouTube [8], posing significant security threats.

In recent years, several multi-modal-based methods have emerged [13, 14, 15], including audio-visual fusion and audio-visual inconsistency. Fusion strategies may confound the learning of singular modality features and the performance postfusion is not necessarily enhanced [16].

To address this issue, some studies shift focus to frequency domain features [28, 29] or subtle forgery artifacts in more generalized datasets [30, 31]. Another line is to guide the network to focus on discriminative locations, such as automatically guiding the detector\u2019s positional attention through a double-stream network [32], or manually cropping the lip region to extract artifacts formed by the inconsistent lip movements [33]. Although these works have achieved considerable performance on afore datasets, they are not sensitive when faced with advanced lip-syncing generators due to the absence of synchronized audio features. In the multi-modal-based detectors, noticing that the coordination of audio-visual modalities is an inherently challenging issue in any SOTA generator, [34] quantifies the disparity between audio and visual as the criterion for classification, but focusing too much on the background information in the video led to failure. In this context, [35] intentionally extracts talking head movements and establishes a correlation with audio for discrimination.
