This is partly due to the limitations of existing benchmarks and the lack of human-like modeling in algorithms. This paper introduces CPDTrack, a novel visual tracking algorithm inspired by the Central-Peripheral Dichotomy (CPD) theory of human vision.  CPDTrack uses a central vision module for precise localization and a peripheral vision module for global awareness, improving the tracker's ability to handle complex scenes and maintain tracking over time.  It also introduces the STDChallenge Benchmark, a new dataset designed to specifically assess trackers' visual search abilities in scenarios with spatio-temporal discontinuities, including a human baseline for comparison.\n\nCPDTrack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on the STDChallenge Benchmark and exhibits strong generalizability across other benchmarks. The results highlight the importance of human-like modeling in visual tracking and demonstrate that incorporating human-centered design principles can lead to more robust and efficient algorithms.  **The STDChallenge benchmark and human baseline provides a high-quality environment for evaluating trackers' capabilities**.  **The CPDTrack algorithm demonstrates the significant advantages of human-like modeling** by closing the gap between machine and human performance in complex visual tracking tasks.
