To address this issue, this work introduces the weighted score matching estimator to point processes. Theoretically, we prove the consistency of our estimator and establish its rate of convergence. Experimental results indicate that our estimator accurately estimates model parameters on synthetic data and yields results consistent with MLE on real data.

Typical models include Poisson processes [9] and Hawkes processes [3]. Their applications span various fields such as seismology [16; 17], finance [1; 4], criminology [15], and neuroscience [11; 26]. In the field of point processes, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has been a conventional estimator. However, MLE has an inherent limitation: it requires the computation of the normalizing constant, which corresponds to the intensity integral term in the likelihood. Except for simple cases, calculating the intensity integral analytically is generally infeasible. This necessitates the use of numerical integration methods like Monte Carlo or quadrature for approximating the computation. This introduces approximation errors, and more importantly, for high-dimensional problems, numerical integration encounters the curse of dimensionality, rendering training infeasible.

These works have greatly advanced the utilization of SM for point processes. However, in practical applications, we have found that these estimators only work for specific point processes.

However, we cannot directly minimize the above objective function since it depends on the unknown data distribution. To facilitate solving, we need to convert the above explicit SM to implicit SM by using a trick of integration by parts, provided that some regularity conditions are satisfied [5]. In [18; 24; 10], they assume that the required regularity conditions are satisfied in their point process models and directly employ the implicit SM objective. However, as demonstrated in Section 3, the required regularity conditions cannot be met for general point processes.
