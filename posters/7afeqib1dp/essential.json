The challenge is finding efficient algorithms that work well in various scenarios without needing substantial training data.  Existing methods using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require extensive training data and struggle with generalization, while classic methods are limited to simpler structures and perform poorly with high-dimensional data.\nThis research introduces a new method called SCI-BDVP, which uses untrained neural networks.  SCI-BDVP employs a theoretical framework to optimize the image acquisition process and utilizes a technique called 'bagged-DIP' to improve robustness and performance, particularly when dealing with noise.  Experiments show that SCI-BDVP surpasses other UNN-based methods for video SCI recovery, especially in the presence of noise.  The proposed method also provides insights into how to best design the image acquisition masks, ultimately advancing the capabilities and efficiency of SCI.", "affiliation": "ECE Department, Rutgers University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "7aFEqIb1dp/podcast.wav"}
