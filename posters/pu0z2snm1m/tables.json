It begins by defining an intervention on the covariate of interest and uses an explanatory causal model (ECM) to simulate counterfactual data.  The algorithm then applies the predictive model to this counterfactual data to generate predictions. Finally, individual counterfactual curves are plotted, along with their average, to visualize the causal dependence.", "section": "2.5 Causal Dependence Plots"}, {"figure_path": "pU0z2sNM1M/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: TDP, NDDP, and NIDP uncertainty bands for the salary example using the random forest model in Figure 1.
