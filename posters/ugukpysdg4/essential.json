Acquiring such datasets is often expensive and time-consuming.  Existing data augmentation techniques either introduce limited diversity (transformation-based) or risk distribution shifts (synthesis-based), hindering model performance. This necessitates the development of new methods that can efficiently and effectively expand datasets while maintaining data quality. \nThis paper introduces DistDiff, a training-free data augmentation framework.  **DistDiff uses a novel distribution-aware diffusion model** that leverages hierarchical prototypes to approximate the true data distribution. This approach generates high-quality, diverse synthetic samples that are consistent with the original data distribution. Experiments show that DistDiff significantly outperforms existing techniques, improving model accuracy across multiple datasets and architectural frameworks. **Its training-free nature and compatibility with other augmentation methods further enhance its practical value.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "UGUkPYSdg4/podcast.wav"}
