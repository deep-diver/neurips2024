Existing methods for interpreting neural activations have limitations in scope and often require researchers to predefine what information to extract. This is where <strong>InversionView shines</strong>. It addresses these challenges by focusing on the pre-image of activations, i.e., the inputs that yield similar activation patterns. By sampling from the pre-image, this method allows researchers to directly infer the information encoded by each activation vector.</p><p>InversionView is applied to several case studies, including character counting, indirect object identification, and 3-digit addition, using various models from small transformers to GPT-2. Results show that InversionView effectively reveals valuable information in activations, <strong>confirming the decoded information via causal intervention</strong>. It successfully uncovers both basic and complex information like token identity, position, counts, and abstract knowledge.

It would briefly touch upon existing methods for interpreting neural activations and their limitations, setting the stage for InversionView&rsquo;s unique approach. <strong>The core novelty</strong> of InversionView might involve its focus on the pre-image of activations ‚Äì the set of inputs producing similar activations ‚Äì arguing that this pre-image directly embodies the information content. The introduction would likely hint at the practical application of InversionView, perhaps mentioning the use of a trained decoder model to sample from the pre-image and how this facilitates a deeper understanding of transformer model algorithms.

This involves translating the high-dimensional vector representations into human-interpretable insights. <strong>InversionView</strong>, as presented in the research paper, offers a novel approach by focusing on the pre-image of activations‚Äîthe set of inputs that produce similar activation patterns. This differs from techniques like supervised probes which rely on pre-defined tasks. <strong>Instead, InversionView leverages a trained decoder to sample inputs based on a given activation, revealing the underlying information encoded in these vectors</strong>. The method&rsquo;s strength lies in its generality and applicability across diverse model architectures and tasks. <strong>It facilitates the discovery of algorithms implemented by the models by allowing researchers to examine the commonalities within this sampled pre-image</strong>. However, challenges include the scalability of sampling from potentially large input spaces and the inherent complexity of interpreting the decoded information. Nonetheless, <strong>InversionView demonstrates promise as a principled tool for gaining a deeper understanding of neural network behavior and deciphering the information content of their internal activations</strong>, ultimately paving the way for better model transparency and control.</p><h4 class="relative group">Transformer Circuits<div id=transformer-circuits class=anchor></div><span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#transformer-circuits aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h4><p>The concept of &ldquo;Transformer Circuits&rdquo; represents a significant advancement in neural network interpretability. It posits that complex neural networks, particularly transformer models, can be understood not as monolithic black boxes, but rather as a collection of interconnected, modular circuits. These circuits, potentially consisting of attention heads, MLP layers, and other components, perform specific sub-computations. <strong>Understanding these circuits requires identifying the information flow and processing within each component and how they interact.</strong> This approach moves beyond simple visualization of activations to a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithmic processes. The success of this approach hinges on the ability to identify the functional roles of individual circuits by observing how they transform input information. <strong>By dissecting the network into smaller, more manageable units, the Transformer Circuits framework makes the internal workings of large, deep networks more comprehensible.</strong> Furthermore, this approach facilitates targeted interventions and analyses which can provide detailed explanations for the model&rsquo;s decisions and behavior. Challenges include the complexity of identifying and mapping these circuits, and the variability in behavior that may emerge from interactions between circuits.</p><h4 class="relative group">InversionView Limits<div id=inversionview-limits class=anchor></div><span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#inversionview-limits aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h4><p>InversionView, while powerful, has limitations. <strong>Scalability</strong> is a concern; exhaustively searching the preimage becomes computationally expensive with high-dimensional data and large models. The reliance on a trained decoder introduces an additional layer of complexity and potential bias, and the <strong>decoder&rsquo;s accuracy directly impacts the reliability of the results</strong>. Moreover, the method&rsquo;s reliance on a threshold parameter requires careful consideration as it impacts the granularity and scope of the information revealed. The success of InversionView also depends on the <strong>representational geometry</strong> of the activations, which is model-specific and may not always be intuitive or consistent. Finally, interpreting the preimages themselves, while potentially aided by LLMs, remains a <strong>labor-intensive and subjective process</strong>, highlighting the need for further automation to fully harness its potential.</p><h4 class="relative group">Future Directions<div id=future-directions class=anchor></div><span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#future-directions aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h4><p>Future research could explore several promising avenues. <strong>Scaling InversionView to larger models and datasets</strong> is crucial, requiring efficient methods for handling high-dimensional activation spaces and potentially more sophisticated decoder architectures. <strong>Automating the interpretation process</strong> further, perhaps by leveraging large language models to analyze the generated samples and formulate hypotheses, would significantly increase efficiency and scalability. Investigating the <strong>applicability of InversionView across different neural network architectures and modalities</strong>, such as vision and audio, would broaden its impact and reveal potential insights into how information is processed in various contexts. A deeper exploration of <strong>the relationship between InversionView and other interpretability methods</strong>, such as causal intervention and activation patching, may lead to more powerful and comprehensive techniques.

The model counts how often the target character (after 'l') occurs in the prefix (before 'l'). B and E denote beginning and end of sequence tokens. The query activation conditions the decoder to generate samples capturing its information content. We show non-cherrypicked samples inside and outside the e-preimage (‚Ç¨ = 0.1) at three activation sites on the same query input. Distance for each sample is calculated between activations corresponding to the parenthesized characters in the query input and the sample. 'True count' indicates the correct count of the target character in the samples (decoder may generate incorrect counts). (a) MLP layer amplifies count information. Comparing the distances before (left) and after (right) the MLP, we see that samples with diverging counts become much more distant from the query activation. (b) In the next layer (':' exclusively attends to target character ‚Äì copying information from residual stream of target character to the residual stream of ':'), the count is retained but the identity of the target character is no longer encoded ('c', 'm', etc. instead of 'g'), as it is no longer relevant for the predicting the count.

Activation patching results show that ate and a1,0 play crucial roles in prediction, as hypothesized based on Figure 3 and Sec. 3.3. In contrast examples, only one character differs. Top: We patch activations cumulatively from left to right. We can see patching ate accounts for the whole effect, and when a¬ø¬∫ is already patched, patching a1,0 has almost no effect. Bottom: On the other hand, if we patch cumulatively from right to left, a1,0 accounts for the whole effect while patching a has no effect if a¬π,0 has been patched.
