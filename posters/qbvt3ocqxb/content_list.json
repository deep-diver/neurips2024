[21] conducted research on zero-shot domain adaptation of object detection networks from daytime to nighttime scenes. They utilized data augmentation to maximize the distance between daytime and nighttime input images while minimizing the differences in features within the backbone network, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s robustness to variations in image brightness. GAL et al. [19] were the first to integrate the CLIP network [22] into the Style-GAN [39] image generation model for zero-shot domain adaptation. They proposed a text-guided image generation network domain adaptation method, leveraging the robustness of the CLIP network in open-world scenarios to guide network adaptation from the source domain to the target domain using text descriptions. Furthermore, GAL et al.[19] proposed a strategy for selecting fine-tuning layers. During the network adaptation towards the target domain, specific layers are adjusted based on the magnitude of weight changes to enhance the stability of network domain adaptation. Kim et al. replaced the StyleGAN network in the StyleGAN-NADA method with the diffusion network [40], proposing DiffusionCLIP [41], which achieved better performance. Guo et al. [16] argued that StyleGAN-NADA and DiffusionCLIP identify all images using a single text description, leading to overly uniform directions in domain adaptation and potential pattern collapse issues. Therefore, they proposed a specific text descriptor prediction module that individually predicts a specific text description for each source domain image, effectively reducing the risk of pattern collapse. To increase the diversity of domain transfer directions, Jeon et al. [17] proposed a perturbation strategy where noise is artificially added during text feature extraction, along with an orthogonal constraint to reduce the redundancy of the noise. Additionally, Jeon et al. [17] argued that specifying certain layers for fine-tuning in StyleGAN-NADA is unreasonable, because the remaining layers also contribute to the network\u2019s predictions in the target domain. Therefore, they introduced an EWC [42] (Elastic Weight Consolidation) regularization term to fine-tune all layers of the network, but with constraints on the range of weight changes to avoid excessive adjustments. Fahes et al.[20] proposed the zero-shot domain adaptation method P0DA for semantic segmentation. Its core was a text-guided feature augmentation module. This allowed the augmentation module to augment source domain features according to the text description of the target domain, obtaining features that approximated the target domain distribution. As a result, during training, the network gained the ability to handle target domain feature distributions.

Liang et al.[37] introduced Swin-Transformer [44] into the SR network, which effectively alleviated issues such as patch boundary artifacts and limited receptive fields with patches, using a sliding window approach. HAT [24] further enhanced the feature correlation between windows in SwinIR by introducing Overlapping Cross-Attention Blocks (OCAB) to enhance feature interactions between adjacent windows.

Therefore, Zhang et al. [46] first employed shift convolution to extract local structural information from images while maintaining complexity similar to 1x1 convolutions. Then, they introduced group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA) modules, which used different window sizes to compute self-attention on non-overlapping feature groups. By cascading shift convolution with GMSA modules, ELAN effectively enhanced the processing speed of existing Transformer-based SR networks. Zhou et al. [25] aimed to reduce the computational burden of networks using large-scale window self-attention. Its core concept was permuted self-attention (PSA), which reduced the channel dimension of the key and value matrices and then incorporated spatial information into the channel dimension. This approach effectively prevented the loss of spatial information while reducing the number of channels. Sun et al. [26] split features along the channel dimension and extracted these split features at different downsampling ratios, enabling the network to have a larger receptive field while effectively reducing computational cost.

To address this issue, test-time domain-adaptive SR networks [34],[47],[48],[49],[50] were introduced, treating the training set as the source domain and the test set as the target domain. During inference on the target domain, the network simulated the degradation experienced by target domain LR images to generate additional training samples. Training the network with these simulated samples, which approximated the target domain\u2019s degradation, effectively reduced the negative impact of distribution discrepancies on network performance. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Shocher et al. [34] can be seen as a test-time domain-adaptive SR network. During inference, it performed Bicubic downsampling on target domain LR images to generate pseudo-LR images, simulating the degradation of the target domain LR images. It then used paired target domain LR and pseudo-LR images for supervised training, achieving super-resolution without requiring labels for target domain HR images. Soh et al. [47] suggested that the ZSSR [34] network repeatedly performed domain adaptation training from the random initial weights, leading to long training times. Therefore, they attempted to find a universal initial weight parameter to reduce the duration of domain adaptation training. Deng et al. [48] argued that the ZSSR network\u2019s consideration of only the Bicubic downsampling degradation model was insufficient to represent the more complex degradation models encountered by LR images in real-world scenarios. Therefore, they proposed the SRTTA network, which considered various degradation factors such as GaussianBlur, DefocusBlur, GlassBlur, and GaussianNoise. They used a pre-trained degradation classification network to identify the degradation category of target domain LR images and generated corresponding pseudo-LR images based on this classification. This more accurate degradation modeling enabled SRTTA to achieve better SR performance. Rad et al. [49] constrained fine-tuning samples by actively selecting additional reference samples that optimize fine-tuning efficiency, thereby improving network performance. Additionally, Zhang et al.

", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Although test-time domain-adaptive SR networks had considered various degradation models, realworld scenarios involved highly complex degradation due to factors such as lighting and imaging devices, which manual degradation models could not fully represent. To address this, adversarial generated domain adaptation methods emerged [14],[52],[53],[54],[15],[55],[56],[57], using generative adversarial networks for implicit modeling of degradation, thereby avoiding the need for complex manual modeling. Fritsche et al. [53] separated high-frequency and low-frequency information for domain adaptation training. They considered that texture details correspond to high-frequency information, which is crucial for SR tasks. Therefore, they applied high-frequency filtering before feeding the features into the discriminator, using the discriminator to constrain the high-frequency information, effectively improving SR performance in reconstructing texture details. Ji et al. [54] similarly constrained generated images at the frequency level, using the discriminator for adversarial training on high-frequency information and introducing a Frequency Density Comparator to enable the network to perceive frequency differences at varying sampling rates, further improving SR performance. Subsequently, Wang et al. [15] considered the impact of domain distance between the target domain and the source domain on network domain adaptation training. They optimized the network adaptation process based on the domain distance mapped by a discriminator, assigning higher learning weights to samples with higher domain similarity, further enhancing the network\u2019s fti to the target domain. Yin et al. [55] also adopted the concept of distance awareness from [52] and achieved good performance in facial SR tasks. Xu et al.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
