{"importance": "This paper is crucial because **it tackles the real-world challenge of limited data availability in super-resolution (SR)**. By enabling effective domain adaptation with just one unlabeled target image, it opens **new avenues for SR research** and has **practical implications for various applications** where obtaining large, labeled datasets is difficult or impossible.", "summary": "IODA achieves efficient one-shot domain adaptation for super-resolution using a novel instance-guided strategy and image-level domain alignment, significantly improving performance with limited target data.", "takeaways": ["IODA enables effective domain adaptation for super-resolution using only one unlabeled target image.", "The instance-guided distribution expansion strategy enhances the diversity of the limited target domain data.", "Image-guided domain adaptation offers higher granularity than text-based methods for SR tasks focusing on texture details."], "tldr": "Super-resolution (SR) models struggle with domain adaptation when limited target data is available. Existing methods often require numerous target images, hindering real-world applicability.  The lack of diversity in a single target image further limits adaptation effectiveness, causing problems like pattern collapse during training.\nIODA addresses these issues by introducing two novel techniques. First, **an image-guided domain adaptation method** uses pixel-level representations to capture fine-grained texture details, improving the guidance for SR networks. Second, **an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy** leverages Alpha-CLIP to generate instance-specific features from a single target image, expanding the feature space and improving adaptation. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate IODA's significant performance improvement in one-shot domain adaptation scenarios.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "qbvt3ocQxB/podcast.wav"}
