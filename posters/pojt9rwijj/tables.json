It highlights whether each method successfully reconstructs opaque objects, transparent objects, or both, and whether it accounts for refraction and/or reflection.  Notes clarify specific assumptions made by certain methods.", "section": "2 Related Works"}, {"figure_path": "Pojt9RWIjJ/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative evaluation (\u00d710\u22123) on the synthetic dataset. \"g2d\" is the Chamfer distance from the ground truth mesh to the reconstructed mesh, and \"d2g\" measures the reverse. \"CD\" denotes the average of \"g2d\" and \"d2g\". The best results are marked in bold.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of three different methods for 3D reconstruction on a synthetic dataset.  The methods compared are NeuS with an iso-value of 0, NeuS with an iso-value of 0.005, and the proposed \u03b1-NeuS method. The evaluation metric is the Chamfer distance, calculated in both directions (from ground truth to reconstruction and vice versa), and averaged to produce a single CD score. The results are presented for five different model types (Snowglobe, Case, Bottle, Jug, Jar) and as an overall mean. Lower CD values indicate better reconstruction accuracy.", "section": "4.2 Synthetic data"}]
