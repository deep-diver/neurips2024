NeuS is unbiased, i.e., the maximum volume rendering weight coincides with the object surface, for opaque surface [4]. We advance the theory of NeuS and prove that NeuS is unbiased for all transparent and opaque surfaces. Under various opacities, the unbiased surfaces are either the non-negative local minimum or the zero level set of the distance field learned by NeuS. Thus, we are able to extract the unbiased surface for transparent and opaque surface reconstruction simultaneously. However, precise values of these non-negative local minima are unknown beforehand and can vary spatially, they are unsuitable for extraction by conventional iso-surfacing algorithms, such as marching cubes [10], which require a specified fixed iso-value. To effectively extract the target geometry for transparent objects, we take the absolute value of the distance fields, making the unbiased surfaces become the local minima of the absolute distance field.

We use NeuS [4] as backbone for reconstruction, which learns a mixed SDF and UDF. However, during the projection stage of surface extraction, we use the absolute value of the distance field. The absolute distance field $f^{a}$ resembles UDF. While directly using UDF learning methods could avoid the distance field conversion process, we select NeuS rather than UDF learning methods because the the SDF learning method NeuS is simple, stable and robust, and is also capable of reconstructing details. We further compare with a UDF learning method NeUDF [21]. We notice that other UDF learning methods including NeuralUDF [22] and 2S-UDF [24] both take advantage of the opaque surface assumption, introducing an indicator function or ray truncation strategy respectively. This leaves NeUDF [21] the only method that is theoretically capable of rendering multiple layers of surfaces in a single ray.

However, our method is not designed to handle the cases with complex lighting conditions like heavy refraction or reflection. As shown in Figure 8, when using NeuS [4] as the backbone, scenes with reflection and refraction may yield ambiguous distance fields, preventing the acquisition of the ideal surface. For these situations, on the one hand, improving the lighting conditions to minimize the occurrence of refraction and reflection can be considered. In our experiments, we used polarizer to reduce reflection and model only thin transparent objects that have as little refraction as possible. Meanwhile, it is also possible to use existing reflection removal algorithms [42]. On the other hand, replacing the backbone with models like Ref-NeuS [28] or ReNeuS [8] (which focus on opaque object reconstruction but not the transparent object itself) could be considered.
