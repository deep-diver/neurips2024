These algorithms are typically designed for traditional Bayer sensors and are not directly applicable to quad-Bayer data, limiting their effectiveness in high-resolution video applications. \n\nMambaSCI, a novel algorithm using Mamba and UNet architectures, efficiently reconstructs quad-Bayer patterned SCI.  It introduces Residual-Mamba-Blocks, incorporating STMamba, EDR, and CA modules for handling long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, improving edge detail, and compensating for missing channel information.  The results show that MambaSCI significantly outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs. This is particularly important for resource-constrained mobile devices.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "U4WeoyRHPd/podcast.wav"}
