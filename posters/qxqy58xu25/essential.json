However, training these composites is challenging when the program part is a black-box (e.g., an API call or LLM). Existing methods either struggle with sample efficiency or require modifying the program for differentiability. \nThis paper introduces ISED, a novel algorithm tackling this problem. ISED uses reinforcement learning to estimate gradients using only input/output examples.  It's tested on various tasks, showing better performance and efficiency than baselines, especially in tasks using modern LLMs. The improved data efficiency addresses a significant bottleneck in the field.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "QXQY58xU25/podcast.wav"}
