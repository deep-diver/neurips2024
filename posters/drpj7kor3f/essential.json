{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses the significant computational burden of expanding Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to new modalities.  **PathWeave offers a novel, efficient incremental training strategy**, reducing the need for extensive pre-training and joint-modal tuning, thus making MLLM development more scalable and accessible to researchers with limited resources.  It opens avenues for continual learning in MLLMs, a crucial area for future research and development.", "summary": "PathWeave: A novel framework enabling Multimodal LLMs to continually evolve on modality, achieving comparable state-of-the-art performance with 98.73% less training burden!", "takeaways": ["PathWeave enables continuous evolution of MLLMs on modalities without joint-modal pre-training.", "The Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) framework facilitates efficient modality alignment and collaboration.", "PathWeave achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art MLLMs with significantly reduced training costs."], "tldr": "Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges in scalability due to their reliance on extensive modal-specific pre-training and joint-modal fine-tuning. Expanding these models to incorporate new modalities requires substantial computational resources, hindering research progress. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient and flexible training strategies for MLLMs. \nThis paper introduces PathWeave, a novel framework that tackles this scalability issue. **PathWeave leverages continual learning principles and a unique Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) architecture to enable incremental training of MLLMs**.  The AnA framework seamlessly integrates uni-modal and cross-modal adapters for efficient modality alignment and collaboration, reducing training burdens significantly. Experiments demonstrate that PathWeave achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art MLLMs while concurrently reducing the parameter training burden by 98.73%, thereby showcasing its efficiency and scalability.", "affiliation": "Dalian University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "drpJ7KOr3F/podcast.wav"}
