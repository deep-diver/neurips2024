Existing state-of-the-art ANNS algorithms often build large proximity graphs, leading to many unnecessary computations during search.  This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel framework. \nThe proposed framework, called Crossing Sparse Proximity Graphs (CSPG), divides the dataset into smaller partitions, creating a sparse proximity graph for each.  An efficient two-staged search strategy, combining fast approaching and cross-partition expansion, is designed to traverse these graphs effectively.  Theoretical analysis proves that CSPG reduces computations compared to traditional methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant speed improvements (1.5x to 2x) across various datasets and ANNS algorithms.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ohvXBIPV7e/podcast.wav"}
