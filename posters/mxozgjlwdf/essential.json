Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as adapters and LoRA, offer a solution by updating only a small subset of parameters. However, these methods often have limitations in flexibility and expressiveness. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing Structured Unrestricted-Rank Matrices (SURMs). SURMs leverage structured matrices, offering a balance between compactness and expressiveness, making them a drop-in replacement for existing PEFT methods.\nThe paper demonstrates SURMs' effectiveness across various tasks, including image classification and NLP.  In image classification, SURMs achieve significant accuracy improvements over baselines while using fewer parameters.  In NLP, SURMs show substantial parameter reduction in adapters with minimal performance loss.  The results suggest that SURMs offer a promising new paradigm for PEFT, potentially enabling researchers to fine-tune large models more efficiently and effectively.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "MXOzgjlWDF/podcast.wav"}
