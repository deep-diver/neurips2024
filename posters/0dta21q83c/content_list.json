This implies that the depth of a network acts as an implicit regularizer in the rank space of the attributes.

We use the Colored MNIST dataset Nam et al. (2020) (CMNIST), where digit identity (core attribute) is spuriously correlated with color (bias attribute). We experiment with the decodability of the digit identity and color attributes in the CMNIST dataset. Additional information on the computation of feature decodability can be found in Section 7.5. We regard digit identity to have a higher rank than that of color, due to its higher representational complexity / information content in terms of the number of bits required for storage, a notion also confirmed in the experiements of Hermann and Lampinen (2020). We start by looking at the decodabilities at random initialization of the networks, and interestingly observe in Figure 2a that the decodabilities of both attributes decrease with increasing depth, but that of digit identity drops faster than color.

Hence, the difference in decodability between color and digit attributes becomes more pronounced in the 5-layer compared to the 3-layer MLP.

We ignore the second stage of training since our focus was primarily on the segregation of bias and core attributes. An interesting observation is the significant standard deviation in accuracies when the branches have the same depth, observed in both datasets. This phenomenon occurs because in such a configuration, DeNetDM loses its ability to clearly distinguish between branches. This is due to the similarity in feature decodability of bias and core attributes across both branches, as discussed in Section 3.2. As a result, DeNetDM may distribute information across multiple branches or still separate core and bias attributes, but the specific branch capturing core attributes varies with different initialization. In contrast, when depths are unequal, the deeper branch tends to focus on aligned points, disregarding conflicting ones, as seen in the test accuracies provided in Table 5. Additionally, the shallow branch emphasizes capturing core attributes, consistently enhancing conflicting accuracy.
