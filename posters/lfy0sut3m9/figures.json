The algorithms compared are two variants of the proposed Shuffling Gradient Method (SGM), standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Prox-Linear. The y-axis represents the objective value, and the x-axis shows the number of epochs.  The figure visually demonstrates the relative performance of each algorithm in minimizing the objective function for the model selection problem in binary classification with nonnegative nonconvex losses, as described in the paper.", "section": "5 Numerical Experiments"}]
