Existing methods often struggle with efficiency and theoretical guarantees in these complex scenarios, particularly when stochasticity or large datasets are involved.  The lack of efficient and theoretically sound algorithms hinders progress in various applications like GANs and reinforcement learning. \nThis paper addresses these challenges by proposing novel shuffling gradient-based methods. Two algorithms are developed: one for nonconvex-linear minimax problems and another for nonconvex-strongly concave settings. Both algorithms use shuffling strategies to construct unbiased estimators for gradients, resulting in improved performance and theoretical guarantees.  The paper rigorously proves the state-of-the-art oracle complexity of these methods and demonstrates their effectiveness through numerical examples, showing they achieve comparable performance to existing methods.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "lfY0SUT3m9/podcast.wav"}
