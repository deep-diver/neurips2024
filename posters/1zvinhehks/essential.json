Existing methods, like those employing graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs), often suffer from high computational costs, manual feature engineering (kernels), or information loss from global pooling (GNNs).  These limitations hinder scalability and accuracy, particularly with large graph datasets. \nThis paper introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), a novel and efficient graph classification method. GRDL addresses the limitations of existing approaches by directly classifying node embeddings as distributions, bypassing the need for global pooling operations and thus retaining valuable structural information.  **The method leverages maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)** to compare graph distributions with learned reference distributions, leading to high accuracy. Importantly, the paper provides a theoretical analysis of GRDL, deriving generalization error bounds and demonstrating its superior generalization ability compared to GNNs with global pooling. Experimental results showcase GRDL's exceptional efficiency, achieving at least a 10-fold speed improvement over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high accuracy.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "1zVinhehks/podcast.wav"}
