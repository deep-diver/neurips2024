These issues stem from the trackers learning conflicting scene-specific parameters, requiring costly fine-tuning for new domains.  Existing methods often struggle to balance model complexity, computational cost, and generalization ability.\nThe proposed Parameter-efficient Scenario-specific Tracking Architecture (PASTA) tackles these issues by employing a modular design that uses Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for each scenario attribute (e.g., lighting, viewpoint). This method allows the tracker to generalize to new domains without increasing inference time or requiring extensive fine-tuning.  Experiments on various benchmarks showed PASTA's superior performance over monolithic trackers, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving both efficiency and accuracy.", "affiliation": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "aujnNnIiiM/podcast.wav"}
