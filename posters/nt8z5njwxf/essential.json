However, it still suffers from higher uncertainties compared to multi-view setups due to fewer cameras. Existing methods often rely on explicit pose priors or complex network architectures, or tackle uncertainty issues using limited statistical models. These approaches either lack flexibility or efficiency. \nThis paper introduces Dual-Diffusion, a novel method specifically designed for binocular 3D HPE that addresses these challenges. It leverages a diffusion model to simultaneously denoise initial 2D and 3D pose uncertainties by using geometric mapping to connect the two domains.  It also introduces Z-embedding and baseline-width-related pose normalization to improve the flexibility of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual-Diffusion achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "NT8Z5NjwxF/podcast.wav"}
