It starts by sampling an initial response from the language model.  Then, it iteratively samples an index from the current translation, generates a new continuation from the language model, and uses the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion to decide whether to accept or reject the new translation.  This process continues for a fixed number of iterations, and the accepted translations are returned.  Hyperparameters control temperature, burn-in period, and the Gibbs distribution.", "section": "3 An MCMC-based Decoding Approach for Text Generation"}]
