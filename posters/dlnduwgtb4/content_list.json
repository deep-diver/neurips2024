However, relying on a single translation with high estimated quality increases the chances of \u201cgaming the metric\u201d. In this paper, we address the problem of sampling a set of high-quality and diverse translations. We provide a simple and effective way to avoid over-reliance on noisy quality estimates by using them as the energy function of a Gibbs distribution. Instead of looking for a mode in the distribution, we generate multiple samples from high-density areas through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo approach.

Secondly, their effectiveness is limited by the quality of the initial candidate set.

We address this challenge by proposing a simple and effective Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (MCMC) method, combining the MetropolisHastings algorithm with a suitable proposal distribution. Our method, Quality-Aware MetropolisHastings (QUEST) Sampling, uses a novel proposal distribution that is compatible with sentencelevel evaluation metrics, common in text generation tasks like MT (Figure 1).

Several methods have been proposed to sample approximately from Gibbs distributions in text generation using autoregressive and masked-language models. Prior works (Miao et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020) use MH with a proposal distribution that makes token-level modifications for constrained generation tasks. Since masked language models (MLM) do not have a straightforward mechanism for sampling text, MCMC has been widely explored using variations of Gibbs sampling (Berglund et al., 2015; Su et al., 2018; Wang and Cho, 2019; Yamakoshi et al., 2022). However, Goyal et al. (2022) shows that the masked conditional distributions from MLMs result in invalid Gibbs samplers and, therefore, proposes to use MH on the masked conditionals, resulting in higher-quality text. Mireshghallah et al. (2022); Forristal et al. (2023) build on this work and use MLMs for sampling from Gibbs distributions. Some works (Kumar et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2022; Amini et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023) also adapt the Hamiltonian MCMC algorithms originally designed for high-dimensional continuous distributions for the discrete scenario (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 2011). Furthermore, Hu et al. (2024) apply GFlowNets (Bengio et al., 2021) to fine-tune language models for solving posterior inference problems, which can be considered as sampling in proportion to an intractable Gibbs distribution.

However, the increased computation cost with the model size and beam width makes it infeasible and impractical to use with LLMs and it fails to yield consistent improvement over ancestral with an increase in beam width (Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019; Eikema and Aziz, 2020; Pang et al., 2024). Quality-aware decoding approaches on the other hand are almost always used to generate a single best hypothesis. Concurrently, Jinnai et al.

However, their approach only allows for the selection of hypotheses from a predefined set.

Furthermore, our proposal distribution only modifies the sentence suffix, which becomes restrictive once the chain reaches a high-quality region.

We believe these risks will be mitigated as better metrics are constantly being developed\u2014our method, being agnostic to the specific quality metric, will directly benefti from it.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
