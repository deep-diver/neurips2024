The SDR measures the semantic completeness; a lower SDR indicates better preservation of important image content. The comparison is conducted across four different aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 1:1, and 9:16), demonstrating the methods' performance consistency across varying aspect ratios.

Twenty volunteers scored the results of each method across four criteria: content completeness, deformation, local smoothness, and aesthetics. Each criterion was scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance.  The average score across all four criteria is also provided for each method.

The study focuses on the 16:9 aspect ratio.  It compares the Saliency Discard Ratio (SDR) for three different configurations: Seam-carving alone, Seam-carving with the addition of the Content-Aware Seam-carving module (+CSC), and finally Seam-carving with both the Content-Aware Seam-carving and the Adaptive Repainting modules (+CSC+AR).
