The first stage involves filtering, feature extraction (using dynamical metrics like irrationality measure and convergence rate), and clustering PCFs with similar metric values. The second stage focuses on labeling clusters by identifying known formulas (anchors) within them and validating the association of other formulas in the cluster to the same constant.  If no anchors are found, further investigation using PSLQ is employed to attempt labeling or identifying inner-cluster connections.

Analysing the convergence of polynomial continued fraction (PCF) formulas provide dynamical metrics that prove useful for their automated clustering and identification. (a) Irrationality measure \u03b4 vs. PCF depth, for two example formulas of the constants cot(1) and the Silver Ratio. The \u03b4 of these constants is known to be 1 (green dashed lines). The blue dots show the numerical convergence of \u03b4 (Eq.3) to the correct value. The red dots show the evaluated \u03b4-Predictor formula (Eq.5), following the numerical \u03b4 very closely in the Silver Ratio formula, while taking a completely different (and much slower) trajectory in the cot(1) formula; yet both converge to the correct value \u03b4 = 1. For the purposes of clustering, \u03b4predicted was evaluated at n = 109, providing an accurate estimation for \u03b4. (b) \u03b4n (n = 1000) vs. the limit value for PCFs in our dataset. While \u03b4 values seem to follow a pattern, the limit value distribution does not contain relevant information (the higher density of PCFs near the Y axis arises from the small coefficients of the polynomials in our dataset). Our dataset contains 913,056 irrationality-proving formulas, most of which are not yet linked to any known constant.

A few of the clusters have been identified, but the reason for the appearance of these \u201cbands\u201d and the properties of most clusters remain as open questions.
