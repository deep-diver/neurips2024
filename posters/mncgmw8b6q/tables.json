Numerous data points in this cluster exhibit identical sequence dynamics and are equivalent under the inflation and index indentation transformations. The equivalent data points create families of continued fractions in the cluster. Discrepancies between the calculated irrationality measure within the same family is ascribed to numerical inaccuracies, typically on the order 0.001. However, when comparing families, discrepancies in the irrationality measure rise to a magnitude of 0.04, suggesting potential deeper distinctions among these PCFs.", "description": "This table shows examples of continued fractions converging to linear fractional transformations of the golden ratio (\u03c6).
