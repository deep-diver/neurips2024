However, the large number of Gaussians and their attributes demand efficient compression techniques. Existing methods often compress these individually, overlooking spatial dependencies.  This leads to significant storage overhead and limits the scalability of 3DGS for large-scale scenes.\n\nThis paper proposes ContextGS, which uses an autoregressive model at the anchor level to tackle the spatial redundancy issue.  Anchors are hierarchically divided into levels; coarser levels predict finer ones, leading to more efficient coding.  The method also incorporates a hyperprior for effective compression of coarsest level anchors.  ContextGS demonstrates remarkable compression ratios (up to 15x), faster rendering speeds, and improved rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.
