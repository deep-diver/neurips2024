Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over 100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher rendering quality.

As a representative work, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [22] uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict the attributes of quired points in the 3D scene. While good rendering qualities are achieved, the dense querying process results in slow rendering, which greatly hinders their applications in practical scenarios. Significant efforts have been made to enhance training and rendering speeds, achieving notable progress through various techniques, such as factorization [4, 8, 10, 13] and hash grids [24, 12]. However, they still face challenges in the real-time rendering of large-scale scenes due to the intrinsic limitations of volumetric sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [15] has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) rendering quality and speed. As an emerging alternative strategy for representing 3D scenes, 3DGS represents a 3D scene using a set of 3D Gaussians initiated from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with learnable attributes such as color, shape, and opacity. The 2D images can be effectively rendered using differentiable rasterization and end-to-end training is enabled.

Representing large scenes requires millions of 3D Gaussian points, which demand several GBs of storage, e.g., an average of 1.6 GB for each scene in the BungeeNerf [32] dataset. The huge storage overhead greatly hinders the applications of 3DGS [15], thus an efficient compression technique is required. However, the unorganized and sparse nature of these 3D Gaussians makes it highly challenging to effectively reduce data redundancy. To address this issue, various techniques have been proposed to enhance the storage efficiency of 3D Gaussian models. For example, [7, 18, 25, 26] proposed to discretize continuous attributes of 3D Gaussians to a cluster of attributes stored in the codebooks; [7, 18] proposed to prune neural Gaussians with little effect. Entropy coding is also used to reduce the storage overhead by further encoding neural Gaussian features into bitstream [11, 5, 18, 23]. Although space utilization has greatly improved, they focus more on individually compressing each Gaussian point and do not well explore the relationship and reduce the spatial redundancy among neural Gaussians. To further reduce the spatial redundancy, most recently, [20] proposed to divide anchors into voxels and introduced an anchor feature for each voxel to grasp the common attributes of neural Gaussians in the voxel, i.e., the neural Gaussians are predicted by the anchor features. While the spatial dependency has been significantly reduced, as shown in Fig. 1 (c), the similarity among anchors remains high in certain areas, indicating that spatial redundancy still exists.

Inspired by the effectiveness of context models [31] in image compression [21], we introduce an autoregressive model at the anchor level into 3DGS. Specifically, building on Scaffold-GS [20], we divide anchors into hierarchical levels and encode them progressively. Coarser level anchors are encoded first, and their decoded values are used to predict the distribution of nearby anchors at finer levels. This approach leverages spatial dependencies among adjacent anchors, allowing already decoded anchors to better predict the distribution of subsequent anchors, leading to significant improvements in coding efficiency. Additionally, anchors decoded at coarser levels can be directly used in the final fine-grained level, reducing storage overhead. To further enhance coding efficiency, especially for encoding the coarsest level anchors without already decoded ones, we employ a quantized hyperprior feature as an additional prior for each anchor. It is worth noting that the proposed method can also support vanilla 3DGS renderers by simply removing the view-dependent features from the anchor feature.

However, the dense querying process results in extremely slow rendering. Various methods have been developed to speed up the rendering process significantly [6, 9, 27], such as plane factorization-based techniques like K-Planes [8] and TensoRF [4], and the use of hash grid features in InstantNGP [24]. While these methods enable high-quality rendering with a much smaller MLP compared to the vanilla NeRF, rendering a single pixel still requires numerous queries. This can lead to increased storage requirements for the grid-based features and difficulties in efficiently rendering empty space or large-scale scenes. To achieve real-time and efficient rendering while maintaining high fidelity, 3DGS [15] introduces an innovative approach by representing the scene explicitly with numerous learnable 3D Gaussians.

However, [5] codes all the anchors at the same time, and its spatial redundancy can be further reduced. In the image compression task, an important category of methods to improve the coding efficiency is the context model [21, 31], which greatly reduces the spatial redundancy by predicting the distribution of latent pixels based on an already coded one.

A main difference between the proposed method and existing works for Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques [28] is that the proposed method can reuse the anchors of different levels, i.e., anchor forward in Fig. 2 (b). For example, the anchors from different levels in [28] are stored separately. In contrast, the anchors from coarser levels are used in the final level (level 0) in our method, i.e., in an autoregressive manner. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method that reuses the anchors in coarser levels, we do an ablation study in Table 3. As shown in the table, the model w/o reusing anchors of coarser levels to the finest level leads to serious redundancy, even slightly worse than the model w/o dividing anchors into different levels.

One can utilize the hyperprior feature ${\\bf z}$ to predict the distribution of anchor positions and the anchor position can thereby be compressed using entropy coding. However, we find that the precision of the anchor position is essential to the performance of the model and an adaptive quantization strategy leads to serious performance degradation. While a fixed quantization width is feasible and can retain the fidelity performance while effectively compressing the size of anchors, it leads to a greatly increased number of symbols that greatly decreases the coding speed.

The rendering speed after decompression is the same as or even faster than Scaffold-GS [20] when the number of anchors is the same since we use the same data structure. However, as shown in Table 4, we can achieve higher rendering quality with fewer anchors due to the use of masking loss [18] therefore achieving faster rendering speed. For the decoding time, while the proposed method involves autoregressive coding, which is usually very slow in image compression tasks [21] due to its serial characteristics, it adds neglectable overhead to our method in both training and decompression compared to other entropy-coding-based 3DGS compression methods, such as HAC [5]. This is because, unlike autoregressive coding in image compression that predicts pixels/latent features one by one, introducing a loop of at least thousands of operations, we perform autoregressive coding group by group, introducing only a loop of 3 iterations.

Besides, we demonstrate that utilizing the proposed anchor forward technique, i.e., directly reusing the anchors from coarse levels to the final level, can achieve better performance than just using anchors of coarse levels as a prior.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
