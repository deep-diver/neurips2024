Existing methods like the JOINT mechanism, while accurate, suffer from high computational costs, particularly when dealing with large datasets.  This is problematic as many real-world applications (e.g., search engines, recommendation systems) require processing enormous amounts of data.\nThis research proposes a novel algorithm that dramatically improves the efficiency of differentially private top-k selection.  By using a joint exponential mechanism combined with a pruning technique, the algorithm achieves a significantly reduced time and space complexity of O(d + k\u00b2/\u025blnd), where d is the number of items and k is the number to select.  The method is shown to be orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy, making differentially private top-k selection more practical for large-scale applications.", "affiliation": "University of Waterloo", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "QyxE3W9Yni/podcast.wav"}
