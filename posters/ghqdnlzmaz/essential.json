Existing methods for explaining model decisions often result in complex and unintuitive explanations. The concept of global sparsity, focusing on the overall model complexity, is not always relevant for individuals affected by model decisions. Local sparsity, also known as decision sparsity, matters more, but it is challenging to quantify and optimize. This paper tackles this problem by extending the Sparse Explanation Value (SEV) framework.\nThis work introduces cluster-based SEV and tree-based SEV, which improve explanation closeness and credibility.  A new method to improve the credibility of explanations is also presented, along with algorithms to optimize decision sparsity during model training.  The findings demonstrate that the proposed SEV variants achieve better sparsity, closeness, and credibility compared to existing counterfactual explanation techniques, making AI models more understandable and trustworthy.", "affiliation": "Duke University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "GhqdnLZMAz/podcast.wav"}
