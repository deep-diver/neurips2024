Existing methods like the Winsorized Mean Estimator (WME) suffer from bias and sensitivity issues under such conditions.  They often rely on clipping, which introduces bias in heavy-tailed scenarios, and struggle with imbalanced datasets that lead to larger sensitivity and thus increased estimation error.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach using Huber loss minimization to overcome these limitations. Huber loss adapts to the data distribution, reducing bias without relying on clipping. The adaptive weighting scheme addresses the issues caused by sample size imbalances among users.  This method demonstrates significantly improved accuracy and robustness in experiments compared to existing methods, especially for challenging datasets.  Theoretical analysis provides guarantees on privacy and error bounds.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "TutGINeJzZ/podcast.wav"}
