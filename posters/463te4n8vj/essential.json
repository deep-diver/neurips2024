Many current methods predict depth pixel by pixel without considering relationships between nearby pixels, leading to inaccuracies and inefficient processing.  This also ignores the holistic scene context that impacts depth predictions.\n\nDCDepth tackles this by working in the frequency domain, utilizing the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).  This separates depth information into different frequency components that relate to global structure (low frequency) and fine details (high frequency).  A progressive prediction approach is used, starting with low-frequency components to establish scene context and then iteratively adding higher-frequency details.  **This progressive, frequency-domain approach improves estimation accuracy and efficiency.** The method also includes a DCT-inspired downsampling technique to improve information fusion across different scales.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple standard datasets.**", "affiliation": "Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "463TE4N8VJ/podcast.wav"}
