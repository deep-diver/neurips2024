Existing invariant learning methods, like Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx), often fail to identify true predictive patterns in node-level graph tasks, instead relying on spurious features. This limitation stems from their lack of class-conditional invariance constraints which leads to inaccurate structural understanding of predictive ego-graphs.\nTo overcome these issues, the researchers introduce Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA) and its label-free variant CIA-LRA.  CIA explicitly aligns cross-environment representations within the same class, effectively removing spurious features.  CIA-LRA adapts this approach to scenarios without environment labels by cleverly leveraging the distribution of neighboring labels. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation on multiple benchmarks confirm CIA and CIA-LRA's effectiveness and advancement in node-level OOD generalization.
