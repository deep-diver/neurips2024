Geometric deep learning is generally concerned with hand-crafting architectures that are equivariant to (i.e. that commute with) known transformations acting on the data [1\u20134, 6\u201317]. To this end, many successful architectures exploit group representations by using established mappings, such as the Fourier or spherical harmonic transforms, to map features onto domains where the group actions manifest equivalently as linear transformations [1\u20133, 7]. In most cases, the representations considered are finite-dimensional and irreducible which, loosely speaking, means that the group action in observation space can be expressed exactly by frequency-preserving block-diagonal matrices acting on the transform coefficients. While finite-dimensional irreducible representations $(\\mathbf{IRs})$ are attractive building blocks for equivariance due to their computationally exploitable structure, they often don\u2019t exist for non-compact groups, precluding generalizations to most non-linear symmetries, let alone those ill-modeled by groups.

Essential to our approach is the parameterization of transformations between observations in the latent space not as group representations, but instead as functional maps. Introduced in the seminal work of Ovsjanikov et al.

Beyond 3D shapes, FMs can be seen as a tool to parameterize transformations between observations viewed as functions, in the sense that images, for instance, are functions that map 2D pixel coordinates to RGB colors. Integral to their study and implementation is the Laplace-Beltrami operator (the generalization of the Laplace operator to function spaces on manifolds), and in particular the expression of FMs in its eigenbasis which can expose specific geometric properties of deformations. In particular, isometries (distance-preserving transformations) manifest as highly-structured matrices not unlike IRs, being orthogonal and commuting with the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and are thus approximately block-diagonal. That said, FMs are recovered through regularized linear solves and as such lack the consistency inherent in the analytical expressions of IRs for compact groups. However, freed from nagging theoretical constraints, FMs have displayed remarkable representational capacity, well modeling a variety of highly-complex non-rigid deformations [24] including those without group structure, such as partial [25] and inter-genus correspondence [26].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
