Existing geometric deep learning methods often require handcrafted architectures tailored to specific symmetries, limiting their generalizability.  This paper aims to overcome these limitations by learning a latent space where these complex symmetries are simplified into tractable isometric maps.\nThe proposed framework, Neural Isometries, uses an autoencoder to map observations to a latent space.  A key contribution is regularizing the latent space to preserve inner products and commute with learned operators, ensuring that geometrically related observations have isometrically related encodings in the latent space. This allows for simple equivariant networks to be used effectively in the latent space, achieving comparable results to complex handcrafted methods. Experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness on various tasks including image classification with unknown homographies and robust camera pose estimation directly from latent space maps.", "affiliation": "PlayStation", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "kCabCEhQWv/podcast.wav"}
