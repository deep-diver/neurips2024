Chain-of-Thought $(C o T)$ prompting, 21, provides in-context math questions together with solutions which include detailed reasoning chains. Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), 24, instruct the model to produce a code-based solution to the given problem by providing in-context examples that also contain code-based solutions. Ensemble methods, based on CoT and PAL [35, 47], incorporate self-consistency, where the most frequent answer is chosen [35], and progressive-hint-prompting, which utilizes a feedback-based strategy for refining responses [47]. Notably, all these methodologies employ a fixed set of in-context examples. A strategy for selecting in-context examples was introduced in ComplexCoT [36], which prefers in-context examples of higher complexity, i.e., length of the reasoning chains. Our approach proposed also provides dynamically selected in-context examples sourced from the Skill Exemplar Repository. In our case, examples are selected based on relevance rather than complexity. The proposed approach can seamlessly integrate with any of the above prompting methods.
