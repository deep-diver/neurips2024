First, we show that by leveraging any verified subproblems (e.g., a subproblem is verified when neurons A and B are both split to active cases), we can deduce cuts that preclude certain combinations of ReLU states (e.g., neurons A and B cannot be both active). This cut may tighten the bounds for subproblems in other parts of the search tree, even when neurons A and B have not been split yet. Second, to make these cuts effective during the regular BaB process, we show that they can be strengthened by reducing the number of branched neurons in a verified subproblem (e.g., we may conclude that setting neuron B to active is sufficient to verify the problem, drop the dependency on A, and remove one variable from the cut).

Similarly, a positive $\\tau>0$ for some $z\\in\\mathcal{Z}^{-(i)}$ signifies that the fixed inactive neurons are influential in optimizing the bound. However, neurons with zero dual variables $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=0$ or $\\tau=0$ ) may not contribute to the current bound optimization. This observation suggests that these neurons might be candidates for removal to simplify the cut. But it\u2019s important to note that a zero dual variable does not guarantee that the corresponding neuron has no impact under all circumstances\u2014it only indicates no contribution in the current optimization context. Simply removing all neurons with zero dual variables might overlook their potential influence in other parts of the search space or under different parameter settings. Therefore, the challenge lies in deciding which neurons with zero or negligible dual variables can be safely removed without significantly weakening the cut. This decision requires a careful heuristic that considers not only the current values of the dual variables but also the overall structure of the problem and the potential future impact of these neurons. By intelligently selecting which $z$ variables to exclude, we aim to produce a stronger cut that is both effective in pruning the search space and efficient in computing. To do this, we use a heuristic to determine whether each neuron should be tentatively dropped from the list of constraints. Algorithm 1 shows the constraint strengthening with the neuron elimination heuristic. ", "page_idx": 5}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Neuron Elimination Heuristic for Constraint Strengthening First, we compute a heuristic influence score for each neuron to assess its impact on the verification objective. This score is based on the improvement in the lower bound of $f^{\\star}$ before and after introducing the neuron\u2019s split in the BaB tree. By recording the computed lower bounds at each node, we can measure how beneficial each constraint is to the verification process. Second, we rank the neurons according to their influence scores and tentatively drop those that contribute least to improving the lower bound. We will retain neurons whose corresponding Lagrange multipliers, $\\mu$ or $\\tau$ , are greater than zero. For neurons with $\\mu$ or $\\tau$ equal to zero, we remove a certain percentile of neurons with the lowest scores, as indicated by the \u201cdrop_percentage\u201d parameter in Algorithm 1. When a neuron is dropped, its split is canceled. Then, we perform a re-verification step using only the reduced subset of constraints. This involves recomputing the lower bound on $f^{\\star}$ based solely on the selected constraints. If the verification still succeeds\u2014that is, the lower bound remains non-negative\u2014the reduced set induces a new cutting plane. This new cutting plane is applied to all subproblems within the BaB process after further strengthening. The sentence looks wrong. Do we add them right now? Or after further strenghthenining? Finally, we can iteratively repeat the process of reducing the constraint set, aiming to generate even stronger cuts. The process terminates when the property can no longer be verified with the current subset of constraints. This iterative refinement is designed to focus on the most influential neurons, potentially enhancing the efficiency of the verification. Once the new cuts determined, we merge pairs of cuts if possible (e.g. merging $z_{1}+z_{2}\\ge0$ and $z_{1}-z_{2}\\ge0$ to $z_{1}\\geq0$ ).

While this initially increases the number of subproblems, the cutting planes generated in one tree are universally valid and can be applied to all other trees.

These procedures may discover confilcts in boolean variable assignments, corresponding to eliminating certain subproblems in BaB. However, they differ from BICCOS in two significant aspects: first, although DPLL or CDCL may discover constraints to prevent some branches with neurons involved in these constraints, they cannot efficiently use these constraints as cutting planes that may tighten the bounds for subproblems never involving these neurons; second, DPLL or CDCL works on the abstract problem where each ReLU is represented as a boolean variable, and cannot take full advantage of the underlying bound propagation solver to strengthen constraints as we did in Alg. 1.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
