For instance, adding certain bias vectors to the outputs of certain attention heads is reported to boost the truthfulness of models. In this work, we show that localized fine-tuning serves as an effective alternative to such representation intervention methods. We introduce a framework called Localized Fine-Tuning on LLM Representations (LOFIT), which identifies a subset of attention heads that are most important for learning a specific task, then trains offset vectors to add to the model\u2019s hidden representations at those selected heads. LOFIT localizes to a sparse set of heads $\\!\\!\\left(3\\%-10\\%\\right)$ and learns the offset vectors from limited training data, comparable to the settings used for representation intervention. For truthfulness and reasoning tasks, we find that LOFIT\u2019s intervention vectors are more effective for LLM adaptation than vectors from representation intervention methods such as Inference-time Intervention. We also find that the localization step is important: selecting a taskspecific set of attention heads can lead to higher performance than intervening on heads selected for a different task.

Moreover, mechanistic interpretability methods, especially causal intervention, have revealed that such semantics can be attributed to specific attention heads [23, 21, 28], MLP layers [40, 30], neurons [49], or subnetworks [1]. Inspired by these findings, a line of work has explored intervening on pre-trained language models by manipulating and editing hidden representations at some specific locations in transformers with lightweight or no tuning to perform specific tasks or for controllable generation, including alignment [60], style transfer [43, 47], reasoning [12], truthfulness [21], and knowledge editing [30].

Concurrent to our work, ReFT [54] proposes to integrate interventions on representations into PEFT as a strong alternative fine-tuning method.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
