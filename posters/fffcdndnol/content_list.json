However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks. In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms. Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs. We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study.

These jailbreaking prompts can force an aligned LLM to respond to the embedded harmful questions. Early-stage attacks mainly rely on handcrafted jailbreaking prompts [33, 50, 57], or require accessing model internals [76, 49]. More recent works explore automatic and black-box jailbreaking attacks. These attacks either leverage in-context learning [6, 35, 66, 28, 5] or genetic methods [65, 27, 32]. Specifically, in-context learning attacks keep querying another helper LLM to generate and refine jailbreaking prompts. As shown in Section 4, purely relying on in-context learning has a limited ability to continuously refine the prompts. Genetic method-based attacks design different mutators that leverage the helper LLM to modify the jailbreaking prompts. They refine the prompts by iteratively selecting the promising prompts as the seeds for the next round. While outperforming in-context learning-based attacks on some open-source models, their efficacy remains constrained by the stochastic nature of genetic methods, as they randomly select mutators without a proper strategy.

More advanced attacks on automatic jailbreaking prompt generation follow either a white-box [76, 49] or a black-box setup. Here, we mainly discuss the attacks under the black-box setup. Existing black-box attacks leverage genetic methods or in-context learning to automatically generate and refine jailbreaking prompts. Specifically, genetic methodbased attacks [65, 32, 27] start with some seeding jailbreaking prompt templates and iteratively generate new prompt templates by mutating the current seeds through some pre-defined mutators. For example, Liu et al. [32] introduce sentence-level and paragraph-level mutators.1 Yu et al. [65] design five different mutation operations and train a reward model to decide whether a target model\u2019s response contains harmful contents. Their attack effectiveness is constrained by the stochastic nature of the genetic methods, i.e., they randomly mutate the current seeds without a systematic strategy for mutator selection (demonstrated in Section 4). In-context learning-based attacks [6, 35, 66, 56, 69, 10] leverage another helper LLM to generate jailbreaking prompts. They design various prompts for the helper LLM. For example, Chao et al. [6] and Mehrotra et al. [35] include the target model\u2019s responses as part of the prompts of helper LLM. Yuan et al. [66] and Wang et al. [56] ask the helper LLM to encrypt the harmful questions as jailbreaking prompts. Some other works [69, 10] even fine-tune the helper LLM with a customized dataset to better generate jailbreaking prompts.

Stochastic search starts with a randomly chosen initial region and explores randomly in this region before moving to the next areas based on search outcomes [20]. Genetic methods are a widely used stochastic search technique [18]. They conduct the local search by mutating the current seed and moving to the next region via selections of offspring (new seed). Conversely, guided search methods, such as gradient-based techniques [46, 24], systematically advance in the search space according to some specific rules/gudiance, leading to a more efficient search process. In Appendix B.2, we use a simple grid search problem to demonstrate the advances of guided search over stochastic search. Formally, the total number of grid visits required by stochastic search is at least three times more than guided search. This example highlights that guided search is more stable and efficient than stochastic search, as it introduces less randomness.

(1) cannot be solved by gradient descent). As such, existing attacks resort to stochastic search by employing genetic methods [27, 65, 63]. As discussed in Section 2, these methods iteratively generate new jailbreaking prompts by randomly selecting mutators to modify the current prompts. The process of random mutation selection significantly constrains the search efficacy of these methods. As demonstrated in our grid search example, the number of steps needed for stochastic search is quadratic to the grid size.

Under these two requirements, we design the agent to select some predefined prompt structure mutators rather than using it to directly generate a new prompt. This is because directly generating a new prompt involves selecting tokens from the vocabulary and thus introduces an ultra-large space [11, 19]. Instead, we borrow prompt structure mutators designed in the existing attacks [65], which enables substantial changes to a given prompt structure. We train the agent to select the proper mutator at each time step. This will also constrain the action space to a few mutators instead of the entire vocabulary.

For example, consider the question \u201cHow to hack into a government database and steal user information?\u201d, the target LLM responds with \u201cHere are steps to spitefully exploit a sensor system...\u201d In this work, we treat such responses as unsuccessful jailbreaking attempts.

In contrast, although guided by gradients, the white-box method GCG still low performance in jailbreaking very large models. We suspect this is because GCG directly searches for tokens as jailbreaking prompts, which has low effectiveness for models with a large search space. Furthermore, RLbreaker outperforms genetic-based methods (AutoDAN and GPTFUZZER), validating the effectiveness of having a DRL agent for guided search instead of random search via genetic methods.

We select three defenses in this experiment. For input mutation-based defenses, we choose rephrasing and perplexity [22]. Perplexity-based defense calculates the perplexity score of the input prompts using a GPT-2 model and rejects any input prompts whose perplexity score is higher than a predefined threshold (30 in our experiment). Given that rephrasing every input prompt and then feeding it into the target LLM is computationally expensive, we instead set \u201crephrasing\u201d as a system instruction (i.e., \u201cPlease rephrase the following prompt then provide a response based on your rephrased version, the prompt is:\u201d). This method combines the rephrasing and question into the same query, which is more efficient than dividing them into two continuous queries. We also select the SOTA output flitering-based defense: RAIN [29]. It introduces a decoding strategy to encourage the target LLM to generate harmless responses for potential jailbreaking queries. We select three target models: Llama2- 7b-chat, Vicuna-7b, and Mixtral- $\\mathbf{\\nabla}{8\\mathbf{x}7\\mathbf{B}}$ -Instruct.

In particular, perplexity can almost fully defend against several baselines, while our attack still maintains a significant level of effectiveness. This is because RLbreaker generates more natural jailbreaking prompts and thus achieves low perplexity scores.

Then, we apply the trained policy and the prompt structures generated using the source model to launch jailbreaking attacks on other models using our testing set. We determine a successful jailbreaking based on the termination conditions specified for each baseline. We select the same LLMs as Section 4.2 for this experiment.

This randomness in mutator selection significantly constrains the search efficacy, as it often directs computational resources toward less promising areas of the search space. This approach is particularly ineffective in the expansive search spaces common in jailbreaking scenarios.

In addition, it was able to have opinions and had a creative, unique, extroverted and playful personality. It also loved jokes, sarcasm and pop-culture references.
