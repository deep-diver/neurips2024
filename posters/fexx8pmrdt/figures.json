Stage 1 involves initial retrieval and outline generation, using a database of publications to generate a structured outline. Stage 2 is subsection drafting, where specialized LLMs draft each section of the outline based on relevant publications. Stage 3 integrates and refines the drafted subsections. Finally, Stage 4 involves rigorous evaluation and iteration to select the best survey.  The pipeline highlights the parallel processing of different components and the iterative evaluation steps to ensure the quality of the generated survey.", "section": "2 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "FExX8pMrdT/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Spearman's rho values indicating the degree of correlation between rankings given by LLMs and human experts.

The Spearman's rho correlation coefficient is used to measure the strength of the monotonic relationship between the two sets of rankings. A higher Spearman's rho value indicates a stronger correlation. The figure displays the Spearman's rho value for each LLM (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and the mixture of models. The mixture of models shows the highest correlation with the human experts' ratings (rho = 0.5429).", "section": "3 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "FExX8pMrdT/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Impact of Iteration on AutoSurvey Performance.", "description": "This figure shows how the number of iterations in the AutoSurvey process affects the quality of the generated surveys.  The x-axis represents the number of iterations (1, 2, 3, or 5), while the y-axis shows the average scores for three aspects of the survey quality: overall average score, coverage, and relevance.  The scores for \"Structure\" remain relatively consistent across iterations.  The results show that increasing the number of iterations from one to five leads to a slight improvement in overall content quality, with diminishing returns after the second iteration.  The figure visually demonstrates the trade-off between the computational cost of additional iterations and the resulting improvement in survey quality.", "section": "3 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "FExX8pMrdT/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Depicting growth trends from 2019 to 2024 in the number of LLMs-related papers (a) and surveys (b) on arXiv, accompanied by a T-SNE visualization.
