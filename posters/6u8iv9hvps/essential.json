Neural contextual bandits, using neural networks, perform better than traditional methods but are vulnerable to malicious reward corruptions.  These corruptions can significantly impact performance, leading to unreliable AI systems. Existing solutions mostly focus on linear or kernel-based models, which struggle with complex, real-world scenarios.\nThis work introduces R-NeuralUCB, a new algorithm designed to overcome these limitations. R-NeuralUCB uses a novel training method that focuses on reliable information and effectively minimizes the impact of corrupted rewards.  The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on real-world datasets, showing superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.  The researchers also provide a theoretical analysis, providing strong evidence supporting the algorithm's reliability.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "6U8iV9HVpS/podcast.wav"}
