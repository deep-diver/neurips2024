The algorithms are categorized by the type of reward function they assume (linear, kernelized, or arbitrary), whether the corruption level C is known or unknown, and their resulting regret bounds. The regret bounds are expressed in terms of the time horizon T, context dimension d, and the corruption level C. The table highlights the trade-off between robustness against adversarial corruption and theoretical guarantees.", "section": "Comparison of T-round regret bounds with adversarial corruption level C"}, {"figure_path": "6U8iV9HVpS/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of T-round regret bounds with adversarial corruption level C.", "description": "This table compares the theoretical regret bounds of several contextual bandit algorithms under different reward corruption scenarios. The algorithms are categorized based on their reward function (linear, kernelized, or arbitrary) and knowledge of corruption level (known or unknown). The regret bounds are presented in terms of the time horizon T, the effective dimension of the context space d or NTK Gram matrix, and the corruption level C. This table shows that the proposed R-NeuralUCB algorithm achieves a better regret bound by removing assumptions, such as the arm separateness assumption.", "section": "5 Theoretical Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "6U8iV9HVpS/tables/tables_16_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of T-round regret bounds with adversarial corruption level C.", "description": "This table compares the theoretical regret bounds of several contextual bandit algorithms.
