Existing fast algorithms often rely on assumptions about data distribution, and these assumptions do not always hold true for real-world data, a problem known as generative overfitting.   Semi-random models, which allow some degree of adversarial entry selection, provide a more realistic setting, but efficient high-accuracy algorithms for semi-random matrix completion remained elusive. \nThis paper introduces a novel, efficient algorithm to solve the semi-random matrix completion problem. The method uses an iterative approach with adaptive reweighting to progressively recover the matrix, using techniques from optimization and graph theory.  Crucially, **the algorithm provides guarantees on accuracy even in noisy settings and achieves nearly-linear time complexity**, substantially improving upon existing solutions.  The new algorithm avoids the polynomial dependence on inverse accuracy and condition number found in previous work, opening up possibilities for high-precision matrix recovery in practical applications.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "XZp1uP0hh2/podcast.wav"}
