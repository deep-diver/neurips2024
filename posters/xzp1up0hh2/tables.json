It takes as input a rank-r matrix M that is approximately close to a rank-r* matrix M*, but only on a submatrix. The algorithm aims to recover the full matrix M* by identifying and correcting columns with large errors.  It uses the Sparsify subroutine to find columns with few large errors, and then a Fix subroutine, applying regression, to improve the approximation of M to M*.  The output is a new matrix that is entrywise close to M*.", "section": "D Postprocessing"}]
