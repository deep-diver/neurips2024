In recent years, the literature has witnessed a significant surge in research focusing on model compression. Among various techniques, network pruning or sparsification stands out as a powerful approach, effectively reducing the model\u2019s parameter count by eliminating the least influential weights and fine-tuning the remaining ones [Singh and Alistarh, 2020, Lin et al., 2020, Hoefler et al., 2021, Frantar and Alistarh, 2023]. Following a similar concept to pruning, quantization techniques suggest reducing the precision of each parameter by allocating fewer bits, rather than completely removing weights from the network [Yao et al., 2022, Dettmers et al., 2022, Frantar et al., 2023, Kim et al., 2023]. Additionally, methods that leverage low-rank factorization are gaining popularity due to their inherent tensor structure [Hu et al., 2022, Lialin et al., 2024, Xu et al., 2023, Nikdan et al., 2024]. Notably, these compression methods are versatile, applicable during both the optimization and post-training phases. Another noteworthy technique is knowledge distillation [Hinton et al., 2014, Mishra and Marr, 2018, Polino et al., 2018], where the compressed model is a compact \u201cstudent\u201d model trained by a larger \u201cteacher\u201d model. The teacher model can either be already trained to high accuracy or trained simultaneously with the student model [Guo et al., 2020, Harutyunyan et al., 2023]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Sparse recovery. The model compression problem we study in this paper is closely related to the field of sparse recovery, which aims to optimize certain objective function based on sparsity constraints, see e.g. [Zhao, 2018] for a detailed introduction. One of the most common sparse optimization algorithms is the iterative hard thresholding algorithm (IHT) first proposed by Blumensath and Davies [2009] for compressed sensing problem, which applies a topk operator to each gradient update, which keeps the $k$ elements with the largest magnitude and setting the rest to zero. While IHT is simple and effective, there is also a long line of work [Blumensath, 2012, Bahmani et al., 2013, Chen and Gu, 2017, Meng and Zhao, 2020, Zhou et al., 2021] that studies the sparse variants of Newton\u2019s methods for these sparse optimization problems, aiming to get acceleration benefits. In particular, Blumensath [2012] proposed a general definition of accelerated IHT for sparse linear regression problems, and showed an accelerated convergence rate in this type of method. Bahmani et al. [2013] proposed a general framework called GraSP, and they proposed to use a restricted Newton step as an approximation of the sparse constrained optimization problem. Chen and Gu [2017] proposed a Fast Newton Hard Thresholding Pursuit, which uses an iterative algorithm to estimate the inverse Hessian matrix for a stochastic objective function. They also obtain a composite rate of convergence. Meng and Zhao [2020] consider applying hard thresholding to Newton\u2019s method for sparse linear regression problems, where they call Newton-Step-Based Iterative Hard Thresholding (NSIHT), and prove a global convergence for this specific problem. Zhou et al. [2021] proposed a general framework called Newton Hard Thresholding Pursuit (NHTP) for general sparse optimization problems showing implicit global and local quadratic convergence rates. In contrast to our approach, at each step NHTP selects the spare support based on the first-order gradient information, switches to restricted gradient update whenever the restricted Newton update fails to provide sufficiently good descent direction, and additionally incorporates a line search procedure to achieve global convergence.

Our work follows the salience-based weight pruning approach, which evaluates the impact of removing weights on the model\u2019s loss or output. Among these, methods based on second-order information are most relevant, particularly those following the Hassibi et al. [1993] framework. Dong et al. [2017] use a second-order approximation of the loss function, assuming a zero gradient, and introduce a layerwise strategy to approximate the Hessian. Singh and Alistarh [2020] scale this idea with the empirical Fisher approximation of the Hessian, improving performance and considering non-zero gradients. However, WoodTaylor methods by Singh and Alistarh [2020] focus on pruning one weight at a time, whereas our work extends this to multiple weights. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Other methods addressing multiple weight pruning include Combinatorial Brain Surgeon (CBS) [Yu et al., 2022], which formulates mask selection as an integer programming problem and proposes two heuristics to approximate its solution.

[2023] formulate layerwise pruning as a $\\ell_{0}\\ell_{2}$ -regularized quadratic problem and propose an IHT-like iterative algorithm with a line search strategy. Aghasi et al. [2017] minimize the norm of weight matrices while ensuring similar activations in the pruned layer. While prior iterative algorithms like CHITA [Benbaki et al., 2023] focus on specific problems, our methods apply to general loss functions beyond quadratic problems and offer convergence guarantees. Practically, within our iterative framework, using a cost-effective projection step (e.g., TopK or SparseGPT [Frantar and Alistarh, 2023]) yields competitive results compared to more complex one-shot solvers.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
