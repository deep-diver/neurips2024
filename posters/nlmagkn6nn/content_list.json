Despite their advanced capabilities, the wide deployment of DiTs, particularly for real-time applications, is currently hampered by considerable computational demands at the inference stage. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a fast and data-efficient solution that can significantly reduce computation and memory footprint by using low-bit weights and activations. However, its applicability to DiTs has not yet been explored and faces non-trivial difficulties due to the unique design of DiTs. In this paper, we propose PTQ4DiT, a specifically designed PTQ method for DiTs. We discover two primary quantization challenges inherent in DiTs, notably the presence of salient channels with extreme magnitudes and the temporal variability in distributions of salient activation over multiple timesteps. To tackle these challenges, we propose Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearman\u2019s $\\rho$ -guided Salience Calibration (SSC). CSB leverages the complementarity property of channel magnitudes to redistribute the extremes, alleviating quantization errors for both activations and weights. SSC extends this approach by dynamically adjusting the balanced salience to capture the temporal variations in activation. Additionally, to eliminate extra computational costs caused by PTQ4DiT during inference, we design an offilne re-parameterization strategy for DiTs. Experiments demonstrate that our PTQ4DiT successfully quantizes DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) while preserving comparable generation ability and further enables effective quantization to 4-bit weight precision (W4A8) for the first time.

The first challenge lies in systematic quantization errors in DiT\u2019s linear layers.

We term these as salient channels, characterized by extreme values that greatly exceed the typical range of magnitudes. Upon uniform quantization (Eq. (2)), it is often necessary to truncate these extreme values in order to maintain the precision of the broader set of standard channels.

Another challenge of DiT quantization arises from temporal variations in the magnitudes of salient activation channels. Rather than static inputs, DiTs operate across a sequence of timesteps to generate high-quality images from random noise. Consequently, activation distributions can vary drastically within the inference process, which is particularly evident in salient channels that dominate the signal. Figure 4 demonstrates that the distribution of maximal absolute values in activation channels exhibits significant variations over different timesteps. This temporal variability introduces a non-trivial difficulty to quantization optimization: Quantization parameters effective for salient activation channels at one timestep may not be suitable at other timesteps. Such discrepancies can exacerbate quantization errors, cumulatively impairing the generation quality.

Our analysis identifies the primary challenges in effective DiT quantization: the pronounced quantization errors incurred by salient channels with extreme magnitudes and the temporal variability in salient activation. To address these challenges, we design Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearman\u2019s $\\rho$ -guided Salience Calibration (SSC). Specifically, CSB utilizes the complementarity nature of salient channels to redistribute the extremes within activations and weights toward the balanced salience. SSC dynamically adjusts salience evaluations across different timesteps, prioritizing timesteps where salient activation and weight channels exhibit significant complementarity, thereby mitigating overall quantization difficulties. To avoid extra computational costs of PTQ4DiT, we also devise a re-parameterization strategy for efficient inference. Experiments show that our PTQ4DiT can effectively quantize DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) and further advance to 4-bit weight (W4A8) while maintaining high-quality image generation capabilities.
