Data selection aims to reduce these costs but traditional methods often compromise accuracy by neglecting the balance between bias and variance reduction, especially in high-dimensional finetuning. This paper focuses on data selection for the finetuning of pre-trained models, a context where less research has been done.\nThis paper introduces Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM), a two-stage data selection method.  First, gradient sketching identifies an informative low-dimensional subspace of the model's parameter space.  Then, moment matching selects samples that reduce variance within this subspace while maintaining low bias.  Theoretically, they prove SkMM preserves fast-rate generalization.  Empirically, experiments on synthetic and real vision tasks show SkMM outperforms existing data selection methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for reducing data volume and computational cost in deep learning finetuning.", "affiliation": "Courant Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "yAAQWBMGiT/podcast.wav"}
