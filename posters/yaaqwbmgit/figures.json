[{"figure_path": "yAAQWBMGiT/figures/figures_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Controlling variance-bias tradeoff in data selection for high-dimensional finetuning via gradient sketching + moment matching (SkMM). Consider a toy dataset with N samples (in blue) whose finetuning gradients lie in a high-dimensional parameter space Rr (visualized in 3D) with a low intrinsic dimension (e.g., three clusters). The goal is to select n = n1 + n2 + n3 < r samples for finetuning. (a) Bias reduction focuses on minimizing the low-rank approximation error, resulting in uniform selection across clusters regardless of their variance. (b) Variance reduction\u00b3places more emphasis on high-variance clusters and could lead to large bias by missing low-variance ones. (c) Gradient sketching efficiently finds a low-dimensional subspace S (where dim(S) < n) with small bias. (d) Moment matching in S controls the variance within the low-bias subspace, leading to a variance-bias balance with fast-rate generalization O(dim(S)/n).", "description": "This figure illustrates the variance-bias tradeoff in high-dimensional finetuning data selection.  It compares four scenarios: (a) bias reduction (uniform selection), (b) variance reduction (biased towards high-variance clusters), (c) gradient sketching (identifying a low-dimensional subspace with minimal bias), and (d) Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM) which balances bias and variance within the subspace for optimal generalization.", "section": "3 Sketchy Moment Matching"}]
