This scenario unfolds as a game over $T$ rounds, leading to a competition of objectives between the learning agent, aiming to minimize their regret, and the arms, motivated by the desire to maximize their individual utilities. To address these dynamics, we introduce a new mechanism that establishes an equilibrium wherein each arm behaves truthfully and discloses as much of its rewards as possible. With this mechanism, the agent can attain the second-highest average (true) reward among arms, with a cumulative regret bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{\\log}(T)/\\Delta)$ (problem-dependent) or $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T\\log(T)})$ (worst-case).

Its primary aim is to enable the player to learn the most favorable sequence of decisions over time. In formal terms, we consider a scenario involving $K$ arms, where, at each time step $t$ , the player selects one arm $k_{t}$ from the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,K\\}$ and receives a reward, denoted as $\\boldsymbol{r}_{k_{t},t}$ . These rewards can either be generated stochastically or determined adversarially. The player\u2019s overarching objective is to strike a balance between two key aspects: exploration and exploitation. Initially, he must explore all arms adequately to gain confidence in identifying the best-performing arm. Once this is accomplished, he focuses on exploiting this knowledge to maximize his cumulative reward over subsequent rounds. Established algorithms for this problem ensure that the player\u2019s performance is nearly as good as selecting the best individual arm, thus minimizing his regret [1, 2, 3]. This modeling framework has broad real-world applications, including domains such as clinical trials [4, 5], recommender systems [6], and resource allocation problems [7]. However, in many of these scenarios, arms are traditionally viewed as passive entities, faithfully reporting their generated rewards $r_{k_{t},t}$ to the player.

Essentially, the player is uncertain about the precise costs or returns until the task is completed, and the agent has substantial freedom to set these ex-post [8]. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that arms are strategic and may act in their self-interest. Conceptually, arms can report a value, denoted as $x_{k_{t},t}$ , which may differ from the actual reward $r_{k_{t},t}$ , retaining in the process a net utility of $r_{k_{t},t}-x_{k_{t},t}$ . This strategic scenario introduces a game-like dynamic, creating a competition of objectives between the player, aiming to minimize his regret and the arms, wishing to maximize their own utilities.

This situation is evident in e-commerce, where advertisers receive rewards for successful ad campaigns that result in a sale after a click. Notably, an e-commerce platform may choose to conceal a sale, but it cannot fabricate one.

Within this framework, we contemplate a collection of $K$ stochastic arms denoted by $k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,K\\}$ , where each arm possesses a bounded reward distribution $D_{k}$ supported on $[0,1]$ . Each arm is distinguished by its reward mean, denoted as $\\mu_{k}$ . To maintain generality without loss of clarity, we assume, for the presentation and the analysis, an ordering such that $\\mu_{1}\\;\\geq\\;\\mu_{2}\\;\\geq\\;\\cdots\\;\\geq\\;\\mu_{K}$ (unknown to the player). In each round $t$ , the $p$ layer selects an arm denoted as $k_{t}$ . This arm $k_{t}$ then observes a reward $r_{k_{t},t}\\,\\in\\,[0,1]$ . Subsequently, the arm reports a quantity $x_{k_{t},t}$ to the player and retains $r_{k_{t},t}-x_{k_{t},t}$ as its own utility. In this scenario, it is important to note that solely arm $k_{t}$ possesses knowledge of the actually observed reward $\\boldsymbol{r}_{k_{t},t}$ , whereas the player is privy only to $x_{k_{t},t}$ and remains unaware of the withheld portion. Hence the decision of the player is based on the information gathered until time $t$ which can formally encoded in $\\mathcal{F}_{P,t}=\\{k_{s},\\bar{x}_{k_{s},s}\\}_{s<t}$ implying that $k_{t}$ is $\\sigma\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{P,t}\\right)$ measurable. Conversely, the arm $k_{t}$ \u2019s available information is succinctly represented by $\\mathcal{F}_{k_{t},t}=\\{k_{s},r_{k_{s},s},x_{k_{s},s},k_{t},r_{k_{t},t}\\}_{s<t:k_{s}=k_{t}}\\cup\\{k_{s}\\}_{s<t}$ and $x_{k_{t},t}$ is $\\sigma\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{k_{t},t}\\right)$ measurable.

In the context of strategic bandits, the player has the option to allocate a bonus $\\Psi_{k}$ to each arm $k\\,\\in\\,\\{1,\\ldots,K\\}$ at the end of the game. This bonus serves as an incentive to encourage arms to provide truthful information, for instance. It can take various forms, including additional rounds of pulling as in [8] or simply a bonus payment awarded to the arms, similar to payments in the usual mechanism design for procurement auctions [11].

Consequently, any incentive-unaware learning algorithm that is oblivious to the strategic nature of the arms is not resilient to such a utility definition and will generally fail to achieve low regret. Therefore, it becomes crucial to design algorithms that rely not only on sequential decision-making but also on incorporating incentive mechanisms to enhance truthfulness. In this context, Lemma 14 of [8] establishes that no mechanism can guarantee more than $\\mu_{2}T$ as revenue for the player in the worst case. This observation justifies the use of $\\mu_{2}$ as a comparator in the regret definition. As a solution, they propose a mechanism referred to here as S-ETC (Strategic Explore Then Commit).
