However, in many real-world scenarios, arms are strategic and might misreport rewards. This paper addresses this issue by considering a strategic multi-armed bandit problem with arms that can strategically retain a portion of their rewards and only disclose a fraction to the learning agent. This leads to a game where arms maximize their utility while the learning agent aims to minimize regret. Existing solutions often fail to achieve satisfactory regret bounds in these settings.\nThe paper proposes a novel mechanism that establishes an equilibrium where arms act truthfully, disclosing all their rewards.  This mechanism involves a new incentive-aware algorithm that uses a bonus-based system to encourage truthful behavior. With this approach, the learning agent can attain the second-highest average reward among arms with a cumulative regret bounded by O(log(T)/\u0394) or O(\u221aT log(T)) depending on problem characteristics.", "affiliation": "CREST, ENSAE", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "WqNfihAcu5/podcast.wav"}
