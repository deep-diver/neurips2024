The first is a baseline where arms randomly withhold portions of their reward.  The second shows the cumulative regret when all arms report truthfully, achieving a dominant-strategy subgame perfect equilibrium. The third strategy, called \"optimal\", shows that only the two best-performing arms report truthfully, while the others withhold all rewards. This demonstrates the trade-off between incentivizing truthful reporting and achieving lower regret.

The x-axis represents the arms (indexed from \u03bc\u2081 to \u03bc\u2086, indicating that \u03bc\u2081 is the arm with the highest mean reward, and \u03bc\u2086 is the lowest). The y-axis represents the utility (total reward retained by the arm) achieved by each arm under each strategy. The bars show that under truthful reporting, arms achieve higher utilities than under untruthful reporting, which is consistent with the paper's theoretical analysis demonstrating that truthful reporting leads to a dominant strategy.", "section": "F Empirical Analysis"}]
