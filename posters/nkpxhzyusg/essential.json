This limitation hinders the development of truly responsive online video assistants.  Existing solutions like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler try to reduce the number of vision tokens, but this can lead to information loss.\nVIDEOLLM-MOD tackles this problem by dynamically skipping the computation for a high proportion of vision tokens at certain transformer layers instead of decreasing the overall token count. This approach, inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs, significantly reduces computational costs (~42% training time and ~30% memory savings) without sacrificing performance.  Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of VIDEOLLM-MOD and its state-of-the-art performance.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "NKPXHzYusG/podcast.wav"}
