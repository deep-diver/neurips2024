The top row shows the exploitability gap (a measure of how far from optimal the learned strategies are) as a function of the number of episodes of training.  The bottom row illustrates the empirical variance of the loss estimations during training. The figure demonstrates that LocalOMD achieves lower exploitability and variance compared to other algorithms.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "HU2uyDjAcy/figures/figures_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performances over 5 simulations of various algorithms with respect to the total number of episodes.
