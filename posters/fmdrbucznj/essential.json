Existing approaches also struggle to scale effectively to large datasets.  This limits the accuracy and applicability of hierarchical clustering across various domains. \nThe paper introduces Expected Probabilistic Hierarchies (EPH), addressing these issues by learning hierarchies through probabilistic modeling and optimizing expected scores.  **EPH uses differentiable hierarchy sampling**, allowing for end-to-end gradient descent optimization, and **an unbiased subgraph sampling technique** to handle large datasets efficiently.  **Experimental results demonstrate EPH's superiority** over existing methods on various benchmarks.
