Existing machine learning (ML) approaches either rely on computationally expensive atomic structure data or fail to fully utilize domain expertise. This research addresses these challenges by introducing Retrieval-Retro. \n\nRetrieval-Retro implicitly extracts precursor information from reference materials, overcoming limitations of previous methods that explicitly use this information.  It employs two retrievers: Masked Precursor Completion (MPC) to find similar materials and Neural Reaction Energy (NRE) to consider thermodynamic relationships.  Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority, especially in finding novel synthesis pathways.  The open-sourced code ensures broader accessibility and collaboration.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Manufacturing"}, "podcast_path": "7gf6oGdKPU/podcast.wav"}
