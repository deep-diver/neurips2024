The results demonstrate that our proposed approach offers greater beneftis compared to refining with a robust classifier alone (i.e., BIGROC [6]). Notably, the proposed training of our joint model leads to significantly improved results. This boost in image quality is observed across both Consistency Training (CT) and Consistency Distillation (CD) methods, and when using either one or two generative steps. In terms of efficiency, one PGD step requires only 0.02 seconds, while a single Consistency (CT or CD) inference step takes 0.55 seconds, making 25 PGD steps comparable in cost to a Consistency inference. This suggests that our approach could be interpreted as providing a continuum trade-off between complexity and perceptual quality.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
