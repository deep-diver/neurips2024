Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model to improve efficiency without significant performance loss.  Current KD methods mainly focus on minimizing the difference between teacher and student probability distributions, which can be suboptimal.  This approach has limitations in capturing the essence of language knowledge and generalizing well.\nThis paper proposes a new KD method using reinforcement learning, focusing on matching action-value moments instead of probability distributions. This is done via an adversarial training approach which optimizes both on-policy and off-policy objectives simultaneously, improving generalization performance.  The results demonstrate significant improvements over existing techniques in instruction-following and various task-specific experiments, achieving state-of-the-art results.", "affiliation": "SI-TECH Information Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "0VeSCjRDBy/podcast.wav"}
