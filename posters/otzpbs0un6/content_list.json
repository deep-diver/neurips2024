To address this challenge, recent efforts [10, 11, 12, 13] have focused on improving the generalizability of detection, i.e., the ability to detect unknown forgeries based on known examples. One effective approach to address this problem is to enhance the training data by generating synthetic fake faces, known as pseudo-fakes [14, 15, 16]. The intuition behind this approach is that the DeepFake generation process introduces artifacts in the step of blending faces, and these methods generate pseudo-fake faces by simulating various blending artifacts. By training on these pseudofake faces, the models can be driven to learn corresponding artifacts. However, existing methods concentrate on simulating the spatial aspects of face blending (see Fig. 1 (right)). While they can make the pseudo-fake faces resemble the distribution of wild fake faces in the spatial domain, they do not explore the distribution in the frequency domain. Thus, current pseudo-fake faces lack frequency-based forgery clues, limiting the models to learn generic forgery features.

Then we replace this range of real faces with the corresponding range of fake faces to generate pseudo-fake faces. However, identifying the frequency range of forgery clues is challenging due to two main reasons: 1) this range varies across different fake faces due to its high dependence on face content, and 2) forgery clues may not be concentrated on a single frequency range but could be an aggregation of various portions across multiple ranges. Thus, general low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filters are incapable of precisely pinpointing the distribution.

This hypothesis is validated in our preliminary analysis (refer to Sec. 3 for details).

These methods mainly rely on deep neural networks to identify the inconsistency between real and fake faces using various features, including biological signals [17], spatial artifacts [18, 14, 15, 16], frequency abnormality [13, 19, 20], auto-learned clues from dedicated-designed models [21, 22]. These methods have shown promising results on public datasets. However, some of their performance significantly deteriorates when confronted with unknown DeepFake faces due to the large distribution discrepancy resulting from limited training datasets. To tackle this issue, many methods have been proposed to improve their generalizability by learning the generic DeepFake traces, e.g., [10, 14, 15, 16, 12, 23, 24]. One effective approach is to create synthetic fake faces during training, known as pseudo-fake faces, e.g., [10, 14, 15, 16]. FWA [10] is a pioneering method that conducts self-blending to simulate fake faces. Several extended variants (Face X-ray [14], PCL [15], SBI [16], BiG-Arts [25]) have been proposed to blend faces using curated strategies, further improving detection performance. By increasing the diversity of training faces, the gap in the distribution of wild fake faces can be reduced, allowing the models to learn the invariant DeepFake traces across different distributions. To generate the pseudo-fake faces, existing methods usually design spatial blending operations to combine different faces. This involves extracting the face region from a source image and blending it into a target image. However, these methods overlook the distribution of wild fake faces in the frequency domain. While the synthetic faces may resemble the spatial-based distribution, the lack of consideration for frequency perspective hinders the models from learning the fundamental generic DeepFake traces.

We extract the frames from all videos and randomly select 3, 000 real images and 3, 000 fake images for each manipulation method (e.g., DF, F2F, FS, and NT). Then we crop out the face region in these selected images using a face detector [28] and apply DCT [29] to generate frequency maps. For analysis, we sum up all frequency maps of real and fake images and adopt the visualization process of azimuthal average described in previous work [30, 27]. This process involves logarithmic transformation and the calculation of azimuthally-averaged flux in circular annuli apertures. By placing the center of the circular annuli aperture at the top-left corner of the frequency map, we can obtain a one-dimensional array representing the spectrum diagram. The visual results of their distribution are shown in Fig. 2 (top). It can be observed that this figure is consistent with the results in [26]. However, when we directly plot their distribution differences without logarithmic operation, the results do not match the previous figure. It can be seen that the disparities in high-frequency regions are not as substantial as expected, while the differences in the lower range become more noticeable (see Fig. 2 (bottom)). This is because the logarithmic operation mitigates the degree of differences in lower frequency ranges, causing the illusion that only the high-frequency range exhibits differences between real and fake faces. Therefore, we conjecture that the forgery traces may not only be concentrated in a very high-frequency range but could possibly spread to the low-frequency range.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
