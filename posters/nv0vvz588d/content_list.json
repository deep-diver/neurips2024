In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our prior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when processing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i) approximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating results appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state spaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its scalability and the tractability of variational posteriors, For discrete state spaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable approximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings.

Our case studies in linear preference learning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets in sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting.

[19, 39] In this context, Bayesian inference appears as a natural starting point to learning in the streaming data setting due to its innate property of coherence [5], which allows learning can happen continuously, independently of how the data is chunked into packages or ordered.

Streaming, Distributed, Asynchronous (SDA) Bayes [6] was originally presented as a general framework for implementing variational inference algorithms in a streaming setting. Similarly to our work, it was based upon the principle that, if the variational distribution $q^{(t)}(x)$ is a good approximation to the unnormalized posterior $\\tilde{\\pi}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ , then ${\\boldsymbol{q}}^{(t+1)}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ may be optimized to approximate $q^{(t)}(x)f(D_{t}|x)$ instead of $f(\\mathcal \u1e0a D \u1e0c _{t}|x)\\tilde{\\pi}_{t}(x)$ . This framework was instantiated to accommodate, for example, the learning of Gaussian processes [7], of tensor factorization [14], of feature models [51] and, jointly with SMC, nonlinear state-space models [62]. Nonetheless, our work is the first one to enable the training of GFlowNets in a streaming setting and, due to the relationship between GFlowNets and variational inference algorithms presented by [38], may be viewed as an instance of SDA-Bayes tailored to inferential problems on a combinatorial support. In the realm of approximate Bayesian inference, Akhound-Sadegh et al. [1], Berner et al. [4], Sendera et al. [52], Zhang and Matsen [59] propose advancements in diffusion-based sampling methods, which we believe could be extended to the context of approximate streaming Bayesian inference via the techniques presented in this work. On the other hand, Mittal et al. [40] introduces an neural network-based approach for approximate Bayesian inference that amortizes over exchangeable data sets to handle posterior inference in novel data. Also, Richter and Berner [48], Richter et al. [49] develop a low-variance gradient estimator for carrying out variational inference derived from the log-variance loss, which could be employed as an alternative to our KL-based objective for streaming updates of GFlowNets. On a broader scale, Cranmer et al. [9] reviews approximate Bayesian methodology under the lens of simulation-based inference. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "7 Conclusions, limitations, and outlook ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Conclusions. We proposed the first method for carrying out approximate Bayesian inference over discrete distributions within a streaming setting, called SB-GFlowNet. We proposed two training/update schemes for SB-GFlowNet, as well as a theoretical analysis accounting for the compounding effect of errors due to posterior propagation. Our experimental evaluation showcases SB-GFlowNet\u2018s effectiveness in accurately sampling from the target posterior \u2014 while still achieving a significant reduction in training time relative to standard GFlowNets. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations. Proposition 2 and Proposition 4 suggest that an inappropriate approximation to $\\pi_{t}$ may be propagated through time and lead to increasingly inaccurate models. This phenomenon, known as catasthropic forgetting in the online literature [19, 39], may eventually demand retraining of the current SB-GFlowNet based on an earlier checkpoint or on the full posterior. We also note that unlike traditional variational methods, where the expressiveness of the approximation family is explicitly chosen, the expressiveness implied by different parametrizations of GFlowNets is not clear. We believe this is a fruitful avenue for future investigation. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Outlook and future works As our proposal provides generic and efficient streaming variational inference solution for discrete parameters, we believe it will allow the use of streaming discrete Bayesian inference to more datasets and to less explored research domains. In this work, we proposed two training criteria based on the trajectory balance condition and the KL criterion, nonetheless, these are not the only training schemes for GFlowNets, we believe other proposed criteria such as detailed balance [3] or the sub-trajectory balance [35] could be adapted for the streaming setting as well. Additionally, due to the flexibility of GFlowNets in sampling unnormalized distributions, our proposal can be extended to different divergences and generalized likelihoods to improve the predictive quality of the learned posteriors [28]. Finally, the problem of updating a GFlowNet when the size of the generated object changes, e.g., when a new species is observed during BPI, remains open.
