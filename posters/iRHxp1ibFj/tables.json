The supervision column indicates a form of supervision: image-level class tags, size targets (our highlighted results), or full supervision with pixel-accurate masks. The percentage after \u201csize\u201d is the accuracy (mRE) of our corrupted size targets (15,16). Our approach does not require any complex architectural modification or multi-stage training procedures needed for tag supervision, see \"Modification\" column.", "description": "This table compares the performance of various semantic segmentation methods on the PASCAL and COCO datasets.  It breaks down the results by the type of supervision used (image-level class tags, size targets, or full supervision), the backbone architecture of the model, and whether the model involved multi-stage training or was a single-stage (end-to-end) approach.  The table highlights the superior performance achieved using the proposed size-target approach which is a single-stage method that doesn't require complex architectural modifications.", "section": "3.5 Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods"}]
