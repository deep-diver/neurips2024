NVS has been widely applied in autonomous driving [1\u20134], image editing [5\u20138], digital human [9\u201312], etc. NVS is a challenging topic in computer vision because the limited capacity of camera sensor usually leads to a low dynamic range (from 0 to 255) of luminance in rendered images. This results in the loss of image details in very bright or dark areas, color distortions, and a limited capacity to display subtle gradations in light and shadow that the human eye can normally perceive. Hence, there is a growing demand to render HDR (from 0 to $+\\infty$ ) views for better image quality and visualization performance.

Firstly, the dynamic range of the rendered image is still limited to [0, 255], which severely degrades the visual quality. Secondly, training 3DGS with images under different exposures may lead to a non-convergence problem because the spherical harmonics (SH) of 3D Gaussians can not adaptively model the change of exposures.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
