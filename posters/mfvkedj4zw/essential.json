Existing methods are either complex, lack interpretability, or are sensitive to noise. This necessitates efficient, robust methods for comparing and aligning these spaces to enhance performance in downstream tasks such as retrieval and data transfer across various modalities.\n\nThis paper introduces Latent Functional Maps (LFM), a novel spectral framework that tackles these issues.  LFM leverages spectral geometry principles in the functional domain, boosting both interpretability and performance. The framework is shown to efficiently compare spaces, find correspondences (even with limited data), and transfer information between them.  Evaluations across diverse applications and modalities showcase LFM's efficacy and robustness, surpassing existing methods in many aspects.", "affiliation": "IST Austria", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "mfvKEdJ4zW/podcast.wav"}
