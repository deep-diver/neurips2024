Recent studies in 3D generation can be classified into three categories: 3D generative methods [53, 17, 45, 36, 60, 3, 58, 12], feed forward methods [18, 49, 23, 67], and diffusion priorbased methods [26, 39, 51, 9, 34, 41, 50, 30, 55, 27]. Inspired by the advancements in 2D content creation, 3D generative methods utilize the robust diffusion [53] or flow-based [60] backbone to generate 3D data represented by Signed Distance Function (SDF) [60], voxel grid [36], triplane [8, 17, 45], or weights of neural network [12]. However, these methods require time-consuming pre-training to fit each 3D data and are limited to creating a single category. Feed forward methods [18, 23] adopt image features extracted from the pre-trained visual encoder DINO [7] to reconstruct 3D representations through a highly scalable and efficient transformer-based decoder. Although they can produce a 3D shape in a few seconds, they demand extensive training on large-scale 3D datasets, which is impractical with limited 4D datasets for 4D generation. Furthermore, diffusion prior-based methods distill prior knowledge from diffusion generative models via SDS [38] to optimize 3D representations, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D shapes with strong generalizability.
