As a rule, these algorithms operate by iteratively choosing what to evaluate next until some predefined budget has been exhausted.

We focus on the prototypical example of an $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ -criterion: stop when a solution has been found whose value is within $\\epsilon>0$ of the optimum with probability at least $1-\\delta$ under the model. For Gaussian process priors, we show that Bayesian optimization satisfies this criterion under mild technical assumptions. Further, we give a practical algorithm for evaluating Monte Carlo stopping rules in a manner that is both sample efficient and robust to estimation error. These findings are accompanied by empirical results which demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.

", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "A common approach is therefore to construct models for these problems and use them to predict real-world outcomes. In recent years, Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a leading approach for accomplishing these tasks. Precise definitions vary, but BO methods are frequently characterized by their use of probabilistic models to guide the search for good solutions. The idea is for these models to provide distributions over the performance of competing alternatives, which can then be used to simulate the usefulness of evaluating different things. For a recent review, see Garnett [16]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite the success of these algorithms, an ongoing issue for practitioners has been the continued lack of interpretable stopping rules. The vast majority of BO runs proceed until a predetermined budget (e.g., a number of evaluations or amount of resources) is exhausted. We highlight two likely reasons for this trend and then give a brief prospective for model-based alternatives. The first reason is that stopping rules often revolve around quantities like optimums that are difficult to work with, even when defined under a model. The second is that even the best models sometimes go astray; and, if the model is bad, then model-based stopping is liable to stop much too soon or far too late. To avoid potential disappointment, let us say upfront that this work addresses the former challenge and only provides mild commentary on the latter. We will revisit this topic in the closing sections.

One benefti of model-based stopping is its ability to adapt to the data. Sometimes, we will get lucky and stumble upon good solutions early on. Other times, our progress will be slow. If the model captures these events, then stopping can be tailored to each run.
