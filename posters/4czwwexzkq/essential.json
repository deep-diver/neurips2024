This process is time-consuming and prone to bias. Existing automated methods still require substantial human labor, and manual annotation is impractical due to the massive data size. \nActSort, an active learning algorithm, addresses this challenge by strategically selecting outlier cell candidates for annotation. It integrates domain-expert features and data formats with minimal memory needs, resulting in a drastic reduction of human effort (to 1-3% of candidates) and enhanced accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. This is supported by a first-of-its-kind benchmark study involving ~160,000 annotations.  The user-friendly software makes ActSort accessible to experimental neuroscientists, promising to accelerate systems neuroscience research by enabling analysis of large-scale neural activity datasets.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4czwwExZKQ/podcast.wav"}
