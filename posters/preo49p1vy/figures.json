The left part shows a schematic of the matrix mixer framework. It illustrates how an input sequence X is preprocessed using a function fx, then passed through a sequence mixer (represented by a matrix M), and finally processed by a channel mixer to produce the output sequence Y. The right part provides an overview of different classes of structured matrices that can be used as sequence mixers. These include dense, Vandermonde, Toeplitz, low-rank, semiseparable, and quasiseparable matrices. Each matrix type is visually represented along with a formula to better demonstrate the key differences between the classes of matrices. This part also highlights the different properties of each matrix that makes it suitable for use in the model.", "section": "2 The Matrix Mixer Framework: Bridging Sequence Mixers and Structured Matrices"}, {"figure_path": "preo49P1VY/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Cross-entropy loss of various bidirectional variants, measured on the C4 validation set.", "description": "This figure shows the cross-entropy loss curves during training on the C4 validation set for different methods of creating bidirectional sequence models.  The methods compared are concatenation (Concat), Hadamard product (Mult), element-wise addition (Add), and the proposed quasiseparable matrix mixer (Quasi). The plot demonstrates the training progress over 70,000 steps, illustrating how the loss decreases over time for each method. The quasiseparable method shows a consistently lower loss than other approaches.  This visual comparison underscores Hydra's superior performance in bidirectional sequence modeling.", "section": "4.1.2 Ablating Approaches for Bidirectionality"}, {"figure_path": "preo49P1VY/figures/figures_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Detailed illustration of Hydra.", "description": "This figure provides a detailed illustration of the architecture of the Hydra model.

(b) A quasiseparable (QS) matrix. (c) A mixer matrix of addition-based bidirectional SSMs. (d) A QS mixer matrix for Hydra. SS and QS matrices are characterized by rank conditions (Definition 3.1, Definition 3.2). The rank characterization of SS matrices include the diagonals (e.g., green submatrices), whereas that of QS matrices hold for off-diagonal submatrices (e.g., yellow submatrices). Because of the similar rank properties, a naive addition-based bidirectional SSM is provably a QS matrix mixer. Hence, QS matrix mixers generalize this common heuristic for bidirectional SSMs. The freedom in the diagonal values of Hydra leads to a higher expressivity compared to the mixer matrices of the addition-based bidirectional SSMs, where the diagonal values are constrained by the colored vectors.", "description": "This figure illustrates the matrix structures of semiseparable (SS), quasiseparable (QS) matrices, and how they relate to the Hydra model.  It highlights the rank properties that distinguish SS and QS matrices, showing how QS matrices generalize SS matrices and a common bidirectional SSM approach. The key takeaway is that Hydra's QS matrix structure provides greater expressivity than simpler addition-based bidirectional SSMs due to its unconstrained diagonal values.", "section": "3 Hydra: The Double-Headed Mamba"}]
