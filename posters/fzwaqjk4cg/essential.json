This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new graph-based representation of cryptographic problems based on the Algebraic Normal Form (ANF).  This approach is designed to efficiently handle XOR operations and capture higher-order information.\nThe paper introduces CryptoANFNet, a graph neural network model trained to solve these ANF-based SAT instances.  Empirically, CryptoANFNet shows significant performance improvements, offering a 50x speed-up compared to heuristic solvers.  It also achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art NeuroSAT, especially on large-scale datasets. Furthermore, the paper introduces a key-solving algorithm that leverages CryptoANFNet to enhance key decryption accuracy. Overall, CryptoANFNet provides a more efficient and accurate approach to solving complex cryptographic problems, paving the way for further advancements in learning-based cryptanalysis.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "FzwAQJK4CG/podcast.wav"}
