These approaches frequently result in lengthy training times and struggle to generalize well.  Template-based methods lack the flexibility needed to reconstruct diverse real-world scenes accurately.\n\nThis research introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free approach using an invertible neural network (INN) to predict linear blend skinning weights efficiently.  By disentangling entity motions and using semantic-aware ray sampling, TFS-NeRF generates high-quality, semantically separable 3D reconstructions.  Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and training efficiency compared to existing methods.  **TFS-NeRF's template-free nature and efficient INN-based approach enable superior generalizability and improved reconstruction quality.**", "affiliation": "Faculty of IT, Monash University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "UPxFYvHsyN/podcast.wav"}
