It shows a comparison of the regret bounds (measuring algorithm performance), time complexity, and space complexity of three algorithms: Zooming, HOO, and MBAD. The table highlights that MBAD offers significant improvements in space complexity (using only constant memory) while maintaining comparable time complexity and regret bounds to existing methods.", "section": "1.2 Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "SOxxGATGsl/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison with State-of-the-art Lipschitz Bandits Algorithms", "description": "This table compares the proposed MBAD algorithm with existing state-of-the-art algorithms for solving Lipschitz bandits problems.

The table highlights the superior efficiency of MBAD in terms of both time and space complexity, particularly its near-optimal regret with only a constant number of arms stored in memory.", "section": "1.2 Related Work"}]
