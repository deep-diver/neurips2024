We demonstrate that such an approach enables the experience of immersive virtual tourism - performing a real-time dynamic navigation within the scene, experiencing both audio and visual content. Current audio-visual rendering approaches typically rely on visual cues, such as images, and thus visual artifacts could cause inconsistency in the audio quality. Furthermore, when such approaches are incorporated with visual rendering, audio generation at each viewpoint occurs after the rendering of the image of the viewpoint and thus could lead to audio lag that affects the integration of audio and visual streams. Our proposed approach, AV-Cloud, overcomes these challenges by learning the representation of the audio-visual scene based on a set of sparse AV anchor points, that constitute the Audio-Visual Cloud, and are derived from the camera calibration. The Audio-Visual Cloud serves as an audio-visual representation from which the generation of spatial audio for arbitrary listener location can be generated. In particular, we propose a novel module Audio-Visual Cloud Splatting which decodes AV anchor points into a spatial audio transfer function for the arbitrary viewpoint of the target listener. This function, applied through the Spatial Audio Render Head module, transforms monaural input into viewpoint-specific spatial audio. As a result, AV-Cloud efficiently renders the spatial audio aligned with any visual viewpoint and eliminates the need for pre-rendered images. We show that AV-Cloud surpasses current state-of-the-art accuracy on audio reconstruction, perceptive quality, and acoustic effects on two real-world datasets.

While visual realism and visual perception of current virtual tourism methods are striking [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], additional modalities such as sound could enhance and contribute to a fuller, more dynamic, and more immersive experience. Imagine attending a virtual tour of the Trevi Fountain in Rome, where you can not only view the fountain from different locations but also hear its magical sounds. Furthermore, these sounds would adapt based on your view perspectives while exploring the scene.

Combined together, visual and audio components provide a cohesive, immersive experience that allows to explore and interact within virtual spaces. The creation of such an experience requires the rendering of high-quality spatial audio which is synchronized with the visual rendering. In addition to real-time speed requirements, this task is challenging since such audio rendering requires careful modeling of comprehensive factors such as magnitude changes and spatial effects (e.g., left-right channel energy ratios for stereo audio) that match with view perspectives and reverberation that enhances the sound\u2019s situational presence within a scene. While, in principle, the spatial audio can be rendered in a scene by comprehensive modeling of the Room Impulse Response (RIR) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] that will be convolved with sounds emitted from emitters, achieving high fidelity modeling of RIR is reserved for synthetic scenes with simulated RIR or scenes that have been thoroughly scanned for such purpose. Indeed, accurate modeling of RIR demands a thorough understanding of the scene properties such as the scene geometry and surface materials, all of which are challenging to estimate for scenes reconstructed from \u201cin-the-wild\u201d sparse collections of images or videos.

While such image-based approaches pave the way to audio-visual rendering, their accuracy relies on the visual accuracy of rendered images such that visual artifacts will impact the sound quality.

AV-Cloud then establishes clusters of these points and initializes representative Audio-Visual Anchors (AV anchors), each bound with 3D coordinates, RGB visual features, and audio effect latent features for a point-based audio-visual scene representation. AV anchors then undergo splatting by the AudioVisual Cloud Splatting (AVCS) module, which decodes them into spatial audio transfer function by dynamically adjusting the contribution of each anchor based on the viewpoint pose of the listener. Together with the Spatial Audio Render Head (SARH), AV-Cloud converts monaural reference sound into viewpoint-specific stereo audio, effectively adjusting the acoustic effects.

Most traditional audio scene reconstruction methods reconstruct spatial sound at arbitrary listener locations by convolving the sound waveform of each emitter with corresponding Room Impulse Response (RIR) and then perform summation of the outcomes of each emitter. Conventional RIR modeling methods were based on solving the acoustic wave equation [8, 9, 10, 11] or treat sound propagation as optic rays [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Recent methods utilize deep learning approaches to generate spatial RIRs for emitter-receiver pairs. Particularly, in [18, 19, 20, 21], a deep generative model is learned, while alternative methods [30, 31, 32] learn an implicit neural function to represent RIR. Since RIR is the complex outcome of sound propagation through the scene geometry and interaction with surfaces, the aforementioned RIR generators are conditioned on the locations of the emitters and scene properties such as geometry [31, 32, 19], mesh [20] and visual at target viewpoint [21]. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "In real-world applications, the explicit emitter location and detailed scene geometry information are challenging to capture without special setups. To overcome this requirement, it was proposed to reconstruct spatial audio scenes from images, giving rise to methods such as visual acoustic matching [22, 23, 27] and visual-guided audio spatialization [24, 25, 26]. These methods primarily focused on matching environmental levels, that could introduce inaccuracies in learning acoustic effect difference during continuous viewpoint changes. To address these limitations, the study in [28] introduced a novel-view acoustic synthesis task and a neural rendering approach that learns to synthesize the sound of an arbitrary perspective in the space guided by visual images. This was followed by the study in [29] which utilized NeRF-based rendering method [33] to synthesize novel videos with spatial sound from arbitrary camera poses. Both [28] and [29] rely on viewpoint information rather than uniform scene representations for audio rendering which may result in inaccuracies when tested on novel camera poses. Furthermore, the requirement of view images as input, could reduce the audio rendering quality due to visual artifacts and introduce rendering delays. Our method renders spatial audio in synchrony with the visual rendering for any viewpoint since audio is rendered directly from the learned scene representation. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Point-based Neural Rendering for Audio-Visual Scenes. Point-based methods were shown to render disconnected and unstructured geometry samples such as point clouds in an efficient way [34]. Points capture the underlying data of a 3D scene, and hold essential physical information critical for precise depiction in both visual and audio rendering. In some instances, point sample rendering for visual content could lead to holes due to the extreme discontinuity of points. Traditionally, this issue was addressed by splatting the points to extents larger than a pixel [35, 36, 37, 38]. This approach helps in mitigating discontinuities. Notably, a recent method 3D-GS[3] utilizes 3D Gaussians for a flexible and expressive scene representation, leveraging explicit representation and differential pointbased splatting methods for real-time rendering of novel views. In contrast to traditional point-based methods that require Multi-View Stereo (MVS) data [39, 40, 41], 3D-GS achieves high-quality results from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points only [1] from camera calibration as input, optimizing properties such as position, opacity, anisotropic covariance at each point.

Therefore, implicit neural field representations are popular for point-based neural audio rendering [32, 42, 43, 44]. Specifically, in [42], distinct local feature grids were used for the emitter and the receiver as an inductive bias to generalize to novel inputs, while in [32], scene geometry features were disentangled with three modules to generate independent features for the emitter, the boundary points, and the listener, respectively, enhancing feature reuse. These methods rely on knowledge of the locations of the emitter and the listener, and they do not adapt to the orientation of the viewer. Such property is key for realistic spatial effects.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
