Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description (caption) of the audio. Such a framework has two unique advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of the visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, which is an LLM that has been fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space, and VATT Audio, a bi-directional transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens and the text prompt are used by a pretrained neural codec to convert them into a waveform. Our experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, such as VGGSound audiovisual dataset, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (with lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies asking participants to choose the most compatible generated audio for a given silent video, show that VATT Audio has been chosen on average as a preferred generated audio than the audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.

In particular, the goal of an ideal video-toaudio generative model would be to generate sounds that seamlessly match the video temporally and fully capture the semantics. Moreover, it is desirable to control such a generation process towards the themes and sounds that match user preference. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have adopted two types of generative modeling techniques: auto-regressive token-based modeling and diffusion-based modeling. These methods enable end-to-end video-to-audio generation and are applicable across a wide variety of video and audio categories. However, while these methods are capable of capturing the general semantics of sound sources in videos, they often overlook the subtleties of the context. For example, in a video depicting two cats in a territorial dispute, the model might produce a calm, amiable meowing sound, which contradicts the contentious nature of the scene. This discrepancy mainly stems from the limitations of the vision encoder, which struggles to distinguish between varying sound properties emitted by identical sound sources across different contexts, due to an incomplete understanding of the entire scene. Second, these methods lack controllability since the generation is conditioned only on visual frames, without taking into account the context and interpretation of the sounds. While text-to-audio models could explicitly control the context of the sounds, such models are based on text only without incorporating the rich and dynamic context of visuals, which could significantly inform video and audio alignment. Indeed, text only generative outcomes often result in unmatched audio with the visual (e.g., temporal misalignment or semantic loss).

Through this cross-modal conversion, visual features that are relevant to audio concepts are extracted. These features are closely connected to audio-related tasks such as audio captioning and audio generation. ii) Video $^+$ Text to Audio stage, that generates audio conditioned on the hidden states extracted from the LLM in the prior modeling stage. At its core, the proposed model in this stage is a bi-directional transformer decoder that generates audio using a token-based representation similar to [1, 2]. To obtain the conditioning on the hidden states of the preceding component, the projected video features along with the optional text prompts are concatenated together and fed into the LLM in stage i), with the hidden states from the last layer extracted and attached to the audio tokens for the decoder. The decoder is trained using masked token modeling, where the objective is to predict masked audio tokens from unmasked ones at varying masking ratios. During inference, starting from all tokens being masked, an efficient parallel decoding algorithm is implemented which gradually unmasks multiple tokens in parallel based on video and text inputs until a stop condition is met. Finally, the generated tokens are converted into audio waveforms through a neural audio codec decoder.

Existing Visual-to-Audio generation approaches can be divided into two branches of studies based on audio categories: visualto-music generation and visual-to-natural sound generation. In visual-to-music generation domain, earlier studies explored Midi or spectrogram generation from human body movements by studying the temporal and semantics alignment [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. More recently, diffusion-based methods have been proposed to generate music waveforms directly from videos [11]. In visual-to-natural sound generation, earlier efforts pioneered the generation of sounds linked to various objects and materials [12]. Later works proposed an audio generation approach based on SampleRNN [13, 14] that could generate several types of natural sounds from in-the-wild videos. While these approaches showcase promising results, they are often limited to specific audio categories. Neural codec [15, 16, 17, 18] and autoregressive transformer architectures [19, 20] addressed these limitations and as they have evolved, generative models now effectively generalize across a broader range of sounds or music, leveraging compressed latent spaces [21, 22, 23, 24]. Similar advances have been shown with diffusion techniques such as [25, 26]. However, these methods often lack detailed sound control and their inference time turns out to be consuming. Our work aims to address these limitations by introducing a text-guided framework to improve controllability and efficiency in video-to-audio generation.

As shown in Table 5, the model performs better when the distribution has a higher mean in masking ratio, especially arc cosine distribution and Gaussian mean with 0.75. This is due to the fact that the initial steps during the sampling stage are important for future decoding steps. The initial steps correspond to high masking ratio cases. For later steps, new tokens are unmasked conditioned on more clues such that the masking ratio decreases and the generation becomes less challenging, thus making the learning at lower masking ratio easier during training.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
