Since 3D scans are generally accompanied by multi-view images, leveraging 2D convolutional neural networks allows these images to be exploited as a rich source for extracting extrusion cylinder information. However, we observe that extracting only the surface information of the extrudes and utilizing it results in suboptimal outcomes due to the challenges in the occlusion and surface segmentation. By synergizing with the extracted base curve information, we achieve the optimal reconstruction result with the best accuracy in 2D sketch and extrude parameter estimation.

Supervised methods using a language-based architecture, such as those described in [65], often face challenges in producing valid outputs. A notable exception is Point2Cyl [58], which is a supervised method proposing to first segment the given raw point cloud into each extrusion region and estimate the 2D sketch and the extrusion parameters using the predicted segments and surface normal information.

Also, 2D convolutional neural networks have been utilized in various 3D tasks [34, 63], owing to their superior performance compared to 3D processing networks.

In contrast, we observe that reconstructing only the 2D sketches of the two ends of the extrusion cylinders\u2014the start and end planes of extrusion\u2014provides much more accurate results while avoiding the ambiguity issue and the consequential error accumulation. However, this approach also results in failure cases when one of the bases is not properly detected in 2D image due to the sparse viewpoints. Therefore, we propose a framework that synergizes the reconstructions of labeled surfaces and labeled curves of the extrusion bases so that parameters such as extrusion center and height can be better calculated from the surface information, while the 2D sketches can be precisely recovered from the curve information.

Primitive fitting has been extensively investigated in computer vision. One line of work involves decomposing into surface/volumetric primitives. Classical approaches include detecting simple primitives such as planes [6, 11, 42] through RANSAC [51, 31], region growing [45], or Hough voting [3, 8]. The emergence of neural networks gave rise to data-driven methods [29, 56, 28] learning frameworks that fit simple primitives such as planes, cylinders, cones, and spheres. Primitive ftiting has also been used to approach the task of shape abstraction [75, 57] that fti cuboids given an input shape or image. However, these works all assume a fixed predefined set of primitives that may not be able to cover complex real-world objects.

CAD reverse engineering has been a well-studied problem in computer graphics and CAD communities [4, 60, 2, 1, 38], enabling the recovery of a structured representation of shapes for applications such as editing and manufacturing. Earlier works focused on reconstructing CAD through inverse CSG modeling [9, 55, 22, 48, 69], which decomposes shapes into simple primitives combined with boolean operations. While achieving good reconstruction, CSG-like methods tend to combine a large number of shape primitives, making them less flexible or easily manipulated by users. Recent efforts in collating large-scale CAD datasets (ABC [25], Fusion 360 [64], SketchGraphs [54]) have pushed this boundary, enabling the learning of data-driven methods for various applications such as B-Rep classification [19] and segmentation [19, 26, 10], parametric surface inference [16, 36], and CAD reconstruction [23, 27] and generation [66]. For the reverse engineering task, a common CAD modeling paradigm uses sketch-extrude [64, 58] as the basic building block, where a sketch [67, 47] is defined as a sequence of parametric curves forming a closed loop.

To address these issues, Point2Cyl [58] is the pioneering work that poses the CAD reverse engineering task as a geometry-aware decomposition problem.
