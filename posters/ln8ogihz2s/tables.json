We ran an additional baseline on pendulum/bouncing ball/monkey reaching datasets. L-SDE achieves results with a similar level of performance as the other models. Listed are the R2 values for decoding angular velocity/x-y position/reach velocity from the latent representations learned for each dataset in both smoothing and prediction regimes.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the performance of several different state-space models (XFADS, DKF, DVBF, SVAE, and L-SDE) on three different datasets: pendulum, bouncing ball, and monkey reaching.  The results are presented as R-squared values (R2) for the model's ability to decode specific features of the system (angular velocity for the pendulum, position for the bouncing ball, and reach velocity for the monkey reaching).  The table shows performance for both smoothing (using the full time series data) and prediction (predicting future data based on a portion of the data).  The goal is to compare the model's ability to learn both the dynamics and the predictive ability of the different models.", "section": "E.7 Collated results"}]
