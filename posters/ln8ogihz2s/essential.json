Current approaches often sacrifice accuracy or model expressiveness to achieve scalability, hindering accurate forecasts and generative modeling. This significantly limits their applications in fields dealing with complex, high-dimensional time-series data, like neuroscience.\nThis paper introduces XFADS, a novel framework that leverages low-rank structured variational autoencoders to address these issues.  XFADS's inference algorithm exploits inherent covariance structures, enabling approximate variational smoothing with linear time complexity in the state dimension.  Empirical results demonstrate its superior predictive capabilities compared to existing deep state-space models across various datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing research in diverse areas dealing with complex temporal data.", "affiliation": "Champalimaud Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Ln8ogihZ2S/podcast.wav"}
