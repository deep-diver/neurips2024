Existing methods, while improving sampling speed, still demand significant resources. This necessitates more efficient training pipelines.  This paper introduces PaGoDA, a novel approach designed to address this challenge.\n\nPaGoDA employs a three-stage pipeline: 1) **pre-training a diffusion model on downsampled data** to drastically reduce training costs; 2) **distilling the pre-trained model into a single-step generator**; and 3) **progressively upscaling the generator** to achieve high resolutions.  The study demonstrates that PaGoDA achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation across various resolutions, significantly reducing training costs compared to existing methods. Furthermore, it shows how this pipeline directly applies to Latent Diffusion Models, offering further possibilities for efficiency.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "h5zYGF68KH/podcast.wav"}
