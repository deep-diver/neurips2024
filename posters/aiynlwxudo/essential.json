This is partly due to their difficulty in tracking digit positions within large numbers.  Existing methods, like reversing digit order or using index hints, have only yielded limited improvements. These approaches can harm generalization and increase the computational burden.\nThis paper proposes a novel solution: Abacus Embeddings. These embeddings encode the relative position of each digit within a number, allowing the model to effectively align digits for arithmetic operations.  The researchers combine these embeddings with architectural modifications, such as input injection and recurrent layers, to achieve significant performance gains.  Their experiments show state-of-the-art generalization on addition problems, achieving 99% accuracy on 100-digit numbers after training on only 20-digit numbers. These improvements also extend to other algorithmic tasks, demonstrating the method's broader applicability.", "affiliation": "University of Maryland", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "aIyNLWXuDO/podcast.wav"}
