Solving arithmetic with next token prediction is a difficult problem that attracts a lot of attention [e.g. Saxton et al., 2019]. However, in zero-shot settings, even incredibly strong commercial API models struggle with very large addition problems (e.g. up to 100 digits) without access to tools. Among attempts to improve arithmetic performance of transformer-based models, reversing the digits so the arguments are written with the least significant digit first is popular [Lee et al., 2023, Shen et al., 2023, Zhou et al., 2023, 2024]. Furthermore, changing the data format by adding explicit index characters improves model capability for addition [Zhou et al., 2023, 2024, Olsson et al., 2022].

Indicating the position of tokens in a sequence to transformer models is critical for language modeling [Vaswani et al., 2017]. Absolute positional embeddings (APE) are learned embeddings that are added to token embeddings before the first layer of the transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017]. However, these absolute embeddings inhibit length generalization [Press et al., 2022]. To address this issue, Shaw et al. [2018] propose relative embeddings (RPE) which are embedded during the attention computation, a mechanism further simplified by Raffel et al. [2020]. Others build on these works to improve length generalization including Sandwich [Chi et al., 2023], Kerple [Chi et al., 2022], and Alibi [Press et al., 2022] positional embeddings. Additionally, Kazemnejad et al. [2023] show that decoder layers can still learn positional information with no explicit positional embeddings. No positional embeddings (NoPE) can achieve good length generalization performance for small algorithmic tasks and even outperform some specialized embeddings. Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) [Su et al., 2024] are commonly used in state-of-the-art open source transformers [e.g. Touvron et al., 2023]. However, RoPE does limit the length generalization as models are trained only using rotations based on training data length [Kazemnejad et al., 2023, Press et al., 2022]. For improved length generalization, one can add post-training extensions [Peng et al., 2024].

For this study all training sets have 20 million samples and $i=j$ , hence we can use one number to define the dataset $i$ , where $i$ is the maximum length of either operand. We sample data with replacement and we stratify the data, so that all length pairs $(i,j)$ are equally sampled during training. To facilitate training of many models from scratch, we use a language model cramming setup [Geiping and Goldstein, 2023] and limit each training run to 8 exaFLOP of compute (a single Nvidia RTXA4000 GPU for 24 hours); for multiplication results we allow 64 exaFLOP (eight Nvidia RTXA4000 GPUs for 24 hours).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
