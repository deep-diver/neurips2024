The y-axis represents the average cost (number of queries) of each algorithm, and the x-axis represents the logarithm of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the predicted distribution ( p\u0302 ) and the true distribution (p).  The plots illustrate how the average cost changes as the accuracy of the predicted distribution varies, showcasing the robustness and efficiency of the proposed Learned BST algorithm compared to other methods. The results demonstrate that the Learned BST algorithm exhibits a smoother degradation in performance as the EMD increases, remaining competitive even when the prediction accuracy is low.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
