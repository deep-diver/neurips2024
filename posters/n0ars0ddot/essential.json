Current model compression techniques often suffer from performance degradation due to misalignment with the true underlying structures in the weight matrices. This paper introduces the Block-Level Adaptive Structured (BLAST) matrix, a flexible approach that learns efficient structures either from data or existing weights.  \n\nBLAST boasts significant advantages over existing methods. It addresses the misalignment issue via flexible structures adaptable to various model types.  Its efficiency stems from optimized matrix multiplication and well-defined gradients allowing easy integration into existing training frameworks. Empirical results show that BLAST successfully boosts performance while substantially reducing the computational complexity and memory footprint of medium-sized and large foundation models across language and vision tasks.", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "n0arS0DDot/podcast.wav"}
