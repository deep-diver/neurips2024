This translates to fewer measurements, reduced error accumulation, and improved training efficiency, showcasing the potential of QDEQs for near-term quantum machine learning.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "CWhwKb0Q4k/podcast.wav"}
