The results are shown for various numbers of generated images (2500, 5000, 7500, 10000) and across five different subsets of the DIS5K dataset (DIS-VD, DIS-TE1, DIS-TE2, DIS-TE3, DIS-TE4).  Higher values for max F1, F, Sa, and E indicate better performance, while lower values for M indicate better performance. The table demonstrates the impact of increasing the number of synthetic data samples on the overall performance of the different methods.
