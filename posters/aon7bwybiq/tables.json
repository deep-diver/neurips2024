For each dataset, it provides the number of nodes (|V|), the number of edges (|E|), the number of classes (|C|), the average degree, and the network density.  The statistics help to characterize the size and structure of each network, which is important for understanding the results of the privacy-preserving graph diffusion experiments.", "section": "D.1 Datasets and Experimental Environment"}]
