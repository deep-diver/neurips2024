Protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature.  Existing methods often use output perturbation, which may not be optimal. This paper addresses the limitations of existing approaches by focusing on edge-level differential privacy using noisy diffusion iterates. \nThe paper proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level differential privacy guarantees using noisy diffusion iterates and a degree-based thresholding function. The privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI) with a novel \u221e-Wasserstein distance tracking method.  The framework is evaluated using Personalized PageRank computation, demonstrating superior performance under stringent privacy conditions compared to existing baselines. The method is shown to be more efficient and has better utility-privacy tradeoffs.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "aon7bwYBiq/podcast.wav"}
