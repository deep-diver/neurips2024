This paper tackles this problem by introducing 'Prospective Learning,' acknowledging the inherent dynamism of real-world data and goals.  The existing theoretical framework, PAC learning, is inadequate for these scenarios as it ignores the temporal dimension. This limitation leads to poor real-world performance in systems that need to adapt to changing data and user needs. \nThe proposed solution, 'Prospective ERM,' addresses this by explicitly incorporating time as a factor. This novel approach allows the algorithm to predict future outcomes more accurately by accounting for the evolving data.  The paper demonstrates the superior performance of Prospective ERM through rigorous experiments on various datasets including synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, confirming that Prospective ERM can learn in conditions where traditional methods fail.", "affiliation": "John Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XEbPJUQzs3/podcast.wav"}
