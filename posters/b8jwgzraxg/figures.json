The input consists of a sequence of generators (\u03c31, \u03c32, etc.), representing a group element. Each generator is passed through a 'Matrix Block,' which learns a matrix representation of that generator. These matrix representations are sequentially multiplied to obtain a matrix representation of the input group element.  Finally, this matrix representation is flattened and fed into a task model (a Multilayer Perceptron or MLP in this case) to predict the order of the group element.", "section": "4.2 MatrixNet"}, {"figure_path": "b8jwgZrAXG/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Length extrapolation results. Left: The plot shows how MSE grows for increasing word lengths (y-axis is truncated for clarity). Right: The plot shows how the average accuracy decays for increasing word lengths. The relatively high accuracy of MatrixNet and MatrixNet-MC compared to baselines suggests that the high MSE is caused by outliers with multiplicity predictions much higher than the ground truth.", "description": "This figure displays the results of a length extrapolation experiment. The left panel shows the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different models as the length of the input sequence increases.  It shows that MatrixNet and MatrixNet-MC have a significant increase in MSE with longer sequences, while MatrixNet-LN and MatrixNet-NL show much more stable performance, even approaching zero MSE. The right panel shows that despite the increased MSE, MatrixNet and MatrixNet-MC maintain relatively high accuracy compared to baselines which suggests their high MSE may be due to outliers in prediction.  Overall, this illustrates the generalization abilities of different model variants.", "section": "5.2 Categorical Braid Action Prediction"}, {"figure_path": "b8jwgZrAXG/figures/figures_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Visualization of learned matrix representations.
