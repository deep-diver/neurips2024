The results demonstrate that MatrixNet achieves superior performance, particularly MatrixNet-Nonlinear and MatrixNet-MC,  with near-perfect accuracy and significantly lower loss compared to the baselines.", "section": "5.1 Order Prediction in Finite Groups"}, {"figure_path": "b8jwgZrAXG/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: MatrixNet performance on finite group order prediction", "description": "This table presents the results of applying MatrixNet to order prediction tasks on various finite groups.  It shows the group used (including its order |G|), the size of the learned matrix representation used, the number of classes in the prediction task (which varies based on the possible orders in the group), the cross-entropy loss (CE Loss), and the accuracy (Acc).
