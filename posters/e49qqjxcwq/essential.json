Existing methods often fall short due to their reliance on instance-level analysis and global alignment between cross-modalities, overlooking critical person-specific information like fine-grained attributes and identities.\nTo overcome these limitations, this paper introduces PLIP, a novel language-image pre-training framework designed for person representation learning.  It incorporates three carefully designed pretext tasks: Text-guided Image Colorization, Image-guided Attributes Prediction, and Identity-based Vision-Language Contrast.  These tasks effectively capture fine-grained attributes, identities, and cross-modal relationships, resulting in more accurate and discriminative representations.  Furthermore, the paper introduces SYNTH-PEDES, a large-scale synthetic dataset to support the pre-training.  The results show that PLIP significantly outperforms existing methods in various person-centric tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot and domain generalization capabilities.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Multispectral Information Intelligent Processing Technology, School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "e49QqJxCwq/podcast.wav"}
