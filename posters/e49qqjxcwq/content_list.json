For example, CAE [14] presents a novel masked image modeling approach and shows the benefit to representation learning through an encoderregressor-decoder architecture. Besides to pre-training on unlabeled image data, there is currently a popular trend of attempting to establish the relationship between vision and language to learn more discriminative representations. For example, CLIP [72] and ALIGN [40] perform cross-modal contrastive learning on hundreds or thousands of millions of image-text pairs crawled from the web and can directly perform open-vocabulary image classification.

Before long, LUP-NL [30] develop a large-scale pre-training framework utilizing noisy labels, and demonstrate that learning directly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which utilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. This simple pre-training task provides a scalable way to learn good Re-ID representations from scratch without bells and whistles. Also, PASS [124] is proposed to use several learnable tokens to extract part-level features offering fine-grained information. It helps the ViTs set good performance on several person Re-ID datasets.

Ensuring the gender consistency of an id plays a role in promoting the stability of the model training.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
