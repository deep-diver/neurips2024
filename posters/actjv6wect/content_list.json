Their work has been revisited by Micha and Shah [2] for specific metric spaces. More recently, Aziz et al.

In an effort to answer the latter question, in Appendix C.1 we show that the core is always non-empty for the maximum loss when the metric space is 1-dimensional (i.e., a line).

Another intriguing question is whether we can choose the number of clusters $k$ intrinsically; this seems challenging as proportional fairness guarantees seem to depend on fixing $k$ in advance to define which coalitions can deviate. Lastly, while classical algorithms such as $k$ -means and $k$ -centers are incompatible with the core and FJR in the worst case (see Appendix E), it is interesting to explore conditions under which they may be more compatible, and whether a fair clustering can be computed efficiently in such cases.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
