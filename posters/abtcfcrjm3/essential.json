Layer factorization, which represents weight tensors as products of smaller rank matrices, is a promising approach to address this issue. However, existing methods suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to initialization and the need for prior knowledge of rank. This often requires a warm-up phase with a full-model, adding to the computational burden. \nThis paper introduces a novel method, called Geometry-aware training in Tucker format (TDLRT), to tackle these challenges. **TDLRT trains the factors of a Tucker decomposition of weight tensors**, dynamically adapting the rank of each mode during training. **The algorithm guarantees optimal local approximation, convergence, and approximation to the original unfactorized dynamics**. Extensive experiments show TDLRT achieves remarkable training compression rates and comparable or better performance than full baseline and alternative methods.", "affiliation": "Gran Sasso Science Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aBtcfcrjM3/podcast.wav"}
