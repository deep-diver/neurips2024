The algorithms are ADDITIVE-PEGGING, MULTIPLICATIVE-PEGGING, LEARNED-DYNKIN, DYNKIN, and HIGHEST-PREDICTION.  The plot shows two key metrics: competitive ratio (the ratio of the expected value accepted by the algorithm to the maximum possible value) and fairness (the probability of accepting the best candidate). It demonstrates how each algorithm's performance is affected by the accuracy of the predictions and the nature of the input data.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
