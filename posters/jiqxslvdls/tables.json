For various dimensions (dx = dy), 11 MI estimates were generated, comparing estimates against ground truth values ranging from 0 to 10. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is shown for each dimension, indicating the accuracy of the estimator.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "JiQXsLvDls/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: The NN architectures used to conduct the tests in Section 5.", "description": "This table presents the architectures of neural networks used for the experiments in Section 5 of the paper.
