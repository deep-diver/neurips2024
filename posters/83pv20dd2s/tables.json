It compares the performance of both models across various metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for both gray and color images, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for gray and color images, Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), and CLIP score.  The higher PSNR and SSIM values indicate better image quality, while a lower FID indicates better semantic similarity and a higher CLIP score represents better visual quality.  The table also shows the winning rates for fidelity and aesthetics in subjective evaluations.", "section": "4 Experiments and Results"}]
