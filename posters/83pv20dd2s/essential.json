The human brain, however, naturally associates visual attributes without explicit supervision, inspiring this research.  The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing more brain-like AI systems.\nThe proposed SCG framework introduces a modular autoencoder with an equivariance constraint to enable spontaneous functional specialization, mimicking the brain's modularity.  This, combined with a self-supervised pattern completion training approach, enables zero-shot generalization and superior performance in high-noise scenarios compared to existing supervised methods.  **The results demonstrate the successful emergence of associative generation capabilities without external supervision, offering a promising direction for building more robust and scalable AI models.**", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "83pV20DD2s/podcast.wav"}
