Existing methods often compromise accuracy or require extra training.  This issue hinders applications in image editing and other downstream tasks. \nThe paper introduces BELM, a new framework for exact inversion.  It systematically analyzes existing samplers, reveals their suboptimal designs, and proposes O-BELM, an optimal version that minimizes error. O-BELM demonstrates mathematically exact inversion without extra training, achieving superior sampling quality.  It also offers theoretical guarantees for stability and convergence.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "ccQ4fmwLDb/podcast.wav"}
