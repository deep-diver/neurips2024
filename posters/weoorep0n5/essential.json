This has raised concerns about the environmental and financial costs associated with training and deploying such models.  This research aims to address these issues by focusing on energy efficiency. \nThe proposed method, called Data Adaptive Pathway Discovery (DAPD), aims to identify and train smaller, more efficient sub-networks within a larger neural network, effectively creating \"neural pathways\". The researchers evaluate DAPD on several continuous control tasks, demonstrating that these small pathways can achieve performance comparable to much larger models using less than 5% of the parameters.  They showcase this in both online and offline settings and also successfully demonstrate training multiple pathways within the same network for solving multiple tasks concurrently.  This significantly reduces the energy consumed during training and inference.
