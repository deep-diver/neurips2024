In the source population (a), we have variables Xs, Vs, and Ys, with ZS as a confounder affecting both Xs and Vs, while Vs affects Ys. In the target population (b), similar variables XT, VT, and YT are presented. The key difference is that the distribution of (X, Z, V) may change between the two populations. This change could affect the relationship between Y and X, especially when conditioning on Z and V. The DAGs highlight how covariate shift might lead to different conditional independence conclusions between the two populations.  Even if Y and X are conditionally independent given Z and V in one population, this might not hold true in the other population.", "section": "2 Problem Setup"}, {"figure_path": "Me5esZTRqW/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison of Type-I error control across three methods.", "description": "This figure compares the Type-I error rate of three methods: csPCR, csPCR(pe), and IS.
