The study varied \u03c4 across three values (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) and measured the impact on three evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. The results show that the performance is relatively consistent across the different values of \u03c4, indicating that the method is not highly sensitive to the choice of this parameter.", "section": "4.5 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "ja20BpFAPa/tables/tables_16_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Evaluation of novel view synthesis on BDD100K and DCVR.
