However, understanding their generalization behavior requires analyzing their uniform stability.  Existing works focused on upper bounds, leaving the tightness unclear, which hinders algorithm design and analysis. This research specifically addresses this problem by investigating the stability of these algorithms.\nThis paper introduces lower-bounded expansion properties to characterize the instability in update rules of iterative algorithms. Using these properties, the authors establish stability lower bounds for UD-based and IFT-based algorithms, with a **tight lower bound for UD-based algorithm** and **meaningful lower bounds for the IFT-based algorithm**.
