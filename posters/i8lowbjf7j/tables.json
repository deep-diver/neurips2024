The models were trained using 10,000 sample image patches from the DIV2K dataset. The performance is evaluated using two metrics, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), across three different benchmark datasets (McM, Kodak, and Urban100).  The table includes both the number of parameters in each model and the PSNR and SSIM scores for each dataset.  The results showcase the performance of the proposed graph-based models (uGLR and uGTV) in comparison to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (MAIN and SwinIR-lightweight) and traditional methods (bicubic).", "section": "6.2 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "i8LoWBJf7j/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Demosaicking performance for different models, trained on 10k sample dataset.", "description": "This table presents the performance comparison of various demosaicking methods, including the proposed uGLR and uGTV models, against existing state-of-the-art methods such as RST-B and RST-S, Menon, Malvar, and bilinear interpolation.  The comparison is based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) metrics across three benchmark datasets (McM, Kodak, and Urban100). All models were trained on 10,000 64x64 image patches from the DIV2K dataset. The table highlights the performance gains of the proposed models in terms of both PSNR and SSIM values, especially when compared to models with significantly more parameters.", "section": "6.2 Experimental Results"}]
