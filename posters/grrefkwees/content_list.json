Most prior approaches rely on multiple images or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation.

Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3Dto-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics.

This strategy is time-consuming and computationally inefficient due to the heavy supervision back-propagation, limiting its widespread applicability. [51, 54] explored video-conditioned 4D generation and utilized 3D-aware image diffusion models to acquire pseudo multi-view data for photometric supervision. Yet the issue of slow optimization speed persists. $\\pmb{\\varphi}$ Another primary challenge in 4D synthesis is to guarantee 4D geometry consistency, which can be decomposed into two components: spatial consistency and temporal consistency. As illustrated in Fig. 1, spatial consistency implies that the object maintains consistent 3D geometry at each distinct timestamp, while temporal consistency indicates that the object\u2019s appearance and movement exhibit coherence and smoothness across timestamps. These two components have been thoroughly explored separately in static multi-view 3D synthesis [19, 39, 34] and monocular video generation [3, 35, 4]. Multi-view 3D diffusion models possess robust knowledge of geometrical consistency, whereas video diffusion models encapsulate temporal appearance coherence and smooth motion priors. Recent approaches [27, 49] tried combining these two generative models to enhance efficiency and consistency in 4D generation. However, their underlying assumption of spatial-temporal conditional independence, the utilization of multi-model supervision, or inference at distinct timestamps inherently leads to 4D geometry inconsistencies. This raises the question: can we integrate spatial and temporal consistency into a single network, and obtain multi-timestamp cross-view supervision in one shot? Inspired by recent works in static 3D generation [41, 58] that repurposed temporal consistency in video generation to spatial consistency in 3D generation, we design a strategy that achieves spatial-temporal 4D consistency with a singular 4D-aware video diffusion model.

There are many works dedicated to this task.

Consistent4D [16] leverages the object-level 3D-aware image diffusion model for the primary supervision and proposes cascade DyNeRF to facilitate stable training. More recent work STAG4D [54] uses a multi-view diffusion model to initialize multi-view images anchored on input video frames and introduces a fusion strategy to improve the temporal consistency.

We curate a large-scale, high-quality dynamic 3D dataset sourced from the vast 3D data corpus of Objaverse-1.0 [10] and Objaverse-XL [9]. Since the original Objaverse dataset primarily consists of static 3D assets and many of them are of low quality (e.g., partial scans, missing textures) [38], we applied a series of empirical rules to fliter the dataset. The curation process includes an initial selection with dynamic label, removal of assets with subtle or overly dramatic motion, and out-of-boundary detection. In the initial step, we select 3D assets labeled as \"dynamic\". However, upon closer examination, we observe that many assets exhibit subtle or imperceptible movement, limiting their utility in learning dynamic properties in the proposed task. To mitigate this problem, we employ Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the assets. Specifically, for each 4D asset, we fix the camera pose at the front view and render three images at three distinct timestamps $(\\tau_{0},\\tau_{T/4}$ , and $\\tau_{T/2},$ ), then compute two SSIM scores between them. Assets with both SSIM scores higher than a predetermined threshold $s_{h i g h}\\,=\\,0.95$ , suggesting high resemblance and little movement, are discarded. We also observe that many samples exhibit significant geometric distortion or drastic appearance changes over time. Therefore, we empirically set an SSIM score of small value $s_{l o w}=0.4$ as the lower bound to filter out cases of poor quality. Subsequently, for each remaining 4D asset, we render $T=24$ multi-view images following the camera pose trajectory and timeline settings as we defined in Sec. 3.1. In the final step, we handle cases where assets exhibit over-dramatic movements that extend out of the boundaries of the scene. We employ alpha maps to identify and remove such cases and ensure that only appropriately positioned dynamic assets are included in the curated dataset, enhancing the overall quality and coherence of the generated content. Finally, we also conduct a manual inspection over Objaverse-1.0 [10] to remove low-quality cases that do not make sense semantically.

In each case, depending on the condition modality, the text description or front-view image serves as the reference. For the diffusion generation, we use all 24 images in orbital videos as targets, and for 4D construction, we uniformly render 36 orbital views from constructed 4D assets as targets (CLIP-O). We also measure using only front-view images as targets(CLIP-F). To evaluate the appearance and texture quality and the spatial-temporal consistency of the synthesized images, we also use the following metrics, i.e. LPIPS [55], PSNR, SSIM [45], and FVD [40], to help assess image- and static 3D content-conditioned generation. For these evaluations, we use ground truth images rendered from the dynamic 3D assets as references. Images generated by the diffusion model or rendered from constructed 4D assets are used as targets. Metrics are computed between ground truth images and synthesized images from the same camera pose. The same procedure is applied to calculate the scores for baseline methods. We also conduct qualitative comparisons through a user study involving 30 human evaluators from diverse backgrounds. Participants are asked to specify their preference for rendered orbital videos around 4D assets based on four properties, following the approach in [1]: 3D geometry consistency (3DC), appearance quality(AQ), motion fidelity(MF), and text alignment(TA).

First, we use a video size of $24\\times256\\times256.$ While this resolution provides a good balance between quality and computational feasibility, higher resolution and longer temporal sequences could further enhance the detail and realism of 4D content generation. Image resolution could be improved using off-the-shelf super-resolution models. Second, though we curated a substantial amount of high-quality data, the dataset still lacks diversity. The asset textures are simple, with actions restricted to basic movements such as walking, jumping, and stretching arms. Although there is a large number of characters, each character appears only a few times, performing a limited range of actions. Last, in the 4D reconstruction stage, the performance is subject to the capacity of off-the-shelf 4D construction pipelines. In our settings, we empirically find that both of the chosen 4D construction pipelines work well in constructing consistent 4D assets from orbital views. Comparatively, SC-GS performs better than 4DGS from more novel views. Due to the limited views for supervision, the constructed 4D assets may meet floaters and blurry problems when the objects have large motions. In future research, we will try to expand the diversity and quality of the dynamic 3D dataset. We will focus on exploring 4D reconstruction to improve the model\u2019s ability to interpret and leverage orbital-view supervisions, which will be beneficial for generating 4D assets with better consistency across novel views.

Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we developed a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. We incorporate 3D-to-4D motion magnitude guidance and the motion magnitude reconstruction loss to enhance the dynamics learning and control. 3D-aware classifier-free guidance is introduced to further augment the dynamic strength. We fulfill explicit 4D construction with a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.

DreamGaussian4D [30] adopts the deformable 3D Gaussian as 4D representations. 4DGen [51] proposes a novel pipeline where they utilize spatial-temporal pseudo labels into anchor frames with a multi-view diffusion model. Another line of work predicts dynamic objects from single-view videos. Consistent4D [16] leverages the object-level 3D-aware image diffusion model as the primary supervision signal for training Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields, and proposing cascade DyNeRF to facilitate stable training. More recent work STAG4D [54] utilizes a multi-view diffusion model to initialize multi-view images anchoring on the input video frames and introduce a fusion strategy to ensure temporal consistency. Efficient4D [27] generates multi-frame multi-view captures of dynamic 3D objects through SyncDreamer-T and reconstructs 4D representations with them.
