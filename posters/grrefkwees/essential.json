Most approaches rely on multiple images or video diffusion models, leading to suboptimal results.  Additionally, achieving spatial-temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been a significant hurdle. Existing methods often struggle to maintain consistent 3D geometry across different timestamps while simultaneously generating smooth and realistic motions.\n\nThis paper introduces Diffusion4D, which tackles these challenges head-on.  **It leverages a novel 4D-aware video diffusion model trained on a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset to synthesize orbital views of dynamic 3D assets.** This model incorporates a novel 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric and a motion magnitude reconstruction loss to refine motion dynamics.  **Furthermore, a 3D-aware classifier-free guidance is introduced to further improve the dynamic fidelity of the generated assets.** Finally, explicit 4D construction is performed via Gaussian splatting for better efficiency and consistency, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "grrefkWEES/podcast.wav"}
