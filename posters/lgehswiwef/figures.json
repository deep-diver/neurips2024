Panel (a) shows the Multiple Structure Motif Alignment (MSMA) process, which involves extracting local structure motifs from a protein structure using ESM-IF, storing them in a database (SMEDB), and retrieving similar motifs using CUHNSW. Panel (b) shows the MSM-Mut model architecture, which incorporates the retrieved motifs to predict mutation effects using a Multi-Structure Motif Invariant Point Attention (MSM-IPA) module.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "LgeHswiWef/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: CUHNSW combined with embeddings from ESM-IF successfully retrieved motifs with large matched regions, and possibly motifs distant in sequence identity, where matched residues are defined by the indicator function in Eq. (1). Moreover, lower TM-Score is obtained for motifs with high number of locally matched residues, indicating that our search approach can extract analogous local structures motif from structurally unrelated proteins.", "description": "This figure shows two plots. The left plot is a histogram showing the distribution of the number of matched motifs of different sizes retrieved by the CUHNSW algorithm combined with ESM-IF embeddings.  The right plot shows the relationship between TM-score (a measure of structural similarity) and the number of matched motifs. The plots demonstrate that the method effectively retrieves local structural motifs even from structurally unrelated proteins, highlighting the capability of the approach to capture analogous local structural information.", "section": "3.1 Multiple Structure Motif Alignment"}, {"figure_path": "LgeHswiWef/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: A diagram illustrating a set of highly similar local antibody structures obtained through Multiple Structure Motif Alignment.

It shows two sets of highly similar local antibody structures that were retrieved using the method.  The structures, despite being from different proteins (5KOV and 7FAE), share highly similar local micro-environments around the central amino acid. This highlights the ability of the MSMA to find structurally similar regions even when the overall global sequence/structure similarity is low.  The similarity in local structure motifs supports the model's approach to leveraging these local features for accurate mutation effect prediction.", "section": "3.1 Multiple Structure Motif Alignment"}]
