A DNA sequence (ATGTCCGC) is given as input. The editor identifies positions (2nd and 7th base) that need modification to improve the desired property. The algorithm edits these positions (changing T to C and C to A, respectively) resulting in a new sequence (ACGTCCAC) with an improved property.", "section": "3 Preliminaries and Problem Statement"}, {"figure_path": "g0G8DQSBcj/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Property improvement of AMP (left) and CRE (right) with respect to edit percentage.
