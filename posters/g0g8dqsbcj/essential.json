However, existing methods often struggle to optimize biological properties while keeping the number of edits minimal. This is problematic because too many edits can reduce predictability and potentially compromise safety.  Current generative models, though promising, typically generate entirely new sequences from scratch, which also poses safety and predictability concerns.\nThis research addresses these issues by introducing GFNSeqEditor, a new algorithm that leverages generative flow networks. **GFNSeqEditor** first identifies suboptimal elements within a seed sequence that negatively impact the desired property.  It then uses a learned policy to make edits at these locations, generating multiple diverse options.  **The number of edits can be carefully controlled** through hyperparameters. Extensive experiments show GFNSeqEditor outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and tasks, improving the desired biological property with fewer changes.", "affiliation": "UC Irvine", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "g0G8DQSBcj/podcast.wav"}
