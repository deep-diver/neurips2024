Existing approximate GP methods often result in overly smooth estimations, hindering BO's performance, especially with limited online samples.  Many existing methods focus on problems with large online samples in low dimensions. \nThis paper introduces FOCALBO, a hierarchical BO algorithm that uses a novel focalized GP.  **Focalized GP improves local prediction accuracy by strategically allocating representational power to relevant search space regions**. FOCALBO iteratively optimizes acquisition functions over progressively smaller search spaces, efficiently utilizing large offline and online datasets. Experiments show FOCALBO outperforms existing methods on robot morphology design and high-dimensional musculoskeletal system control, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling real-world, large-scale optimization problems.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "OF0YsxoRai/podcast.wav"}
