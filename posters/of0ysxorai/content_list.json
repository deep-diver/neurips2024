The efficacy of BO is attributed to its ability to model the unknown objective function using a surrogate model and to strategically select the next sample position by optimizing an acquisition function. Among the surrogate models, Gaussian Processes (GPs)[5] are usually favored due to their flexibility and robust uncertainty quantification. However, the computation of the posterior GP covariance matrix scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$ with the number of data points $n$ , which can severely restrict the applicability of BO in handling large datasets. This poses a significant challenge for real-world applications with high-dimensional and heterogeneous function landscapes such as those in robot control, which often necessitate a substantial amount of data to adequately explore the vast search space. To extend the scope of BO to accommodate larger datasets (from long-horizon online trials and/or pre-collected offline datasets[6]), it is imperative to employ surrogate models that offer enhanced computational efficiency.

Given limited representational resources, the resulting posterior is likely to be overly smooth, which may negatively impact the performance of BO. This issue is exacerbated in the high-dimensional setting, in which accurately fitting the entire domain is a far more challenging task. As such, several works have proposed strategies to improve BO performance with sparse GP models by focusing promising regions[10, 11] or advanced sparse GP models[12].

Under the large offline-to-online optimization setting, FocalBO achieves stable high-dimensional control of human musculoskeletal model with over 500 parameters. Ablation studies over the algorithm components further verify the principled design of FocalBO.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
