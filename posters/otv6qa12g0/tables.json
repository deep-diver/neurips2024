The experiment compares the performance of two models: a baseline linear classifier trained using CLIP image embeddings (Vanilla) and a concept bottleneck model (CBM). The table shows the accuracy of each model, reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.  The CBM's improved performance demonstrates the benefits of using concept embeddings for enhancing the robustness of models against distribution shifts.", "section": "D.2 Out-of-Distribution Generalization on CINIC-10"}]
