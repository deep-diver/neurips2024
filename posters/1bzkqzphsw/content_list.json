Large language models (LLMs), utilizing transformer architectures, have shown remarkable proficiency in advanced language generation tasks Vaswani et al. [2017], Radford et al. [2019], Brown et al. [2020], Devlin et al. [2018], Bubeck et al. [2023]. Despite their inherent capabilities, optimizing these models for specific downstream tasks necessitates additional strategies. One approach involves adapting the language model training to be multi-task oriented, as exemplified by the T5 family of instruction-tuned models Raffel et al. [2020]. Alternatively, aligning these models with downstream task data through specialized techniques can be effective. Specialized techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Lewis et al. [2020], Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Howard and Ruder [2018], and Fine-Tuning via Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) Christiano et al. [2017], Ziegler et al. [2019], Stiennon et al. [2020], Ouyang et al. [2022] or AI Feedback (RLAIF) Lee et al. [2023] represent pivotal methods for enhancing downstream task performance in large language models. Each technique offers a unique approach to optimizing model proficiency: RAG integrates external knowledge sources during generation knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering, SFT adapts models to specific tasks through targeted training, and RLHF/RLAIF employs feedback-driven learning for iterative improvement. Among these, RLHF has shown notable success in aligning LLMs with human preferences, making it a focal point of study in this paper.

Consequently, unaligned versions of LLMs have been documented to generate harmful content, as evidenced by recent studies Sheng et al. [2019], Wallace et al. [2019] which highlight the risks associated with uncurated training data. Furthermore, even aligned versions of LLMs are not immune to exploitation. The aligned models can still be prompted or \u2018red-teamed\u2019 to produce harmful content under certain conditions Gehman et al. [2020], Weidinger et al. [2021], Ganguli et al. [2022], Deshpande et al. [2023]. This underscores the complexity of mitigating risks in LLM deployment and the necessity for robust, ethical alignment strategies. Algorithmically including safety in LLM generations is a budding area of research. Bai et al. [2022a] demonstrated producing helpful and harmless content by doing RLHF with preference model trained on a mixture of helpful and harmless data. Solaiman and Dennison [2021] introduced PALMS, a method to iteratively finetune an LLM using a dataset that reflects a predetermined set of target values. The authors show that LLM behaviour can be significantly adjusted by finetuning on a small curated dataset. DExperts Liu et al. [2021] utilizes \"expert\" and \"anti-expert\" language models (LMs) to guide the generation process. There\u2019s also the challenge of ensuring that the \"expert\" and \"anti-expert\" models are well-balanced, as any imbalance could lead to biased or skewed text generation. Moreover, there may be limitations in the granularity of control, particularly in nuanced or complex scenarios where the desired attributes of the text are not clearly defined or are subjective. The work by Liang et al. [2021] introduces Autoregressive INLP (A-INLP), for post-hoc debiasing of large pretrained language models. This method dynamically identifies bias-sensitive tokens and effectively mitigates bias while preserving contextual information in text generation. While it effectively mitigates bias in language models, the approach may not entirely eliminate biases. Furthermore, it focuses on biases identifiable through token-level interventions, which may not cover all types of biases. The paper also highlights the challenge of balancing bias mitigation with the retention of useful information in the model, indicating a potential trade-off between debiasing and model performance. Safe-RLHF Dai et al. [2023] balance helpfulness and harmlessness in AI responses by decoupling these aspects during training. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Risk Averseness in RL. In the RL community, risk averseness to ensure safe policy execution has been studied using various risk criteria.

CeSOR integrates two innovative concepts: a soft risk scheduling mechanism to navigate the local-optimum challenges inherent in conventional risk-averse RL methods, and a cross-entropy module for enhanced sampling efficiency that still retains risk aversion. This approach allows for sampling episodes under poor conditions, and optimizing for successful strategies.

To ensure a broad spectrum of toxicity within the prompts, 25, 000 sentences were sampled from four toxicity ranges, each covering a quarter of the toxicity spectrum (i.e., [0, .25), [.25, .50), [.50, .75), and [.75, 1]), culminating in a total of 100, 000 sentences.

Yes, in reinforcement learning (RL), \u201crisk\u201d can mean both variability of costs and sensitivity to modeling errors, and the potential for rare but highly undesirable outcomes or tail events Greenberg et al.

These tail events represent rare but potentially highly impactful negative outcomes that an RL system seeks to avoid.

Importantly, this increase in perplexity does not compromise model performance; in fact, the perplexity scores for Jigsaw-Gen remain lower than those recorded for the GPT-2 model, underscoring RA-RLHF\u2019s superior performance in avoiding harmful outputs while maintaining effectiveness in generative tasks.

Our research introduces a nuanced perspective on inducing safety in large language model (LLM) outputs, even encompassing characterization of safety through dual-axis approach of assessing helpfulness and harmlessness independently Bai et al. [2022a], Ganguli et al. [2022]. The work by Bai et al. [2022a] introduces the concepts of helpfulness and harmlessness, noting best performance tradeoff on LLMs that were RLHFed with preference models (PM) trained on the combined HH dataset (see Fig. 1 in Bai et al. [2022a]). They mention \u201cfortunately, we find that PMs trained on a mixture of both datasets can nevertheless learn the right lessons and behave helpfully when appropriate, while encouraging the polite refusal of harmful requests\u201d. In both Bai et al. [2022a], Ganguli et al. [2022], characterization of safety is done through a single reward/preference model, as is the case in our work. We, in fact, demonstrate in our work how the RLHF finetuning process can be made risk-averse using risk averse principles, algorithmically going beyond what is established in Bai et al. [2022a], Ganguli et al. [2022]. ", "page_idx": 33}, {"type": "text", "text": "More recently, the work by Dai et al. [2023] introduces Safe-RLHF requiring separate models to evaluate the helpfulness and harmlessness of responses. This dual-model framework adds complexity to the safety induction process, necessitating the management of two distinct assessment criteria. In contrast, as mentioned above, we work with a single reward model. This singular reward-based framework is particularly advantageous when the reward model is tuned to accurately reflect safety considerations specific to the task at hand. Under such circumstances, RA-RLHF can effectively navigate the safety landscape, ensuring that LLM generations meet the desired standards without the need for dual evaluations. This consolidation into a single reward model offers a more efficient and potentially more effective mechanism for achieving safe and reliable LLM outputs across broader applications.
