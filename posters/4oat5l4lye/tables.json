The passkey is inserted at different depths within the text (0% to 95%) to simulate long-range dependency scenarios.  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARKVALE in maintaining high accuracy even with limited cache budgets and long context lengths, unlike the other models which show significant accuracy drops.", "section": "6.4 Passkey Retrieval Results"}]
