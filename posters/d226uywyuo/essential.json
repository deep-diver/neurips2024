Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models are effective but prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing regularization methods focus on minimizing embedding norms, which is insufficient. \nThis paper introduces a novel regularization technique, Intermediate Variables Regularization (IVR). IVR minimizes the norms of intermediate variables during tensor computation.  The authors provide theoretical analysis proving IVR's effectiveness in reducing overfitting by promoting low trace norm of the predicted tensor.  Experiments demonstrate IVR's superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple datasets.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "d226uyWYUo/podcast.wav"}
