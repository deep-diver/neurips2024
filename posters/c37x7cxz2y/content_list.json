Since the treatments of interest often cannot be directly randomized, observational data is leveraged to learn CATEs, but this approach can incur significant bias from unobserved confounding. One strategy to overcome these limitations is to leverage instrumental variables (IVs) as latent quasi-experiments, such as randomized intent-to-treat assignments or randomized product recommendations. This approach, on the other hand, can suffer from low compliance, i.e., IV weakness. Some subgroups may even exhibit zero compliance, meaning we cannot instrument for their CATEs at all. In this paper we develop a novel approach to combine IV and observational data to enable reliable CATE estimation in the presence of unobserved confounding in the observational data and low compliance in the IV data, including no compliance for some subgroups. We propose a two-stage framework that first learns biased CATEs from the observational data, and then applies a compliance-weighted correction using IV data, effectively leveraging IV strength variability across covariates. We characterize the convergence rates of our method and validate its effectiveness through a simulation study. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility with real data by analyzing the heterogeneous effects of 401(k) plan participation on wealth.

This field has seen adaptations of a wide range of machine learning techniques, from random forests [39, 51] and Bayesian algorithms e.g. [20, 24] to deep learning [5, 27, 48] and blackbox metalearners [33, 38] that utilize efficient influence functions [14, 31] and Neyman orthogonality [12, 16]. Despite these advancements, a significant challenge remains as these methods typically assume the absence of confounding in observational data (ignorability) \u2013 an often unrealistic and unverifiable assumption \u2013 limiting their real-world applicability. Without ignorability, point identification of effects is impossible, although some studies propose methods to construct bounds on treatment effect estimates under assumptions about the structure of unobserved confounding [17, 28, 40, 45]. Nonetheless, these bounds often have limited practical utility. Other efforts to address confounding bias in CATE estimation rely on latent variable models to recover unobserved confounders from noisy proxies [34, 36] or utilize multiple or sequential treatments [9, 22, 53]. However, these methods also have limited practical impact, as they depend on either the availability of additional accurate proxy data or unverifiable assumptions such as no unobserved single-cause confounders. ", "page_idx": 13}, {"type": "text", "text": "Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation using IVs: Machine learning techniques have recently been integrated with instrumental variable methods, offering significant advantages over traditional approaches, including the flexible estimation of CATEs. [49] and [54] expand on two-stage least squares (2SLS) to incorporate complex feature mappings via kernel methods and deep learning. In the same vein, [21] introduced a two-stage neural network for conditional density estimation, while [8] applied moment conditions for IV estimation. [50] propose novel IV estimators that exhibit Neyman orthogonality. However, these techniques rely on the assumption that instruments are relevant across all covariate groups, a condition that is not consistently met with weak instruments. ", "page_idx": 13}, {"type": "text", "text": "Treatment effect estimation with weak instruments: Weak instruments compromise the reliability of traditional IV methods like 2SLS, often producing biased, high-variance estimates and undermining causal claims. To mitigate these issues, several approaches have been developed, including bias-adjusted 2SLS estimators, limited information maximum likelihood (LIML), and jackknife instrumental variable (JIVE) estimators (see [25] and references therein). Recent methods reduce 2SLS estimator variance by exploiting first-stage heterogeneity (variation in compliance) through a weighting scheme, as detailed in [1, 13, 32]. However, these methods do not extend to estimating conditional average treatment effects. Another strand of research focuses on combining multiple weak instruments into a robust composite, showing promise in genetic studies using Mendelian randomization ([30, 35]). These approaches require access to multiple weak instruments for the same treatment. Our work aligns most closely with [1, 13, 32] in that we leverage compliance heterogeneity and employ compliance weighting to merge IV studies with observational data for efficient confounding bias estimation. Unlike these studies, however, our approach distinctively estimates heterogeneous effects and leverages additional observational data to address challenges posed by weak instruments. ", "page_idx": 13}, {"type": "text", "text": "Combining observational and randomized data: There has been a proliferation of research in combining observational datasets with randomized control trials \u2013 experimental data with perfect compliance \u2013 to mitigate bias from observational studies. One of the strategies is to impose structural assumptions such as strong parametric assumptions for the confounding bias [29] or a shared structure between the biased and unbiased CATE functions that can be estimated from the two datasets [23]. Other studies advocate for dual estimators from both data types, optimizing bias correction through a weighted average [10, 46, 55]. Additionally, approaches like those by [6] and [26] leverage outcomes from different time-steps, such as short-term and long-term effects, to enhance estimation accuracy. Our work is closest to [29] and [23]. However, our study faces additional complexities: firstly, the CATE estimation techniques differ between the datasets, requiring us to debias the overall effect function rather than just individual outcome functions. Secondly, RCTs may not represent the target population due to their narrow scope, our instrumental variable (IV) study faces representation issues due to minimal or absent compliance in strata that are not known a priori. Thirdly, the CATE estimation in our IV study uses a ratio estimator, which is highly sensitive to changes in the compliance denominator, adding a layer of complexity to our analysis.
