One-shot FL, which involves a single round of communication, is attractive for its efficiency and privacy but struggles with non-identical data distributions across clients, impacting model accuracy.  This paper's key challenge is to solve the one-shot FL in non-IID data effectively. \nThe proposed method, FedLPA, addresses this by inferring the statistical properties of each layer in each local model, using a layer-wise Laplace approximation to obtain the posterior.  Instead of directly averaging model parameters, FedLPA aggregates these layer-wise posteriors to obtain a more accurate global model.  The results across various datasets show that FedLPA significantly outperforms existing one-shot FL methods.  This improvement is attributed to FedLPA's ability to effectively handle data heterogeneity without compromising privacy or communication efficiency.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "I3IuclVLFZ/podcast.wav"}
