The figure shows sample trajectories for different values of the step size \u03b1.

Also it shows that using only the second half of the trajectory further improves convergence for small step sizes.", "section": "A Additional numerical results"}, {"figure_path": "RxXdokK2qz/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5.

The figure illustrates how the bias and variance of these estimators change as the step-size \u03b1 decreases.
