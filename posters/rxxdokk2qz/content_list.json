This framework has been extended by a series of papers for applications in reinforcement learning, see for instance [11, 15, 29, 26], still in the decreasing step-size case, with the goal of understanding the fluctuations of the algorithm around the equilibrium.

Our model can be viewed as a discrete-time version of the recent paper [1]. Some of our results (like our Theorem 1) are analogous to the results of [1] but others (like Theorem 2) are different and require time-averaging, mostly because of the possible periodicity of the discrete-time Markov chains.
