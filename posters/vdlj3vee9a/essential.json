This paper focuses on the space complexity of efficiently approximating this loss, a problem addressed by using coresets \u2013 smaller data subsets that approximate the original data. Prior work showed that coresets' sizes depend on a complexity measure called \u03bcy(X), but it remained unclear whether this dependence was inherent or an artifact of specific coreset methods.  Existing coresets were also considered optimal without rigorous justification. \nThis work addresses these issues by establishing lower bounds on the space complexity needed to approximate logistic loss up to a relative error. They prove that for datasets with a constant \u03bcy(X) value, current coreset constructions are indeed near-optimal.  Furthermore, they disprove previous conjectures by showing that \u03bcy(X) can be computed efficiently via linear programming.  Finally, they analyze the use of low-rank approximations to achieve additive error guarantees in estimating the logistic loss.  Overall, their findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental limits of approximating logistic loss and guide the design of future space-efficient algorithms.", "affiliation": "LinkedIn Corporation", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "vDlj3veE9a/podcast.wav"}
