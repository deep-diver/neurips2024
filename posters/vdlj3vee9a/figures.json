The results clearly show that the upper and lower bounds can be very loose compared to our exact calculation of the complexity measure \u03bcy(X) for each value of n'.", "description": "This figure compares the exact computation of the classification complexity measure \u03bcy(X) using the full dataset and sketched datasets of varying sizes against the approximate upper and lower bounds provided by Munteanu et al. [10]. The results demonstrate that the exact computation on sketched datasets closely matches the actual \u03bcy(X) of the full dataset, while the approximate bounds can be significantly loose.", "section": "Experiments"}]
