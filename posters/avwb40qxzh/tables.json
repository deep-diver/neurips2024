The Chamfer distance measures the difference between the predicted particle positions from various methods and the ground truth particle positions. Lower Chamfer distance values indicate better performance. The methods compared include PAC-NeRF, NCLaw, and different variants of NeuMA (with and without particle supervision, binding, and the material adaptation term). The comparison is done across six different dynamic scenarios ('BouncyBall', 'JellyDuck', 'RubberPawn', 'ClayCat', 'SandFish', and 'HoneyBottle'), providing a comprehensive evaluation of each method's accuracy.", "section": "4.2 Performance on Object Dynamics Grounding"}, {"figure_path": "AvWB40qXZh/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison in object dynamics grounding in Chamfer distance.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for object dynamics grounding, using the Chamfer distance as a metric. The methods compared include PAC-NeRF, NCLaw, and three variants of the proposed NeuMA model (NeuMA, NeuMA with particle supervision, NeuMA without binding, and NeuMA without the material adaptation term). The comparison is done across six different benchmarks representing various dynamic scenarios (BouncyBall, JellyDuck, RubberPawn, ClayCat, SandFish, and HoneyBottle), with the average Chamfer distance reported for each method across all benchmarks.

It shows the Chamfer distance, a metric measuring the accuracy of object dynamics grounding, for five different settings. Each setting represents a different combination of elastic (M<sub>o</sub><sup>e</sup>) and plastic (M<sub>o</sub><sup>p</sup>) material models used as priors. The results demonstrate the impact of different choices of these priors on the model's ability to generalize to unseen objects and multi-object interactions.", "section": "4.4 Experimental Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "AvWB40qXZh/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison in object dynamics grounding in Chamfer distance.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for object dynamics grounding, specifically measuring the Chamfer distance.
