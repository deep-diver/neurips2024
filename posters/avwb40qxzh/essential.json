Neural-network simulators (black boxes) may violate physics, while traditional ones (white boxes) use expert-defined equations that might not fully capture reality. This necessitates a more robust approach that combines the strengths of both.\n\nThe proposed NeuMA system addresses this challenge by integrating existing physical laws with learned corrections.  This enables accurate learning of actual dynamics while retaining the generalizability and interpretability of physics-based models. NeuMA utilizes a particle-driven 3D Gaussian splatting variant (Particle-GS) for differentiable rendering, allowing back-propagation of image gradients to refine the simulation. Experiments show NeuMA excels in capturing intrinsic dynamics compared to existing techniques.", "affiliation": "MoE Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence, AI Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "AvWB40qXZh/podcast.wav"}
