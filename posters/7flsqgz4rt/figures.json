A double-ended arrow signifies that an edge exists in both directions between the two nodes. The caption indicates that this specific graph is an example of a navigable graph, which can be verified using another figure (Figure 2 in the paper) that provides additional information needed for verification.  Navigability, in this context, relates to a greedy routing strategy used for nearest neighbor search.", "section": "3 Upper Bound"}, {"figure_path": "7flSQgZ4RT/figures/figures_4_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Distance-based permutations for the data set in Figure 1. As an example, in the plot above, we have N\u2081(1) = 1, N\u2082(1) = 2, N\u2083(1) = 5, N\u2084(1) = 4, N\u2085(1) = 3, we have N\u2081(2) = 2, N\u2082(2) = 1, N\u2083(2) = 3, N\u2084(2) = 5, N\u2085(2) = 4, etc. For the permutations, we draw all edges in the graph G from Figure 1 that point \u201cleft\u201d in the permutation. In particular, we show edges that connect any N\u2097(t) to Nk(t) with k < l. We can check that property (1) holds, so the graph is navigable.", "description": "This figure shows the distance-based permutations for the data set shown in Figure 1.  Each subfigure (a) through (e) represents a permutation for a node, ordered by increasing distance to that node.  Edges in the graph are drawn if they connect a node in the permutation to a node that appears earlier in the permutation.  This illustrates the concept of navigability; if a path exists from a node to the next closest node to the target in the permutation for each step, the graph is considered navigable.", "section": "3 Upper Bound"}]
