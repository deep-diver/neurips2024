Existing works based on the assumption of single and uniform illumination cannot correctly process these data. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to model 3D facial textures under such unnatural illumination. Instead of assuming single illumination, our framework learns to imitate the unnatural illumination as a composition of multiple separate light conditions combined with learned neural representations, named Light Decoupling.

Although recent works [16, 2, 21, 23, 22] replace the linear models [6, 4] with non-linear GAN-inversion-based textured models to greatly enhance the quality of textures and complete occluded facial areas, they still rely on the assumption that the environment illumination is single and uniform.

Regarding this challenge, we propose to use multiple separate light conditions to imitate the local illumination of different facial areas after being affected by external occlusions. As shown in Fig. 1-c, our method can model the influence from external occlusion as one of the light conditions and eliminate its effect on the recovered texture as highlighted in the red rectangle, where the rendered output is also more realistic and closer to the input image especially on the forehead and eyes. Specifically, we use a spatial-temporal neural representation to predict masks for different light conditions, which are used to combine rendered results under multiple light conditions into final output. The number of light masks is adpatively adjusted during optimization. As external occlusions may directly cover parts of the face, we also introduce another neural representation to provide a continuous prediction for the available face region.

Within the 3DMM framework, the coordinates and colors of facial mesh vertices are computed through a linear combination of numerical parameters. These parameters can be estimated to enable face reconstruction through optimization-based ftiting [4, 6] or learning-based approaches [10, 30, 43, 42], with the goal of minimizing the disparities between the rendered and original face images. Traditional 3DMMs, although effective, are limited by their linear PCA basis. Recent advancements [16, 21, 23, 44] have introduced non-linear basis by incorporating pre-trained mesh or texture decoder networks. In these methods, latent codes for these decoders are optimized to align with the original face images. This approach significantly enhances the robustness of the model when faced with issues such as occlusions and missing textures.

Accurate modeling for 3D face textures and environmental illumination is vital for subsequent applications such as face relighting [36, 18, 31] or animation [38, 30]. To achieve high-resolution rendering, recent approaches [9, 21, 16, 3] usually opt for UV mapping to model facial texture, as opposed to the earlier methods that focused on vertex colors [32]. The UV map can either be initialized with a PCA basis [15] or estimated through the use of a pre-trained non-linear texture decoder [22, 2, 16]. There are two commonly used models to estimate human skin reflectance for the texture modeling framework: the Lambertian model [1] and the BlinnPhong model [5]. The Lambertian model is more computationally efficient, while the Blinn-Phong model produces more realistic rendering results by accounting for specular attributes in textures.

These methods have higher inference efficiency, while the size of their training set may greatly affect their performances. Notably, Dib et al.
