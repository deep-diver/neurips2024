The two-stage approach known as linear probing then fine-tuning (LP-FT) has emerged as a promising solution, but its underlying mechanisms require further investigation.  This is particularly true for complex model architectures like Transformers.\nThis research addresses these issues by analyzing LP-FT's training dynamics through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory.  **The NTK analysis reveals that LP-FT's success stems from a combination of accurate predictions and increased linear head norms** achieved during the linear probing stage.  **This increased norm effectively minimizes feature changes during fine-tuning**, improving generalization.  However, **the study also reveals a potential trade-off: increased linear head norms can negatively affect model calibration**, which the authors suggest can be addressed through temperature scaling.  Finally, the study expands the NTK analysis to the LoRA method, providing further theoretical validation for its efficacy.", "affiliation": "University of Tokyo", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "1v4gKsyGfe/podcast.wav"}
