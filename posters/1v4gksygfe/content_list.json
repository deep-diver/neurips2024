This holds true for both indistribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One key reason for its success is the preservation of pre-trained features, achieved by obtaining a near-optimal linear head during LP. However, despite the widespread use of large language models, there has been limited exploration of more complex architectures such as Transformers. In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of LP-FT for classification tasks on the basis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into two components. This decomposition highlights the importance of the linear head norm alongside the prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a significant increase in the linear head norm during LP, which stems from training with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. This increase in the linear head norm effectively reduces changes in learned features. Furthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model calibration, which can be corrected using temperature scaling. Additionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness.

To address this, the two-stage approach known as linear probing then fine-tuning (LP-FT) [Kumar et al., 2022] has demonstrated high performance on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. Initially, linear probing (LP) optimizes only the linear head of the model, after which fine-tuning (FT) updates the entire model, including the feature extractor and the linear head.

Calibration is defined as the alignment between the predicted probabilities and the actual probabilities [Guo et al., 2017].

Empirical experiments with Transformer-based language models supported our theoretical insights, validating our understanding of the NTK, feature changes, and the beneftis of temperature scaling.
