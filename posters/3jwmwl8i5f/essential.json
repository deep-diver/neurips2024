Larger patch sizes are computationally efficient but lose fine-grained details, while smaller patch sizes are more accurate but computationally expensive.  Existing time conditioning methods are also parameter-intensive, adding to model complexity.\nDiMR solves these issues through a novel multi-resolution network that progressively refines features from low to high resolution, improving image detail.  It also introduces Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), a parameter-efficient approach for incorporating time information.  Through these improvements, DiMR significantly outperforms existing models on ImageNet, setting a new state-of-the-art in terms of FID scores while maintaining a reasonable model size. This is a significant contribution to the field of image generation.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "3JwMwL8i5f/podcast.wav"}
