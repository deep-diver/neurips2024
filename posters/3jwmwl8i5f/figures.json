We propose DiMR that enhances Diffusion models with a Multi-Resolution Network. In the figure, we present the Multi-Resolution Network with three branches. The first branch processes the lowest resolution (4 times smaller than the input size) using powerful Transformer blocks, while the other two branches handle higher resolutions (2 times smaller than the input size and the same size as the input, respectively) using effective ConvNeXt blocks. The network employs a feature cascade framework, progressively upsampling lower-resolution features to higher resolutions to reduce distortion in image generation. The Transformer and ConvNeXt blocks are further enhanced by the proposed Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), detailed in Fig. 4.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the DiMR model's Multi-Resolution Network.
