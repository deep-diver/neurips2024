Transfer RL aims to alleviate this by leveraging knowledge from similar tasks, but effective transfer depends on the similarity between tasks and the ease of transferring representations.  Existing methods have limitations in scaling and don't fully address this challenge.\nThis work proposes new computationally efficient transfer RL algorithms for settings with low-rank structure in the transition kernels.  These algorithms learn latent representations from source MDPs and exploit their linear structure to minimize the dependence on state and action space sizes in target MDP regret bounds.  The introduction of a \"transfer-ability\" coefficient quantifies transfer difficulty, and the paper proves that these algorithms are minimax optimal (excluding the (d,d,d) setting) with respect to this coefficient. The efficient algorithms and strong theoretical guarantees make this a significant advance in transfer learning for RL.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "pK2qGRY2Hv/podcast.wav"}
