The algorithms compared include various versions of FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm), both stochastic and non-stochastic, with and without modifications like momentum stopping and automatic rate adjustments. The performance is measured using the mean squared error (MSE) and the logarithm of the MSE, showing error rate and squared mean error. The table highlights the impact of these modifications on the algorithms' efficiency and accuracy in solving the optimization problem.", "section": "A.1 Application of modified FISTA to neural network optimization"}, {"figure_path": "Ye0O4Nyn21/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Performance of algorithms on handwritten dataset", "description": "This table presents the results of applying different optimization algorithms to a handwritten digit recognition task.  The algorithms compared are: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Baseline Non-Stochastic Gradient Descent, FISTA, FISTA with momentum and a stop condition on gradient sign change, the same algorithm with a fixed momentum parameter, the same with a 4x rate, and two versions with an automatically adjusted rate. The performance is measured by the mean squared error (MSE) and its logarithm. This demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed modified FISTA algorithm in solving optimization problems compared to existing methods.", "section": "A.1 Application of modified FISTA to neural network optimization"}]
