While some methods are efficient, they don't always generate purified images that retain the semantic meaning of the originals.  Others are effective but computationally expensive.  This creates a trade-off that limits the practical application of these techniques. \nThis work introduces Consistency Purification, a novel framework that addresses this limitation. It leverages a consistency model\u2014a one-step generative model\u2014for efficient purification, combined with fine-tuning using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) loss to ensure semantic meaning is preserved.  Empirical results show that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a significant improvement in both efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "tLWoxftJVh/podcast.wav"}
