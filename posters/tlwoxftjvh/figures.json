It shows how a Gaussian noise augmented image is purified using a fine-tuned consistency model. This purified image is then passed to an off-the-shelf classifier for robust prediction. The framework also includes a Consistency Fine-tuning step using LPIPS loss to optimize the parameters of the consistency model for better semantic alignment between purified and original images.  The process is depicted with both a pig and a hummingbird as example images.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "tLWoxftJVh/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Transport between purified images and clean images with noise level \u03c3\u2208 {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}.", "description": "This figure shows the transport (a measure of distance between probability distributions) between purified images generated by different methods (onestep-DDPM, Consistency Purification, and Consistency Fine-tuning) and clean images at various noise levels (sigma).
