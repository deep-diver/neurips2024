Existing verifiable training methods face challenges in scalability and robustness due to the nondeterministic nature of GPU hardware.  Nondeterminism leads to different results when the same training process runs on different GPU types, hindering the verification process.\nThis research proposes a novel approach to address this challenge. By training models at a higher precision than needed, and carefully recording and sharing rounding decisions based on an adaptive thresholding technique, the researchers were able to achieve exact replication of the training process across different GPUs. This significantly reduces the storage and time overhead associated with verifiable training methods, making it scalable for large models. The method leverages an interactive verification game to ensure accountability and allows for efficient dispute resolution.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "bf0MdFlz1i/podcast.wav"}
