The comparison is based on three metrics: SKF1 (Skeleton F1 score), PSHD (Complete PDAG SHD), and Time (in seconds).  The plots illustrate how the performance of each method varies with the number of variables in the graph.  Each point in the plots represents the average of 30 experiments, with error bars representing the standard deviation. The results demonstrate that QWO achieves comparable accuracy to BIC while being significantly faster, especially as the number of variables increases.  Different colors represent the different search strategies (HC-QWO, HC-BIC, grasp-QWO, grasp-BIC).", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
