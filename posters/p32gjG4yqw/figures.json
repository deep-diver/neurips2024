In the left panel, we see G-equivariance where the input x is transformed by a group action g to g.x. This transformed input is passed through the feature map \u03c6, which produces an output that is similarly transformed by the group action g to g.y. The parameter \u03be remains unchanged by the group action. In the right panel illustrating joint-G-equivariance, both the input x and parameter \u03be are transformed by the group action g, which produces g.x and g.\u03be, respectively. These are then passed through the feature map \u03c6, generating an output g.y that is also transformed by the same group action g. The key difference lies in whether or not the parameters are also affected by the group action.", "section": "3 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "p32gjG4yqw/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Deep H-valued joint-G-equivariant network on G-space X is L\u00b2(X;H)-universal when unitary representation \u03c0of G on L\u00b2(X; H) is irreducible, and the distribution of parameters for the network to represent a given map f : X \u2192 H is exactly given by the ridgelet transform R[f]", "description": "This figure illustrates a deep H-valued joint-G-equivariant network.
