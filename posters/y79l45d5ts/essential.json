Current methods often struggle with generating molecules that effectively bind to both targets.  This research focuses on overcoming these obstacles using AI. \nThe study introduces a novel dataset based on synergistic drug combinations. It proposes a novel approach to repurpose pretrained diffusion models designed for single-target drugs to generate dual-target drugs. The approach leverages SE(3)-equivariant message passing and compositional drift to guide the generation process, effectively transferring knowledge gained during single-target training to the dual-target scenario. This zero-shot learning approach is shown to be highly effective, surpassing various strong baselines and demonstrating significant improvements in the design of dual-target drugs.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "Y79L45D5ts/podcast.wav"}
