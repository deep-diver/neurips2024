It illustrates how the types are represented as trees, with each node representing a specific term or operator. The tokens are shown in different colors or styles to indicate the various kinds of symbols. This visualization is key to understanding how the system represents types for processing by a neural network and is described in detail in Appendix B.1.

The x-axis represents the standardized score, and the y-axis represents the density.  The distributions are visualized using kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, with relevant lemmas shown in green and irrelevant lemmas in beige.  The figure visually demonstrates the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant lemmas, as evidenced by the clear separation between the distributions.  The small overlap between the distributions suggests that the model provides a relatively reliable separation.", "section": "5 Experiments & Results"}, {"figure_path": "e397soEZh8/figures/figures_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: JSON extract of the Agda code of Figure 1.", "description": "This figure shows a subset of the JSON structure generated by the AGDA2TRAIN tool for the example Agda code in Figure 1.  It illustrates how the tool represents the program's structure, including global imports, local definitions (like the data type N and the addition function), and a private helper lemma (+-suc). It also highlights the representation of a 'hole' in the proof, showing its context, the goal to be proven, and the term used to fill the hole.

The first subplot (a) displays histograms and kernel density estimates (KDEs) for the counts of imports, definitions, and holes across files.  It's noteworthy that the distribution of holes is more evenly spread than the other two, while imports and definitions show a right skew, indicating some files have a significantly larger number of entries than most. The second subplot (b) presents histograms and KDEs of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) lengths for lemmas and holes. Again, a similar right-skew is observed, suggesting certain type definitions are considerably more complex than the majority.  Finally, subplot (c) illustrates the distribution of lemma occurrences as imports versus use as premises in proof attempts.  The distributions show that a small fraction of lemmas is repeatedly used across many files (as imports), while a much larger fraction of lemmas is infrequently used in the dataset.", "section": "Data"}]
