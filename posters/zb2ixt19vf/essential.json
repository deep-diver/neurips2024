Generating realistic synthetic data for such multi-relational databases is challenging due to the complexity of capturing intricate dependencies across multiple tables and the need for scalability to handle large datasets.  Existing techniques often struggle with these challenges, leading to synthetic data that is less realistic or suffers from scalability issues.\nClavaDDPM, a novel approach, tackles these challenges by using cluster-guided diffusion probabilistic models.  It leverages clustering labels to model relationships between tables, effectively capturing long-range dependencies.  Experimental results demonstrate that ClavaDDPM significantly outperforms existing methods on multi-table datasets while maintaining competitive performance on single-table data.  The authors also introduce a new metric focusing on long-range dependencies to better evaluate synthetic data quality for multi-relational datasets.", "affiliation": "University of Waterloo", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Finance"}, "podcast_path": "Zb2ixT19VF/podcast.wav"}
