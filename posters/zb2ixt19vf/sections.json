[{"heading_title": "Multi-Relational Synthesis", "details": {"summary": "Multi-relational data synthesis presents a significant challenge in generating realistic synthetic datasets that accurately reflect the complexities of interconnected real-world data.  **Existing methods often struggle with scalability and capturing long-range dependencies across multiple tables.**  The core problem lies in effectively modeling relationships between tables, particularly foreign key constraints, while maintaining data fidelity and utility.  A promising approach involves leveraging the strengths of **diffusion models** to generate data conditioned on these relationships. The key idea is to use **latent variables** to represent the relationships between tables as intermediaries, allowing the model to capture intricate correlations. This approach may be more robust in handling datasets with multiple parent-child relationships, a common characteristic of complex databases. **Effective algorithms are crucial** for propagating latent variables across tables and efficiently managing the resulting high-dimensional data.  Careful consideration of the challenges posed by multi-parent relationships is critical for developing practical methods.  Evaluation metrics should incorporate assessment of both local and long-range relationships to assess the overall data quality.
