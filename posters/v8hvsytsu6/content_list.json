In many applications, the distribution of interest $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ is not precisely known; yet datasets that contain finite samples independently drawn from the distribution $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ are often available, which yield an empirical distribution estimate $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ . For instance, in image classification problems, $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ can represent the joint distribution of the features and the labels, and $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ can represent the empirical distribution of a dataset that is annotated by humans [2]; in portfolio optimization problems, $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ captures the uncertainty of a set of financial products in the future months and $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ contains historical prices of all the products [3]; in healthcare applications, $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ can represent the feature distribution of a population of interest, and $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ represent the available electronic health record data [4]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The above stochastic optimization problem is often solved using empirical risk minimization (ERM) [5], which searches for the best decision variable $\\theta$ that minimizes the expected loss function with respect to the empirical distribution, i.e., $\\theta_{\\mathrm{ERM}}=\\arg\\operatorname*{min}_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}\\mathbb{E}_{\\xi\\sim\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}}[l(\\xi,\\theta)]$ . However, ERM is not guaranteed to provide good out-of-sample performance, i.e., the value of $\\mathbb{E}_{\\xi\\sim\\mathbb{P}^{*}}[l(\\xi,\\theta_{\\mathrm{ERM}})]$ is high when the empirical estimate $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ is not close to the true distribution $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ . For example, in the presence of distribution shifts or contaminated datasets, the out-of-sample performance cannot be improved by increasing the sample size. To enhance the out-of-sample performance of the decision variable, researchers have developed methods that use distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to address the mismatch between $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ and $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In contrast to ERM, DRO aims to optimize outcomes against the worst-case scenario over a set of distributions that are close to the empirical distribution according to a pre-specified distance metric. This set of distributions is called the ambiguity set and is typically assumed to contain the distribution of interest, e.g., the true distribution $\\mathbb{P}^{*}$ . The construction of the ambiguity set is critical in the development of various DRO methods, as it ideally encompasses all prior knowledge about the true distribution. For example, [6] defines the ambiguity set using moment constraints. Moment constraints assume that the true distribution has similar moments compared to the empirical distribution, e.g., means and variances. The ambiguity set can also include distributions that are similar to $\\hat{\\mathbb P}$ in infinite-order moments; this construction is explored in [13] and is termed Kernel DRO. When the distribution of interest is categorical, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) is often adopted to define the ambiguity set as the categories can be permuted and KL does not consider the geometry of a distribution\u2019s support. DRO using KL has been extensively studied in the literature due to its computational benefits [14, 15]. In contrast, the Wasserstein distance between two distributions captures the geometry of the distributions. The Wasserstein distance can be useful, e.g., in loan approval prediction problems where the distribution represents the incomes of a population and prior knowledge may specify that two clients are similar if their incomes are close. DRO using the Wasserstein distance (WDRO) has been applied to many machine learning problems, such as linear regression [16] and logistic regression [17] problems.

However, WDRO is not suitable for contaminated datasets, e.g., datasets that contain outliers that are geometrically far from the clean distribution but cannot be easily removed. The reason is that the Wasserstein distance between the contaminated empirical distribution and the clean (true) distribution is very sensitive to the outliers; to include the clean distribution in the ambiguity set, the Wasserstein distance would need to be selected very large and inevitably the ambiguity set would include distributions that will never happen in practice. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To apply DRO to contaminated datasets, the authors in [18, 19, 20] take outliers into consideration and propose various methods to minimize their impact on the learning performance. Specifically, [18] proposes to minimize the most optimistic DRO risk to avoid the hardest instances that are likely to be outliers. In [19], a weight clipping method is proposed to truncate the excessive impact of outliers on the results. However, both [18] and [19] use KL divergence to define the ambiguity set, which fails to capture geometric uncertainty. Notably, the authors in [20] introduce an outlier-robust WDRO framework capable of addressing both geometric uncertainty and non-geometric contamination, allowing an $\\varepsilon$ fraction of data to be arbitrarily corrupted. They design an ambiguity set based on prior knowledge and demonstrate the strong duality of the resulting DRO problem, which is related to the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) [21]. Nevertheless, the performance of the formulated DRO problem relies heavily on the accuracy of the estimate of $\\varepsilon$ . Besides, [20] uses off-the-shelf solvers to solve the resulting DRO problem, which is not computationally efficient when applied to large datasets since the number of constraints in the proposed method grows linearly with the sample size.

Our approach involves the design of a UOT distance that substitutes hard constraints by a soft penalization term. This construction, combined with some prior knowledge on the learning task, enables the design of a new ambiguity set that includes distributions of interest and penalizes distributions that contain outliers. For the DRO problem with this new ambiguity set, we establish strong duality results under specific smoothness assumptions. However, the solution of the dual problem poses significant computational challenges. Motivated by [27], we explore a Lagrangian penalty variation of the problem, which can be viewed as a Lagrangian function of the original formulation with a fixed dual variable. We show that strong duality holds for this Lagrangian penalty problem under fewer assumptions compared to the original DRO problem. The reformulated problem employs an exponential function to reweight data points, effectively diminishing the influence of outlier data on the optimization process. We solve this problem by proposing a provable stochastic (sub)-gradient algorithm, which is computationally efficient. We provide empirical results that demonstrate that our approach not only enhances robustness to outliers but also improves computational efficiency for large-scale problems.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
