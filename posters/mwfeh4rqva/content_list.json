In this work, we propose a novel multi-stage generation paradigm that is designed for fine-grained control, flexibility and interactivity.

However, achieving desired image quality and properties inherently requires tedious and meticulous prompt engineering [35]. As image content is solely described using a textual description, prompt content has to be carefully crafted, notably taking into account the models\u2019 struggles to understand subtleties of language (e.g. counting, object attributes, negation or spatial relationships) [16]. Additionally, minor prompt modifications can lead to substantial modifications of generated image content, further increasing prompt crafting tediousness. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "An intuitive way of improving controllability of generated content is by providing alternative image descriptors, e.g. using image layouts which describe the location of specific objects in an image as bounding boxes. Several approaches have been proposed to inject layout information in the generative process. Training based methods [24, 54] adapt or introduce new model weights to introduce object coordinates as conditioning, while [8, 51] leverage cross-attention manipulation and inference time optimisation. While substantially increasing control over image structure, these solutions still generate all components as a single denoised image. This limits the user\u2019s ability to finely control object attributes, and layout adjustments requires re-generation with limited content preservation guarantees. These issues can potentially be addressed with image editing techniques. This, however, can require expensive data construction and training [4], while the displacement or resizing of objects (essential for layout manipulation) remains a very challenging type of edit that few have explored [9, 31]. This challenge can be attributed to the fact that objects and backgrounds have to be regenerated, while at the same time ensuring appearance preservation with the original image.

The idea is to represent images as multi-layer stacks, where different image components are generated on separate layers. This has two key benefits: 1) instances can be generated more precisely as separate images with individual prompts, 2) separating image components simplifies image manipulation tasks, as only the relevant layers will be modified. Nonetheless, layer-based methods typically suffer from the fact that layers are not fully generated, as they are collapsed to a single image in the later stages of a diffusion process. Generating all components jointly can affect the ability to achieve fine-grained control of layers attributes, control their relative positioning in 3D space (as layers are collapse with no hierarchical structure), ensure a smooth composition of all image component, and achieve layout manipulation abilities with strong content preservation (as layers and composite image influence each other). ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this work, we seek to address current limitations through a multi-stage generation process that is designed for fine-grained control, flexibility and interactivity. We propose to build complex scenes by first generating individual instances as RGBA images, then iteratively integrating them in a multi-layer composite image according to a specific layout. The ability to generate individual instances allows to finely control instance appearance and attributes (e.g. colours, patterns and pose), while their layered composition allows to easily control and modify positioning, scale and ordering. In particular, our two-stage approach provides intrinsic layout and attribute manipulation abilities with strong content preservation. To achieve our goal, we firstly train a diffusion model capable of generating RGBA images, i.e. images with alpha transparency information. Directly generating isolated instances, c.f. generating and extracting them with a segmentation model, ensures better transparency masks and more fine-grained control of instance attributes. Our RGBA generator is obtained by fine-tuning a latent diffusion model (LDM) using RGBA instance data from the recently released MuLAn dataset [47]. In order to incorporate transparency information in the generative process, we devise a transparency-aware training procedure for both VAE and diffusion model. In contrast with the contemporary transparent generation method of [57], which implicitly encodes transparency information in the null space of the VAE to carry out standard LDM fine-tuning, we explicitly integrate transparency in our generation and training process. Our VAE is trained so as to disentangle RGB and alpha channels, ensuring colour and detail preservation in RGB reconstruction. Our LDM is then fine-tuned with a novel training paradigm leveraging our disentangled latent space, that allows a conditional sampling-driven inference where alpha and RGB latents are sequentially denoised with mutual conditioning. Finally, we leverage our RGBA generator to build composite images with fine-grained control over object attributes and scene layout. We build multi-instance scenes via a multi-layer noise blending solution, where each instance is associated to a specific image layer. Crucially, each instance is integrated in the scene one layer at a time, yielding increasingly complex image layers so as to ensure scene coherence and accurate relative positioning. This contrasts with pre-existing multi-layer works which assemble all instances at once [38, 49], and is uniquely afforded by our RGBA generation process. By manipulating latent representations in early stages of the denoising process, we are able to achieve high degrees of precision and control, while at the same time generating smooth and realistic scenes.

GLIDE [32] first proposed text-to-image generation with diffusion models by adopting classifier-free guidance through text. While GLIDE trains the text encoder jointly with the diffusion prior using paired image and text data, Imagen [43] employs a frozen large language model as the text encoder. More recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) trained in latent space have increased in popularity, given their lower computational requirements[41]. Stable Diffusion incorporates an adversarial objective to learn the latent representation and enhance the authenticity of generated images and introduces cross-attention for text conditioning. While the U-Net [42] architecture was originally the most popular for latent diffusion models, recent works are converging towards the use of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) [36], which operate on latent patches. For example, Pixart- $\\alpha$ [6] has demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities, while reducing the computational requirements to $10.8\\%$ of Stable Diffusion-v1.5\u2019s training time. Leveraging these models to generate instances with transparency information has been rarely explored. Text2Layer [60] generates foreground and background images separately, defining foreground as the ensemble of all salient objects and predicting the foreground alpha mask separately from RGB pixels. Developed concurrently, LayerDiff [18] generates image components as separate images, providing the transparency masks as input. This technique tends to generate partial instances, as occluded areas are not generated. Also contemporary, LayerDiffusion generates transparent images by encoding transparency in the null space of the pre-trained VAE, allowing to fine-tune a diffusion model using standard techniques. While able to generate high quality instances, this implicit transparent modelling can lead to inconsistent results, without guarantees that transparency will be achieved. In contrast, our explicit disentangled latent space allows for more control and guarantees transparent images outputs. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "Image editing and scene controllability The increasing popularity of diffusion models has highlighted the limitations of working solely with text based control. We identify two main areas of research seeking to increase generative controllability: image editing and layout controlled generation. Image editing can be achieved by fine-tuning on dedicated dataset [4], constrained sampling with CLIP [39] losses [20, 21, 45, 17, 50], mask guided inpainting [30, 59, 11, 52, 7], training-free cross attention manipulation [12, 34, 5, 48], and inference-time optimisation [9]. Despite achieving impressive results for replacement and local modification tasks, image editing often struggles with more complex manipulations such as moving, rescaling and removing, especially on non isolated instances. By modifying pre-generated content, editing methods additionally have limited layout control capabilities. Alternatively, precise layout control during generation has been explored by introducing additional conditioning. GLIGEN [24], ReCo [54] and Boxdiff [51] achieve image generation from layouts given as bounding boxes specified by the user. ControlNet [58] allows to incorporate several forms of image based conditioning, such as sketches, depth maps, or canny edges. These techniques afford high generative controllability, but lack layout editing capability. Composite [2] and layer-based generation techniques [38, 49, 40] offer a promising avenue, where individual scene components are associated with unique prompts and assembled in a scene with bounding boxes or instance specific masks, leveraging the diffusion model\u2019s intrinsic priors to build coherent scenes. However, generating scenes and all individual components jointly requires compromising between instance quality, attribute accuracy and scene coherence, reducing flexibility and control. We build from layered approaches, and use multi-layer paradigms to iteratively integrate pre-generated RGBA instances in increasingly complex images, affording us precise control over layout, instance attributes and allowing us to focus on scene composition quality solely during the composition step.

While GLIGEN is capable of accurately reproducing the desired layout, it often fails to assign the right attributes to objects (e.g. blue apple, orange plane, swan painting) and struggles with highly overlapping objects (fox and unicorn). In contrast, Multidiffusion is more accurate in terms of attribute assignments, but struggles to handle overlapping objects. This can be attributed to the noise averaging process, which fails to integrate a notion of instance ordering like our multi-layer approach. Instance diffusion achieves performance closest to ours, but still struggles with complex patterns, attributes and relative positioning (swan painting behind the couch, white bus with a red flower pattern, woman walking away).

We compare our results to contemporary method Instance Diffusion, which has been highlighted to possess similar editing capabilities [49]. Results are reported in Fig. 6, showing that we are able to control and modify image content easily while maintaining strong consistency across different versions of the scene, without explicitly enforcing content preservation.

Extensive experiments show that we are able to generate diverse, fine-grained RGBA instances, and assemble them in complex scenes, achieving precise control and high flexibility over scene structure. One key limitation of our approach is the independent generation of instances, increasing the challenge of assembling them in a coherent scene.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
