It evaluates performance using three metrics: Kernel Inception Distance (KID) to assess image quality, Intersection over Union (IoU) to measure the accuracy of generated alpha masks against ground truth, and CLIP Score to evaluate the semantic similarity between generated images and their corresponding captions.  The table also includes ablation studies showing the impact of removing key components of the proposed training procedure.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
