This homogeneity hinders exploration and limits overall performance.  Existing methods attempting to increase diversity through maximizing mutual information between trajectories and agent identities often suffer from inefficient exploration. \n\nThis paper introduces Contrastive Trajectory Representation (CTR), a novel method that addresses this limitation. CTR leverages contrastive learning to create distinguishable trajectory representations, encouraging diverse policies without sacrificing exploration efficiency.  Experiments on various cooperative tasks demonstrate CTR's significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for more robust and scalable multi-agent systems.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "D6nlm2AYHi/podcast.wav"}
