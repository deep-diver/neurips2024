Existing methods often rely on computationally intensive differential equation solvers for sampling, hindering their practical application.  This limits the use of generative models in many fields where data naturally resides in non-Euclidean spaces.\nThis work introduces Manifold Free-Form Flows (M-FFF), a novel generative model that overcomes these limitations. **M-FFF leverages a single feed-forward neural network for sampling and density estimation**, bypassing the need to solve differential equations.  **This results in a method that is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques**, while achieving comparable or even better accuracy on various benchmarks.  The generalizability of the M-FFF framework makes it suitable for a wide variety of Riemannian manifolds.", "affiliation": "Heidelberg University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Generative Models"}, "podcast_path": "QbPHYPZKJI/podcast.wav"}
