Current acceleration techniques require additional training. This limits their application to large datasets and complex tasks.\n\nThis paper proposes Discrete Non-Markov Diffusion Models (DNDM) which solve this problem. **DNDM introduces a training-free sampling algorithm by leveraging predetermined transition times.** This significantly reduces the computational cost by decreasing the number of function evaluations.  The superior performance of DNDM compared to other methods is demonstrated via experiments on natural language generation and machine translation.  Furthermore, an infinite-step sampling approach is presented, providing new insights into discrete and continuous-time diffusion models.", "affiliation": "UC Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "KkYZmepjHn/podcast.wav"}
