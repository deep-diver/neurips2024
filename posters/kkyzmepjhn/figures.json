It shows the relationship between the BLEU score and computational time for various models including RDM-Multi, DNDM-Multi, RDM-k-Multi, and DNDM-k-Multi for both multinomial and absorbing diffusion. The steeper slope of a line indicates a larger improvement in BLEU score for a given increase in computational time, suggesting a better tradeoff between quality and speed.  The figure highlights the superior efficiency of the DNDM models in achieving higher BLEU scores with lower computational cost compared to the baseline models.", "section": "4.1 Conditional Text Generation"}, {"figure_path": "KkYZmepjHn/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Generation quality to generation time comparison on IWSLT14. x-axis: computational time in seconds; y-axis: BLEU score.", "description": "This figure compares the relationship between generation quality (measured by BLEU score) and computational time for different models on the IWSLT14 dataset.

It shows that the computational time for the baseline methods (Absorb, RDM-Absorb) increases linearly with the number of sampling steps.
