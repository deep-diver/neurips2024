This is a significant problem in various machine learning applications where discrete variables are common, such as energy-based models and large language models. Current methods struggle to explore the entire distribution effectively. \nThis research introduces the Automatic Cyclical Sampler (ACS), a novel gradient-based discrete sampling method that addresses these challenges. ACS uses cyclical schedules to automatically adjust the step size and proposal distribution, balancing exploration (finding new modes) and exploitation (characterizing current modes).  **This approach leads to significant improvements in sampling efficiency and accuracy, overcoming the local optima limitation of existing methods.** The method has been proven theoretically, showing convergence guarantees, and demonstrated empirically across a wide range of complex multimodal distributions. This work sets a new standard for discrete sampling with notable implications for numerous machine learning applications.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4syq5cgwA2/podcast.wav"}
