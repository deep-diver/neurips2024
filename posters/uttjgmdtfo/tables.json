It compares the performance of three different surrogate models (LRNN, LODE-RNN, LODE) trained using both interventional and observational data on two test sets: an interventional test set (I') and an observational test set (O').  The metrics used to assess performance are the average mean squared error (AMSE) and average negative log-likelihood (ANLL).  The table shows that interventionally trained surrogates generally outperform observationally trained surrogates, particularly on the interventional test set.", "section": "5 Case study"}, {"figure_path": "UtTjgMDTFO/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Metrics for interventionally (I) & observationally (O) trained surrogates on interventional & observational (O') test sets (median third first quartile quartile from 5 repeats).
