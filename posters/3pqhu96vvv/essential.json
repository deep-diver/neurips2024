Existing models struggle to capture the flexible modulation of sensory processing based on context and goals, often failing to replicate human behavior. This limits our understanding of visual attention and its neurological basis.\nThis paper introduces a novel neural network model called DCnet, inspired by the visual cortex. **DCnet incorporates local, lateral, and top-down connections and uses a low-rank mechanism to modulate sensory responses according to cues.** The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models on visual search tasks and replicates key human psychophysics findings in attention experiments, including reaction times. **This demonstrates its ability to capture both the biological realism and computational efficiency.**", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "3PqhU96Vvv/podcast.wav"}
