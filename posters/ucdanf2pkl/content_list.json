To address this issue, several studies have been conducted and have shown promising results.

To tackle such a less-touched challenge, we propose an innovative method, termed as All-in-one VidEo Restoration Network (AverNet), which comprises two core modules, i.e., Prompt-Guided Alignment (PGA) module and Prompt-Conditioned Enhancement (PCE) module. Specifically, PGA addresses the issue of pixel shifts caused by time-varying degradations by learning and utilizing prompts to align video frames at the pixel level. To handle multiple unknown degradations, PCE recasts it into a conditional restoration problem by implicitly establishing a conditional map between degradations and ground truths. Thanks to the collaboration between PGA and PCE modules, AverNet empirically demonstrates its effectiveness in recovering videos from TUD.

However, these methods typically require prior knowledge of the specific type of degradation to design and train effective models, such as denoising, dehazing, and deblurring models [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

To favor all-in-one video restoration (AVR), a few studies [17, 18, 19] have been conducted in very recent, which typically assume that the frames of a given video contain unknown but the same type of degradation. In other words, these methods can only handle a single unknown type of degradation and would fail when faced with multiple unknown types of degradation for a given video. Clearly, the latter is more practical and challenging because degradations can vary over time in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1). For instance, motion blur can occur when a stationary object starts to move, and noise will appear when the scene changes to low-light conditions. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an AVR method capable of handling time-varying unknown degradations (TUD).

Specifically, a vital step in video restoration is spatial alignment across frames, which aims to eliminate frame difference at the pixel level. As shown in Fig. 2, compared to time-invariant degradations, time-varying degradations cause larger and more complex pixel shifts, making frame alignment significantly more challenging. Hence, to align frames at pixel level better, PGA optimizes a specific prompt conditioned on a video clip first and then uses this prompt to align the frames within the clip. To tackle unknown degradations in a given frame, PCE is designed to learn prompts corresponding to latent unknown degradations by building the conditional map between the corrupted frame and the ground truth.

The former kind of methods typically take a short sequence of frames as input and restore only the center frame. By leveraging the temporal information from adjacent frames, these methods have achieved promising performance. For example, EDVR [1] introduced the pyramid architecture and temporal-spatial attention modules to effectively aggregate information across frames. Shift-Net [5] proposed an efficient framework based on grouped spatial-temporal shift modules to implicitly aggregate inter-frame information. Although the methods have shown impressive performance, they encounter challenges in handling long-sequence videos and suffer from high memory consumption. To alleviate the problem, recurrent methods choose to propagate latent features from one frame to the next frame sequentially, accumulating information from previous frames for the restoration of subsequent frames. For instance, BasicVSR [26] proposed a concise and efficient network employing a bidirectional propagation scheme.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
