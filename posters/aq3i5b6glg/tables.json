[{"figure_path": "aq3I5B6GLG/tables/tables_32_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Certificate that \u03a0C,\u03ba is not affine", "description": "This table provides a concrete example showing that the categorical MMD projection operator (\u03a0C,\u03ba) is not affine. It considers a single-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a 2-dimensional reward space R = {0, ..., 3}2 and uses the energy distance kernel (induced by p(x, y) = ||x \u2212 y||2). Two probability distributions, p1 and p2, are defined, and their linear combinations (\u03bbp1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)p2, with \u03bb = 0.8) are compared. The table shows that the categorical projection of the linear combination is not equal to the linear combination of categorical projections (i.e., \u03a0C,\u03ba(\u03bbp1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)p2) \u2260 \u03bb\u03a0C,\u03ba(p1) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03a0C,\u03ba(p2)), demonstrating the non-affine nature of the operator. The bolded entries highlight the discrepancies in the resulting probability distributions.", "section": "D Nonlinearity of the Categorical MMD Projection"}]
