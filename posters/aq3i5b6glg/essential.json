Existing methods for learning multiple rewards often lack theoretical guarantees or are computationally expensive. This paper tackles these limitations by developing algorithms for multivariate distributional RL.  A major challenge is the difficulty of modeling the full joint distribution of multiple rewards, which previous methods often failed to address fully or efficiently. \nThe researchers introduce novel, computationally tractable algorithms for both dynamic programming and temporal difference learning in multivariate distributional RL. These algorithms come with theoretical guarantees of convergence, matching the convergence rates observed in the simpler case of a single reward.  Furthermore, the researchers also provide new insights into how the quality of approximate return distribution representations relates to the number of reward dimensions.  The paper also introduces new techniques, including a randomized dynamic programming operator and a TD-learning algorithm, designed to improve efficiency and convergence in the high-dimensional case.  Through simulations, they also show how different distribution representation choices influence the practical performance of multivariate distributional RL.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aq3I5B6GLG/podcast.wav"}
