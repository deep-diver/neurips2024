Normal and up vector determines the rotation of a tablet in 3D space, while every tablet maintains a distance ratio between the coordinates of the 3D field and 2D-pixel space.", "description": "This figure illustrates the properties of an AlphaTablet, the core element of the proposed 3D plane representation.  It shows how a rectangular primitive is defined in 3D space using properties like position, normal vector, and up vector.  The figure also demonstrates the 2D properties that exist within the tablet, such as RGB texture, transparency (alpha channel), and pixel range.  Finally, it depicts the volumetric rendering process, showing how multiple AlphaTablets combine to generate the final 3D scene. The key idea is that each AlphaTablet is a semi-transparent rectangle that can model complex shapes through its alpha channel.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "7rrJQ9iWoX/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Pipeline of our proposed 3D planar reconstruction.
