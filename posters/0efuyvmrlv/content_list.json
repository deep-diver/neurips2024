We investigate the problem of sequentially adapting a model to non-stationary environments, where the data distribution is continuously shifting and only a small amount of unlabeled data are available each time. Continual testtime adaptation methods have shown promising results by using reliable pseudolabels, but they still fall short in exploring representation alignment with the source domain in non-stationary environments. In this paper, we propose to leverage non-stationary representation learning to adaptively align the unlabeled data stream, with its changing distributions, to the source data representation using a sketch of the source data. To alleviate the data scarcity in non-stationary representation learning, we propose a novel adaptive representation alignment algorithm called Ada-ReAlign. This approach employs a group of base learners to explore different lengths of the unlabeled data stream, which are adaptively combined by a meta learner to handle unknown and continuously evolving data distributions.

For example, once an autonomous driving model is deployed, external factors such as weather changes (e.g., snow, frost, or fog) and internal factors like sensor degradation (e.g., causing Gaussian noise, defocus, or blur) can negatively impact its performance. Unfortunately, many well-trained models are highly sensitive to such distribution shifts and may suffer significant performance degradation, even when the shifts are minor [12].

In addition, aligning the representation of unlabeled data back to the source representation has also been proposed to improve performance [28, 10]. More recently, several seminal works have explored continual test-time adaptation with unlabeled data streams, where data arrive continuously, and the distribution may change over time. These algorithms often rely on generating and selecting high-confidence pseudo-labels to update the model, with techniques such as reliable entropy minimization [34, 25].

Different from prior representation alignment methods for fixed distributions [23, 28], the key challenge in non-stationary representation learning lies in the limited amount of data available at each time.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
