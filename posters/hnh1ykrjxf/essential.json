Previous research has primarily focused on offline settings where a single shift occurs. Online label shift adaptation is more challenging because the distribution shifts continuously over time. Existing methods mainly focus on updating the final layers of pre-trained classifiers, but this approach may be limited.  Missing labels at test-time further complicates the problem.\nThis paper proposes a novel method called OLS-OFU (Online Label Shift adaptation with Online Feature Updates) which improves on existing methods. OLS-OFU leverages self-supervised learning to refine the feature extraction process at test time, using unlabeled data to adapt to changing distributions. This approach is theoretically sound, maintaining a similar convergence guarantee as other online learning methods. Empirical evaluations show that OLS-OFU significantly improves over existing methods, with gains comparable to those methods' improvements over simple baselines, demonstrating its robustness across scenarios.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "HNH1ykRjXf/podcast.wav"}
