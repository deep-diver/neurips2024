It starts with an offline training stage using labeled data from Ptrain distribution to train a model f0. Then, in the online test stage, unlabeled test samples from Ptest distribution arrive sequentially.  At each time step t, predictions are made on the unlabeled samples using the current model ft. The model is then updated to ft+1 using algorithm A. The figure highlights the assumption of equal conditional distributions (Ptest(x|y) = Ptrain(x|y)) for online label shift and the existence of a transformation h making the conditional distribution equal in the feature space for online generalized label shift.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "HNH1ykRjXf/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Evaluation of OLS and OLS-OFU.", "description": "The figure shows the performance comparison between OLS-OFU and OLS methods on CIFAR-10, STL-10, CINIC-10, EuroSAT, and CIFAR-10-C datasets under different label shift scenarios.  OLS-OFU is tested with three self-supervised learning (SSL) methods: rotation degree prediction, entropy minimization, and MoCo.  The results demonstrate that OLS-OFU achieves substantial improvements over existing OLS methods in various settings, particularly with the sinusoidal shift pattern. The improvements are consistent across different datasets and SSL techniques.
