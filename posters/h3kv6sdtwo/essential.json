Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with this, using 2D slices and hand-crafted regularization, resulting in artifacts and z-axis inconsistencies.  This limits their ability to accurately learn a comprehensive 3D image prior for accurate reconstruction.\nDiffusionBlend++, a novel approach, learns the 3D image prior through position-aware 3D-patch diffusion score blending. This innovative technique combines information from neighboring 2D slices in 3D patches and blends their scores, overcoming the inconsistencies of previous methods.  Extensive experiments on sparse-view and limited-angle CT show that DiffusionBlend++ significantly outperforms previous methods, leading to state-of-the-art performance.  It is computationally efficient and requires minimal hyperparameter tuning.", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "h3Kv6sdTWO/podcast.wav"}
