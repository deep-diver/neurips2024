Unlike conventional single-modality sentiment recognition, MSA poses greater challenges owing to the intricate nature of processing and analyzing heterogeneous data across modalities. Mainstream studies in MSA [69, 70, 44, 12, 11, 42, 25] focus on designing complex fusion paradigms and interaction mechanisms to improve MSA performance. For instance, CubeMLP [42] employes three distinct multi-layer perceptron units for feature amalgamation along three axes. However, these methods rely on complete modalities and thus are impractical for realworld deployment. There are two primary approaches for addressing the missing modality problem in MSA: (1) Generative methods [8, 28, 26, 49] and (2) joint learning methods [37, 50, 76, 74, 68, 27]. Generative methods aim to regenerate missing features and semantics within modalities by leveraging the distributions of available modalities. For example, TFR-Net [67] employes a feature reconstruction module to guide the extractor to reconstruct missing semantics. Joint learning methods focus on deriving cohesive joint multimodal representations based on inter-modality correlations. For instance, MMIN [76] produces robust joint multimodal representations via cross-modality imagination. However, these methods cannot extract rich sentiment information from incomplete modalities due to their inefficient interaction. In contrast, our learning paradigm achieves effective extraction and precise reconstruction of sentiment semantics through complete modality factorization.

This separation enables the model to more effectively capture intrinsic information and yield favorable modality representations. Previous methods of factorized representation learning primarily rely on auto-encoders [3] and generative adversarial networks [32]. For example, FactorVA [18] is introduced to achieve factorization by leveraging the characteristic that representations are both factorial and independent in dimension. Recently, factorization learning has been progressively utilized in MSA tasks [54, 25, 57]. For instance, FDMER [54] utilizes consistency and discreteness constraints between modalities to disentangle modalities into modality-invariant and modality-private features. DMD [25] disentangles each modality into modality-independent and modality-exclusive representations and then implements a knowledge distillation strategy among the representations with dynamic graphs. MFSA [57] refines multimodal representations and learns complementary representations across modalities by learning modality-specific and modality-agnostic representations. Despite the progress these studies have brought to MSA, certain limitations persist: (i) The supervision of the factorization process is coarse-grained and insufficient. (ii) Focusing solely on factorizing distinct representations at the modality level, without taking into account sentimentally beneficial and relevant representations. By contrast, the proposed method decomposes sentimentrelevant representations precisely through intra- and inter-modality translation and sentiment semantic reconstruction. Furthermore, hierarchical mutual information maximization and adversarial learning paradigms are employed to refine and optimize the representation of factorization at the semantic level and the distributional level, respectively, thus yielding robust joint multimodal representations.

Many studies [5, 17, 38, 21, 47, 51] utilize knowledge distillation for MSA tasks with missing modalities. These approaches aim to transfer dark knowledge from teacher networks trained on complete modalities to student networks trained by missing modalities. The teacher network typically provides richer and more comprehensive feature representations than the student network. For instance, KD-Net [17] utilizes a teacher network with complete modalities to supervise the unimodal student network at both the feature and logits levels. Despite their promising results, these methods neglect precise supervision of representations, resulting in low-quality knowledge transfer.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
