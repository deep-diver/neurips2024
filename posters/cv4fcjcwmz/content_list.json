Firstly, most of the existing data extraction attacks target at generative models (e.g., transformers and diffusion models) in text and image domains. From generative models, training data can be easily inferred via simple prompts (as depicted in Figure 1(a)). In comparison, most molecular pre-trained models are not generative. Instead, users of these models can only query the model with molecular graph and then obtain corresponding representations of this graph [62, 53, 18, 19, 55], which obstructs the direct extraction of molecular data (see Figure 1(b)). Secondly, while models in image and text domains typically employ widely recognized architectures like diffusion models [44] and transformers [43], molecular pre-trained models feature a much greater diversity in their architectures and training tasks, such as contrastive learning [47, 62, 53], context prediction [18, 55, 51], and graph reconstruction [19, 45]. These architectures often remain undisclosed to potential adversaries, adding an additional layer of complexity to any attempt at data extraction.

This structure influences the molecular properties but does not necessarily determine them. (2) Common: the template structure should be prevalent across a wide range of molecules. Both criteria are indispensable: If a template structure is only common but lacks functional significance, like an atom, then it fails to provide useful information on the structure of the molecules under interest. On the other hand, if a template is merely functional, such as thiols (typically found only in antioxidant molecules) [39], then the diversity of the extracted molecules would be restricted. Rings uniquely meet both criteria: they are prevalent across numerous molecular families, satisfying the common criterion, and as a functional structure, they significantly influence molecular stability, reactivity, and interactions with other molecules [9, 48].

Moreover, atoms may form atypical chemical fragments, such as alternating bond patterns that form incomplete aromatic rings [33].

Molecular pre-trained models utilize GNNs to capture the intricate non-Euclidean structure of molecular graphs, employing various self-supervised pre-training tasks to enhance generalization [57, 22, 12, 5, 21, 58]. Training on extensive molecular graphs, molecular pre-trained models can acquire generalized molecular graph representations and patterns, thereby benefiting various downstream tasks in the molecular domain [13, 53, 1, 30, 32]. Molecular pretrained models typically employ self-supervised tasks as follows. (1) Contrastive Learning [47, 62, 53]. The objective of the contrastive pre-training task is to capture the similarities and dissimilarities between instances of subgraphs at the molecular level or motif level. (2) Graph Reconstruction [18, 55, 51].

Pre-trained models contain a large amount of knowledge, and data extraction attacks are among the methods aimed at extracting training data from these models [4, 24].

In the first category, [6] generates text from pre-trained language models and performs membership inference attacks to filter the generated text for extraction. In the second category, [26] demonstrated that the effectiveness of data extraction is due to duplication in commonly used web-scraped training sets [26]. [20] analyzed the extracted text from pre-trained language models and found these models do leak personal information as a result of memorization.
