While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are the de facto standard, their performance in link prediction often falls short compared to simple heuristics like Common Neighbors (CN). This discrepancy arises because MPNNs excel at node-level representation but struggle to capture joint structural features essential for link prediction.\n\nThis research introduces Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model that addresses these limitations. MPLP harnesses the orthogonality of input vectors to effectively estimate link-level structural features, including CN, while preserving the node-level complexities. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPLP consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results.  **The findings offer crucial insights into the capabilities of GNNs and pave the way for the development of more effective and efficient link prediction models.**", "affiliation": "Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Xa3dVaolKo/podcast.wav"}
