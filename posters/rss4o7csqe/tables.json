The comparison is performed across four metrics for each dataset, reflecting different aspects of image quality.  The metrics used are standard deviation (SD), average gradient (AG), spatial frequency (SF), and the sum of correlations of differences (SCD). Higher values generally indicate better performance for SD, AG, SF, and SCD.  The best, second-best and third-best results for each metric in each dataset are highlighted in red, blue, and green respectively, providing a clear visualization of the CCF method's performance relative to the competitors.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "RSs4o7CSqe/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison with SOTAs.
