Rather than providing a single label prediction and letting a human expert decide when and how to use the predicted label to update their own prediction, these systems provide a set of label predictions, namely a prediction set, and ask the expert to predict a label value from the set.2 To construct each prediction set, these systems rely on a conformal predictor [20, 21]. The conformal predictor first computes a non-conformity score for each potential label value using the output provided by a classifier (e.g., the softmax scores), and then adds a label value to the prediction set if its nonconformity score is below a data-driven threshold computed using a calibration set. Further, to optimize the performance of these systems, Straitouri et al. have introduced several methods to efficiently find the optimal value of the threshold used by the conformal predictor.3 However, it is unclear whether the optimal prediction sets maximizing the average accuracy achieved by an expert who uses such systems can always be constructed using a deterministic threshold rule as the one used by a conformal predictor.

In addition, for each noisy image, the dataset contains (approximately) six label predictions made by human experts on their own. In our experiments, we run and evaluate each method separately by grouping the above noisy images (and expert predictions) according to their level of noise. For each group of images and method, we use the deep neural network classifier VGG-19 [56] after 10 epochs of fine-tuning as provided by Steyvers et al. [7]. Further, we randomly split the images (and expert predictions) in each group into two disjoint subsets, a calibration set (800 images), and a test set (400 images). The accuracy of the (pretrained) VGG-19 classifier on the test set is $0.900\\pm0.014$ $\\omega=80$ ), $0.895\\pm0.009$ $\\langle\\omega=95\\rangle$ ), $0.857\\pm0.016$ $\\omega=110)$ ) and $0.792\\pm0.016$ $\\langle\\omega=125\\rangle$ ).

The results of our experiments suggest that the prediction sets constructed using our greedy algorithm may help human experts make more accurate predictions than the prediction sets constructed using conformal prediction. However, one may argue that the difference in performance is partly due to the fact that the non-conformity scores used in conformal prediction do not incorporate information about the distribution of experts\u2019 predictions. Motivated by this observation, it would be important to investigate how to incorporate such information in the definition of non-conformity scores. Moreover, in our experiments, the true distribution of experts\u2019 predictions matches the mixture of MNLs used by the greedy algorithm and brute force search. However, in practice, there may be a mismatch between the true distribution of experts\u2019 predictions and the mixture of MNLs, and this may decrease performance.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
