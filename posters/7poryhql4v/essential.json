This paper investigates the distribution of optimized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with stochastic algorithms. A key challenge in deep learning is the inherent stochasticity of training, leading to a distribution of different optimized models, and understanding this distribution's properties is crucial.\nThe researchers focus on input salience maps which represent the sensitivity of the model's prediction to different input features. Their main finding is that as model capacity increases, the input salience of optimized DNNs converges towards a shared mean. This convergence trend is independent of the specific architecture of the model and consistently occurs across various model types. They introduced a semi-parametric approach for modeling this convergence, which helps explain several previously unclear phenomena, such as the efficacy of deep ensemble methods.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7PORYhql4V/podcast.wav"}
