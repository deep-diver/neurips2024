Specifically, gradients from different loss functions (boundary and PDE residual losses) can exhibit significant magnitude imbalances and negative inner products, leading to unreliable solutions. This is a critical challenge hindering wider adoption of PINNs. \nTo tackle this issue, this paper introduces a new optimization framework called Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD).  **DCGD cleverly adjusts the gradient update direction** to ensure that both boundary and PDE residual losses decrease simultaneously. Theoretical convergence properties are analyzed, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-convex settings.  Extensive experiments across various benchmark equations showcase DCGD's superior performance and stability compared to existing methods, especially for complex PDEs and failure modes of PINNs.", "affiliation": "Artificial Intelligence Graduate School\nUNIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gvtCR7dHJ3/podcast.wav"}
