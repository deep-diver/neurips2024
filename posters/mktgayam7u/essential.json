Traditional IO methods often rely on linear models, limiting their ability to capture complex relationships in real-world scenarios.\n\nThis paper introduces Kernelized Inverse Optimization (KIO), leveraging kernel methods to significantly improve the expressiveness of IO models and extending the hypothesis class to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). To tackle the computational challenges associated with the increased dimensionality of RKHS, the paper proposes a novel algorithm called Sequential Selection Optimization (SSO) to train KIO. SSO efficiently trains the KIO model by selectively updating parameters. Results show KIO and SSO improve efficiency and accuracy in learning from demonstration tasks, demonstrating promising results in low-data regimes on the MuJoCo benchmark.", "affiliation": "Delft Center for Systems and Control", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Mktgayam7U/podcast.wav"}
