This is problematic because it limits the ability to extract detailed features at the variable level, thus hindering accurate predictions.  The varying sampling rates and time-dependent correlations further complicate the analysis. \n\nTo overcome this, the authors propose Knowledge-Empowered Dynamic Graph Network (KEDGN). KEDGN uses a pre-trained language model to integrate medical knowledge, allowing it to capture variable-specific temporal patterns. A density-aware mechanism dynamically adjusts the variable graph, reflecting the time-varying correlations among variables. This dynamic graph, combined with variable-specific parameter spaces, is integrated into a graph convolutional recurrent network to model intra and inter-variable dependencies.  Experiments show KEDGN significantly outperforms existing methods on four healthcare datasets.
