Existing Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) methods, like INFO-BAX, often rely on expected information gain (EIG), which can be computationally expensive and limit their applicability.  This is especially true when the property of interest is complex or high-dimensional. \nThis paper introduces PS-BAX, a new BAX method using posterior sampling.  **PS-BAX is significantly faster than EIG-based approaches because it only requires a single base algorithm execution per iteration.** It is also simpler to implement and easily parallelizable. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that PS-BAX performs competitively with existing baselines. Furthermore, the paper provides theoretical analysis showing that PS-BAX is asymptotically convergent under mild conditions.", "affiliation": "California Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "m4ZcDrVvid/podcast.wav"}
