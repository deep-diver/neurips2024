Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle with this 'minimum-cost reach-avoid' problem because combining these objectives is challenging.  They often use weighted sums of objectives, resulting in suboptimal solutions.  This paper tackles the minimum-cost reach-avoid problem by using a novel technique based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. \nThe paper introduces a new algorithm called RC-PPO that addresses the limitations of existing methods.  RC-PPO converts the reach-avoid problem into a reachability problem on an augmented system.  It uses a two-step process: first learning a policy and value function conditioned on a cost upper bound, and then fine-tuning to find the optimal cost.  Experiments show RC-PPO significantly reduces costs compared to existing approaches across various benchmark tasks while maintaining similar success rates. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for solving challenging constrained optimization problems.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jzngdJQ2lY/podcast.wav"}
