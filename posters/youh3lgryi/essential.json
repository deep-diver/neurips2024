This limitation leads to inaccuracies in spatial feature extraction and synthesis.  The paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel dual learning strategy. \nThe proposed approach leverages a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation to model 3D spatial relationships more accurately. This 3DSG is shared between the I2T and T2I tasks.  Furthermore, it introduces a synergistic dual learning strategy, where the easier 3D-to-text or 3D-to-image process aids the harder processes, improving the overall performance. **Experiments on the VSD dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques for both I2T and T2I tasks.**", "affiliation": "Tianjin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "YOUh3lgRYI/podcast.wav"}
