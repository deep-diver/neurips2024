The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in cameraLiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models, and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance.

However, the exponential increase in parameter counts due to fusion architectures introduces significant computational costs, especially when deploying these systems on resourceconstrained edge devices, which is a crucial challenge for autonomous driving [5]. Network pruning is one of the most attractive methods for addressing the challenge above of identifying and eliminating redundancy in models. Existing pruning algorithms target single-modal models [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] or multi-modal models that merge distinct types of data [13, 14], such as visual and language inputs. However, it\u2019s important to note that directly applying these algorithms to camera-LiDAR fusion models can lead to significant performance degradation. The degradation can be reasoned for two main factors that existing pruning methods overlooked: 1) the key fusion mechanism specific to vision sensor inputs within models, and 2) the training scheme where models typically load single-modal pre-trained parameters onto each backbone [2, 15]. Specifically, since single-modality models lack the cross-modality fusion mechanism, existing pruning algorithms traditionally do not consider intermodality interactions. Furthermore, because the pre-trained backbones (image or LiDAR) are trained separately, they are not optimized jointly, exacerbating the redundancy in features extracted from each backbone. Though leveraging pre-trained backbone improves the training efficiency compared with models training from scratch, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism.

Meanwhile, the fusion mechanism selectively leverages reliable features while minimizing weaker ones across modalities to enhance model performance. This selective utilization upon similar feature extraction across modalities introduces the additional redundancy: Each backbone independently extracts similar features, which subsequent fusion modules will not potentially utilize. For instance, both camera and LiDAR backbones extract geometric features to predict depth during pre-training. However, geometric features extracted from the LiDAR backbone are considered more reliable during fusion because LiDAR input data contain more accurate geometric information than the cameras, e.g., object distance, due to the physical properties of sensors. Consequently, this leads to the redundancy of geometric features of the camera backbone. In summary, similar feature extraction across modalities, coupled with the following selective utilization in fusion modules, leads to two counterparts of similar features across modalities: those utilized by fusion modules in one modality (i.e., fusion-contributed), and those that are redundant in the other modality (i.e., fusion-redundant).

Current stateof-the-art (SOTA) fusion models evolve primarily within intermediate fusion and combine low-level machine-learned features from each modality to yield unified detection results, thus significantly enhancing perception performance compared with early or late fusion.

From the perspective of granularity, pruning algorithms can be divided into two primary categories: 1) structured pruning, which entails removing entire channels or rows from parameter matrices, and 2) unstructured pruning, which focuses on eliminating individual parameters.

Consequently, the fusion module is compelled to utilize the geometric features from the unmasked camera backbone, which were previously fusion-redundant.

As we hypothesize, fusion modules across various modalities and tasks exhibit different functionalities. In perception-only tasks involving multiple sensors (camera, LiDAR and radar), the fusion mechanism primarily focuses on supplementing and spatial aligning across modalities by fully leveraging the physical properties of different sensors since all inputs consist of vision-based data. Formally, lowlevel machine features are fused in the multi-sensor fusion mechanism. However, in the fusion mechanism devised for different types of data, such as vision and language, things differ. When input data is highly disparate, such as vision and language, fusion modules tend to focus more on matching, which means synchronizing the high-level semantic context between different input formats. Therefore, for the AlterMOMA framework, we concentrate on the redundancy stemming from supplementary functionality, which may only primarily exist in multi-sensor fusion architectures.
