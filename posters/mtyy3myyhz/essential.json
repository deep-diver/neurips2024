It also provides publicly available code, enhancing reproducibility and collaboration.", "summary": "S2HPruner bridges the discretization gap in neural network pruning via a novel soft-to-hard distillation framework, achieving superior performance across various benchmarks without fine-tuning.", "takeaways": ["S2HPruner, a novel structured differentiable mask pruning framework, effectively bridges the discretization gap in neural network pruning.", "Decoupled bidirectional knowledge distillation in S2HPruner enhances mask optimization while preventing performance degradation.", "S2HPruner demonstrates superior pruning performance across diverse benchmarks without any fine-tuning."], "tldr": "Many model compression methods use differentiable mask pruning (DMP), which optimizes a continuous \"soft\" network as a proxy for the final pruned \"hard\" network. However, a significant performance drop is observed after discretization, creating a \"discretization gap\".  This gap severely limits the practical effectiveness of DMP.\n\nThe authors introduce S2HPruner, a new framework that addresses the discretization gap. It uses soft-to-hard distillation, training both a soft and hard network simultaneously and distilling knowledge from the soft to the hard network.  This process, coupled with a decoupled bidirectional knowledge distillation approach, ensures effective mask optimization and significantly improved performance on CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet benchmarks. **S2HPruner's superior performance comes without the need for time-consuming fine-tuning, making it a highly efficient and practical solution**.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "mtyy3Myyhz/podcast.wav"}
