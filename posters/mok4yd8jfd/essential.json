Using a short exposure time leads to high noise, while long exposure leads to motion blur, both degrading the accuracy of the polarization data. Existing methods struggle to balance noise and blur reduction while maintaining the polarization properties, limiting the quality of the resulting images. \nThis research tackles these issues by introducing a new framework that cleverly uses a degraded pair of noisy and blurry images to generate a high-quality image.  The method involves three main processing phases: irradiance restoration, polarization reconstruction, and artifact suppression, each with specially-designed modules.  **This approach significantly improves image quality and surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in polarimetric imaging.** The framework demonstrated superior performance on both synthetic and real-world data, paving the way for applications in various fields relying on accurate polarization information.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Enhancement"}, "podcast_path": "mOK4yD8JFd/podcast.wav"}
