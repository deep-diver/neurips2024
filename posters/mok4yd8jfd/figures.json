Our framework can produce clean and clear results with high-quality DoP and AoP by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots (right).", "description": "This figure shows the effects of short and long exposure times on polarimetric imaging. Short exposure leads to noisy images with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in poor quality Degree of Polarization (DoP) and Angle of Polarization (AoP). Long exposure reduces noise but introduces motion blur, again degrading DoP and AoP. The authors' proposed framework addresses this by complementarily fusing a noisy, short-exposure image with a blurry, long-exposure image to produce clean and high-quality results.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "mOK4yD8JFd/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The workflow of our framework, consisting of three phases: irradiance restoration, polarization reconstruction, and artifact suppression.", "description": "This figure illustrates the overall framework of the proposed polarimetric imaging method. It consists of three main phases: 1) Irradiance Restoration: This phase aims to restore the high-level irradiance information of the scene. The CSCF module is used to make full use of color and structure cues. 2) Polarization Reconstruction: This phase aims to establish the physical correlation between the polarized images by reconstructing the DoP and AoP in the Cartesian coordinate representation. CAG and CI modules are used. 3) Artifact Suppression: This phase aims to suppress the artifacts by performing refinement in the image domain. This figure shows the connections and data flow between these three phases and the different modules within each phase.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "mOK4yD8JFd/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The details of the proposed CSCF (color and structure cue fusion) and CAG (coherence-aware aggregation) modules.", "description": "This figure shows the detailed architecture of the Color and Structure Cue Fusion (CSCF) module and the Coherence-Aware Aggregation (CAG) module.
