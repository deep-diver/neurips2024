It shows the empirical type I error (for groups G1 and G3, where the true coefficients are all zero) and the empirical power (for groups G2 and G4, where some true coefficients are non-zero) under different scenarios. The scenarios vary based on the sample size (n=200, 500), the dimensionality of predictors (p=800), the presence or absence of outliers, and the error distribution (normal and Cauchy).  The results are reported for both linear and non-linear models.", "section": "4 Numerical studies"}, {"figure_path": "MelYGfpy4x/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Simulation results for the group inference problems", "description": "This table presents the results of simulation studies conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods for group inference.  The studies involved linear and non-linear models, with varying error distributions (standard normal and Cauchy).  The table shows the empirical rejection rate (ERR) for different scenarios, which serves as a measure of type I error (false positives) and statistical power (true positives) for various group sizes and outlier conditions.", "section": "4 Numerical studies"}]
