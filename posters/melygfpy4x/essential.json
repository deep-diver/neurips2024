Existing inference methods often rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. The lack of robust and efficient inference procedures creates a significant hurdle in effectively analyzing high-dimensional data sets, especially in various scientific fields where such data is frequently encountered. \nThis research introduces a robust method to address these limitations by recasting SIMs into pseudo-linear models with transformed responses.  This transformation relaxes distributional assumptions, leading to improved efficiency for heavy-tailed errors. The proposed method provides asymptotically honest group inference procedures, which are shown to be highly competitive with existing methods. Additionally, a multiple testing procedure is developed to control the false discovery rate, enhancing the reliability of simultaneous inference. The methodology is supported by both theoretical proofs and numerical experiments, demonstrating its superiority in various conditions.", "affiliation": "Beijing Normal University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MelYGfpy4x/podcast.wav"}
