{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in causal reinforcement learning and off-policy evaluation because it directly addresses the limitations of existing methods when dealing with unmeasured confounders.  **Its introduction of the two-way unmeasured confounding assumption and the associated deconfounder algorithm provides a more flexible and realistic approach to handling this challenging problem.**  The theoretical results and empirical validation further enhance its significance and practical value, paving the way for more accurate and reliable policy evaluation in various real-world applications.  The work also opens up new avenues for research on more sophisticated latent variable modeling and consistent policy value estimation.", "summary": "Two-way Deconfounder tackles off-policy evaluation challenges by introducing a novel two-way unmeasured confounding assumption and a neural-network-based deconfounder, achieving consistent policy value estimation.", "takeaways": ["A novel two-way unmeasured confounding assumption is proposed to model system dynamics in causal reinforcement learning, addressing limitations of existing one-way assumptions.", "A two-way deconfounder algorithm using a neural tensor network simultaneously learns unmeasured confounders and system dynamics for consistent policy value estimation.", "Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate improved performance over existing methods in various scenarios, including real-world applications."], "tldr": "Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning is often hampered by unmeasured confounders, leading to biased policy value estimations. Existing methods frequently rely on restrictive assumptions, like the one-way unmeasured confounding assumption, which limits their applicability.  These limitations motivate the need for more robust and flexible OPE methods that can handle complex real-world scenarios.\nThis paper proposes a novel two-way unmeasured confounding assumption, relaxing the limitations of the one-way assumption.  **A two-way deconfounder algorithm is developed, employing a neural tensor network to jointly learn unmeasured confounders and system dynamics.** This approach yields a model-based estimator, providing consistent policy value estimation.  **The effectiveness is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods in various settings, particularly those with unmeasured confounders.**", "affiliation": "Shanghai University of Finance and Economics", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Lu9Rasfmjj/podcast.wav"}
