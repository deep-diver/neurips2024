Similar to Self-Imitation Learning [40], this clipping mechanism can be viewed as a form of lower-bound-soft-Q-learning, where only samples with a positive advantage provide valuable insights into the optimal soft Q-value. From an empirical perspective, this approach embodies the notion that if there is still room for policy enhancement after being updated by the oracle critic $V(h,s)$ , the standard critic $V(h)$ should be engaged. With full-state information from the oracle critic, DCRL avoids falling into a vicious cycle of poor policy and bad value estimates. The standard critic in DCRL can effectively mitigate variance, whereas recurrent Actor-Critic methods preclude such opportunities due to entanglement in a vicious cycle. These two critics establish a mutually supportive relationship, facilitating variance reduction while effectively using full-state information. The proof regarding lower-bound-soft-Q-learning is provided in Appendix C.

We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze how DCRL improves efficiency and enhances performance. DCRL contains two key factors: the dual-critic structure and the weighting mechanism. We replace the dual-critic structure with the single-critic structure to verify the structure\u2019s effectiveness. The Standard Critic Version and Oracle Critic Version are constructed with the following expressions for the inside terms of the policy loss: $\\delta_{\\phi}(h_{t},a_{t}){\\log}\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|h_{t})\\,+\\,\\beta\\delta_{\\phi}(h_{t},a_{t}){\\log}\\bar{\\pi_{\\theta}}(a_{t}\\bar{|}h_{t})$ and $\\delta_{\\psi}(h_{t},s_{t},a_{t})\\mathrm{log}\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|h_{t})\\mathrm{~+~}$ $\\beta^{\\prime}\\delta_{\\psi}(h_{t},s_{t},a_{t})\\mathrm{log}\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|h_{t})$ .

The adjustment of $\\beta$ and $\\beta^{\\prime}$ follows the same way as discussed in Section 4.2. Additionally, we introduce an intuitive variant that modifies the standard critic\u2019s input from history to state, referred to as the DCRL State Version. This adjustment aligns with previous works that introduce biases; however, it has the potential to enhance efficiency gains. All methods utilize the same architectures and hyperparameters as DCRL. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "We select four environments from the MiniGrid domain, where state information plays a crucial role. In these environments, methods that utilize states perform significantly better than those that do not. We compare our DCRL approach with four ablation baselines, and the results are presented in Figure 6. It can be observed that DCRL converges to optimal policies faster than other methods. Intuitively, incorporating the concept of positive advantage $(\\delta_{+})$ can optimize the utilization of beneficial samples and expedite the training process. Consequently, single-critic structure methods integrating a $\\delta_{+}$ term outperform those lacking it, as demonstrated by the superior performance of approaches like the Standard Critic Version compared with the Recurrent Actor-Critic. However, it is crucial that the two critics fulfill distinct and orthogonal roles within the dual-critic structure. DCRL incorporates an oracle critic that utilizes state information compared with the Standard Critic Version. The inclusion of state information provides the agents with additional context to accurately determine the environment\u2019s true state, facilitating learning an accurate value function and ultimately improving performance. In comparison to the Oracle Critic Version, DCRL reduces variance. These factors contribute to DCRL\u2019s efficiency. As for the DCRL Exchange Version, although it is also a dual-critic structure, its policy gradient is biased, and its weighting mechanism does not utilize state information as effectively as DCRL. Its performance only shows advantages in limited environments. It converges to suboptimal policies in DistShift2 and LavaGapS6. The DCRL State Version demonstrates commendable performance among the various DCRL variants.

For example, in an extreme scenario where the state information $s$ represents the true value of $V(h)$ , the agent can effortlessly infer this true value through $V(h,s)$ . Specifically, in the context of the Empty Navigation task, when the state information indicates the agent\u2019s relative distance to the goal, the value function learning process is significantly streamlined. Besides, in most POMDPs, rewards are directly defined based on state information rather than on observations. Consequently, learning the value function $V(h,s)$ with the reward as the target is typically simpler than learning $V(h)$ . This characteristic makes state information effective in most practical applications, a conclusion that numerous previous studies have empirically validated. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, state information does not always enhance training. When the state information contains significant noise, introducing excessive noisy features to the input can hinder learning the value function. In unfamiliar environments, whether state information genuinely supports the learning process remains to be determined. The motivation behind this work is that state information may be accessible during training in many scenarios. However, introducing a state could potentially lead to bias or variance. In most cases, state information offers higher-level features that assist agents in decision-making. In these situations, DCRL enhances the process by further reducing variance. Conversely, when state information and partial observations correspond one-to-one, the oracle critic demonstrates no variance; DCRL may become ineffective under these circumstances.

Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) [42\u201344] is a prevalent paradigm for addressing challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The optimization objective in MARL is to maximize the rewards under the global states, optimizing each agent accordingly. These methods mostly presuppose that the combination of optimized actions under partial observations leads to optimality under global states. Building on CTDE, MANSA[45] introduces a Global agent to decide when to activate global information usage. However, the policy that maximizes rewards under partial observations does not necessarily align with the policy that maximizes rewards under global states, i.e., $Q(h,a)\\neq Q(s,a)$ [19].

Previous studies have explored various double structures. In the context of double critics, Double DQN [46] utilizes a replicated Q-network as the target network to handle overestimation issues, a method later extended to subsequent works such as TD3 [47] and SAC [48]. Considering the opposite properties of single-critic and double-critic methods, TADD [49] incorporates a novel triplet critics mechanism to reduce the estimation bias. Additionally, ADC [50] takes advantage of environmental models by training a model-based critic, which is then combined with the model-free critic. This approach enables learning from the model-free path despite model noise, enhancing the robustness to environmental models. In the context of double actors, DARC [51] introduces a double actor structure to boost the agent\u2019s exploration ability by providing two paths for policy optimization, thus reducing the risk of the agent getting stuck locally. Moreover, DAC [52] utilizes a parallel actor-critic architecture to learn better options, indicating that the two critics can be effectively consolidated into one.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
