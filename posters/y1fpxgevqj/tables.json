The experiments use MNIST images and evaluate three different MIL tasks (4-Bags, Pos-Neg, and Adjacent Pairs) measuring context sensitivity and positive/negative evidence handling. The table shows the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) scores for each method, highlighting the best-performing methods for each task. Additionally, model performance (Test AUROC) is included to provide context.", "section": "4.1 Toy experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Y1fPxGevQj/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Results of the faithfulness experiments.

Faithfulness is measured using AUPC (Area Under Perturbation Curve), where lower scores indicate higher faithfulness (better alignment between explanation scores and model predictions).
