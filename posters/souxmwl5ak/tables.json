[{"figure_path": "soUXmwL5aK/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The conditional probability table obeyed when adding synthetic missingness.", "description": "This table shows the conditional probability of a variable (X1) being missing given the values of another variable (X2) and the outcome (Y).  It defines the mechanism for introducing synthetic missingness into the data in a way that is Missing at Random (MAR). The probability of missingness depends on the outcome (Y) and X2.  If X2 is above the 60th percentile, then the probability of X1 being missing is 'r' if Y = 1 and 0 if Y = 0. If X2 is below the 60th percentile, the opposite is true. This creates a dependence between the outcome and the probability of missingness, making it MAR, but not MCAR.", "section": "D.1 Conditional Probability Table for Added MAR Missingness"}]
