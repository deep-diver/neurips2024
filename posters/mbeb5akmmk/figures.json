It shows three subplots displaying the instantaneous loss, cumulative loss, and average loss across multiple algorithms (OGD, COMID, Optimistic-OMD, OptCMD, and USC-SEA) over 5000 rounds.  The instantaneous loss plot illustrates the loss at each round, highlighting the fluctuations. The cumulative loss shows the accumulated loss over time, illustrating the performance of each algorithm. Finally, the average loss indicates the average loss per round, providing a metric for overall performance comparison.", "section": "A Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "MbEB5aKmMK/figures/figures_15_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experimental results for the general convex case.", "description": "This figure presents the experimental results for the general convex case, comparing several online optimization algorithms.  The left panel shows the instantaneous loss per round; the middle panel illustrates the cumulative loss over time, which represents the total loss accumulated during the learning process; and the right panel displays the average loss per round, showing the average loss incurred in each round of optimization.  These three aspects help to analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms in handling general convex loss functions within the context of the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model. The algorithms compared include OGD, COMID, Optimistic-OMD, OptCMD (the proposed algorithm), and USC-SEA (a universal strategy for composite SEA).", "section": "A Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "MbEB5aKmMK/figures/figures_15_3.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Experimental results for the exp-concave case.", "description": "This figure shows the experimental results for the exp-concave case. It includes three subfigures showing the instantaneous loss, cumulative loss, and average loss for different algorithms (ONS, ProxONS, Optimistic-OMD, OptCMD, and USC-SEA) over 5000 rounds. The results demonstrate that OptCMD and USC-SEA achieve lower losses compared to baseline methods, indicating their better performance in handling the composite SEA environment.", "section": "A Experiments"}]
