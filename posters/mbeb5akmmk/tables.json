The algorithm is iterative, taking place over T rounds. In each round, the learner submits a decision xt, receives a composite loss function ft(xt)+r(xt) where ft is sampled from a distribution Dt provided by the environment, and updates its decision for the next round using the Bregman divergence.  This table is central to understanding how the algorithm functions and adapts in the stochastically extended adversarial environments discussed in the paper.", "section": "3.2 Optimistic composite mirror descent"}]
