Existing methods often rely on directly transmitting the data, leading to high communication costs, particularly when dealing with large models or numerous samples. This is particularly problematic in areas like federated learning where communication is a major bottleneck.  The paper addresses this by introducing a new framework called \"Universal Sample Coding\".\nThe core of Universal Sample Coding involves using a reference distribution, known to both sender and receiver, to estimate the target distribution from which the samples originate. By strategically using this reference distribution, the communication can be significantly compressed, thereby reducing the number of bits required for transmission. This method is applied to both federated learning and generative model scenarios demonstrating significant communication cost reduction. The theoretical analysis provides lower bounds on the achievable communication cost, and an algorithm is designed to approach this bound in practice. This showcases the potential to greatly reduce communication overhead, paving the way for more efficient applications in machine learning.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qdV1vp1AtL/podcast.wav"}
