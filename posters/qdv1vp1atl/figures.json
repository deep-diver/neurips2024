The factor represents the multiplicative gap between the upper bound on communication cost (from the proposed algorithm) and the theoretical lower bound. The plot also includes a line representing the lower bound factor of 1, which provides a reference point for comparison.

The factor represents the multiplicative gap between the upper bound on the communication cost of the proposed algorithm and the theoretical lower bound.  The figure shows that the optimal factor decreases as the dimensionality increases, approaching the lower bound of 1.

Source coding is the traditional method of compressing and transmitting data, while sample communication is the novel technique proposed in the paper. The figure compares the performance of sample communication using auxiliary models of varying sizes (125M, 350M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B parameters) against the source coding method. The results demonstrate that the sample communication method outperforms source coding for larger group sizes, highlighting the efficiency gains of the proposed approach.", "section": "Generative models"}]
