", "takeaways": ["PURE uses a Graph ODE to learn time-evolving prompts for model adaptation.", "The method effectively handles both parameter-based and temporal distribution shifts.", "Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements on various benchmarks."], "tldr": "Fluid dynamics modeling using machine learning often suffers from distribution shifts due to varying system parameters and temporal evolution. Existing methods struggle with these shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. This paper introduces PURE, a novel approach to address these issues.\n\nPURE leverages prompt learning and graph neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn time-evolving prompts that adapt forecasting models to different scenarios. It first extracts multi-view context information from historical data to initialize prompts and then utilizes a graph ODE to capture the temporal evolution of these prompts.  This adaptive prompting mechanism significantly improves the model's robustness and generalization performance in out-of-distribution settings.  Experiments show PURE outperforms various baselines.", "affiliation": "Tencent", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "z86knmjoUq/podcast.wav"}
