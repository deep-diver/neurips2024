Backdoors are proposed for various domains, from computer vision [9, 22, 6, 26, 40, 25] to graph data [42] and neuromorphic data [1]. Still, backdoors in computer vision received most of the attention of the research community, which also means there is a significant variety of triggers. For instance, a trigger can be a pixel patch [9], an existing image [22], dynamic perturbation [25], or image warping [26].

Input space trigger inversion is first introduced by Neural Cleanse (NC) [36], where potential triggers for all target classes are reversed by minimizing the model loss of clean inputs. Median absolute deviations of reversed triggers from all classes are then calculated to detect triggers. More recently, input space trigger inversion methods have been shown to be ineffective against feature space backdoor attacks [26, 38]. To address this problem, FeatureRE [38] proposes a detection method using feature space triggers. The authors observe that features of backdoored and benign inputs are separable in the feature space by hyperplanes. Unicorn [39] formally defines and analyzes different spaces for trigger inversion problems. An invertible input space transformation function is proposed to map the input space to others, such as feature space, and to reconstruct the backdoor triggers. These trigger inversion methods can be considered as an optimization problem for the targeted class. They optimize the input images to mislead the model under various constraints and recover strong triggers in different spaces. The state-of-the-art trigger inversion method, BTIDBF [44], increases the inversion efficiency by relaxing the dependency of trigger inversion on the target labels. BTI-DBF trains a trigger generator by minimizing the differences between benign samples and their generated poisoned version in decoupled benign features while maximizing the differences in remaining backdoor features. Feature space trigger inversion defenses are generic and effective against most backdoor attacks. However, we show that BTI-DBF may fail against BadNets, as its backdoor is not prominent in the feature space (see Section 3.4).

Specifically, BAN generates adversarial neuron noise, where the weights of the victim model are adversarially perturbed to maximize the classification loss on a clean data set. Simultaneously, trigger inversion is conducted in the victim model\u2019s feature space to calculate the mask for benign and backdoor features.

It can be observed that the backdoored model misclassifies parts of the data from all classes as the target class when the adversarial neuron noise increases, while the clean model has fewer misclassifications under the same level of noise.

We note that the advanced detection methods (FeatureRE, Unicorn, and BTI-DBF) perform worse than NC on simple attacks (BadNets and Blend). We hypothesize this is because the backdoor features generated by BadNets are less obvious on feature channels than advanced attacks in the feature space, such as WaNet and IAD. Figure 3 shows that BadNets features are weaker than features from advanced attacks using the feature mask in Eq. (5). Specifically, we optimize the feature mask to disentangle the benign and backdoor features for four attacks. Then, we compute two cross-entropy loss values using the positive mask $(\\mathbf{m})$ and the negative mask $(1-\\mathbf{m})$ for benign and backdoor features, respectively. The average loss values and standard deviation for four models for each attack are plotted in Figure 3. The negative loss value of BadNets is much smaller than others, which means BadNets features are weaker than others with regard to misleading the model to the backdoor target. Recent defenses usually add more regularizers to their losses and optimization objectives to counteract powerful backdoor attacks. These regularizers encourage the capturing of strong features but omit weak ones. Thus, recent advanced detections can perform worse on BadNets than NC.

The goal of defense is to decrease the attack success rate (ASR) of backdoor triggers.

In Section 3.5, we propose a simple and effective fine-tuning method using the noise that activates the backdoor. Table 3 compares BAN with three baselines: plain finetuning, FeatureRE [38], and BTI-DBF(U) [44]. Plain fine-tuning refers to training the backdoor model using the same hyperparameters as BAN but without the noise loss in Eq. (8). The FeatureRE [38] and BTI-DBF(U) [44] refer to the defense methods from the respective paper. We use default hyperparameters for FeatureRE [38] and BTI-DBF(U) [44]. For plain fine-tuning and BAN, we use a small learning rate (0.005) to avoid jumping out of the current optimal parameters of the well-trained model. Then, we use $\\lambda_{2}$ (0.5) for Eq. (8) for the trade-off between robustness against backdoor and clean accuracy. We fine-tune for a short schedule of 25 epochs, as the model is well-trained. Table 8 in Appendix B.4 shows defense performance with standard deviation on different hyperparameters, which supports our choice. Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that our fine-tuning method effectively removes the backdoor while preserving high accuracy in benign inputs.

Adap-Blend [28] achieves it by randomly applying $50\\%$ of the trigger to poison the training data, while SSDT attack [24] utilizes source-specific and dynamic-triggers to reduce the impact of triggers on samples from non-victim classes. The source-specific attack refers to backdoor triggers that mislead the model to the target class only when applied to victim class samples. Table 6 demonstrates our approach is resistant to these two attacks, while other methods fail. The reason is that the backdoor features of SSDT are close to benign features in the feature space. It is difficult for other methods to distinguish between backdoor and benign features created by SSDT.
