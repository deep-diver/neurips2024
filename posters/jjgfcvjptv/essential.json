Existing methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo use predetermined force fields which is not ideal.  This paper addresses these issues by exploring the potential of designing customized force fields for Hamiltonian ODEs.\nThis paper introduces **Hamiltonian Velocity Predictors (HVPs)** to design force fields for Hamiltonian ODEs. Using HVPs, the authors develop **Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM)** for score function estimation and **Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs)** for generative modeling.  **HGFs** generalize diffusion models and flow-matching, while **HSM** offers a novel score matching metric with lower variance.  The authors validate their methods through experiments demonstrating the superiority of HGFs and HSM.
