The constraints vary across different mouse datasets and ranks of the model, reflecting the different scales and levels of complexity in the data.", "section": "5.1 Active Learning on Data-Driven Neural Population Dynamics Simulator"}, {"figure_path": "nLQeE8QGGe/tables/tables_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Input Rank r for Results of Section 5.1", "description": "This table shows the input rank *r* used for Algorithm 1 in Section 5.1 for each of the eight experiments. The input rank is a hyperparameter that controls the dimensionality of the low-rank approximation used in the algorithm.
