This limits understanding of how neural circuits compute and perform tasks.  Moreover, designing effective photostimulation experiments to understand neural circuits is challenging due to the sheer size of the search space and the time-consuming nature of experiments. \nThis work addresses these challenges by developing active learning techniques that intelligently select which neurons to stimulate, optimizing data collection and causal inference.  The researchers use a low-rank linear dynamical systems model to capture the low-dimensional structure of neural population dynamics and propose an active learning procedure to choose informative photostimulation patterns. This method is demonstrated on both real and synthetic data, resulting in substantially more accurate estimates of neural population dynamics with fewer measurements than traditional passive methods.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "nLQeE8QGGe/podcast.wav"}
