The mismatch between the learned and assumed distributions motivates us to raise a fundamental yet under-explored question: Is it possible to deterministically model the feature distribution while pre-training a discriminative model?

However, real-world applications often entail scenarios in which deployed models may encounter unseen classes of samples during training, giving rise to what is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. These OOD instances can potentially undermine a model\u2019s stability and, in certain cases, inflict severe damage on its performance. Accordingly, a reliable discriminative model should not only correctly classify known In-Distribution (ID) samples but also flag any OOD input as \u201cunknown\u201d. This directly motivates OOD detection [31, 56, 74], which makes significant differences in ensuring the safety of decision-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving [26], medical diagnosis [85], and cyber-security [51]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Up to now, a plethora of OOD detection algorithms have been developed recently by leveraging post-hoc analysis on the pre-trained model. The seminal work [22] leverages the maximum softmax probability (MSP), also known as the softmax confidence score, for OOD detection, which is built upon the hypothesis that OOD data should trigger relatively lower softmax confidence than that of ID data. ODIN [35] extends MSP by using temperature scaling and input perturbation to amplify the ID/OOD separability. Approaches of this category, albeit intuitive, are challenged by the observation that deep neural networks are prone to produce over-confident predictions, i.e., abnormally high softmax confidences, even though the inputs are far away from the training data [50]. As a result, advanced methods turn to design alternative OOD scoring functions by resorting to the stored ID patterns in gradients [25], intermediate features [2, 34, 62, 36, 57, 76, 77] and logits [21, 38, 67, 78].

Despite the empirical success, the power of density-based OOD detection has yet to be fully unleashed even with the helm of feature-shaping [11, 59, 60, 72, 79, 80, 84] and neuron pruning [1, 61]. This is because current methods struggle with making a strong distributional assumption of the underlying feature space either explicitly or implicitly due to the lack of knowledge about the learned feature space in advance.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called Distributional Representation Learning (DRL) that bridges the gap between network pre-training and density-based scoring strategy. At a high level, we explicitly enforce the underlying feature space to conform to a pre-defined distribution, inspired by [41]. In this way, OOD detection can be naturally approached in an assumption-free manner, hence providing stronger flexibility and generality. When implementing our idea, it could always be non-trivial to parameterize the ID data distribution since the computation of normalization constants tends to be costly and even intractable [19]. Towards this dilemma, instead of introducing impractical constraints to make the normalization constants input-independent or known, we propose an online approximation of normalization constants to enable end-to-end training.

In the M-step, we propose to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log conditional likelihood with respect to all parameters so that the optimization process can not only benefti from the classification process but also avoid leading to trivial solutions. We prove that the ELBO is bounded, and the EM algorithm contributes to the convergence of ELBO.

For example, a latent feature $\\mathbf{z}$ can be far away from the corresponding class prototype $\\pmb{\\mu}_{y}$ while still being correctly classified as long as ${\\bf z}$ is relatively closer to $\\pmb{\\mu}_{y}$ than to other class prototypes. We, accordingly, mitigate this problem with the ELBO in Eq. (10) to explicitly measure the extent to which a training sample ftis the assumed distribution. Besides, these methods are limited by assuming the concentration parameter $\\epsilon_{k}$ to be class-uniform for a simplified computation of Eq.

By contrast, our method learns $\\epsilon_{k}$ directly through the prototype magnitudes while proposing an online approximation of the normalization constant $\\bar{\\pi}(\\hat{\\mu}_{k},\\bar{\\epsilon}_{k})$ to enable end-to-end training.

One line of work performs OOD detection by devising post-hoc scoring functions, including confidencebased methods [21, 38, 78], energy-based methods [37, 67], distance-based approaches [2, 34, 62, 36, 57, 76, 77], gradient-based approaches [25], and Bayesian approaches [29, 44]. Another line of work addresses OOD detection by fine-tuning a pre-trained discrimination model with training-time regularizations that help the model learn ID/OOD discrepancy following the guideline of outlier exposure [23] or negative prompts [53]. For instance, the discriminative model is regularized to produce lower confidence [33, 43], smaller feature magnitudes [37] or higher energy [10] for outlier points. More recently, some works have considered a practical scenario where the auxiliary outliers can be arbitrarily different from the real OOD data, therefore, distributionally augmenting the observed OOD data. Besides, the given OOD samples tend to include unlabelled ID counterparts [27]. In view of this, WOOD [27] formulates learning with noisy OOD samples as a constrained optimization problem while SAL [12] separates candidate outliers from the unlabeled data and then trains a binary classifier using the candidate outliers and the labeled ID data. Most regularization methods, unfortunately, assume the availability of auxiliary OOD data, not to mention resource-intensive re-training processes, while our method maintains the same training scheme as standard cross-entropy loss without requiring additional OOD data in training.

CIDER [46] proposes a prototypical contrastive learning framework for OOD detection by promoting stronger ID-OOD separability than SupCon loss, where a regularization strategy is to ensure that all samples are compactly located around their corresponding class prototype. PALM [40] extends CIDER by introducing a mixture of prototypes to represent each class and performing prototype-level contrastive learning to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class discrimination. This paper significantly differs from PALM and CIDER in the following two aspects: 1) we avoid normalizing the class prototypes to protect the generalization ability of the data distributional modeling, and 2) we learn a feature space that best describes the pre-defined distribution rather than features that preserve inter- and intra- class structures.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
