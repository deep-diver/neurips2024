The first is data generated from larger, more capable models (SFT data), and the second is data generated by the learner itself (RFT data).  Both datasets contain the same number of problems, but the RFT data only has one correct solution per problem, while the SFT data has multiple. Despite this difference, the results indicate that the RFT data results in better performance.", "section": "5 Positive Data Improves Coverage, But Amplifies Spurious Correlations"}]
