These scenarios are often modeled as latent Markov decision processes (LMDPs), but solving LMDPs efficiently has been a significant hurdle. Existing algorithms either require strong assumptions or suffer from the 'curse of horizon', meaning their performance degrades drastically as the time horizon increases. This research addresses these challenges.\nThis research introduces a novel algorithm that solves the exploration problem in LMDPs without any extra assumptions or distributional requirements. It does so by establishing a new theoretical connection between off-policy evaluation and exploration in LMDPs.  Specifically, they introduce a new coverage coefficient to analyze the performance of their algorithm, demonstrating its efficiency and near-optimality. This approach offers a fresh perspective that goes beyond the limitations of traditional methods, and the result is a sample-efficient algorithm with provably near-optimal guarantees.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "juJl2uSq4D/podcast.wav"}
