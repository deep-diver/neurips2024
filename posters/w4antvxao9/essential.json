This is because they don't inherently possess the motivation to optimize reasoning steps like humans do. This limitation hinders their ability to generalize and solve problems with increased efficiency. The researchers aimed to investigate whether this human-like step-skipping ability can be learned by language models. \nThe researchers introduced a controlled training framework to encourage models to generate shorter, accurate reasoning paths. They iteratively refined models by selectively incorporating successful step-skipping paths in training data.  Experiments across several datasets demonstrated that the models successfully developed the ability to skip steps. Importantly, the step-skipping behavior improved efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and even enhanced generalization capabilities. The findings provide fresh perspectives on developing human-like cognitive abilities in AI models and offer new avenues for advancing generalization abilities in language model reasoning.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "w4AnTVxAO9/podcast.wav"}
