Many VSAs were designed before deep learning became popular and thus do not easily integrate with modern deep learning systems. This limits their use in various applications. \nThis paper introduces the Hadamard-derived Linear Binding (HLB), a novel VSA designed for improved computational efficiency and numerical stability. **HLB uses the Walsh Hadamard transform to achieve linear time complexity**, avoiding the O(d log d) complexity associated with the Fourier transform used in other VSAs.  Experimental results show that HLB outperforms or matches existing VSAs in both classical VSA tasks and in deep-learning applications, such as extreme multi-label classification and a cryptographic privacy application.  **HLB is shown to be numerically stable and shows advantages in both classical and recent deep learning tasks.**", "affiliation": "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "p3hNrpeWMe/podcast.wav"}
