However, LLMs often struggle to accurately represent these sub-tasks and their dependencies as graphs, leading to planning failures. This paper investigates this issue and reveals that attention bias and auto-regressive loss hinder LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities. \nTo address this problem, the researchers propose a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with LLMs. GNNs are well-suited for processing graph structures, enabling more accurate task planning. Experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods significantly outperform existing LLM-only approaches, especially when dealing with larger task graphs. The performance gains show the effectiveness of integrating GNNs and LLMs, opening up new avenues for improving task planning in AI agents.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "bmoS6Ggw4j/podcast.wav"}
