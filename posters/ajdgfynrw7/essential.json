Existing algorithms primarily focus on improving data quality (label accuracy), neglecting model quality (prediction accuracy) which is the ultimate goal.  This often leads to suboptimal model performance despite high label accuracy.\nThe proposed IWBVT method tackles this by focusing on model quality. It introduces a novel instance weighting mechanism that reduces the impact of intractable instances. Then, it employs probabilistic loss regression to achieve a bias-variance trade-off, resulting in better generalization and significantly improved model accuracy. IWBVT demonstrates effectiveness as a universal post-processing method, enhancing existing label integration and noise correction algorithms. The findings highlight the importance of prioritizing model quality in crowdsourcing.", "affiliation": "China University of Geosciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Education"}, "podcast_path": "aJDGfynRw7/podcast.wav"}
