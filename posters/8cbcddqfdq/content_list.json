In this paper, we propose a method called Stratified Prediction-Powered Inference (StratPPI), in which we show that the basic PPI estimates can be considerably improved by employing simple data stratification strategies. Without making any assumptions on the underlying automatic labeling system or data distribution, we derive an algorithm for computing provably valid confidence intervals for population parameters (such as averages) that is based on stratified sampling. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that, with appropriate choices of stratification and sample allocation, our approach can provide substantially tighter confidence intervals than unstratified approaches. Specifically, StratPPI is expected to improve in cases where the performance of the autorater varies across different conditional distributions of the target data.

", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "One often-proposed approach to avoiding the evaluation bottleneck is to use a secondary LLM-based system to judge the output of the primary one. For instance, if the primary task is developing an LLM-based question-answering (QA) system, one can use a second LLM-based system that rates question/answer pairs as acceptable or not [6; 8; 17]. However, automated raters (i.e., autoraters) may be biased relative to the human raters they are intended to model, as others have noted [1; 9; 18; 23]. This can become substantially worse when models are tailored to hill climb on the autorater metrics, and eventually cease to become a good metric at all\u2014a phenomenon commonly referred to as Goodhart\u2019s law, or reward hacking in the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback [13; 24]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "We thus have two signals for assessing model performance. The first is human labels, which are typically accurate, but expensive to collect. As a result, usually only a small sample size is available, and an estimate based on these samples alone will have high variance. The second is autorater predictions, which are easy to collect for large sample sizes, but may also be systematically biased. The above may suggest that one must make a choice between either (i) a high-variance, but unbiased, estimate from a small human sample, or (ii) a lower-variance, but biased, autorater-based estimate. However, it turns out there are also statistically valid ways of combining the auto-rater and human data for hybrid evaluations. Following [1; 3; 7] we call such methods prediction-powered inference (PPI) methods. At a high level, PPI-based methods operate by using a small sample of examples labeled by both humans and autoraters to estimate the bias of the autorater. This bias is then used as a rectifier for the autorater estimate. The resulting estimate can then be shown to provide improved (i.e., tighter) confidence intervals for properties of interest for the system being evaluated, such as its true mean accuracy.

For example, in our QA setting, an autorater may have one accuracy when predicting if a model answer is correct, and a different accuracy when predicting if it is incorrect. This is especially true in cases where a correct answer is easy to verify (e.g., it is also present in Wikipedia), but harder to refute (e.g., no relevant external search results can be retrieved to either support or contradict it). In these settings, it may make sense to apply a different PPI strategy within each subdomain, depending on the local quality of the autorater. Moreover, we claim that such heterogenous settings are to be quite expected in practical applications. Inspired by the rich prior literature on stratified sampling and survey design [12; 19; 21], we therefore propose a stratified approach to PPI, and show that it can be very advantageous when performance varies across subdomains, for either the autorater, or the model being evaluated. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "On a technical level, it is not immediately clear how to apply stratification to PPI, as it involves two types of samples: one sample that is labeled by both humans and an autorater, and another (typically much larger) sample that is only labeled by the autorater. Extending the analysis of [3], in this work we show how confidence intervals based on the asymptotic normality of weighted M-estimators [32] can in fact be derived for the stratified PPI setting. The next challenge we address is how to determine the sample sizes used for stratification (i.e., the sample size of each stratum). Similar to recent work for active statistical inference [37], we further derive optimal rates that depend on certain moments of the underlying distribution that are generally unknown\u2014and provide an approach for effectively approximating these. Finally, we provide extensive empirical evidence showing that our stratified approach (StratPPI) leads to considerably improved confidence intervals over both classical inference methods that use only human labels, and the baseline (unstratified) PPI approach.

Related ideas were explored by [30], but with a focus on bootstrapping as a way for obtaining confidence intervals. PPI was then extended in several directions. For example [36] showed how the labeled data can be used for both estimating the parameters and the autorater model. $\\mathsf{P P I}^{++}$ [3] showed how to obtain confidence intervals that are easy to compute efficiently, and introduced a parameter for weighting the predictions of the autorater such that the overall statistical efficiency can be improved. As noted in previous works on PPI, these approaches are closely related to other statistical methods for introducing control variates based on autoevaluators [9], as well as augmented inverse propensity weighting [27] (see discussion in [1; 3]). Like this paper, prior work has also focused on using $\\mathsf{P P I/P P I++}$ for evaluating machine learning systems with autoraters, including for ranking chatbots in the Chatbot Arena [7] and evaluating retrieval-augmented generation systems [28].

Specifically, it proposes to label examples for which the autorater is less confident in its predictions, and corrects for the sampling bias with a variant of inverse propensity weighting. In contrast, our somewhat simplified approach takes inspiration from stratified sampling where a coarse stratification is defined in advance, and the total number of labeled samples is constant. Like [37], we derive an analogous optimal allocation strategy for a given budget, though we only apply it at the stratum level, and not for individual examples. Furthermore, while the variable allocation helps reduce variance in heterogenous settings, our stratified treatment also allows for a stratum-specific extension of [3]\u2019s estimated tuning parameters that further improves performance in complementary ways.

That said, clearly one approach to improving PPI is to use a better-calibrated classifier, perhaps by taking some of the labeled data and using it for re-calibration.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
