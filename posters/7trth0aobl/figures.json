Subfigure (a) and (b) display the episodic returns for different state and horizon sizes. Subfigure (c) compares the runtime of the algorithms for 1000 episodes.  The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform UCRL-MNL in terms of both episodic return and computational efficiency.  ORRL-MNL and UCRL-MNL+ converge faster to optimal performance than RRL-MNL and UCRL-MNL.", "section": "5 Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "7tRtH0AoBl/figures/figures_69_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Riverswim experiment results", "description": "The figure shows the experimental results of the Riverswim environment.
