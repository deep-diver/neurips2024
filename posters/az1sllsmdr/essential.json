However, existing methods have limitations such as high computational costs or suboptimal design choices.  These limitations hinder the scalability and overall effectiveness of dataset condensation, especially for large datasets.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel framework, Elucidating Dataset Condensation (EDC), that addresses these issues.  EDC uses a **uni-level optimization paradigm** with **carefully chosen design choices**, including **soft category-aware matching and a smoothing learning rate schedule**. These techniques lead to a **state-of-the-art performance** on several benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, especially on large datasets such as ImageNet-1k.  The researchers provide both **empirical evidence and theoretical analysis** to support their design choices.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "az1SLLsmdR/podcast.wav"}
