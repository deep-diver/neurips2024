Traditionally, various heuristic methods [9] were used to identify new links by encapsulating the pairwise relationship between two nodes. For instance, the Common Neighbors (CN) heuristic [10] counts the number of shared neighbors between a node pair, postulating that the number of common neighbors can indicate the likelihood of a connection. The Katz index [11] considers the total number of paths between two nodes, assigning a higher weight to those shorter in length.

Our preliminary studies in Section 3 have shown that different heuristics tend to complement each other, and employing multiple heuristics within the same dataset can lead to improved link prediction performance. Therefore, methods relying on a single type of heuristic might not be optimal.

They attempt to explicitly model the pairwise information between a node pair via hand-crafted measures. Several classes of heuristics exist for link prediction [17] including: local structural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. Local Structural Proximity (LSP): These method extract the information in the local neighborhood of a node pair. Common Neighbors (CN) [10], AdamicAdar (AA) [18], and Resource Allocation [19] are popular measures that consider the number of shared 1-hop neighbors between the node pair. Global Structural Proximity (GSP): These methods attempt to model the interaction of a node pair by extracting the global graph information. The Shortest Path Distance assumes that a shorter distance between nodes results in a higher likelihood of them connecting. Both Katz Index [11] and Personalized Pagerank (PPR) [20] consider the paths of disparate length that connect both nodes, giving a higher weight to those shorter paths. Feature Proximity (FP): FP measures the similarity of the node features for both nodes in the pair, positing that nodes with similar features are more likely to form edges.

However, multiple works [7, 8] have shown that node-based representations are unable to properly model link prediction. As such, newer methods, which we refer to as GNN4LP, attempt to learn pairwise representations to facilitate link prediction. Both SEAL [7] and NBFNet [16] condition the GNN aggregation on either both or one of the two nodes in the pair. While expressive, both methods tend to be prohibitively expensive as they require aggregating messages separately for each node pair. Recent methods [14, 13, 26, 27] have attempts to devise more efficient ways of learning pairwise representations by injecting pairwise information in the score function, bypassing the need of customizing the GNN aggregation to each node pair.

This improvement underscores the pivotal role of the gating model, which intelligently leverages heuristic information to enhance the overall performance. In this subsection, we delve into the impact of various heuristics utilized by the gating model in Link-MoE. Specifically, there are three types of heuristics: local structure proximity (e.g., CN, AA, RA), global structure proximity (e.g., Shortest Path, Katz), and feature proximity. We design experiments to isolate the effect of specific types of heuristics by including them either individually or in groups. For instance, utilizing only feature proximity is referred to as \u2018OnlyFeat\u2019, combining local and global structure proximities is labeled \u2018OnlyStruct\u2019, employing only local structure proximity is denoted \u2018OnlyLocalStruct\u2019, and using only global structure proximity is marked \u2018OnlyGlobalStruct\u2019. Additionally, the \u2018All\u2019 is used to indicate leveraging all heuristics. The results on Pubmed and ogbl-ppa datasets are shown in Figure 6. From the experimental results, several observations can be made: (1) Using only the feature proximity (OnlyFeat) or only the global structural proximity (OnlyGlobalStruct) typically yields lower performance. (2) Combining the local and global structure proximity (OnlyStruct) tends to outperform using either one alone. (3) The effectiveness of feature proximity varies between datasets. On Pubmed, it is beneficial to include it but not on ogbl-ppa. This discrepancy could stem from the relative importance of feature information in each dataset, as suggested by the very poor performance of MLP on ogbl-ppa, whose Hits $@100$ is only around 0.45. Moreover, we explore different inputs for the gating model, the results are presented in Appendix I, which highlights the rationality of the design of our gating model.

Similar to Section 3, we categorize the test node pairs into distinct groups according to different heuristics. Subsequently, for each group, we compute the average weights assigned to each expert by the gating model. The results based on Common Neighbors for ogbl-collab and ogbl-ppa are shown in Figure 8. We can have some interesting findings: (1): For the ogbl-collab dataset, when the node pair doesn\u2019t have common neighbor, the gating model usually assigns a large weight to the MLP model, which aligns the analysis in Section 3 that the MLP can perform well when there is no CN on ogbl-collab. However, For the ogbl-ppa dataset, when there is no common neighbor, the gating model would assign a high weight to NCNC. This preference arises because node features hold less significance in the ogbl-ppa dataset and NCNC can leverage multi-hop common neighbor information. (2): As the number of common neighbors increases, the gating model increasingly allocates more weight to the NCN. This shift reflects the NCN\u2019s capability to efficiently capture and utilize common neighbor information. (3): Not every expert model contributes much to the prediction. This selective engagement is attributed to the overlapping capabilities of certain models. For instance, both Neo-GNN and NCNC are capable of exploiting multi-hop information. In such cases, the gating model opts for one over the other to avoid redundancy and optimize prediction efficacy. This phenomenon is also consistent with the results in Section 5.4 that removing one expert doesn\u2019t affect the overall performance.

But in Link-MoE, Neo-GNN has very low weights on the ogbl-collab dataset.

We use the binary cross entropy loss to train each model. The loss is optimized using the Adam optimizer [55]. At first, we train all of the expert models by using the hyperparameters suggested in this repository \\*. We then do the inference to obtain the prediction score for each link. Secondly, in order to train Link-MoE, we split the original validation dataset into a new training set and validation set. Thirdly, we train the gating model until it converges and choose the model weights associated with the best validation performance. The rationale for utilizing a portion of the validation set to train the gating model is as follows: Given that each expert model is finely tuned on the training data, there exists a significant disparity between the prediction scores for positive and negative edges within this dataset. Should the original training set be employed to train our gating model, the outcome would be skewed\u2014regardless of the gating model\u2019s outputs, predicted scores for positive pairs would invariably remain substantially higher than those for negative pairs. Therefore, to train the gating model effectively, we repurpose the original validation set as our training data, dividing it into new training and validation subsets. Unlike baseline models, which are trained exclusively on the original training set, our method benefits from incorporating a very small validation set compared to the training set into the training process for the gating model, yielding notable performance improvements. Despite this modification, the comparison remains relatively fair. The original validation set is relatively small, so using a portion of it for training does not significantly alter the amount of data available. Thus, the baseline models remain essentially equivalent, even with this adjustment.
