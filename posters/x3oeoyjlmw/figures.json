The model consists of two main components: a gating model and multiple expert models.  The gating model takes heuristic information (local structure proximity, global structure proximity, and feature proximity) as input and produces normalized weights for each expert model. These weights determine the contribution of each expert to the final prediction. The expert models are various GNN4LP models which produce their own probability for link existence. The final output is a weighted sum of the expert models' predictions which is passed through a sigmoid function. The gating model itself is composed of two MLPs, one for feature-based heuristics and one for structural heuristics. These two branches are concatenated and passed through a final MLP with a softmax activation.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "X3oeoyJlMw/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Hits @K of combined heuristics.", "description": "The figure shows the Hits@K values for different combinations of heuristics (Common Neighbors, Shortest Path, and Feature Cosine Similarity) on the Citeseer and ogbl-collab datasets.
