Its open-sourced code and models also accelerate progress in this area.", "summary": "4M-21 achieves any-to-any predictions across 21 diverse vision modalities using a single model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art performance.", "takeaways": ["A single model achieved any-to-any predictions across 21 diverse vision modalities.", "The approach outperforms existing models while handling a significantly larger number of tasks and modalities.", "The model's code and weights are open-sourced, accelerating research progress in the field."], "tldr": "Current multimodal models struggle with handling diverse modalities and tasks, often showing reduced performance compared to single-task models.  This is due to challenges like negative transfer and difficulty balancing losses across various tasks.  Existing models typically work with a small set of modalities, limiting their versatility.\nThis paper introduces 4M-21, a novel any-to-any vision model trained on 21 diverse modalities.  It addresses the limitations of existing models by using a multimodal masked pre-training scheme, employing modality-specific tokenizers, and leveraging co-training on large-scale datasets.  **The model's ability to handle diverse modalities without performance loss is a key contribution**, surpassing the capabilities of existing models.  **Its open-sourced nature further accelerates research and development** in the field.", "affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "qRnmLJQHgx/podcast.wav"}
