Moreover, training a single network on tasks and modalities that vary greatly in terms of dimensionality, data type, and value ranges presents additional complexities\u2020. Recent notable efforts in the space of multimodal and multitask training, such as Pix2Seq [17, 18], OFA [93], 4M [65], or Unified-IO [61, 60] have made significant strides in unifying the representation space for conceptually different inputs and targets. A large part of their success can be attributed to transforming different modalities into a common representation, namely sequences of discrete tokens, and training relatively standard Transformer architectures on them.

These methods first transform various modalities and tasks into sequences or sets of discrete tokens [24, 52, 66, 31, 95], and then train a single Transformer on these tokens using either a sequence modeling [74, 93, 61, 17, 18, 51, 83] or masked modeling objective [65, 94]. Some methods (e.g. Gato [74], UnifiedIO [61, 60]) perform co-training on multiple disjoint datasets and are capable of performing a wide range of tasks, but not jointly. In contrast, methods like 4M [65] train on a single aligned dataset through the use of pseudo labeling, enabling any-to-any modality prediction but on a typically more limited set of modalities. We significantly expand upon them by adding the ability to use this framework for an even greater amount of modalities and capabilities.

In general, compared to LLMs, vision/multimodal models have not shown exciting results in terms of transfer/emergence yet.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
