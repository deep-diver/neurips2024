This limits their applicability to many real-world problems.  The significant cost associated with training these models and the large memory requirement for inference creates a major bottleneck. \n\nTo address these issues, the researchers developed PaDIS, a patch-based diffusion inverse solver. PaDIS trains a diffusion model on image patches instead of whole images, significantly reducing both computational cost and data requirements.  Importantly, it leverages positional encoding to generate complete, high-resolution images during inference, while maintaining high accuracy in solving various inverse problems such as CT reconstruction, deblurring, and super-resolution.  The results demonstrate PaDIS's superior performance, particularly with limited training data, showcasing its data efficiency.", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "HGnxhHz6ss/podcast.wav"}
