Accurately estimating the underlying state (dynamics) from these observations is challenging due to computational cost and instability of existing methods.  Traditional techniques like the extended Kalman filter (EKF) are often too slow or unstable for such complex scenarios.\nThis paper introduces GIN, a novel algorithm that solves these problems by efficiently approximating Bayesian inference for state-space models. GIN achieves this by disentangling the observations and their dynamics, using a compact recurrent neural network structure, and employing a specialized training method to handle exploding gradients.  Experimental results demonstrate GIN's superior performance on several benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in state estimation and missing data imputation.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "z4duW3KzlD/podcast.wav"}
