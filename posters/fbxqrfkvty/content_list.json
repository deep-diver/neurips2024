Many attempts have been made to understand in-context learning in LLMs as a function of model scale, pretraining data, and other factors. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to probe and understand in-context learning from the lens of decision boundaries for in-context binary classification. Decision boundaries are straightforward to visualize and provide important information about the qualitative behavior of the inductive biases of standard classifiers. To our surprise, we find that the decision boundaries learned by current LLMs in simple binary classification tasks are often irregular and non-smooth, regardless of linear separability in the underlying task. This paper investigates the factors influencing these decision boundaries and explores methods to enhance their generalizability. We assess various approaches, including training-free and fine-tuning methods for LLMs, the impact of model architecture, and the effectiveness of active prompting techniques for smoothing decision boundaries in a data-efficient manner.

A key emergent behavior of these transformer-based models is in-context learning, which allows the model to learn tasks by conditioning on a sequence of demonstrations without explicit training [Wei et al., 2022].

For each sequence of data points $\\{(x_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ from a task $C$ , TNPs learn to predict the query labels $y_{i>m}$ given the query inputs $x_{i>m}$ and the context pairs, assuming ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "image", "img_path": "FbXQrfkvtY/tmp/03ee2f7d4c183ae92634ad04b87eda7c2f2c705ca28aed4dc815c6810e53a53a.jpg", "img_caption": ["(a) Decision boundaries before SFT on linear data of Llama3-8b across 4 tasks.

Uncertainty is measured as the entropy of the probability distribution of the two classes after softmax normalization of the logits. Our study focuses on an active learning scheme where new in-context examples are incrementally added based on the LLM\u2019s current uncertainty. Initially, we obtain the decision boundary conditioned on the existing in-context examples. To refine this boundary, we query the LLM over a grid and select the top- $\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{k}$ most uncertain points, ensuring they are spatially distant from each other using a greedy sampling approach. For labeling these uncertain points, we use a logistic regression model well-trained on a larger dataset with perfect accuracy as the ground truth decision boundary. As shown in Figure 11, this uncertainty-aware active sampling method results in a smoother decision boundary over iterations compared to random sampling. The iterative refinement enhances the model\u2019s generalization capabilities, leading to higher test set accuracies and greater sample efficiency, requiring fewer additional in-context examples to achieve performance gains. These findings indicate that leveraging the LLM\u2019s uncertainty measurements is valuable for selecting new in-context examples in resource-constrained settings where labeled data is scarce.

[2024] observe that with the optimal parameters, the transformer implements a single step of preconditioned gradient descent, while Zhang et al. [2023] shows that at the global optimum, the transformer achieves competitive prediction error with the best linear predictor on a new prediction task. In addition to theoretical connections to GD, a complementary direction aims to establish statistical complexity and generalization bounds of in-context learning in transformers [Bai et al., 2024, Li et al., 2023b, Wies et al., 2024, Wu et al., 2023].

Min et al.

Shi et al. [2023] investigate the distractibility of LLMs and shows that their performance dramatically drops when irrelevant context is included. Subsequently, Wei et al. [2023] characterize these behaviors of LLMs with respect to model size, and show that larger language models perform in-context learning differently in the presence of flipped or semantically unrelated labels. Webson and Pavlick [2022] argue against the current practice of prompt engineering, showing that intentionally irrelevant or even pathologically misleading prompts achieve similar downstream performance to instructively good prompts. Orthogonally, Lampinen et al. [2022] find that including explanations in the in-context examples significantly improves the few-shot performance of LLMs. Finally, given the expanded context windows of modern LLMs, recent works have explored in-context learning in the many-shot setting with hundreds or thousands of examples [Agarwal et al., 2024, Li et al., 2023a, Bertsch et al., 2024].

While any dimensionality reduction technique inevitably introduces confounding factors, this approach allows us to extend our analysis to more complex, real-world scenarios. Our experiments encompass six widely-used NLP classification tasks, covering both binary and multi-class settings. These include Subjective/Obejective sentence classification (SUBJ) [Conneau and Kiela, 2018], financial sentiment analysis (FP) [Malo et al., 2014], textual entailment recognition (RTE) [Wang et al., 2019], hate speech detection (ETHOS) [Mollas et al., 2020], sentiment analysis (SST-2) [Socher et al., 2013] and news topic classification (AG_NEWS) [Zhang et al., 2015]. The results, presented in Figure 17, demonstrate that the non-smooth decision boundary characteristics observed in our synthetic datasets persist in these more complex NLP tasks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
