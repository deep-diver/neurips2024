The performance is evaluated using two metrics: Human Preference Score (HPS) and ImageReward (IR).  Higher HPS and IR values indicate better performance.  The table shows that MOLE consistently outperforms the baseline models on both benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in human-centric image generation.  Results are shown for MOLE using both Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL as base models.", "section": "5.1 Evaluation Benchmarks and Metrics"}, {"figure_path": "XWzw2dsjWd/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study on each stage using COCO Human Prompts.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study conducted on the COCO Human Prompts benchmark. The study evaluates the impact of each stage in the proposed MoLE method on the model's performance.  The metrics used are Human Preference Score (HPS) and ImageReward (IR). The rows represent different configurations of the model: SD v1.5 (baseline), SD v1.5 + Stage 1 (fine-tuning on human-centric dataset), SD v1.5 + Stage 1 + Stage 2 (adding low-rank experts), and SD v1.5 + Stage 1 + Stage 2 + Stage 3 (adding soft mixture assignment). The columns show the HPS and IR scores for each configuration. The table aims to demonstrate the contribution of each stage to the overall performance of the model.", "section": "5.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "XWzw2dsjWd/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation study on assignment manner using COCO Human Prompts.", "description": "This table presents the ablation study results on different assignment manners in the MoLE model, specifically focusing on the COCO Human Prompts benchmark. It compares the performance of using only local assignment, only global assignment, and both local and global assignments.  The metrics used are Human Preference Score (HPS) and ImageReward (IR), both showing how well the generated images align with human preferences. The results demonstrate the impact of incorporating both local and global assignment strategies in improving image quality compared to using only one.", "section": "5.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "XWzw2dsjWd/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Comparisons between MoLE and SD v1.5 on CLIP-T, FID, and Aesthetic Score.", "description": "This table compares the performance of MoLE and SD v1.5 on three different metrics: CLIP-T, FID, and Aesthetic Score.  The CLIP-T score measures the alignment between image and text caption. FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) quantifies the similarity between the generated images and real images. Finally, Aesthetic Score evaluates the aesthetic quality of generated images. The results show that MoLE outperforms SD v1.5 on CLIP-T and FID but performs slightly worse on Aesthetic Score.", "section": "5.2 Main Results"}]
