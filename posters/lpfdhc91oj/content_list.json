However, practical applications do not always require the classification of all kinds of objects, and leaving the model capable of recognizing unnecessary classes not only degrades overall accuracy but also leads to operational disadvantages. To mitigate this issue, we explore the selective forgetting problem for PTMs, where the task is to make the model unable to recognize only the specified classes while maintaining accuracy for the rest. All the existing methods assume \u201cwhite-box\u201d settings, where model information such as architectures, parameters, and gradients is available for training. However, PTMs are often \u201cblack-box,\u201d where information on such models is unavailable for commercial reasons or social responsibilities. In this paper, we address a novel problem of selective forgetting for black-box models, named Black-Box Forgetting, and propose an approach to the problem. Given that information on the model is unavailable, we optimize the input prompt to decrease the accuracy of specified classes through derivative-free optimization. To avoid difficult high-dimensional optimization while ensuring high forgetting performance, we propose Latent Context Sharing, which introduces common low-dimensional latent components among multiple tokens for the prompt.

Nevertheless, in practical applications, the classification of all kinds of object classes is rarely required. For example, in an autonomous driving system, it would be sufficient to recognize limited classes of objects such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs. We would not need to recognize food, furniture, or animal species. Retaining the classes that do not need to be recognized may decrease overall classification accuracy, as well as cause operational disadvantages such as the waste of computational resources and the risk of information leakage. In this paper, we address the problem of selective forgetting of specified classes [Shibata et al., 2021, Graves et al., 2021, Ye et al., 2022, Tarun et al., 2023], i.e., tuning a pre-trained model to reduce the classification accuracy for only the specified classes without affecting the accuracy for the others1. While selective forgetting of specified classes has long been overlooked [Ye et al., 2022], a few existing methods have been proposed very recently [Shibata et al., 2021, Ye et al., 2022, Tarun et al., 2023]. The seminal work is Learning with Selective Forgetting (LSF) [Shibata et al., 2021], which has been proposed in the context of continual learning [Kirkpatrick et al., 2017, Li and Hoiem, 2017, Aljundi et al., 2018] and uses a special random code called mnemonic code to control the class-wise memorization and forgetting. A similar idea has been proposed to achieve forgetting by learning noise that maximizes the classification error for the classes to be forgotten [Tarun et al., 2023]. An extended version of LSF [Ye et al., 2022] allows forgetting of specified classes as well as recovery of them by temporarily transferring the knowledge of the classes to be forgotten to another network called deposit module.

One disadvantage of derivative-free optimization would be that it is not effective nor efficient for high-dimensional problems due to the low convergence rate in high-dimensional spaces [Qian et al., 2016], and unfortunately, the textual prompt is typically parameterized as a set of high-dimensional vectors in PTMs, e.g., 512-D for each \u201ccontext\u201d (i.e., learnable token in the prompt) in CLIP ViT-B/16 [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021].

Due to the nature of multi-point search, the performance of CMA-ES degrades in high-dimensional problems, typically ten or more dimensions [Ros and Hansen, 2008, Akimoto and Hansen, 2016]. While several extensions have been proposed, e.g., [Ros and Hansen, 2008, Akimoto and Hansen, 2016], these methods require knowledge of independence among variables, which is not always known.

The key idea is to assume shared parameters among different latent contexts.

This inspires the idea of explicitly modeling semantic correlations between words in a prompt as shared components. We assume that each latent context is composed of unique components (Unique Latent Contexts (ULC)) and common components (Shared Latent Context (SLC)) among multiple latent contexts 2. Then, we optimize each ULC and SLC independently.

Sep-CMA-ES realizes the computational complexity $O(d)$ that is linear with respect to the number of dimensions by restricting the covariance matrix to a diagonal matrix. In other words, the solution generation distribution of Sep-CMA-ES does not consider the covariance between variables, but only the variance of each variable.

Toward addressing the \u201cRight to be Forgotten\u201d: It should comply with the request that if a service provider is asked to remove information so that their model cannot recognize certain information. This can be accomplished by training the model from scratch by removing samples of that class from the training data. However, retraining a large-scale model consumes an enormous amount of energy, which should be avoided. Selective forgetting may provide an efficient solution to this problem.   \n2. Toward efficient large-scale pre-trained models: Improving the efficiency of large-scale pretrained models is of current interest to many researchers. Various attempts have been made such as model compression and architecture optimization (e.g., https://sites.google. com/view/elvm/program). Meanwhile, as the \u201cscaling law\u201d indicates, the reasonable size of a model correlates with the amount of knowledge it memorizes. Therefore, if the number of classes (amount of knowledge) that can be recognized by the model is limited, the model can be scaled down accordingly, thereby improving the efficiency of the model. This contributes to expanding the applicability of large-scale pre-trained models.   \n3. Toward better control over text-to-image generation: While diffusion-based text-to-image generation can generate diverse types of high-quality images, controlling the content of images remains a challenge. Recent research has focused on \u201cforgetting\u201d visual concepts in order to avoid generating undesirable content [Graves et al., 2021, Lu et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024]. These methods forget certain classes by directly fine-tuning the diffusion model, but tuning the diffusion model itself is often costly. In contrast, given that typical generative models use a text encoder of a pre-trained VLM (e.g., CLIP) for conditioning, our method may provide an efficient approach to class forgetting by fine-tuning only the prompts of the text encoder.
