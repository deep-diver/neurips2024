However, it is often difficult to enforce explicit encoding of these semantics within model representations, and it is even harder to interpret these semantics post hoc to better understand what models may have learnt and how they leverage this information. Further, model representations can be brittle, encoding idiosyncratic patterns specific to individual datasets and modalities instead of general human-interpretable semantic information. Multimodal models have been proposed as a potential solution to this issue, and methods such as CLIP [1] have empirically been found to provide highly performant, semantically rich representations of image data. The richness of these representations is evident from their high performance on a variety of tasks, such as zero-shot classification and image retrieval [1], image captioning [2], and image generation [3].

Recent work [31] combines these methods, using dictionary learning to extract visual concept activations, whose semantics can be identified via feature visualization. Work in disentangled representation learning has developed architectures that capture independent factors of variation in data [8, 32, 33, 5, 34, 35], allowing for manual probing of disentangled representations for humaninterpretable concepts. In both mechanistic interpretability and disentangled representation learning, methods typically rely on labeled concept sets, manual labeling of visualizations, or computationally intensive searches over data and latent representations or neurons to identify concepts.

To do so, we formulate decomposition as a sparse recovery problem with three main desiderata. First, for the decompositions to be interpretable to humans they must be comprised of human interpretable atoms. We argue that language is a naturally interpretable interface for humans, and construct our concept vocabulary $\\mathbf{C}$ out of 1- and 2-word atoms, such as \u201ccoffee\u201d, \u201csilver\u201d, and \u201cbirthday party\u201d. Second, our decompositions must be simple and concise, which can be formulated as a sparsity constraint on the recovery. A large body of work in computational linguistics [43, 44, 45, 14], neuroscience [46, 47], and interpretability [48, 49, 30] have demonstrated that a human-aligned semantic model should be sparse in representation. Furthermore, [48] found that users can best understand explanations with fewer than 32 concepts while in linguistics, [50, 51, 52] find participants describe concepts and objects with up to 20 semantic properties, motivating our desiderata of sparsity. Third, our decompositions must be constructive, i.e., we must decompose representations in terms of their constituent concepts. For this reason, we require the weights of decompositions to be strictly nonnegative, to avoid having \u201cnegative\u201d concept weights which do not always carry semantic meaning. Furthermore, prior work by Zhou et al. [30] has argued that \u201cnegations of concepts are not as interpretable as positive concepts.\u201d More specifically, while a small set of concepts have well-defined antonyms which may be viewed as their negative counterparts $(^{\\epsilon}{^{\\epsilon}}{\\mathsf{d a y}}^{,\\ast}\\leftrightarrow{^{\\epsilon}}{^{\\mathrm{night}}}^{,\\ast})$ ), negative concepts do not carry semantic meaning in general $({\\sqrt{\\cdot\\!\\;}}\\!\\!\\cdot\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\,\\!\\;\\!\\cdot\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\,\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\;\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!}}}\\,\\,\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\!\\!\\,\\!\\! $ ).

All vocabularies are of size 15,000 concepts. The random vocabulary is sampled from a 512-dimensional normalized Gaussian distribution. The learned vocabularies are generated by using the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) [62] to learn optimal dictionaries given our sparse recovery problem (optimizing Equation (1) for both $\\mathbf{C}$ and $w$ ). Note that we learn separate dictionaries $\\mathbf{C}_{\\mathrm{{img}}}$ and $\\mathbf{C}_{\\mathrm{text}}$ to reconstruct MSCOCO image and text embeddings respectively.

We believe this is because CLIP encodes both semantics of the underlying image and non-semantic \"noise\", which violates Assumption $\\#2$ in Section 3. Given that our SpLiCE decompositions only aim to encode semantics, they are unable to encode non-semantic aspects in the underlying representation, thus causing poor alignment in the cosine similarity sense, while simultaneously exhibiting excellent alignment on semantic tasks such as zero-shot accuracy.

The first two metrics are the same as those presented in Figure 3. We compute semantic relevance by tokenizing and filtering stop-words from the MSCOCO human-generated captions and embedding each token with CLIP. Then, we take all non-zero concepts output by SpLiCE and compute the Hausdorff distance between the sets of SpLiCE concepts and caption token embeddings. This essentially measures how aligned decompositions are with human captions. We observe that replacing our dictionary with the LLM-generated concept dictionary used by [22, 24, 23] significantly worsens the decomposition in terms of zero shot accuracy and cosine reconstruction. While allowing for negative concept weights improves cosine reconstruction marginally, it decreases the semantic relevance of the decompositions, as negative concepts frequently correspond to concepts not present in images, and as such, are unlikely to be represented by human captions. Finally, we see that modality alignment is necessary across all three metrics.

Existing methods to detect spurious correlations in datasets generally require subgroup and attribute labels or rely on manual human inspection of images (see [63] for an overview), making it hard to scale to large datasets. SpLiCE , on the other hand, allows for fast automatic detection of such biases, without any labels, training, or even a task. To illustrate this, we study two classes of CIFAR100: \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019, in Figure 4. Upon decomposing these classes, we found that {\u201cbra\u201d,\u201cswimwear\u201d } were two of the top ten most common concepts in the \u2018woman\u2019 class. On the other hand, the only clothing-related concepts that appear in the top 50 most activated concepts for \u2018man\u2019 are {\u201cuniform\u201d, \u201ctuxedo\u201d, \u201capparel\u201d}.

Manual inspection of CIFAR100 verifies the trend highlighted by SpLiCE, where at least 70 of the 600 images in the \u2018woman\u2019 class feature women in bikinis, underclothes, or even partially undressed, revealing stereotype bias in this popular dataset.

We note that this dictionary was constructed by looking at token frequency in the LAION-5B dataset, which has its own biases and may not correctly capture all the salient concepts that CLIP encodes.
