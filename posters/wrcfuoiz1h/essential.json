However, obtaining accurate similarity measures can be expensive and noisy in many real-world applications.  Existing query-efficient methods often assume a binary (0/1) similarity and a noise-free oracle, limiting their applicability. \nThis paper tackles the challenge by introducing novel online learning formulations rooted in Pure Exploration in Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (PE-CMAB), allowing for real-valued noisy similarity measures.  The authors propose two algorithms, KC-FC (fixed confidence) and KC-FB (fixed budget), which combine a sampling strategy with a classic approximation algorithm for correlation clustering.  Theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on query complexity and approximation guarantees.  Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods.", "affiliation": "CENTAI Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "WRCFuoiz1h/podcast.wav"}
