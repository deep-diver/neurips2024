Specifically, the distribution of cosine similarity of the watermarked model on the dataset-specified target class has significantly larger values than that of the remaining (benign) classes.

Motivated by these intriguing findings, we propose to conduct dataset ownership verification with closest boundary samples instead of samples containing dataset-specified watermarks (as shown in Figure 1). We call this method as ZeroMark. Specifically, our ZeroMark has three main steps. In the first step, ZeroMark generates the closest boundary version of given benign samples.

However, secure inference requires both the client and server to encrypt input data and adapt the machine learning model\u2019s operations accordingly through cryptographic mechanisms [27, 28].

", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Firstly, we must admit that our method requires additional time to conduct ownership verification since it needs to generate some boundary samples and their gradients under the black-box setting. For example, it takes nearly 30 mins for verification on CIFAR-10. While this cost is acceptable in practice to a large extent, we will discuss how to accelerate our ZeroMark in our future work.

Moreover, through extensive experimental evaluation, ZeroMark is shown to perform more effectively for Blended watermark, compared with other watermark techniques. Such observations inspire us to improve the effectiveness of ZeroMark by designing the potential watermark patterns in a blended manner. Finally, the boundary gradient analysis step in ZeroMark may incur variance among different labels\u2019 samples. In practice, we can release such variance by training a surrogate model with the protected dataset and calculating cosine similarity between the corresponding boundary gradients and the target watermark pattern with samples from different labels. Then we use the calculated cosine similarity using samples from different labels under the surrogate model to adjust the cosine similarity calculated under the suspicious model. Specifically, we can adjust the cosine similarity calculated with samples from a specific label $t$ by subtracting it from the average cosine similarity calculated with samples from the same label $t$ under the surrogate model. We will further discuss these issues in our future work.

Based on existing work related to backdoor attacks/dataset watermarking [42, 9] and adversarial attacks [43, 44], these factors are all met. As such, our method can fundamentally generalize to other models (e.g., transformer) as well. As for the generalizability to other (discrete) data formats like tabular or text, the main challenge lies in how to design effective adversarial attacks to them for finding the closest boundary samples (as in Eq.(10)). In particular, there are already some relevant works [45, 46] confirming its feasibility. Accordingly, our ZeroMark can be naturally adapted to other discrete data formats (e.g., text and scientific data [47, 48, 49, 50, 51]). We will discuss them in our future work.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
