Finding these schedules usually involves manual trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and may not yield optimal results. This research addresses this significant issue. \n\nThe researchers propose a novel algorithm that automatically learns the optimal schedules by minimizing a newly defined 'cost' function. This cost function reflects the computational work needed to accurately simulate the model's sampling process. Importantly, the algorithm is efficient, data-dependent, and doesn't require parameter tuning. Experiments on various datasets show that it recovers previously known optimal schedules and achieves competitive results, highlighting its potential to improve the efficiency and quality of DDMs.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "0rl5vWOzRU/podcast.wav"}
