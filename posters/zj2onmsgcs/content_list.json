As a result, the presence of small adversarial noise can be drowned out by larger noise, which can then be iteratively denoised using the diffusion model [22, 26] or purified through a diffusion-involved optimization [3].

While this has potential misuse in safety-critical domains like healthcare or finance, the core insights uncovered could also inform the development of more robust diffusion-based defenses going forward. Specifically, we introduce a selective attack strategy to overcome the challenge of the gradient dilemma. However, the underlying reasons behind this gradient dilemma are still not fully understood. Our experiments are limited to image classification, and while our approach can extend to other tasks, specific task-related designs need exploration. Overall, this research uncovers vulnerabilities in current diffusion-based defenses, but the findings could also spur innovations to make these defenses more secure in the future.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
