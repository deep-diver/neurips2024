To address this issue, we propose Modality Adaptation with text-toimage Diffusion Models (MADM) for semantic segmentation task which utilizes text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on extensive image-text pairs to enhance the model\u2019s cross-modality capabilities. Specifically, MADM comprises two key complementary components to tackle major challenges. First, due to the large modality gap, using one modal data to generate pseudo labels for another modality suffers from a significant drop in accuracy. To address this, MADM designs diffusion-based pseudo-label generation which adds latent noise to stabilize pseudolabels and enhance label accuracy. Second, to overcome the limitations of latent low-resolution features in diffusion models, MADM introduces the label palette and latent regression which converts one-hot encoded labels into the RGB form by palette and regresses them in the latent space, thus ensuring the pre-trained decoder for up-sampling to obtain fine-grained features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MADM achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance across various modality tasks, including images to depth, infrared, and event modalities.

However, these approaches do not account for the wide range of visual modalities present in real-world scenarios, such as depth, infrared, and event modalities, which are valuable in nighttime perception [14\u201316] but often lack sufficient and high-quality labels for supervising segmentation training.

Specifically, the backbone [19] used in current SoTA UDASS methods is pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset [20] which contains one million images categorized into 1,000 distinct classes, providing the network with a foundational level of semantic understanding.

Although TIDMs are not trained on other visual modalities, their large-scale samples and unification through texts enable them to adapt to a broader distribution of domains. Also, the extensive pretraining provides TIDMs with a robust understanding of high-level visual concepts, enabling their application to various domains, such as semantic matching [23], depth estimation [24], and 3D awareness [25]. This strong prior motivates us to utilize TIDMs as a robust backbone for solving UMA. Therefore, we present MADM: Modality Adaptation with text-to-image Diffusion Models, which takes full advantage of the generalization of pre-trained diffusion models and facilitates robust adaptation for accurate semantic segmentation in other visual modalities. Specifically, TIDM is used to extract robust features for segmentation and is trained in a self-training manner [17] which takes unlabeled target samples as input and generates pseudo-labels for training TIDM itself. Building upon TIDMs [21] and self-training [17], our MADM incorporates two innovative components: Diffusion-based Pseudo-Label Generation (DPLG) and Label Palette and Latent Regression (LPLR), which address the challenges of unstable pseudo-labeling and lack of fine-grained features extraction, respectively.

Thus, we propose DPLG which adds latent noise to target samples before generating pseudo-labels where the noise level gradually decreases as training stabilizes. These pseudo-labels then supervise the noise-free target modality predictions. The mechanism behind DPLG leverages the denoising property of diffusion models, making the target modality more consistent with pre-trained inputs, thus improving accuracy. Unlike previous supervised diffusion-based semantic segmentation methods [26\u201328] which adopt a singlestep forward and remove the diffusion process, we find that a proper diffusion process can stabilize the generation of pseudo-labels and adapt more successfully to the target modality.

To address this, we propose LPLR to convert pixel-level classification into regression in RGB form, utilizing the up-sampling capability of the pre-trained VAE decoder in a recycling manner. Specifically, we use a palette to convert one-hot encoded labels into RGB form and encode these RGB labels into latent representations.

On the other hand, self-training methods [9, 35] operate on the paradigm of pseudo-labeling, where the model\u2019s predictions on the target domain act as ground truth during training, iteratively refining the segmentation.

Future work could focus on distilling the knowledge of TIDMs into lightweight models when adapting.

This approach has enabled us to distill the knowledge embedded in MADM into a more compact DAFormer model [17], MADM (Distilled), which retains a highMIoU of $54.03\\%$ while significantly reducing parameters to 85M and only increasing the training time by 1.3 hours. Our distilled model demonstrates that it is possible to maintain high performance with reduced computational costs, addressing the concerns raised regarding the parameters and efficiency of MADM.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
