The weights (distances) are shown on the edges.

Each dataset is visualized in the top row, showing the inherent shape and distribution of the data points. The middle row displays the clustering results obtained using standard K-means, highlighting how this traditional method struggles with irregularly shaped clusters. The bottom row presents the clustering results achieved using MMJ-K-means, demonstrating its ability to effectively cluster irregularly shaped data.", "section": "5.1 MMJ-based K-means"}, {"figure_path": "2BOb4SvDFr/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Eight more samples of MMJ-K-means", "description": "This figure shows eight more examples of clustering results obtained using the MMJ-K-means algorithm. Each subplot displays a dataset with its corresponding clusters identified by different colors.  The red stars represent the cluster centers (One-SCOM). The black circles indicate border points, defined as points with multiple nearest cluster centers.  These examples further illustrate the algorithm's ability to handle irregularly shaped clusters, a key improvement over standard K-means.", "section": "5.1 MMJ-based K-means"}, {"figure_path": "2BOb4SvDFr/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Clustering result and decision boundary of data B by CNNI using MMJ-SC", "description": "This figure shows the result of clustering data set B using the CNNI model with the MMJ-SC index.
