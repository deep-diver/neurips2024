The accuracy is measured by evaluating the ability of each index to correctly identify the best partition of a dataset from hundreds of candidate partitions. The results show that the MMJ-based indices generally perform better than the existing indices, with MMJ-CH achieving the highest accuracy of 90/145.", "section": "5.2 MMJ-based internal clustering evaluation index"}, {"figure_path": "2BOb4SvDFr/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Accuracy of the ten indices", "description": "This table presents the accuracy of ten different internal clustering evaluation indices.  The indices are compared using 145 datasets, and accuracy is expressed as the number of times each index correctly identified the best partition of a dataset from among hundreds of candidates.  The indices include existing methods (CH, SC, DB, CDbw, DBCV, VIASCKDE, New) and three new indices based on the Min-Max-Jump distance (MMJ-SC, MMJ-CH, MMJ-DB).
