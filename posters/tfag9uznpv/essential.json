Current methods to improve robustness fall into empirical and certified approaches. Empirical approaches, such as adversarial training, lack formal guarantees and are easily broken by unseen attacks. Certified approaches provide formal guarantees but suffer from limited achievable robustness.  This work focuses on certified defenses, exploring their scalability using generated data. Prior work had already shown that using generated data from state-of-the-art diffusion models improve robustness of adversarial training. \nThis paper demonstrates that a similar approach can also considerably improve deterministic certified defenses.  The authors achieve state-of-the-art deterministic certificates on CIFAR-10 by using data generated by an elucidating diffusion model. They highlight notable differences in the scaling behavior between certified and empirical methods, providing a list of recommendations to improve the robustness of certified training approaches.  This includes considerations like regularization, training epochs, and the balance between real and generated data. Their results highlight the potential for substantial improvements in the field of certified adversarial robustness.", "affiliation": "Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab, FAU Erlangen N\u00fcrnberg, Germany", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "TFAG9UznPv/podcast.wav"}
