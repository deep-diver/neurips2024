This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel approach called Quantitative Relative Judgment Aggregation (QRJA). QRJA models situations where agents provide judgments on the relative quality of candidates, rather than complete rankings, which is particularly useful when dealing with incomplete or inconsistent information.\nThe paper introduces new aggregation rules for QRJA, analyzing their computational properties and demonstrating their effectiveness on real-world datasets, such as those from various races and online programming contests. QRJA outperforms standard methods in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. The authors also contribute to the theoretical understanding of QRJA by establishing almost-linear time solvability for a specific class of QRJA problems and proving NP-hardness for another class. This work highlights the potential of QRJA as a versatile and powerful tool for ranking prediction in various applications.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "37CyA1K0vV/podcast.wav"}
