Current methods for identifying these vulnerabilities are often inefficient and struggle with the complex nature of discrete text optimization.  This limits our ability to improve LLM safety and security. \nThis research introduces Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), a new technique to efficiently find and exploit these vulnerabilities. ADC overcomes the challenges of discrete optimization by transforming the problem into a continuous space, gradually increasing sparsity. This innovative approach results in a significantly higher success rate in jailbreaking various LLMs compared to existing methods, particularly against those trained to be resistant. This highlights limitations in current defense mechanisms and paves the way for developing more robust LLM safeguards.
