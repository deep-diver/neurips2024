Black-box auditing typically requires training hundreds of models to empirically estimate FPRs/FNRs with good accuracy and confidence. This can take hundreds of GPU hours, even for the shallow CNNs we audit in our work. Thus, auditing deep neural networks (e.g., WideResNet) trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) may be computationally challenging for entities that are not huge corporations. However, as our main objective is addressing the open research question of whether tight DP-SGD audits are feasible in the black-box model, we focus on shallow models. Our results are very promising as, thanks to the intuition of using worst-case initial parameters, we do achieve nearly tight audits. Nevertheless, we leave it to future work to reduce the computational cost of the auditing procedure, e.g., by training significantly fewer models.

Nevertheless, when auditing DP-SGD with subsampling in the \u201chidden-state\u201d threat model where the adversary can only observe the final trained model but can insert gradient canaries, recent work has shown that there is a significant gap between the theoretical upper bound and the empirical lower bound privacy leakage achieved [8]. Even though this suggests a privacy amplification phenomenon in the hidden-state setting (which would extend to black-box as well), for general non-convex loss functions, prior work has also shown that the privacy analysis of DP-SGD with sub-sampling is tight even in the hidden-state [3].
