These coupled constraints frequently appear in complex real-world applications such as hyperparameter tuning and network design, significantly limiting the applicability of existing BLO algorithms.  This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on BLO problems with coupled constraints, which is an under-explored and challenging scenario.\nThis research introduces BLOCC, a fully first-order algorithm, that efficiently solves bilevel optimization problems with coupled constraints.  Unlike previous approaches, BLOCC avoids computationally expensive joint projections, enabling faster computation and improved scalability. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and real-world applications. Rigorous convergence guarantees are established, making BLOCC a reliable tool for various machine learning applications.", "affiliation": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "uZi7H5Ac0X/podcast.wav"}
