We conducted an ablation study to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of our CALANet. The key components of CALANet are LCTMs and SLAP. Therefore, we compared the performance of our CALANet with that of its two variants, which were obtained by removing each component. The first variant removes the SLAP described in Section 3.3. The second variant replaces the LCTMs with fully-connected layers that have the same number of units as the input size. Table 2 shows that our LCTMs substantially reduced the FLOPs for calculating all-layer aggregation without losing the F1-score. In addition, the SLAP enhanced the effectiveness of all-layer aggregation even while reducing FLOPs. Especially, Figure 3 shows the tradeoff between the FLOPs and F1-score with varying numbers of layers in CALANet with/without LCTMs and SLAP. The tradeoff curves closer to the top-left are more efficient, with a higher F1-score per FLOPs.

Compared with these works, our CALANet significantly improved the accuracy of those activities on the KU-HAR dataset.

Compared to MG-WHAR [8] misclassified \u201cknees bending crouching\u201d by approximately $20\\%$ as \u201creach heels backwards\u201d, our CALANet misclassified \u201cknees bending crouching\u201d as \u201creach heels backwards\u201d only two times on the REALDISP dataset.

Our CALA structure can effectively be applied to existing CNNs if the following constraints are satisfied: (1) the layers of a network architecture should be calculated sequentially and independently; (2) the output of each layer should be able to be expressed as a (temporal length $\\times$ channel size) matrix. To the best of our knowledge, most wearable sensor-based human activity recognition models can satisfy the above constraints. In Table 4, we applied our LCTMs and SLAP to SqueezeNet [22]. Specifically, the output of a squeeze convolution layer in each fire module is fed into LCTMs and connected to the last layer. As a result, our modification significantly improved the F1-score of SqueezeNet on $71\\%$ of all datasets while maintaining its FLOPs. In addition, we applied CALANet to the ECG heartbeat classification problem using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset [16].
