[{"figure_path": "KsLX5pFpOs/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Left: An overview over connections between and bounds on fairness notions, i.e., a-proportional fairness (a-PF), \u03b2-individual fairness (\u03b2-IF), the (\u03b3, \u03b1)-transferable core ((\u03b3, \u03b1)-TC), and the a-q-core. See Sections 2 and 3 for the corresponding definitions and results. If A \u2192 II, then algorithm A produces outcomes satisfying II. If II \u2192 \u0393, then any outcome satisfying I also satisfies \u0393. If \u0393 takes a parameter a, then the label specifies the parameter that can be satisfied (for the transferable core, the result holds for all y > 1). Right: The metric space for the examples used throughout the paper. Edges without labels have length 1, the distance between any two points is given by the length of the shortest path between them.", "description": "This figure summarizes the relationships between different fairness notions in clustering. The left side shows how different algorithms and fairness properties relate to each other, indicating approximation guarantees. The right side illustrates a sample metric space used in the paper for examples.", "section": "Our contributions"}]
