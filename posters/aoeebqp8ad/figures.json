The x-axis represents the missing data rate (percentage), and the y-axis represents the AUROC score.  The lines show how the accuracy of each method decreases as the amount of missing data increases.

The results demonstrate that the naive strategy significantly reduces the recall rate as the missing data rate increases, while even the advanced imputation methods still suffer from imputation bias, leading to lower recall rates on the abnormal data.  The key observation is the negative effect of imputation bias in unsupervised anomaly detection when the training data consist solely of normal samples. The impute-then-detect methods yield lower recall rates compared to using complete data, highlighting the challenge posed by imputation bias in anomaly detection tasks.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "AoEeBqP8AD/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Visualization of Dz and D\u017e in 2-D latent space Z.", "description": "This figure visualizes the latent distributions Dz and D\u017e in a two-dimensional latent space Z. Dz represents the latent distribution of normal data, shown as a cluster of dark blue points concentrated near the origin.  D\u017e represents the latent distribution of pseudo-abnormal samples, which are generated by the ImAD model to mitigate imputation bias. These are shown as lighter blue points forming a ring around Dz.

The normal data (X) and pseudo-abnormal data (X) are first imputed using an imputer (I) to fill in missing values, resulting in imputed data (X) and (X). These imputed datasets are then projected into a lower-dimensional latent space (Z) using a projector (P).  The pseudo-abnormal data is generated based on the latent representations of normal data.  Finally, a reconstructor (R) maps the latent space representations back to the original data space to create pseudo-abnormal samples, which are then combined with the original normal samples for anomaly detection.", "section": "3 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "AoEeBqP8AD/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Two-dimensional visualization on Botnet.", "description": "This figure visualizes the effectiveness of the generated pseudo-abnormal samples learned by the ImAD model for the Botnet dataset.
