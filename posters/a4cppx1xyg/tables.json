Two scenarios are shown: homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data. For each algorithm, the table shows the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) and the correlation between the reconstructed and true signals.  The NMSE measures the reconstruction error, with lower values indicating better performance, and the correlation measures the similarity in the structure of the reconstructed and true signals, with higher values indicating better performance. DivSBL's performance is highlighted in blue, and the best results for each metric are bolded.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "a4cPpx1xYg/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Reconstruction error (NMSE) and Correlation (mean\u00b1std) for synthetic signals.

The results are categorized based on different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50.  Each SNR level includes results from multiple algorithms: BSBL, PC-SBL, SBL, Group BPDN, Group Lasso, StructOMP, and DivSBL.  The table helps to assess the performance and robustness of these algorithms under various noise conditions.", "section": "5.3 1D audioSet"}, {"figure_path": "a4cPpx1xYg/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Reconstruction error (NMSE) and Correlation (mean\u00b1std) for synthetic signals.
