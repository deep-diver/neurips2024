These methods frequently produce errors such as broken or redundant branches.  This limitation necessitates a more sophisticated method that prioritizes accurate topological representation.\n\nGraphMorph tackles this challenge by focusing on branch-level features. It leverages a Graph Decoder to generate a graph that captures the tubular structure, and a Morph Module that uses a novel SkeletonDijkstra algorithm to create a centerline mask aligned with the graph. This two-step process results in improved accuracy, reducing false positives and negatives.  Furthermore, a simple post-processing step enhances segmentation accuracy by using the generated centerline mask to filter out false positives.  The study demonstrates GraphMorph's effectiveness across various datasets, making it a significant advancement in tubular structure extraction.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "hW5QWiCctl/podcast.wav"}
