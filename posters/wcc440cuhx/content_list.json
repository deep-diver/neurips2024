One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple $N$ -gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantitative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by $N$ -gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by $N$ -gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex. In this latter direction, we find that for $79\\%$ and $68\\%$ of LLM next-token distributions on TinyStories and Wikipedia, respectively, their top-1 predictions agree with those provided by our $N$ -gram rulesets.

This is perhaps the most natural place to start even though it is not exhaustive (e.g. it does not include in-context learning [5]). The reasons to understand LLM behavior in terms of the statistics of their training data are plenty. First, the functional form of how LLMs use their training data is not well-understood (though there has been progress on understanding memorization [22, 6]). Second, the over-reliance of LLMs on training data statistics leads to brittleness (e.g. the \u201creversal curse\" [3]) and the perpetuation of dataset biases [12]. Understanding the nature of this statistical dependence can lead to improved and more informed dataset curation and training methods. Finally, in various scenarios, the performance of LLMs on downstream tasks are found to be correlated with frequency of relevant training data [26, 10, 16, 17]. A better understanding of this phenomenon would allow better steering of models towards desired performance levels. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "We can think of the complexity of an LLM next token prediction (regarded as a probability distribution over tokens) along two axes: form and selection. Form refers to the functional form of the prediction as a function of the context, e.g. whether the prediction is some explicit function of associated training data statistics (see Figure 1). Selection refers to which functional form, chosen from a set of functional templates, suitably describes the transformer prediction (supposing the choice set is sufficiently rich). As a first nontrivial step, one might hope that an approximate model for an LLM is that each of its next token predictions can be roughly described by simple statistical rules from the context (simple form) even if the mechanism for its rule selection remains hidden (complex selection)1. This paper is an attempt to see how far this perspective can be pushed, and fortuitously we obtain additional insights for understanding LLM behavior along the way.

(Curriculum Learning Dynamics) By grouping our $N$ -gram rulesets in terms of complexity (as measured by the amount of context they use), we discover the various ways in which the learning dynamics of LLMs implement a statistical type of curriculum learning, in which easier rules are eventually supplanted by more complex ones.

The results we obtained in Section 7 imply that, at least on simple datasets like TinyStories and Wikipedia, LLM predictions contain much quantifiable structure insofar that they often can be described in terms of our simple statistical rules. Along the way, we also obtained novel discoveries into the statistical nature of overfitting, the occurrence of curriculum learning, and the relation between model-variance and approximability by $N$ -gram rules.

Nevertheless, one can speculate that an analogue of our work could still apply: in general, an LLM might be performing some high-level rule application, whereby statistics formed out of distributional categories [24] instead of individual tokens are leveraged from the context. Formulating a correct and parsimonious set of rules, if it is at all possible, would be a nontrivial challenge to overcome and one which we leave to future work. Addressing such a challenge and being able to promote the descriptive approximations provided here to explanatory ones would provide a next step towards understanding how LLMs work.

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
