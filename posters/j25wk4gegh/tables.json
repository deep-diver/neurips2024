Each protocol defines which datasets are used for training and testing to evaluate the generalizability of the person re-identification models. Protocol 1 uses a large training set and evaluates performance on four smaller datasets, assessing overall generalization. Protocols 2 and 3 follow a leave-one-out strategy to assess domain generalization, holding out one dataset for testing and using the remaining datasets for training. This approach more rigorously evaluates how well the model generalizes to unseen domains.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "j25WK4GEGH/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on Protocol-1.
