Homomorphic encryption (HE), a promising technique, faces significant latency issues due to the complex operations involved in processing encrypted data. Existing HE-based frameworks struggle with substantial latency overheads, especially for linear layers in deep neural networks (DNNs).  Many attempts were made to resolve this issue, but they suffer from limited improvements. \n\nPrivCirNet addresses this problem by introducing a novel co-optimization framework. It leverages block circulant transformation to convert computationally expensive matrix operations into more efficient 1D convolutions optimized for HE.  This is coupled with a customized HE encoding algorithm,  CirEncode, to enhance compatibility and reduce latency.  Furthermore, PrivCirNet uses a latency-aware approach to determine layer-wise block sizes and incorporates layer fusion to further boost efficiency.  Experimental results show significant latency reductions and accuracy improvements compared to existing methods on various DNNs and datasets.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "VPSx3n6ICE/podcast.wav"}
