Existing SSL algorithms struggle with efficiency and data-hunger, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited data or resources. This hinders progress, particularly in areas like medical imaging where data acquisition is challenging. \nThis research tackles these challenges by reformulating the SSL loss function, providing theoretical justification and practical recommendations for improved efficiency. It emphasizes using a stronger orthogonalization constraint with a reduced projector dimensionality and incorporating multiple augmentations to minimize the reformulated loss. These changes lead to faster convergence, reduced computation, and the capacity to achieve the same accuracy with significantly less data.", "affiliation": "Mila - Quebec AI Institute & Computer Science, McGill University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Y5DPSJzpra/podcast.wav"}
