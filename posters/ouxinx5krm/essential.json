Different techniques are used for various simulation datasets (e.g., Lagrangian vs. Eulerian), leading to problem-specific designs.  This limits their application to large and complex simulations.  Furthermore, existing methods often face computational bottlenecks when dealing with high-resolution data and large datasets.\nUniversal Physics Transformers (UPTs) address these challenges. UPTs utilize a unified learning paradigm, encoding data flexibly into a compressed latent space representation.  This allows them to operate efficiently without relying on grid or particle-based latent structures, improving scalability across meshes and particles.  The inverse encoding and decoding in the latent space enables efficient dynamic propagation and allows for queries at any point in space-time.  The diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs are demonstrated in simulations of mesh-based fluids, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.", "affiliation": "ELLIS Unit Linz", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "oUXiNX5KRm/podcast.wav"}
