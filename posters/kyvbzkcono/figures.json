[{"figure_path": "KyVBzkConO/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The blue path represents the honest procedure of training the ANN f, converting it into a Boolean circuit C, applying iO, and reconverting it back to an ANN h = sgn(f). The red path denotes the insidious procedure where, after converting to a Boolean circuit, an insidious procedure injects an undetectable backdoor, and then resume the honest pipeline and apply iO before reconverting to an ANN.", "description": "This figure illustrates the \"Honest Obfuscated Pipeline\" and the \"Insidious Procedure\".  The honest procedure shows the steps of training a neural network, converting it to a Boolean circuit, applying indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), and converting it back to a neural network. The insidious procedure highlights the injection of a backdoor into the Boolean circuit before the application of iO, resulting in a backdoored obfuscated neural network. The figure uses color-coding (blue for honest, red for malicious) to clearly show the differences between the two paths.", "section": "Overview of Our Approach and Technical Tools"}]
