It shows the dataset used, the length and size of the image sequences within that dataset, the type of latent space representation used (if any), whether a two-stage training process was employed, the total number of model parameters, the training speed in steps per second, and the inference speed in iterations per second. This information helps in understanding the computational cost associated with training and using AID models for different applications and datasets.", "section": "F Computation and model complexity"}]
