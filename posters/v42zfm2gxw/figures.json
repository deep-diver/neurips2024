At each timestamp, entity and relation representations are updated by the cluster graph message passing module and merged with input representations from the previous timestamp using a time residual gate.  These updated representations are then input to a relation-aware GCN to model multi-relational interactions among entities. A deep evolutionary clustering module captures the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities, maintaining temporal smoothness through an unsupervised alignment mechanism.  An implicit correlation encoder captures latent correlations between clusters, and an attentive temporal encoder captures temporal dependencies among entity and relation representations across timestamps, integrating them for future event prediction. The figure visually depicts the flow of information and the interactions between the various modules of the DECRL model.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "V42zfM2GXw/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The framework of DECRL.", "description": "The figure illustrates the framework of the Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation Learning approach (DECRL).
