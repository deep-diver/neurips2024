Yet, difficulties in adapting Mamba from language to vision tasks arise due to the distinct characteristics of visual data, such as the spatial locality and adjacency within images and large variations in information granularity across visual tokens. Existing vision Mamba approaches either flatten tokens into sequences in a raster scan fashion, which breaks the local adjacency of images, or manually partition tokens into windows, which limits their long-range modeling and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a new vision Mamba model, coined QuadMamba, that effectively captures local dependencies of varying granularities via quadtree-based image partition and scan. Concretely, our lightweight quadtree-based scan module learns to preserve the 2D locality of spatial regions within learned window quadrants. The module estimates the locality score of each token from their features, before adaptively partitioning tokens into window quadrants. An omnidirectional window shifting scheme is also introduced to capture more intact and informative features across different local regions. To make the discretized quadtree partition end-to-end trainable, we further devise a sequence masking strategy based on Gumbel-Softmax and its straight-through gradient estimator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

SSMs offer a versatile approach to sequence modeling that balances computational efficiency with model flexibility. Inspired by the success of Mamba [13] in language tasks, there has been a rise in using SSMs for various vision tasks. These applications range from designing generic backbone models [80, 41, 26, 66, 49] to advancing fields such as image segmentation [51, 39, 65, 46] and synthesis [17].

In this paper, we seek to expand the applicability of the Mamba model for computer vision. We observe that the differences between the language and visual domains can pose significant obstacles in adapting Mamba to the latter. The challenges come from two natural characteristics of image data: 1) Visual data has rigorous 2D spatial dependencies, which means flattening image patches into a sequence may destroy the high-level understanding. 2) Natural visual signals have heavy spatial redundancy\u2014e.g., an irrelevant patch does not influence the representation of objects. To address these two issues, we develop a vision-specific scanning method to construct 1D token sequences for Vision Mamba. Typically, vision Mamba models need to transform 2D images into 1D sequences for processing. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the straightforward method, e.g., Vim [80], that flattens spatial data into 1D tokens directly disrupts the natural local 2D dependencies. LocalMamba improves local representation by partitioning the image into multiple windows, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Each window is scanned individually before conducting a traversal across windows, ensuring that tokens within the same 2D semantic region are processed closely together. However, the handcrafted window partition lacks the flexibility to handle various object scales and is unable to ignore the less informative regions.

We propose to employ a lightweight prediction module to multiple layers in the vision Mamba model, which evaluates the local adjacency of each spatial token. The quadrant with the highest score is further partitioned into sub-quadrants in a recursive fashion for fine-grained scan, while others, likely comprising less informative tokens, are kept in a coarse granularity.

QuadMamba effectively captures local dependencies of different granularities by learnable quadtree-based scanning, which adaptively preserves the inherent locality within image data with negligible computational overheads. The QuadMamba\u2019s effectiveness has been proven through extensive experiments and ablation studies, outperforming popular CNNs and vision transformers. However, one limitation of QuadMamba is that window partition with more than two levels is yet to be explored, which may be particularly relevant for handling dense prediction visual tasks and higher-resolution data, such as remote sensing images. The fine-grained partition regions are rigid and lack flexibility in attending to regions of arbitrary shapes and sizes, which is left for our future work. We hope that our approach will motivate further research in applying Mamba to more diverse and complex visual tasks. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Acknowledgments.
