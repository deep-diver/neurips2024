We generate 50 random DAGs and plot the average SHD and standard deviation. scm-v0 and neurips-rff are pretrained models in the paper.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed algorithm against two other Bayesian causal discovery methods (scm-v0 and neurips-rff) on random complete graphs.  The Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), a measure of the difference between learned and true causal graphs, is plotted against the number of interventional samples. The average SHD and standard deviation across 50 random DAGs are shown.", "section": "Experiments"}]
