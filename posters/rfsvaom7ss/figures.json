The experiment used random causal graphs with varying numbers of nodes (n=5, 6, 7) and densities (p=0.3, 0.6).  For each graph and density, multiple trials were performed, each with a varying number of interventional samples.  The plot shows the average KL divergence and Total Variation Distance (TVD) between the estimated causal effect and the ground truth.  The shaded regions represent the standard deviation across multiple trials.  The results demonstrate that as the number of interventional samples increases, both the KL divergence and TVD decrease, indicating improved accuracy in estimating causal effects.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "RfSvAom7sS/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: SHD vs number of interventional samples for random complete graphs", "description": "This figure compares the performance of four causal discovery algorithms (Active Learning using DCT, Random Intervention, Adaptivity-sensitive Search, and the proposed algorithm) on complete graphs with varying numbers of nodes (n=5, 6, and 7).
