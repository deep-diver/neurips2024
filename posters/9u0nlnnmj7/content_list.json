Achieving such a goal would make producing LLMs targeting different deployment scales significantly cheaper. Weight pruning is a powerful and well-known technique for reducing model size [51, 21]. In this paper, we focus on structured pruning, where blocks of nonzero elements are removed at once from model weights; examples of structured pruning techniques include neuron, attention head, convolutional fliter, and depth pruning [32, 18, 53, 4, 34, 55, 26]. While the literature is rich with numerous papers on structured pruning, to an end-user, it\u2019s not always clear which technique to use, when, and how to combine them to consistently obtain good pruned models. Pruning is also often accompanied by some amount of retraining for accuracy recovery [51]; this phase is extremely expensive in modern LLMs, often requiring access to large amounts of curated data.

For instance, we discover that pruning neurons and heads alone is initially superior to pruning neurons, heads and embedding channels; however, after a few steps of retraining, this order flips. Similarly, we discover that width pruning works better than depth, but only after some retraining (see Table 1 for a concrete example). We also investigate in detail how a pruned model can be efficiently retrained for optimal performance using minimal additional data. Based on our findings, we develop a practical list of LLM compression and retraining best practices.

Recent work in the first category (depth pruning) includes ShortGPT [34], LaCo [55], and Shortened LLaMa [26]; for pruning layers in MINITRON models, we reuse and extend the metrics proposed in some of these works (eg: block importance from ShortGPT [34]). A number of recent papers have also proposed new saliency metrics and pruning strategies targeting width dimensions: namely, embedding channels, attention heads, and MLP intermediate channels [11, 4, 53, 33]. Most work in this category uses learnable masks, combined with an Augmented Lagrangian loss formulation to arrive at optimal width masks [4, 53, 33]. At LLM scale, this strategy has multiple disadvantages: (1) it requires compute and memory-intensive gradient computations, and (2) it requires a considerable amount of data and fine-tuning to arrive at reasonable masks. The notable exception in this line of work is Dery et al. [11], which recognizes these limitations and proposes saliency metrics that can be computed with only forward passes. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first pruning strategy that (1) simultaneously targets both width and depth dimensions, (2) works at LLM scale (i.e., uses only forward passes for computing importance and uses a small fraction of pretraining data), and (3) achieves state-of-the-art compression and accuracy.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
