Traditional statistical methods like PACE often struggle with complex data structures and noise.  Neural network-based methods, while promising, often lack the ability to ensure the smoothness and continuity of the imputed function. This necessitates the use of penalties or post-processing steps like kernel smoothing which may impact performance.\nThe paper introduces SAND, a novel method that augments transformer networks with a 'self-attention on derivatives' module.  This module explicitly encourages smoothness by modeling the sub-derivative of the curve, resulting in improved imputation accuracy and better handling of noisy data.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAND outperforms traditional statistical methods and vanilla transformer networks, providing a more robust and accurate approach for functional data imputation.", "affiliation": "UC Davis", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MXRO5kukST/podcast.wav"}
