Existing diffusion-based methods, despite their high expressiveness, often suffer from these issues.  This limitation hinders the development of robust and reliable RL agents that can generalize well to unseen situations.\nThis paper presents a novel approach to address these limitations.  It proposes an entropy-regularized diffusion policy that uses a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation to sample actions.  This policy increases exploration of out-of-distribution samples.  Further, the approach incorporates Q-ensembles for more reliable Q-value prediction, improving the reliability and stability of training.  The results showcase superior performance on the D4RL benchmark tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "affiliation": "Uppsala University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hWRVbdAWiS/podcast.wav"}
