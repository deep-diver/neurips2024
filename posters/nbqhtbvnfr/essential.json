Existing methods achieve good results on large datasets but lack theoretical justification, making their reliability uncertain.  This creates a need for methods that are both effective and theoretically sound.\nThis paper presents a new manifold clustering method that addresses this issue.  It introduces a novel model and provides rigorous geometric conditions under which the model's solution is guaranteed to correctly cluster data points.  The method shows competitive results on the CIFAR dataset, demonstrating the practical value of the theoretical improvements.  This combination of strong theoretical foundation and competitive empirical performance is a significant step forward.", "affiliation": "Lehigh University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "nBQHTBVnfr/podcast.wav"}
