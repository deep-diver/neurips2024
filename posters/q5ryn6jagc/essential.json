This failure is rooted in the \"binding problem,\" a fundamental challenge in cognitive science where distinct features of multiple objects need to be correctly associated to avoid confusion. This is similar to limitations observed in fast human visual processing. \nThis research investigates VLMs' performance on classic cognitive tasks such as visual search and numerical estimation.  The study reveals that VLMs struggle when the likelihood of feature interference is high, even with few objects. A novel scene description benchmark helps quantify this interference, predicting VLM errors better than simply counting objects. By applying these findings to visual analogy, a pre-processing technique to reduce interference improves VLM performance, suggesting that multi-object scene processing itself, rather than abstract reasoning, is the main bottleneck. The results underscore the need for more sophisticated methods, potentially incorporating serial attention or object-centric representations to improve VLM performance.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Q5RYn6jagC/podcast.wav"}
