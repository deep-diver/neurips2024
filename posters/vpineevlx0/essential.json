Existing solutions often fall short by failing to adequately preserve the essential topological structures of the graph data, leading to inaccurate results. This often results in low performance when revisiting previous tasks.\n\nThe researchers introduce TACO, a topology-aware graph coarsening framework. TACO addresses this issue by using a novel graph coarsening algorithm called RePro. RePro efficiently reduces the size of the graph while preserving key topological features. By storing and replaying this reduced graph, TACO successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting and significantly improves performance. The experimental results demonstrate that TACO outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets, highlighting the importance of preserving topological information in continual graph learning.", "affiliation": "Stevens Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VpINEEVLX0/podcast.wav"}
