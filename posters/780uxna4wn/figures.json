Subfigure (a) shows the average runtime for different dimensions of \u03b8 (n). The generator gradient estimator shows near-constant computation times while the pathwise differentiation method's runtime increases significantly with n. Subfigure (b) displays the estimation statistics for n = 102, showing that both estimators achieve similar results with high confidence. The computation time of the generator gradient estimator remains stable even with high-dimensional scenarios (n approaching 10^8).", "section": "4 Example: Linear System with Quadratic Loss"}, {"figure_path": "780uXnA4wN/figures/figures_36_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparisons of 100-sample estimation statistics and averaged runtime.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the generator gradient estimator and the pathwise differentiation estimator for estimating the gradient of a value function in a linear-quadratic control problem.  Panel (a) shows the average computation time for different dimensions of the parameter vector (n).  The generator gradient estimator shows significantly faster computation times that remain relatively stable as n increases, whereas the pathwise differentiation method's computation time increases linearly with n.
