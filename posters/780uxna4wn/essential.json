However, computing gradients for these high-dimensional models poses a significant challenge due to computational complexity. Existing methods, like pathwise differentiation, suffer from computation times that scale poorly with the dimensionality of the parameter space, making optimization difficult and resource intensive. This research directly addresses this computational bottleneck.\nThis paper introduces a novel unbiased gradient estimator, the \"generator gradient estimator.\"  It demonstrates significantly improved computational efficiency compared to pathwise differentiation. **The key advantage is the stable computation time, which remains nearly constant even when the dimensionality of the parameter space is very high**. Numerical experiments verify these findings, showcasing improved efficiency and robustness in high-dimensional scenarios, without compromising estimation variance.
