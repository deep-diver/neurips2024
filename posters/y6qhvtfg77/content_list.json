However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in crossmodality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT1, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.

These two modalities offer distinct advantages and limitations that can complement one another when combined [45, 13]. fMRI offers high spatial resolution imaging of whole-brain activity by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes, which facilitates probing regional and network-level function. However, fMRI suffers from low temporal resolution and hemodynamic blurring, which limits its ability to capture the accurate timing of rapid neuronal activity dynamics. Additionally, its high cost, non-portability, and incompatibility with metal implants further restrict the utility of MRI in certain contexts. Conversely, EEG stands out as a low-cost, portable neuroimaging modality with high temporal resolution [10, 30, 61]. However, EEG faces limitations due to volume conduction and from the superficial location of electrodes (on the scalp), making it difficult for EEG to accurately infer the origins of the measured electrical potentials. In this context, the high spatial resolution of fMRI becomes indispensable, especially for imaging deep brain regions.

These challenges are exacerbated in conditions during which a participant is resting passively (i.e., resting state), which is characterized by significant noise and randomness.

More recent studies have used deep neural networks for EEG-fMRI translation [33\u201335, 5, 3, 25, 31], and those of [25] and [31] developed sequence-to-sequence (Seq-to-Seq) models to reconstruct fMRI time series of deep brain regions from EEG. However, these efforts have primarily focused on task datasets, including cued eye opening/closing [25, 31, 34, 35, 54, 3], leaving the (fully eyes-closed) resting state condition largely unexplored. In addition, prior studies rely on a subject-specific approach, wherein models are solely trained and tested on different sections of the same individual\u2019s scans. Further, only a small number of brain regions have been examined in current studies, leaving as an open question the predictive power of EEG for fMRI signals across broader areas (see Appendix B for further discussion of related work).

NeuroBOLT is designed to capture and integrate multi-dimensional representations across temporal, spatial, and spectral domains, offering a generalizable approach for translating raw EEG waves to BOLD fMRI time series from regions of interest (ROIs). Drawing inspiration from vision transformer (ViT) [15] and its adaptation for multichannel biosignals [59, 22], our framework transforms raw EEG data into unified \"EEG patches\", enabling flexible and effective EEG data encoding. These EEG patches are then passed into two parallel sub-modules: (1) spatiotemporal and (2) spectral representation learning modules. The spatiotemporal module is propelled by a recently proposed EEG foundation model (LaBraM) [22], which has been trained to learn effective representations on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals. Moreover, as previous studies have emphasized the importance of leveraging spectral features in EEG representation learning [59, 57, 60], EEG-fMRI correlations [27, 14], and EEG-to-fMRI synthesis [31, 39, 25], the spectral module incorporates multi-scale encoding on EEG spectrogram patches. Specifically, instead of employing a fixed window size for the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as commonly used [59, 58, 24, 11], we incorporate spectral features from windows of varying scales. This approach retains the advantages of high temporal resolution from smaller windows and high frequency resolution from larger windows, thereby enhancing the spectral analysis.

However, the HRF is not uniform, varying significantly across different brain regions and between individuals.

As shown in the lower part of Table 1, our model achieves the highest average correlation across ROIs, with a score of 0.473.

This visualization reveals that NeuroBOLT successfully captures major features of fMRI dynamics in reconstructing the whole unseen fMRI scan, especially for primary sensory regions and global signals. Thus, even though both EEG and resting-state fMRI have relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, NeuroBOLT still learns meaningful EEG representations and EEG-fMRI correlations that are crucial for EEG-to-fMRI translation. Additional results including performance distributions with statistical significance, MSE table and examples visualizing the best and the worst fMRI scan reconstructions, are provided in Appendix F for comprehensively displaying the performance. Furthermore, in comparison to other state-of-the-art EEG-fMRI translation approaches [31, 25] and EEG encoding models [59, 22, 29, 44, 48], NeuroBOLT achieves lower mean squared error (MSE) and higher correlation, with at least an $8.74\\%$ improvement in average correlations. Similar to the scenario of within-subject prediction, NeuroBOLT shows the highest performance in predicting signals from global and primary sensory regions, achieving average correlations of 0.564 and 0.522, respectively, followed by its performance in high-level cognitive and subcortical regions.

By learning a multi-dimensional EEG representation from spatial, temporal, and spectral domains, NeuroBOLT shows a strong capability to reconstruct resting-state fMRI signals from EEG alone. In addition to subject-specific models, it can also predict fMRI time series from held-out subjects across entire 20-minute scans, which is a first in this field. It is important to note that correlations of 0.4-0.5 are considered strong for predicting moment-bymoment signal fluctuations in functional neuroimaging data, given the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG/fMRI. It is also worth mentioning that our model reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from deep subcortical regions like the thalamus (with accuracy comparable to, or exceeding, certain cortical ROIs), using raw EEG data with a relatively small set of electrodes (26), enhancing the capabilities of EEG to map subcortical dynamics. This number of channels is typically insufficient to capture detailed neural activity from such regions using methods like EEG source localization [47]. Moreover, NeuroBOLT supports an arbitrary number of EEG input channels, which allows for flexible application across different EEG setups and across different experimental and clinical settings. Overall, by advancing the field of EEG-fMRI translation, this work may ultimately open new possibilities for non-invasive brain research and cost-effective clinical diagnostics. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations Currently, our model is trained separately for each brain region, which is inefficient for the ultimate goal of high-resolution fMRI reconstruction. Since functional modules in fMRI also co-fluctuate dynamically, our future work aims to develop an integrated training approach that leverages these co-fluctuations, aiming to enhance the model\u2019s ability to reconstruct high-resolution fMRI signals more efficiently. Furthermore, although our model demonstrates promising zeroshot reconstruction performance on unseen task-based scans when trained on resting-state data even with limited samples, the sample size of our resting-state and auditory task dataset remains limited compared to existing studies on single modalities, which may still introduce potential bias or overfitting. For certain comparisons, sizable variability in the performance of the proposed method as well as the baseline methods was also observed (see Appendix $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm F}$ and Figures 7, 8). As our model is adaptable to various channel configurations, we plan to leverage other publicly available simultaneous EEG-fMRI datasets in our future work to train the model on larger, more diverse samples. Additionally, future evaluation with multiple random seeds could help mitigate potential biases especially under small sample size, enhancing the model\u2019s reliability and generalizability.

Since this study attempted to reconstruct fMRI signals only from task-specific brain regions, the ability of EEG to infer fMRI signals from other regions needs further investigation. Using deep neural networks, [33\u201335, 5, 3, 25, 31] explored the capability of encoder-decoder based frameworks for EEG-fMRI translation.

However, these studies are constrained by small sample sizes and rely on a subject-specific approach, wherein models are solely trained and tested on different sections of the same individual\u2019s scans. Additionally, most of the existing research has focused on EEG-to-fMRI synthesis during task conditions, including cued eye opening/closing [25, 31, 34, 35, 54, 3], leaving the (fully eyes-closed) resting state condition largely unexplored. This gap in the field may stem from the inherently noisier and more random nature of resting-state data [32], which poses challenges for stable and accurate translation between EEG and fMRI. Yet, resting state is a widely used condition due to its simplicity and ease of applicability in patient populations [37]; therefore, there is a crucial need for models that can successfully operate on resting-state data.

The width of the window affects the representation of the signal, influencing whether frequency resolution (the ability to distinguish closely spaced frequency components) or time resolution (the ability to detect when frequencies change) is prioritized. A wider window $w$ provides better frequency resolution (i.e., higher $N_{f}$ ) but results in poorer time resolution (i.e., fewer time windows), while a narrower window enhances time resolution but sacrifices frequency resolution, as illustrated in the bottom left of Figure 3. Moreover, different neural processes are associated with different frequency bands, which may require distinct time windows to capture accurately. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-level spectral representation learning approach that captures and aggregates a range of rapid to smooth fluctuations with adaptive windows. By using varying time window lengths, the model can isolate low-frequency, long-duration oscillations with larger windows and high-frequency, short-duration oscillations with smaller windows. This flexibility ensures that each frequency band is represented optimally, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to map EEG to fMRI signals accurately as shown in Table 2.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
