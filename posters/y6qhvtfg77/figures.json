It starts with neuronal activity generating electrical potentials, which are then measured by EEG electrodes on the scalp.  Due to volume conduction, the EEG signals do not directly reflect the location of neural activity. These EEG signals, after a 16-second time window, are processed by the NeuroBOLT model.  The model outputs a temporally aligned fMRI ROI (region of interest) time course, which represents the predicted fMRI activity. The figure highlights the challenges of EEG-fMRI translation (volume conduction) and how NeuroBOLT attempts to overcome these to synthesize the high-resolution fMRI activity from EEG.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "y6qhVtFG77/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overall architecture of NeuroBOLT. Our method first divides the input EEG window into uniform patches (A), and has two modules that are trained simultaneously: the temporal-spatial representation learning module (B) and the spectral representation learning module (C).

The model takes an EEG window as input and processes it through two parallel modules: a spatiotemporal module and a spectral module. The spatiotemporal module extracts temporal and spatial features from the EEG, while the spectral module extracts frequency information.  Both modules generate embeddings, which are then combined and fed into a regression head that outputs the predicted fMRI time series.", "section": "2.2 Model Architecture"}, {"figure_path": "y6qhVtFG77/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Multi-scale spectral feature embedding.", "description": "This figure illustrates the multi-scale spectral feature embedding method used in NeuroBOLT.
