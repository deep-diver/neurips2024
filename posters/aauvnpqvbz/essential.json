Standard OT methods often use squared Euclidean distance as a cost function, which can be problematic in high dimensions.  This paper tackles this challenge by exploring 'elastic costs,' which incorporate a regularizer to shape the displacements of the transport map, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem.  The main difficulty lies in the computational burden and the lack of tools to study these problems.\nThis paper proposes a novel numerical method to compute optimal Monge maps for elastic costs, enabling the generation of synthetic datasets with known ground-truth maps. It then introduces 'subspace elastic costs,' which promote displacements within low-dimensional subspaces.  To effectively learn the parameters of these subspace costs, it proposes a bilevel loss function. Experiments on synthetic and single-cell data demonstrate improved predictive ability of subspace elastic costs compared to conventional methods.  This research contributes both practically through improved computational efficiency and improved prediction performance and theoretically with the introduction of new tools and the analysis of the statistical properties of the MBO estimator with subspace elastic costs.", "affiliation": "Apple", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "aaUVnpQvbZ/podcast.wav"}
