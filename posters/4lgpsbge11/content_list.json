Its main rationale is to evaluate models using a testing set that is different from training, so as to provide a reliable estimate of the model generalization ability. Leave-one-out CV (LOOCV) [5, 7], which repeatedly evaluates models trained using all but one observation on the left-out observation, is a prime approach; however, it is computationally demanding as it requires model re-training for the same number of times as the sample size. Because of this, $K$ -fold CV, which reduces the number of model re-training down to $K$ times (where $K$ is typically 5\u201310), becomes a popular substitute [34, 42].

In nonparametric regimes, especially those involving slow model convergence rates, their general performances as well as comparisons with the naive \u201cplug-in\u201d approach, i.e., simply reuses all the same training data for model evaluation, stay essentially open. Part of the challenge comes from the subtle inter-dependence of model convergence rates and other characteristics with the correlation between training and validation sets across folds. Consequently, existing results are either based on limit theorems designed to \u201ccenter\u201d at the average-of-folds instead of full-size model [60], or restricted to specific models (e.g., linear) [7, 9] or specific (fast) rates [57].

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
