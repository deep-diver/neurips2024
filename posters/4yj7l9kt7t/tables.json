It shows whether each algorithm provides guarantees for unknown heavy-tail parameters (u, v), whether it relies on a strong assumption (Assumption 2), the type of regime it addresses (stochastic or adversarial), the expected regret it achieves, and whether these guarantees are high-probability bounds or just expected bounds.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
