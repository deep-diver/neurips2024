The results are shown for different training sample sizes (80,000 and 800,000) and DT node counts (40 and 64).  The table demonstrates that RGMDT consistently outperforms the baselines, achieving higher rewards, especially with smaller sample sizes and fewer nodes. This highlights the efficiency of RGMDT in learning concise, effective decision trees even with limited data.", "section": "Evaluation and Results"}, {"figure_path": "mdWz5koY5p/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: All changes contributed to the improvement of RGMDT, especially the non-Euclidean clustering and iteratively-grow-DT designs.", "description": "This table presents an ablation study on the RGMDT model, analyzing the impact of different components on its performance.  The \"Described RGMDT model\" row shows the performance of the complete model. Subsequent rows remove key components (SVM hyperplane, Non-Euclidean Clustering Module, iteratively-grow-DT process) one at a time, using different DT algorithms (CART, ET, RF, GBDT) where applicable. The results highlight the crucial roles of the SVM hyperplane, Non-Euclidean clustering, and the iteratively-grow-DT process in achieving the strong performance of the full RGMDT model.", "section": "Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "mdWz5koY5p/tables/tables_29_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: The superior performance of RGMDT when using non-Euclidean cosine-distance metrics indicates that the algorithm effectively utilizes the geometric properties of sampled Q-values for DT construction. This advantage becomes particularly evident under higher error conditions, where traditional Euclidean and other non-Euclidean metrics fail. As errors increase, a performance drop across all metrics is typical, highlighting the importance of non-Euclidean clustering. RGMDT's design to cluster observations following similar decision paths into the same leaf nodes\u2014typically maximized by the same actions as guided by the action-value Q(s, a)\u2014enhances its effectiveness. This approach confirms that the cosine-distance metric is more suitable for maintaining performance in the face of clustering errors, as proven in Theorem 4.4.", "description": "This table compares the performance of RGMDT using non-Euclidean cosine distance with Euclidean and Manhattan distances under various noise levels.
