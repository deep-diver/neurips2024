Existing methods for extracting decision trees (DTs) from DRL policies often lack performance guarantees, especially in multi-agent settings.  Furthermore, most prior attempts to design DT policies in multi-agent scenarios rely on heuristics without providing any quantitative guarantees.\nThis paper introduces a novel Return-Gap-Minimizing Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm.  RGMDT recasts the DT extraction problem as a non-Euclidean clustering problem, leveraging the action-value function to obtain a closed-form guarantee on the return gap between the oracle policy and the extracted DT policy.  The algorithm and its theoretical guarantees are extended to multi-agent settings via an iteratively-grow-DT procedure, which ensures the global optimality of the resulting joint return.  Experiments demonstrate that RGMDT significantly outperforms existing methods on various tasks.", "affiliation": "The George Washington University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "mdWz5koY5p/podcast.wav"}
