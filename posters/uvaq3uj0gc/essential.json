Traditional SCO methods often assume smoothness in the objective functions, which limits their applicability to many real-world scenarios where nonsmoothness is prevalent.  This constraint significantly impacts the applicability of previous research.\n\nThis paper introduces novel gradient-free stochastic methods to address the challenges posed by nonconvex and nonsmooth SCO problems.  These methods provide non-asymptotic convergence rates, ensuring reliable performance.  The paper also presents improved convergence rates for the specific case of convex nonsmooth SCO.  The efficacy of these methods is validated via numerical experiments demonstrating their effectiveness across diverse applications. This significantly expands the scope of applicable SCO techniques.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "UVAq3uJ0gc/podcast.wav"}
