This is largely due to the overfitting of lightweight prompt tuning methods focused solely on improving task-specific performance, ignoring the underlying general knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models.  This lack of generalization limits the applicability of these models in real-world applications. \nPoint-PRC tackles this limitation by introducing a regulation framework that explicitly guides prompt learning. This framework enforces consistency between task-specific predictions and task-agnostic knowledge from the pre-trained model. It achieves this through multiple constraints, promoting mutual agreement between the representations and predictions of both the prompt-tuned and the pre-trained model. The framework is also designed to be plug-and-play, easily integrated into existing large 3D models.  Furthermore, to address the lack of systematic evaluation of 3D domain generalization, the paper introduces three new benchmarks: base-to-new, cross-dataset, and few-shot generalization, pushing the field forward. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regulation framework, consistently improving both generalization ability and task-specific performance across various benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "g7lYP11Erv/podcast.wav"}
