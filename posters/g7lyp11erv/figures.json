It shows how the framework integrates three core components: Mutual Agreement Constraint (MAC), Text Diversity Constraint (TDC), and Model Ensemble Constraint (MEC).  The framework utilizes a large pre-trained multi-modal 3D model (with a point cloud branch and text branch), interacting with learnable prompts inserted into the encoder layers of both branches.  MAC aligns the features and predicted distributions between the prompts and the pre-trained model. TDC leverages diverse textual descriptions (generated by LLMs or manual templates) for enhanced generalization.  MEC synthesizes predictions across different training epochs to avoid overfitting.  The figure visually represents the data flow and interactions between the components and how these constraints aim to regulate the prompt learning process for improved generalization performance.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "g7lYP11Erv/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overall architecture of our point cloud analysis prompt regulation constraint framework, namely Point-PRC, consisting of three core components as in the figure.", "description": "This figure shows the overall architecture of Point-PRC, a point cloud analysis framework that uses prompt learning with regulation constraints.
