Existing methods often struggle with computational cost and accuracy, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data and the uncertainty introduced by unobserved variables.  Many existing methods are limited to simple graphical models or assume specific data distributions.\nThis research introduces a **greedy search-and-score algorithm** that efficiently estimates the likelihood of ancestral graphs (which include both directed and bidirected edges). It cleverly uses **multivariate information scores** focusing on local information around nodes and edges, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden.  The algorithm's performance surpasses existing methods on benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "Z2f4Laqi8U/podcast.wav"}
