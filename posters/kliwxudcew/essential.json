Existing research mainly focuses on offline BTL model parameter estimation, while Elo's online update mechanism remains less explored. The paper addresses this gap by analyzing Elo's convergence rate using Markov chain theory. \nThe study leverages the Bradley-Terry-Luce model and explores Elo as a Markov chain. It introduces a capped Elo variant to prevent unbounded ratings while preserving the zero-sum property. The main finding demonstrates Elo's ability to learn model parameters at a competitive rate compared to existing offline algorithms, showcasing its robustness.  The research connects Elo's convergence to the fastest-mixing Markov chain problem, providing insights for efficient tournament design.", "affiliation": "University of Warwick", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "kLiWXUdCEw/podcast.wav"}
