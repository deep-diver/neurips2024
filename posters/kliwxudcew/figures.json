Three different probability distributions for selecting the next match are compared: uniform, an optimal sequential distribution (maximizing the spectral gap), and an optimal parallel distribution (maximizing the spectral gap for parallel rounds). The plot shows the average L2 distance between the time-averaged Elo ratings and the true ratings, normalized by the number of players, over 20,000 games/rounds. The shaded regions represent the 25th to 75th percentiles across ten simulations, showcasing the variability in convergence rates.

The simulations compare the performance of three different match-up probability distributions: uniform, optimal sequential, and optimal parallel. The y-axis represents the average error (presumably L2 distance between estimated and true ratings), and the x-axis represents the number of games played.  The graph shows that the optimal sequential and parallel methods significantly outperform the uniform distribution, achieving much lower errors with the same number of games played.  The parallel method shows that using parallel rounds can offer additional benefits in convergence speed.", "section": "4 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "kLiWXUdCEw/figures/figures_8_3.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Largest Elo rating in absolute value for a complete graph of varying size.
