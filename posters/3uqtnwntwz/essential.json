Existing methods, like Zero-1-to-3, while promising, struggle with inconsistencies and implausibilities, especially when handling significant viewpoint changes.  These issues often stem from inconsistencies in the attention maps generated during the image synthesis process.\nThe proposed Zero-to-Hero method tackles these issues by implementing a novel test-time approach to filter and enhance attention maps. By drawing an analogy between the denoising process and stochastic gradient descent, the method iteratively aggregates and averages attention maps, thus improving generation reliability and reducing inconsistencies.  Furthermore, Zero-to-Hero incorporates information from the source view, reducing shape distortions.  Experiments demonstrated that the technique consistently improves image fidelity, consistency, and geometric accuracy across multiple datasets and various types of objects, achieving significant improvements over baseline methods without the need for additional training.", "affiliation": "Technion", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "3uQtNWNTwz/podcast.wav"}
