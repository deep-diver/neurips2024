To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning objective, dubbed Direct Consistency Optimization, which controls the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained models to retain the pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on subject and style customization, we demonstrate that our method positions itself on a superior Pareto frontier between subject (or style) consistency and image-text alignment over all previous baselines; it not only outperforms regular fine-tuning objective in image-text alignment, but also shows higher fidelity to the reference images than the method that fine-tunes with additional prior dataset. More importantly, the models fine-tuned with our method can be merged without interference, allowing us to generate custom subjects in a custom style by composing separately customized subject and style models.

Our method seeks for a better training of LoRA for T2I diffusion models and thus complementary to existing works.
