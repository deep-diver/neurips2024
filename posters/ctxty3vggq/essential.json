Existing solutions assume known page weights, which is unrealistic in many real-world scenarios such as multi-level caching.  The unknown weights pose a significant challenge, as algorithms must learn page weights while efficiently managing the cache. \nThis paper presents the first algorithm for online weighted paging with unknown page weights. It cleverly combines a fractional solution that optimizes costs based on learned confidence bounds, and a randomized rounding scheme that feeds sampled weights back to the fractional solver. The algorithm demonstrates an optimal competitive ratio, matching the best results for the known-weight scenario, with an additional sublinear regret term accounting for the learning process. This novel approach elegantly manages the trade-off between exploration (learning weights) and exploitation (optimizing caching).", "affiliation": "Tel-Aviv University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "ctxtY3VGGq/podcast.wav"}
