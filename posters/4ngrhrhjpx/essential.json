Existing methods to address this problem using parameter perturbation are ineffective in MARL because they do not consider the learned cooperation knowledge and may lead to forgetting learned knowledge. \nThe paper introduces ReBorn, a simple yet effective solution. ReBorn periodically identifies dormant and over-active neurons, transferring weights from the latter to the former.  This process ensures that the cooperative knowledge remains intact even after weight adjustments.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReBorn significantly improves the performance of popular MARL value factorization approaches, reducing the number of dormant neurons and enhancing overall learning efficiency. The theoretical analysis of the Knowledge Invariant principle provides a strong foundation for ReBorn's effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Xiamen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4NGrHrhJPx/podcast.wav"}
