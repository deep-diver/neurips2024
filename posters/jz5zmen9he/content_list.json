Traditional methods always need the auxiliary user input like trimap [23, 4] and scribble [24, 25]. These methods basically only leverage low-level color or structure features, which limits their ability to distinguish foreground details from images. With the success of deep learning, researchers have begun to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the alpha map in an end-to-end fashion [26, 20]. One type takes images and auxiliary trimap or scribble as input and outputs the alpha map [5]. In order to alleviate the demand for trimap, trimap-free methods [27, 6, 28] are proposed to directly predict alpha mattes from the input image, which increases efficiency while sacrificing performance. Although these existing methods achieve impressive results in alpha prediction, accurately predicting foreground and background colors remains an essential yet challenging task for high-quality matting. Tang et al. [29] and Aksoy et al. [30] firstly proposed to address color estimation by sequentially or directly predicting the background and foreground colors before alpha prediction. Furthermore, recent method [31] unifies foreground, background, and alpha matte into an end-to-end framework. While, another line of works [32, 28] focuses on foreground human extraction and alpha matte prediction. However, these methods are limited by the lack of high-quality labeled data.

Drip\u2019s methodology relies on the extensive priors captured within pretrained LDMs. Consequently, Drip inherits any biases present in the original generative model.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
