Existing methods like Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) struggle with this.  This is because these methods rely on training models to mimic complex and often noisy vector fields, making it slow and unstable.  The existing loss functions have the issue of high variance, making it hard to optimize model training efficiently.\nThis paper introduces Explicit Flow Matching (ExFM), a new method that directly tackles the variance issue.  **ExFM uses a modified loss function** that is more tractable and easier to optimize, leading to faster learning speed.  The researchers provide **exact formulas** for the vector field and score in various cases.  **Numerical experiments show ExFM significantly outperforms traditional methods**, demonstrating faster convergence and superior performance in terms of both learning speed and overall outcomes across a range of datasets.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XYDMAckWMa/podcast.wav"}
