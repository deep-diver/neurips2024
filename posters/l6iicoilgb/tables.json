Plots (a) and (b) compare the output of our algorithm with the benchmark algorithms mentioned at the beginning of Section 3 for a particular value of the parameter \u03bb and a varying number k of movies. Plots (c) and (d) compare the number of queries used by the various algorithms.", "description": "This figure presents the results of experiments on a personalized movie recommendation task.  It compares the performance of the proposed algorithm (Algorithm 3) against two benchmark algorithms (Buchbinder et al. 2014 and 2017) across different values of k (the number of movies) and \u03bb (a parameter controlling the importance of diversity). Plots (a) and (b) show the function values (quality of the movie subsets) obtained by each algorithm, while (c) and (d) display the number of oracle queries (objective function evaluations) required by each method.", "section": "3 Experiments"}]
