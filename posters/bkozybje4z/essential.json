Many existing methods have also disregarded the importance of invertible representation in counterfactual analysis, compromising identification assumptions. These issues make it difficult to accurately estimate how different treatment plans would impact individual outcomes over time. \nThe paper introduces Causal CPC, a new approach to counterfactual regression over time that addresses these issues.  By using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and Information Maximization (InfoMax), Causal CPC effectively captures long-term temporal dynamics and ensures identification assumptions are met.  Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The method is also computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "Paris-Saclay University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "bKOZYBJE4Z/podcast.wav"}
