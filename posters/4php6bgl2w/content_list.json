In this paper, we study the problem of efficient dynamics modeling for multi-modal visual RL. We find that under the existence of modality heterogeneity, modality-correlated and distinct features are equally important but play different roles in reflecting the evolution of environmental dynamics. Motivated by this fact, we propose Dissected Dynamics Modeling (DDM), a novel multi-modal dynamics modeling method for visual RL. Unlike existing methods, DDM explicitly distinguishes consistent and inconsistent information across modalities and treats them separately with a divide-and-conquer strategy. This is done by dispatching the features carrying different information into distinct dynamics modeling pathways, which naturally form a series of implicit regularizations along the learning trajectories. In addition, a reward predictive function is further introduced to filter task-irrelevant information in both modality-consistent and inconsistent features, ensuring information integrity while avoiding potential distractions.

A typical approach involves modeling environmental dynamics in an abstracted state space [1], where the state representations are supposed to mimic the actual environmental changes but operate on a sufficiently low dimension. One classical solution is DeepMDP [9], which leverages neural networks to compress high-dimensional input data.

In addition, such a modality relationship is not stable but constantly evolves with the highly dynamic environment. An intuitive example is given in Fig. 1 (a), where we show the observations of both RGB frames and event camera signals [26, 3] on a night-time driving scene. It can be seen that the two modalities only exhibit partially consistent context. Meanwhile, their inconsistencies include critical visual clues, such as traffic lights (in RGB frames) and cars hidden in the dark (in event signals). Existing approaches often overlook this complex and volatile status caused by modality heterogeneity, which may have detrimental impacts on learning correct environmental dynamics.

Secondly, the distinct features in each modality offer inconsistent side views of the environment. In conventional multi-modal visual tasks, these inconsistencies are typically deemed less critical and are mitigated through modality alignment [5, 40, 27]. However, in modeling RL dynamics, the inconsistent features are equally important as they 1) carry critical taskrelated clues and 2) are also the key ingredient in deducing the modality-specific state changes.

Furthermore, it extends this consistency across different temporal locations, ensuring that the learned common information resonates with environmental dynamics. Regarding modality inconsistencies, unlike standard practice that enforces mutual exclusivity with consistent features of the same modality, DDM imposes orthogonal constraints between different modalities to highlight their unique contents. This avoids overly strong regularization, which leads to improved feature quality. The decomposed inconsistent features are only used to establish the dynamics of each modality itself, which creates a more complete environment dynamics without causing interference across modalities.

Table 1 presents the performance of various methods on the CARLA benchmark using two modalities: RGB frames and event signals. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms others in all four environmental conditions. The table shows that the performances of the SAC and $\\mathrm{DrQ}$ baselines are less satisfactory, especially in complex conditions such as \u201cDazzling\u201d and \u201cMidnight\u201d. While conventional dynamics modeling methods like DeepMDP and SPR do enhance performance, their improvements are modest compared to our DDM method. For example, DDM obtains an average episode return improvement of approximately $24.4\\%$ and $21.3\\%$ over DeepMDP and SPR, respectively. This substantial enhancement is attributed to the explicit modality decomposition and processing in DDM, which significantly boosts robustness across diverse multimodal environments. The table also indicates that existing multi-modal methods achieve decent performance on CARLA. However, these methods primarily focus on modality alignment and fusion, neglecting inconsistency contexts critical for decision-making. Consequently, they do not match the efficiency of our DDM, which effectively leverages both consistent and inconsistent modality contexts for robust decision-making. The results with all four modalities are given in the Appendix. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "Results on DMControl. We further evaluate different methods on the DMControl in Table 2. Similar to the results on the CARLA benchmark, our method demonstrates significant performance improvements on DMControl.

In contrast, our DDM method consistently enhances the performance of the SAC baseline by a large margin, further verifying its effectiveness.

A key finding of our study is the crucial role of both modality commonality and differences in multi-modal dynamics modeling. To investigate this, we leverage the bisimulation metrics [8, 9] for MDPs to assess the dynamics modeling performance of different methods. Specifically, the bisimulation metrics define two states to be behaviourally similar if they have close rewards along the transition trajectory [9]. Therefore, the difference between the estimated and true rewards can reflect how closely the learned states mimic the actual environmental states. In Fig. 3(a), we plot the absolute reward difference $|R(z_{t},a_{t})-r_{t+1}|$ for three methods: DeepMDP, DDM without using $\\mathcal{L}_{o r t h}$ (i.e., only modeling modality consistency), and the full DDM model. The reward difference is plotted for each time step of the same test sequence on the CARLA benchmark. From the figure, it is clear that compared to DeepMDP, modeling modality consistency can reduce reward estimation errors. Additionally, incorporating modality inconsistency further significantly enhances estimation accuracy. These results confirm the importance of both common and differing modality contexts in accurately learning dynamics.

Research has shown that planning mechanisms can effectively model the impact of various strategies in data-rich scenarios, thus minimizing trial and error in real-world applications. In future works, we plan to integrate long-term action consequences into our decision-making processes by developing decomposed multi-modal world models. Second, our approach focuses primarily on vision-based data inputs. However, recent studies suggest that integrating diverse modal inputs, such as textual and audio data, can yield adaptable representations [47].
