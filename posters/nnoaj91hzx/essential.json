{"importance": "This paper is crucial because **it addresses the challenge of online M-concave function maximization**, a prevalent problem in various fields like economics and operations research. By establishing both positive and negative results (efficient algorithms for stochastic settings and NP-hardness for adversarial ones), it provides a comprehensive understanding of this problem's complexity and offers directions for future research.  The paper's findings significantly impact the design and analysis of online algorithms, especially in areas where function evaluations are noisy or only partially accessible.", "summary": "This paper reveals efficient stochastic bandit algorithms for maximizing M-concave functions and proves NP-hardness for adversarial full-information settings.", "takeaways": ["Stochastic bandit algorithms for M-concave function maximization achieve O(T\u207b\u00b9/\u00b2) simple regret and O(T\u00b2/\u00b3) cumulative regret.", "The greedy algorithm for M-concave function maximization is robust to local errors.", "No polynomial-time algorithms can achieve sublinear regret for adversarial full-information M-concave function maximization unless P=NP."], "tldr": "Many real-world optimization problems involve M-concave functions, which are fundamental in economics and discrete mathematics. However, perfect knowledge of these functions is often unavailable, leading to interactive optimization based on feedback. This necessitates the study of online M-concave function maximization, a topic with limited prior research.  This paper directly tackles this issue by investigating the problem under two different settings. \nThis research explores online M-concave function maximization in stochastic bandit and adversarial full-information settings.  For stochastic settings, the paper presents novel algorithms achieving low regret, leveraging the robustness of greedy algorithms. In contrast, it proves that for the adversarial full-information setting, achieving sublinear regret is computationally hard, unless P=NP. These findings provide crucial insights for designing algorithms for online M-concave function maximization, establishing clear boundaries between computationally tractable and intractable scenarios.", "affiliation": "Hokkaido University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "NnoAj91HZX/podcast.wav"}
