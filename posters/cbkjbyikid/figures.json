The process begins with data preparation, where both malicious and defensive poisoned datasets are created. These datasets are then used in the model training phase, where the model learns to respond correctly to both benign inputs and inputs containing the defensive trigger. During inference, the input image is embedded with the defensive trigger, allowing the model to correctly predict the label and mitigate the malicious backdoor's impact.
