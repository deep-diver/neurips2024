For each risk measure and risk level, the table provides the optimized values of the parameters {nj} and {aj} for the discretized spectrum, as defined in equation (10). These parameters are obtained by minimizing the distance between the original spectrum function and its discretized version, as described in the paper.", "section": "E.2 Experiments on Various Risk Measures"}]
