The requirement for \u03bbs can be easily satisfied by setting \u03bbs \u2264 \u03bb/2 for a given D. If we want to fix a predefined \u03bbs, e.g., \u03bbs = \u03bb, we need to sample different D (by sampling different Z) so that \u03bbs \u2264 \u03bb/2 is satisfied. Theorem 4.1 generally suggests that a smaller \u03bbs is better for constructing distilled data.", "description": "This figure shows the distilled data generated for MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets using Linear Ridge Regression (LRR).  The top row displays the distilled MNIST data (one image per class), and the bottom row presents the distilled CIFAR-100 data (one image per class). The caption highlights a key finding from Theorem 4.1: a smaller regularization parameter (\u03bbs) generally leads to better results when constructing distilled datasets.", "section": "4.1 Analytical Computation for Linear Ridge Regression"}, {"figure_path": "WI2VpcBdnd/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Initialized data (first row), distilled data generated from real images using techniques in Sec 4.2 (second row), and distilled data generated from random noise using techniques in Sec 4.1 (third row) for a LRR with m = 50 on MNIST and CIFAR-100.
