When answers consist of entire sentences, however, language model likelihoods become a less reliable indicator of uncertainty because probabilities must be spread over many phrasings of the same concept. Kuhn et al. [30] attempt to mitigate this issue by clustering semantically equivalent answers. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial computational overhead.

If a language model is simply learning patterns in the errors present in the training data, then we would expect this ablation to perform on par with the original method because it suffices to learn patterns in the content of the question and answer without needing the true causal relationship between question, answer, and correctness label. The results are shown in Figure 5 (left). We see the model trained on incorrect answers performs surprisingly well, on par with a Probe model, but significantly worse than a model trained on the original sampled answers.

Lastly, we examine whether a language model can be used to model not just its own uncertainties but the uncertainties of other models. Several prior works argue that models identify correct questions by way of internal representations of truth, which might be unique to a model evaluating its own generations [4, 9]. In Figure 5 (right), we show that, by contrast, Mistral 7B actual has better AUROC values when applied to LLaMA-2 7B than LLaMA-2 7B applied to itself. In Figure 5 (left), we show that sBERT [44] and OpenAI sentence embeddings are competitive with Probe on both LLaMA-2 7B and Mistral. Together, these results suggest that LLM uncertainties are likely not model-specific. The practical upside of this insight is that one strong base model can be used to estimate the uncertainties of many other models, even closed-source models behind APIs, when a small labeled dataset is available or can be generated.

The model trained on incorrect answers generalizes surprisingly well but is much worse than a model trained on the original answers. Error bars show two standard deviations over three instruction-tuned models.

To examine how our uncertainty estimates can be used in this capacity, we perform a preliminary user study (with $N=181$ participants) in which participants complete a multiple choice exam in collaboration with an LLM (Mistral 7B Instruct). For each question, the participant is provided both the LLM\u2019s prediction and an uncertainty estimate, which can be from a calibrated method or an uncalibrated method.

On the other hand, participants generally do not modulate their decision to rely on the output of a random confidence baseline (Figure 6(c)), in which the display uncertainty estimate is generated uniformly at random.

In the process, we discovered that fine-tuning is surprisingly sample efficient and does not seem to rely on representations of correctness specific to a model evaluating its own generations, allowing estimators to be applied from one model to another.

Uncertainty estimates can also be used to improve factuality of language models by increasing the likelihood of generations that the model is confident about (judges likely to be correct), for example by using an alignment procedure (e.g. RLHF, DPO) with a reward function that encourages confident generations [50].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
