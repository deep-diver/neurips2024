Existing methods for uncertainty estimation either require extensive prompting or are computationally expensive. This lack of reliable uncertainty estimates poses a significant challenge to the safe and effective deployment of LLMs.\nThis research introduces a novel approach to address this issue. By fine-tuning LLMs on a relatively small dataset of correctly and incorrectly answered questions, the researchers significantly improved uncertainty calibration.  This method proves efficient and generalizes well to diverse question types, surpassing the performance of baseline methods. Moreover, it unveils the possibility of using LLMs as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable to both their own predictions and the predictions of other models. The findings are validated through a user study, showcasing the benefits of uncertainty estimates in human-AI collaborative decision-making.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "QzvWyggrYB/podcast.wav"}
