Existing methods often struggle to balance these aspects, leading to suboptimal results.  Autoregressive models struggle with temporal alignment and efficiency, while diffusion models require numerous steps for high quality, impacting efficiency.\nFRIEREN tackles these issues with a novel approach. By employing 'rectified flow matching,' FRIEREN efficiently regresses the transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latents, enabling faster generation.  The model incorporates a non-autoregressive vector field estimator with strong temporal alignment, facilitating synchronized audio output.  Further efficiency improvements are achieved through 'reflow' and 'one-step distillation,' allowing for high-quality audio generation with minimal sampling steps. Experiments on VGGSound demonstrate FRIEREN's superiority in audio quality, alignment, and speed compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Audio-Visual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "prXfM5X2Db/podcast.wav"}
