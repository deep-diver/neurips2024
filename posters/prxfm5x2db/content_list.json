For FD, KL, and KID, the scores of FRIEREN are also very close to the best values among other models. When we employ the higher-order Dopri5 ODE solver, FRIEREN achieves further improvements in FD and IS, attaining best values of 11.64 and 12.76, respectively, while maintaining stable performance in other objective metrics, at the cost of slower sampling speed. This indicates the effectiveness of our approach. Generally, the performance of FRIEREN surpasses that of the LDM, demonstrating the superiority of rectified flow matching over the score-based paradigm of diffusion. Additionally, both FRIEREN and LDM outperform Diff-Foley in temporal alignment, proving that our architecture design achieves strong temporal alignment without the need for complex mechanisms, and can produce audio that is highly synchronized with visual input.

This is due to the convoluted nature of the sampling trajectories of these models, which disables them from sampling with large step sizes and few steps.

Notice that reflow brings in some quality degradation in sampling with 25 steps. We speculate that this is because the limited number of sampling steps restricts the data quality when generating data for reflow, resulting in a shift in the marginal distribution learned by the model.

We use a neural network to regress the conditional transport vector field with straight paths from noise to spectrogram latents, and conduct sampling by solving ODE, achieving better performance than diffusion-based and other V2A models. We adopt a vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer as well as channel-level cross-modal feature fusion to realize strong audio-video synchrony. Through a combination of reflow and one-step distillation, our model can generate high-quality audio with a few or even one sampling step, boosting the generation efficiency significantly. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art V2A performance on VGGSound. For future work, we will explore extending the model to larger scales and larger datasets to achieve V2A generation on a broader data domain. Besides, we will attempt audio generation from longer video sequences with variable lengths, rather than being limited to fixed-length short clips. These efforts aim to build a more versatile and widely applicable V2A model.

This is because $\\mathrm{Im}2\\mathrm{Wav}$ conducts a cascaded generation with 2 transformers. Moreover, its use of highbitrate audio VQVAE results in very long sequences of audio representation, significantly increasing the inference time required for the transformers, which has quadratic time complexity concerning sequence length. In contrast, Diff-Foley and FRIEREN require less inference time, and FRIEREN with Euler solver enjoys a higher speed, achieving 7.3 times faster than Diff-Foley with 25 sampling steps. This is the result of a combination of multiple factors, including model architecture, model parameters, sampling methods, and so on. Furthermore, when using FRIEREN model with reflow and one-step distillation, we can generate 5-step sampled audio in 0.064 seconds and 1-step sampled audio in just 0.031 seconds, achieving $4.5\\times$ and $9.3\\times$ acceleration compared to 25-step sampling.
