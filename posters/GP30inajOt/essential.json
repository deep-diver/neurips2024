Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, aim to reduce this cost by only updating a small subset of parameters.  However, existing LoRA optimization methods often rely on computationally expensive retraction operations or require tuning an unknown penalty parameter, hindering efficiency. \nThis paper introduces Manifold-LoRA, a novel approach that overcomes these limitations.  It leverages retraction-free optimization over the Stiefel manifold, eliminating the need for retractions and explicitly determining the penalty parameter.  The proposed method is theoretically grounded, demonstrating convergence to the optimal solution. Extensive experiments on various NLP tasks show that Manifold-LORA achieves significantly faster convergence and improved generalization performance compared to conventional LoRA.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "GP30inajOt/podcast.wav"}
