However, existing techniques often fall short due to their inability to handle the interconnected nature of graphs, resulting in reduced effectiveness.  Conventional OOD detection methods, successful in other domains, struggle when applied to graphs because they ignore the graph's structural information.\nThe proposed GRASP method tackles this challenge by introducing an innovative edge augmentation strategy combined with score propagation.  This post-hoc solution enhances the performance of existing OOD detection functions by strategically adding edges to a subset of the training data. This augmentation increases the ratio of intra-edges, provably improving the accuracy of OOD detection.  Extensive experiments show GRASP surpasses existing baselines and reduces error rates significantly.", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jb5qN3212b/podcast.wav"}
