The metrics used to evaluate the methods are mean Average Precision (mAP), Recall, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Average Normalized Modified Retrieval Rank (ANMRR).  Higher mAP, Recall, and NDCG scores indicate better performance, while a lower ANMRR score is preferred. The table allows for a quantitative comparison of the proposed method ('Ours') against several state-of-the-art techniques.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "A3jHvChR8K/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation studies on SO-ESB and SO-NTU dataset.", "description": "This table presents the results of ablation studies conducted on two datasets, SO-ESB and SO-NTU, to evaluate the effectiveness of different components of the proposed HERT framework.
