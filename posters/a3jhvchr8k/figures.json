In open-set 3DOR, training and testing sets have completely different labels.  Semi-open 3DOR introduces a more realistic scenario where training and testing sets share some coarse-grained labels but are disjoint at the fine-grained level. This reflects real-world situations where objects are often described by hierarchical labels (e.g., coarse category: \"furniture\", fine category: \"chair\"). The figure highlights the contradictory optimization problem in hierarchical open-set learning, where the model needs to both pull together objects with the same coarse label (even if they belong to different fine categories) and push apart objects from unseen categories.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "A3jHvChR8K/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An overview of the proposed Hypergraph-Based Hierarchical Equilibrium Representation framework (HERT) framework for semi-open 3D object retrieval.
