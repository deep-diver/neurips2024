Consequently, the embedding distribution from structure-aware learning tends to be unbalanced towards the feature space of seen categories in the training set.

We propose the HypergraphBased Hierarchical Equilibrium Representation (HERT) framework for semi-open 3D object retrieval. Specifically, to overcome the global disequilibrium of unseen categories, we propose the Hierarchical Retrace Embedding (HRE) module to fully leverage the multi-level category information. Besides, we perform the Structured Equilibrium Tuning (SET) module to tackle the feature overlap and class confusion problem. This module utilizes more equilibrial correlations among objects and generalizes to unseen categories, by constructing a superposed hypergraph based on the local coherent and global entangled correlations. Furthermore, we construct four 3D object datasets with multi-level category labels for semi-open 3DOR tasks, i.e., SO-ESB, SO-NTU, SO-MN40, and SO-ABO. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively generate and generalize the hierarchical embeddings of 3D objects in semi-open environments. However, due to dataset limitations, we are currently unable to verify the balanced representation effect on more than three levels of labels, which is one of our future research directions. We believe this paper can provide new insights for future research in more practical scenarios of open-set learning.
