The left and center panels show the validation error (CRPS) curves for the KNN (k neighbors) and DRF (mtry variables) models, respectively, as the hyperparameters are varied. The minimum validation errors indicate the optimal hyperparameter settings (k=8, mtry=4). The right panel presents boxplots of the test error (CRPS) obtained for KNN, DRF, model selection (selecting the best of KNN and DRF based on validation error), and convex aggregation (combining KNN and DRF predictions) over 100 repetitions. This visualization demonstrates the impact of hyperparameter tuning and model aggregation on predictive accuracy.", "section": "5 Numerical results"}, {"figure_path": "cSfxzCozPU/figures/figures_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: qsar data.

The left and middle panels show the validation CRPS error curves for KNN (k-nearest neighbors) and DRF (distributional random forest) models, respectively.  The x-axis represents the number of neighbors (k) for KNN and the number of randomly selected features (mtry) for DRF.  The optimal values of k and mtry are selected based on the minimum validation error. The right panel presents box plots of the test CRPS error obtained from 100 repetitions of the experiment for each of the four modeling strategies: KNN using optimal k, DRF using optimal mtry, model selection (choosing the best between KNN and DRF based on validation error), and convex aggregation (combining KNN and DRF predictions). The box plots visualize the distribution and variability of test error across different runs.", "section": "5 Numerical results"}]
