It highlights that for linear PDEs, the NTK is deterministic and constant during training, with a sparse Hessian, leading to convergence bounds related to the minimum eigenvalue of the NTK. In contrast, for nonlinear PDEs, the NTK is random at initialization and dynamic during training, having a non-sparse Hessian, affecting convergence bounds which become related to the minimum eigenvalue of the time-dependent NTK or are 0 or 1 in the second-order case.", "section": "3.1 The difference between linear and nonlinear PDEs"}]
