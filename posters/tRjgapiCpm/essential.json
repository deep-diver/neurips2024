However, existing privacy analyses of DP-SGD often make unrealistic assumptions, such as the adversary's access to all intermediate training steps. This leads to overly conservative privacy guarantees.The paper focuses on a more practical setting where only the final model is accessible to the adversary, making it harder to accurately assess the privacy leakage.  The current theoretical analyses fail to capture the tighter privacy guarantees in this more realistic scenario, leaving a significant gap between theory and practice.\nThis paper proposes a novel heuristic privacy analysis that addresses this gap by assuming a linear structure for the model. The heuristic is validated through experiments, showing good accuracy in estimating privacy leakage.  The study also highlights the heuristic's limitations through counterexamples, identifying situations where it underestimates the actual leakage.  These findings suggest the potential for sharper privacy guarantees in the last-iterate-only setting of DP-SGD and offer a practical tool for privacy analysis in realistic deep learning applications. This is a valuable contribution to the privacy-preserving machine learning field, potentially leading to significant improvements in both theory and practice.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "tRjgapiCpm/podcast.wav"}
