Existing testing methods often struggle with scalability, making it difficult to ensure that policies meet safety and performance criteria across all possible situations. This is particularly crucial in safety-critical applications where even rare failures can have severe consequences. The lack of efficient verification methods poses a significant challenge to widespread adoption of RL in high-stakes domains.\nThis paper introduces a novel model-based testing approach called Importance-driven Model-Based Testing (IMT). IMT addresses the scalability problem by efficiently targeting the most critical states in the state space\u2014states where the agent's decisions have the greatest impact on safety and performance.  This importance ranking is rigorously computed, allowing the method to focus its testing efforts on these key areas. By using probabilistic model checking, IMT provides formal verification guarantees about the policy's behaviour, ensuring that certain safety properties are rigorously verified. The method has been shown to discover unsafe policy behavior with significantly reduced testing effort compared to existing methods, thus improving the reliability and safety of RL policies.", "affiliation": "Graz University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "TwrnhZfD6a/podcast.wav"}
