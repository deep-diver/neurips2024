Previous attempts to combine sequence and structural information have yielded only incremental improvements.  Also, surface topology, which influences protein functionality, was mostly overlooked. \n\nThis paper introduces the Sequence-Structure-Surface Fitness (S3F) model, a novel approach that integrates protein features at multiple scales: protein sequences (using a language model), protein backbone structures (using Geometric Vector Perceptrons), and detailed surface topology. **S3F achieves state-of-the-art results on the ProteinGym benchmark**, outperforming previous methods, and provides insights into the determinants of protein function.  **Its efficiency and adaptability makes S3F a valuable tool for future protein design and engineering research.**", "affiliation": "Mila - Qu\u00e9bec AI Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "kWMVzIdCEn/podcast.wav"}
