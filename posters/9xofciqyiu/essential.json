This paper tackles this challenge by proposing a novel individualized modeling approach called Attention boosted Individualized Regression (AIR).  Existing methods often require additional information on sample similarity, making them unsuitable for many real-world applications.  AIR addresses this issue by focusing on heterogeneity within samples. \nAIR achieves individualization by learning an optimal internal relation map within each sample. This internal relation map allows the model to capture local dependencies between different parts of the input data, improving both predictive accuracy and model interpretability.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical experiments and a real-world brain MRI analysis, showcasing superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.  The close connection between AIR and the self-attention mechanism also provides a valuable new perspective on attention.", "affiliation": "City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "9xoFciqYIU/podcast.wav"}
