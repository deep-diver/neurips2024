Firstly, we develop a deformable feature aggregation operation modulated by Retinex information. Specifically, Deformable Convolution (DCN) [48, 9] is adopted to capture dynamic long range dependencies of the fused feature $\\mathbf{F}_{f}$ . For example, when DCN is applied to the token delineated by the red frame in $\\mathbf{F}_{f}$ of Fig. 3, its receptive field is an irregular kernel and the activated tokens are outlined in blue. More importantly, when the red frame is sliding across the feature map, the irregular kernel varies and we record which tokens are activated. After this process, we obtain the total activation number and calculate the average activation frequency for each token. Therefore, we can obtain an activation response map shown in $\\mathbf{F}_{d}$ of Fig. 3, where tokens with higher activation frequency represent important features. Specifically, relatively brighter areas in under-exposed images or relatively normally exposed areas in over-exposed images contain important features and exhibit a large activation response. Based on the obtained activation response map, we propose a feature-aware scanning strategy. Different from \u201cdirection-sensitive\u201d scanning method [27], our feature-aware strategy ranks tokens by their activation frequency and place tokens with higher frequencies at the start of the sequence. Therefore, our generated sequence effectively meets Mamba\u2019s requirements, thereby maximizing its modeling capabilities for vision data.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ECMamba significantly outperforms the current SOTA methods on both multi-exposure correction datasets and under-exposure correction datasets. We recognize that our work, while pioneering in certain aspects, also highlights avenues for future investigation. For example, similar to other methods, ECMamba struggles to deliver satisfactory results in scenarios involving extreme exposure cases (extremely dark or over-exposed environments) due to the extensive information loss inherent in degraded images. Essentially, directing recovery from severely degraded images is challenging, but recent advances in image restoration have utilized generative priors to infer the degraded details, and achieve favorable results. In the future, we plan to integrate Mamba with generative priors to effectively alleviate the performance drop on extreme exposure cases.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
