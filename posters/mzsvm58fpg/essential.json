Existing deep learning models struggle with balancing high performance and efficiency, and often don't fully integrate Retinex theory, which helps separate illumination and reflectance. This limitation leads to suboptimal results. Additionally, many existing approaches are limited in their generalizability.\nThis paper introduces ECMamba, a novel MEC framework inspired by the efficient Mamba sequence modeling. It uses a dual-branch design, each dedicated to restoring reflectance and illumination maps guided by Retinex estimation. The core of ECMamba is a novel 2D Selective State-space layer (Retinex-SS2D) using a deformable feature aggregation and feature-aware scanning, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments demonstrate that ECMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.", "affiliation": "McMaster University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "mZsvm58FPG/podcast.wav"}
