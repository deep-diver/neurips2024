Smaller models offer resource efficiency but often lack accuracy in zero/few-shot scenarios.  The challenge lies in developing accurate and efficient models for diverse real-world datasets.\nThis paper introduces Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), small yet powerful pre-trained models for improved multivariate time series forecasting. TTM utilizes a lightweight architecture and incorporates innovations such as adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. It outperforms current benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by a significant margin (4-40%), while being extremely resource-efficient, and suitable for deployment even on CPU-only machines.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3O5YCEWETq/podcast.wav"}
