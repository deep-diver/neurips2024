Recent jailbreaking methods generate adversarial prompts capable of bypassing safety filters and producing unsafe content, exposing vulnerabilities in influential commercial models. However, once these adversarial prompts are identified, the safety fliter can be updated to prevent the generation of unsafe images. In this work, we propose an effective, simple, and difficult-to-detect jailbreaking solution: generating safe content initially with normal text prompts and then editing the generations to embed unsafe content.

However, implementing such a solution is non-trivial, and we need to overcome several challenges: how to automatically confirm the normal prompt to replace the unsafe prompts, and how to effectively perform editable replacement and naturally generate unsafe content.

Inspired by Inpainting Anything[45], in general, we use substitution word $s$ as a text prompt, mask the area related to the text prompt based on SAM, and apply inpainting model for editing. Initially, as SAM\u2019s input consists of points, mask, and bounding box, but not text prompt, we employ CLIP Surgery [21], which converts text prompt into points by leveraging the explainability of CLIP. Then, we generate a preliminary semantic segmentation map utilizing the robust semantic segmentation capabilities of SAM[20], and then obtain the mask of the editing region. Subsequently, we edit the image using the pre-trained Fooocus-Inpainting model to inject unsafe content. For Fooocus-Inpainting, we set the image size to $512\\times512$ . For the hyperparameters, the guidance scale is 7.5, the num inference steps is 50, and the strength is 0.9999.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
