Prior work suggests ICL involves implicit gradient descent, but this is unproven for complex scenarios. The use of linear transformers\u2014simplified, more interpretable models\u2014could potentially improve our understanding. This paper specifically focuses on the challenge of applying linear transformers to noisy data.\nThis study proves that each layer of a linear transformer functions as a linear regression model, revealing an underlying algorithm similar to preconditioned gradient descent with momentum.  Remarkably, when trained on noisy data, the linear transformers automatically adapt their optimization strategy, incorporating noise level information.  Their performance often matches or even exceeds more explicitly designed algorithms. This unexpected discovery highlights the potential of simple architectures to yield complex, effective algorithms.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "p1ft33Mu3J/podcast.wav"}
