The experiments compare the performance of different calibration methods after 50 iterations.  The results are reported as the KL divergence between the final posterior and the initial (prior) posterior, and the KL divergence between the final posterior and the true posterior (given complete knowledge of the simulator). Lower KL divergence to the true posterior indicates better performance.

It compares the performance of different algorithms (BACON, IMSPE, D-optimal, Random, and VBMC) after 30 iterations, using batches of 4 simulations at each iteration.

The results show the average KL divergence between the final posterior and the initial posterior (DKL(PT||PO)) and the KL divergence between the final posterior and the true posterior (DKL(PT||P*)) across 10 independent runs.
