Existing methods mostly reuse existing designs, potentially missing informative correlations and wasting resources.  This is particularly problematic in complex applications with high simulation costs. \n\nThis research presents BACON, a novel data-efficient algorithm that addresses this issue.  By adopting a Bayesian adaptive experimental design approach, BACON jointly estimates parameters and optimal designs to maximize information gain at each step. This batch-sequential process uses Gaussian processes to effectively model simulations and correlate them with real data. Experiments across synthetic and real datasets showcase BACON's superiority in terms of computational savings and estimation accuracy compared to existing approaches.", "affiliation": "CSIRO's Data61", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "m906PS5G9x/podcast.wav"}
