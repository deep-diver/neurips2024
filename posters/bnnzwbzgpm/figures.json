The x-axis represents the number of hyper-iterations, and the y-axis represents the validation loss.  The results show that the without-replacement sampling methods (shuffle-once and random-reshuffling) outperform the independent sampling method, converging to a lower validation loss.", "section": "5.1 Invariant Risk-Minimization"}, {"figure_path": "BNnZwbZGpm/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of different algorithms for the Hyper-data Cleaning task.
