Existing methods use coarse-to-fine matching, but coarse matching is often sparse and inaccurate, impacting fine matching.  This necessitates using computationally expensive methods, unsuitable for real-time applications. \nThe paper introduces CAST, a novel consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer.  **CAST employs spot-guided cross-attention to focus on relevant areas, and a consistency-aware self-attention module to enhance matching with geometrically consistent correspondences.**  It also includes a lightweight fine-matching module that improves accuracy and reduces computational demands. Experimental results show that CAST significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for real-time applications.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "btLLWaOrFs/podcast.wav"}
