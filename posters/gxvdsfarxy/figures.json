It consists of three main modules: Feature Extraction, PhyloTree Construction, and PhyloTree Structure Modeling. The Feature Extraction module uses a pre-trained language model to extract genome embeddings from raw sequences. The PhyloTree Construction module utilizes these embeddings to generate an initial tree structure using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm. Finally, the PhyloTree Structure Modeling module jointly optimizes the tree topology and branch lengths through two components: a topology learning component and a branch length learning component. The topology learning component refines the initial tree structure by leveraging an encoder and a decoder. The branch length learning component utilizes a dual-pass traversal mechanism and a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) to optimize branch lengths.
