However, the current input for initial pose still relies on predefined gait sequence templates (6; 2; 3; 4; 5) or manual measurement of pose angles from accident images, the former cannot represent the posture of pedestrians in real accidents, and the latter is inefficient. Computer vision-based pedestrian pose estimation methods can directly estimate pose information such as joint positions or limb angles from images in real-time (7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13). Existing pose estimation methods are trained and applied on multiple datasets for various scenarios, adapting to different downstream tasks. However, unlike common poses, pedestrian pre-collision poses in traffic scenes are specific, with differences in spatialtemporal characteristics and challenges such as dynamic backgrounds, sudden scene changes, and occlusions of lower limbs (14; 15).

Pedestrian pre-collision pose is crucial for studying collision damage, as the initial posture at the time of impact directly affects the severity and nature of the injuries (28; 6; 29; 30; 3; 31). Early studies estimated collision poses by collecting post-accident data from pedestrians and vehicles (32). Cadaver tests (33) became effective for biomechanical damage studies but are limited by ethics, sample size, and high costs. Currently, collision simulation software is the most convenient and effective method to assess damage under various poses (2; 3; 4; 5). However, initial collision poses are often fixed templates or simple categories (6; 2; 3; 4; 5), differing significantly from real pre-collision poses. One method to obtain pre-collision poses is using motion capture in virtual environments with volunteers (34), but this is limited by device constraints and lack of real danger. Another method captures collision sequences from real accident videos, manually measuring posture angles or adjusting dummies to match real collision poses (33). This method is closer to real accident scenarios but is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and lacks standardized testing, limiting its use to single accident reconstructions. With advances in deep learning and computer vision, some research has employed human pose estimation algorithms to automatically extract collision poses from accident images (15), providing a new approach to acquiring pre-collision poses in real accidents. Rapid and accurate acquisition of pedestrian pre-collision poses supports research on collision damage and active safety protection.

Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a fundamental task of computer vision, which aims to obtain human pose information such as joint positions and angle from images and videos (35).

Though 3D coordinates can be regressed directly from images (37; 38; 39; 40; 41), using 2D pose as intermediate supervision before lifting to 3D often achieves higher accuracy (9; 42). Additionally, the SMPL (Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model) (43) has gained popularity for providing pose and morphological information, along with prior knowledge of body structure, avoiding issues with limb length changes (44; 11; 12; 27).

Similar to (69), Table 5 reports results for multiple baselines on the PVCP testset using the evaluation metrics described in Sec. 5.1. We compare the classic baseline methods of two paradigms: the one-stage method, which involves direct regression from image to mesh, and the two-stage method, which involves regression from 2D pose to 3D mesh. Following (66; 67), in the one-stage method, we used ResNet-50 (63) to extract the feature $f^{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2048}$ of the collision pedestrian clip-off image in each frame. Following (68), We use DarkPose (70) to extract 2D poses in COCO format (20). For MotionBERT (12) and our method, 2D pose is converted from 15 keypoints of JHMDB (60) to the corresponding 17 keypoints of Human3.6 (16) as input. Because the PVCP dataset contains only pose and shape annotations, there is a lack of spatial arrangement in the 3D scene. Therefore, the error of MPVE and MPJPE is large, but in PAMPVE and PAMPJPE, our method achieves the best accuracy. In addition, in the one-stage method, the effect of PARE (67) is relatively excellent, because PARE has optimized the occlusion of pedestrians and is well adapted to the real situation of the occlusion of pedestrians\u2019 lower limbs in the collision scene. In addition, the two-stage method needs to detect the 2D pose first, and the missing keypoints detection caused by occlusion will continue the error to the subsequent Mesh regression stage.

Furthermore, we adopt the pose prior of the pre-trained model and the idea of iterative regression, introducing the pose class loss to achieve the minimum error on the PVCP testset, effectively estimating the pedestrian pre-collision pose in traffic collision scenarios.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
