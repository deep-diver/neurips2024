This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on physical properties of systems.  This paper addresses the issues with **data efficiency and generalizability** of existing machine learning models, particularly in contexts where physical laws and symmetries govern system behavior. \nThe authors introduce HHD-GP, a novel framework combining Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition with Gaussian Processes.  HHD-GP simultaneously learns the curl-free and divergence-free components of a dynamical system, improving model interpretability and identifiability. Experiments show that HHD-GP achieves better predictive performance on benchmark datasets while also providing physically meaningful decompositions. The paper also introduces a symmetry-preserving extension of HHD-GP that further enhances performance and interpretability by leveraging inherent symmetries within systems.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "T9PfJViMiJ/podcast.wav"}
