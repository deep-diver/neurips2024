Existing algorithms for this setting often rely on simplified assumptions like tabular structures or linear models, limiting their applicability to real-world problems. Kernel-based methods offer a powerful alternative with high representational capacity, but their theoretical analysis in this setting remains largely unexplored. \nThis paper introduces KUCB-RL, a novel optimistic algorithm using kernel-based function approximation.  It leverages a novel confidence interval to construct an optimistic proxy of the value function. The authors prove that KUCB-RL achieves no-regret performance guarantees, a significant contribution to the field.  The algorithm's effectiveness extends beyond the typical assumptions of linear or tabular models, making it suitable for a wider range of applications.  **The theoretical results are backed by a rigorous mathematical analysis, enhancing the reliability and applicability of the approach**.", "affiliation": "MediaTek Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VwUTz2pOnD/podcast.wav"}
