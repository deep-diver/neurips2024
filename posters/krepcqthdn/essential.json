However, individual characteristics often influence state transitions in ways that are not directly observable, creating a significant challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on identifying these hidden, individual-specific factors that affect state transitions.  It does so by introducing a new framework that explicitly incorporates these latent factors, ensuring that the model considers individual differences when learning policies.\nThe authors propose a two-stage approach: First, a novel framework, Individualized Markov Decision Processes (iMDP), is developed to model individualized decision-making by integrating latent individual-specific factors into state-transition processes. This enables them to prove the identifiability of the latent factors under certain conditions. Second, a generative model is designed to estimate these factors from observed data, allowing for accurate and effective policy learning for each individual. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various datasets, showing its potential to improve the performance and personalization of RL policies in various applications.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "kREpCQtHdN/podcast.wav"}
