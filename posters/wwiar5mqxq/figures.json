The left side illustrates the multi-agent reflection framework. The system first computes the identifier i of the agent to respond at the current time (Step 1). Then, agent i updates its memory, including reflections of previous trials and the current trial's historical interactions (Step 2), perceives the environmental state such as the question and current task scores (Step 3), and generates the action (Step 4). After several rounds of interaction, the task trajectory and the reward score are fed into reflectors along with agent profiles to generate reflections, which are then stored in long-term memories and serve as additional context for the continuous optimization of actor prompts. On the right side, we depict the construction of counterfactual rewards, which are further employed for fine-tuning the shared reflector.", "description": "This figure provides a visual representation of the COPPER framework.
