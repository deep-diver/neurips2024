The streaming model, ideal for processing massive datasets, faces challenges in ensuring robustness against adaptive adversaries who can manipulate inputs based on algorithm's past outputs. Prior work on adversarially robust L_p estimation (calculating a norm of data) in the turnstile streaming model (where data can increase or decrease) faced space limitations due to the dense-sparse trade-off technique. This technique combines sparse recovery and differential privacy, but hasn't seen improvements since 2022.\nThis paper introduces improved algorithms for adversarially robust L_p heavy hitters (identifying frequent items) and residual estimation.  By leveraging deterministic turnstile heavy-hitter algorithms and a novel method for estimating the frequency moment of the tail vector, the authors achieve better space complexities than previous techniques.  The improved algorithms for adversarially robust L_p estimation are a significant step forward, showing that the previously assumed limitations weren't inherent.  The results provide a conceptual advancement, suggesting a new direction for developing more efficient and robust streaming algorithms.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "MPidsCd9e7/podcast.wav"}
