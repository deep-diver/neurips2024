Smaller flip numbers indicate less space needed by the algorithm.", "description": "The figure shows the results of empirical evaluations performed on the CAIDA dataset to compare the flip numbers of the p-th frequency moment and the residual. The results are shown across different accuracy parameters (\u03b5), heavy-hitter parameters (a), and frequency moment parameters (p). Smaller flip numbers suggest that less space is required by the algorithm.", "section": "5 Empirical Evaluations"}]
