Existing methods often struggle with spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance, especially when using implicit neural representations or explicit Gaussian splatting.  These limitations hinder the creation of realistic and visually appealing dynamic 3D models suitable for applications like gaming and film.\nDreamMesh4D addresses these issues by introducing a novel framework that combines mesh representation with geometric skinning.  Instead of relying on traditional texture maps, it binds Gaussian splats to the mesh's faces. This hybrid approach allows for differentiable optimization of both texture and mesh vertices, resulting in improved quality and consistency.  A novel skinning algorithm mitigates the drawbacks of existing methods, further enhancing the quality of the generated 4D objects.  Extensive experiments demonstrate DreamMesh4D's superiority in terms of rendering quality and spatial-temporal consistency, highlighting its potential in various industries.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "6ZwJSk2kvU/podcast.wav"}
