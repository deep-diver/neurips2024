Previous methods mainly rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices. In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm. The skinning algorithm is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the dynamic deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score distillation loss as well as other regularization losses in a two-stage manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of our method in terms of both rendering quality and spatial-temporal consistency.

Flat Gaussians are bound to mesh faces based on barycentric coordinates hence the rendering process of 2D images is differentiable with respect to both the position of mesh vertices and the attributes of Gaussians. For high-quality object modeling and efficient motion driving of the object, our method is designed in a static-to-dynamic optimization manner. In particular, during the static stage, an initial coarse mesh is generated utilizing existing image-to-3D generation methods [26, 68, 61]. Then we refine its both geometry and texture by jointly optimizing the mesh vertices as well as the attributes of bound surface Gaussians under the hybrid representation via both the reference image photometric loss and the SDS loss. For dynamic learning, we uniformly sample sparse control nodes from the surface of the refined mesh, to build a deformation graph. Then at each timestamp, transformation associated with each control node is predicted by a deformation network. The deformation of all mesh vertices and surface Gaussians are obtained from those predicted transformations via a novel geometric skinning algorithm, which beneftis from both the LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning) methods.

By employing a Gaussian-mesh hybrid representation, we simultaneously refine both the geometry and texture of the object. This approach allows the static object to serve as an excellent starting point for dynamic learning. During the dynamic stage, we construct a deformation graph on the object\u2019s surface using geodesic distance. Thereafter, the motion of the entire mesh, as well as the surface Gaussians, are driven by sparse control nodes via a novel geometric skinning algorithm named adaptive hybrid skinning. It beneftis from the strengths of both Linear Blending Skinning (LBS) and Dual-Quaternion Skinning (DQS), enabling more robust deformation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of our method in generating high-fidelity 4D objects. It significantly surpasses previous methods in both rendering quality and spatial-temporal consistency, establishing a new benchmark for video-to-4D tasks. While our method benefits a lot from the mesh-based representation, it reveals a promising direction in the field of video-to-4D generation.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
