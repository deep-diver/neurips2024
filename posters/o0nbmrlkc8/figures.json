It shows how a user instruction (search for Lakers game results and create a note) involves navigating through multiple screens and operations.  The \"focus content\" (Lakers game score) is located on a previous screen and needs to be accessed again to complete the task.  The length of the image-text input sequence grows with each operation, becoming increasingly difficult for a single agent to manage both task progress and relevant content from past screens. This highlights the need for a more advanced architecture like the multi-agent approach proposed by the authors.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "O0nBMRlkc8/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of the overall framework of Mobile-Agent-v2.", "description": "This figure shows the overall framework of Mobile-Agent-v2, a multi-agent architecture for mobile device operation assistance.

The decision agent, informed by the task progress, the current screen (visual perception module output), and the result of the previous reflection, makes decisions and performs operations. The reflection agent observes the states before and after an operation to evaluate its outcome and provide feedback to the decision agent.
