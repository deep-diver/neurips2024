Prior studies often simplified this challenge by assuming linear outputs or linearly separable tasks.  However, these assumptions don't hold true for many real-world applications, leading to limitations in understanding the roles of nonlinearities and input-data distribution. This paper addresses this limitation by focusing on a more realistic model.\nThe authors developed a new stochastic-process approach to model learning dynamics in nonlinear perceptrons, analyzing binary classification tasks under both supervised and reinforcement learning rules. They discovered that input noise differently impacts learning speed depending on the type of learning, and it also determines how fast learning of a previous task is overwritten.  The approach was verified on the MNIST dataset, showcasing its practicality and potential for more complex neural network architectures.", "affiliation": "University of Oregon", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "doaJTihgIZ/podcast.wav"}
