These methods often rely on static embedding comparisons, which are ineffective in such scenarios because the output embeddings of different samples tend to converge, obscuring meaningful distinctions. This convergence is termed 'pattern collapse'.  The paper highlights the limitations of existing GLMs in accurately handling mathematical reasoning problems due to this pattern collapse. \nTo address this, the paper proposes a novel trajectory-based method called TV Score. This method focuses on the dynamic changes in embeddings as a GLM processes input, rather than just the final embedding.  By analyzing the volatility of these embedding trajectories, TV Score effectively distinguishes between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, even when their final embeddings are similar.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that TV Score significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various mathematical reasoning datasets and GLMs. The method's generalizability is also explored, showing promise for application to other tasks with high-density outputs.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "hYMxyeyEc5/podcast.wav"}
