This produces a greater likelihood of trajectory variation under different samples in mathematical reasoning.", "description": "The figure shows a comparison of embedding trajectory behavior between mathematical reasoning and text generation tasks.  In mathematical reasoning, the \"pattern collapse\" phenomenon is observed, where trajectories from initially distinct samples converge towards the same endpoint in the output space. This is in contrast to text generation, where trajectories remain more distinct.  The difference in trajectory behavior is highlighted as a key aspect for differentiating in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in mathematical reasoning.", "section": "2 Dynamic Embedding Trajectory Distinguishes ID and OOD Samples in Mathematical Reasoning"}, {"figure_path": "hYMxyeyEc5/figures/figures_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Trajectory volatility curve comparisons between one ID data and ten OOD data from diverse mathematical domains.

Each line represents the average 2-norm of the embedding differences between adjacent layers for a dataset, showing the volatility of the embedding trajectory during the model's reasoning process. The color shading around each line indicates the standard deviation of the volatility values across samples within the dataset. Llama2-7B was used as the language model in these experiments. The figure demonstrates that OOD samples exhibit significantly different trajectory volatility patterns compared to ID samples, supporting the use of trajectory volatility as a metric for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning.", "section": "2.2 Empirical Analysis: Early Stabilization of ID samples"}, {"figure_path": "hYMxyeyEc5/figures/figures_28_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Embedding projection and cases of input and output spaces under mathematical reasoning and text generation scenarios.
