Accordingly, understanding how and when useful features can be captured, along with providing assurances on the quality of learned representations, is an ongoing endeavor [27]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "A natural approach to this problem is to model the input data $X=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{d_{x}})$ as $X=f(Z)$ , where $f$ is a nonlinear transformation that maps structured underlying latent generative factors $Z=(Z_{1},\\L...,Z_{d_{z}})$ to $X$ , and then to attempt to recover the model parameters $Z,f$ from $X$ . This is an appealing approach since it implies no restrictions on the data $X$ , and has the interpretation of recovering \u201cground truth\u201d factors that generated the data. It is well-known that without additional assumptions, this is impossible [46, 71], a fact which has led to a long line of work on nonlinear ICA [21, 45] and unsupervised disentanglement [9, 88, 62]. One approach to resolve this limitation is to assume that $Z$ has an intrinsic causal interpretation. This is known as Causal Representation Learning (CRL) [102, 101], which endeavors to identify useful representations through the lens of causality. Structurally, the latent factors $Z$ are assumed to have causal relationships among them, which enables us to reason about effects of interventions and conditioning on these latent factors. CRL studies this setting via an intricate interplay of ideas from causality, latent variable modeling and deep learning, with the main goal being to reconstruct the mixing function $f$ and $Z$ , the true generative factors of data, by leveraging causal assumptions. Recent years have witnessed a surge of rigorous results on provably learning causal representations under different assumptions [53, 33, 70, 60, 78, 142, 36, 123, 49, 115]. For example, as long as we have access to interventions on each latent variable $Z_{j}$ (a total of at least $d_{z}$ interventions), under weak assumptions on $Z$ and/or $f$ , the causal model over $Z$ as well as the model parameters $(Z,f)$ can be uniquely identified [111, 14].

At the same time, there are yet many other applications where the strict notion of causality may not be needed, and moreover it may not be necessary to learn the full causal model over every causal factor. Is there a middle ground where we can simultaneously identify a smaller set of interpretable latent representations, without the need for a huge number of interventions?

Instead of recovering a (potentially huge) number of causal latents with interventions, we settle for recovering a smaller number of interpretable concepts without strict interventions. The basic idea is to recover projections $A Z$ of the generative factors $Z$ that correspond to meaningful, human-interpretable concepts through conditioning instead of intervention. The idea to model concepts as linear projections of the generative factors is derived from a growing body of literature (e.g. [90, 55, 130, 77, 5, 22, 30, 17, 118, 81, 38, 75, 103], see Section 3 for even more references) showing that the embeddings learned by modern, high-performant foundation models are not inherently interpretable, and instead capture interpretable concepts as linear projections of the (apriori) unintelligible embeddings. While this approach sacrifices causal semantics, it makes up for this with two crucial advantages: 1) Instead of strict interventions in the latent space, it suffices to condition on the concepts, and 2) When there are $n$ concepts of interest to be learned, only $n+2\\ll d_{z}$ such concept conditionals are needed.

We do not assume that $f$ and $Z$ correspond to a ground truth model or that the latent variables $Z$ themselves are related to a causal model or are interpretable and instead only assume linearity of representations (well supported by prior works). In agreement with this hypothesis we define concepts as affine subspaces $A Z=b$ of the latent space of $Z\\mathrm{s}$ , i.e., to a concept $C$ we assign an affine hyperplane $H_{C}=\\{Z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{z}}:\\dot{A}Z=b\\}$ in the embedding space and we say that $X=f(Z)$ satisfies a concept $C$ if $Z\\in H_{C}$ . In this setting the usual goal of CRL to reconstruct $f$ and $Z$ seems to be unneccesary for many applications. Instead we focus on the more modest goal of identifying only a (small) set of concepts we care about, i.e., we want to be able to decide whether a datapoint $X$ satisfies a concept $C$ .

The second is that the various assumptions that go into these works are often difficult to achieve, such as requiring perfect interventions [111, 14].

However, this suffers from the drawbacks that it is mathematically subtle to condition on sets of measure 0 and this does not account for inherent noise in the learned representations. Therefore we relax this strict conditioning by drawing inspiration from how data is collected in practice: We sample $X$ from the base distribution and then keep it if it satisfies our concept $C$ . This leads us to define $p_{C}(Z)\\propto p(Z)q(Z|C)$ where $q$ is defined to be the probability that $Z$ is perceived to be in $H$ by the data collector and can be chosen to incorporate noise in our data gathering scheme. Therefore, this can also be viewed from a Bayesian information gathering viewpoint, as well as a stochastic fliter standpoint. This is the notion we study in this work (Definition 3) and we develop theoretical techniques to guarantee identifiability in this formulation.

Apriori, there is no reason why the high-dimensional underlying latent $Z\\mathrm{s}$ should be interpretable, particularly for large $d_{z}$ . To make the situation worse, there may be other potentially composite concepts that humans can conjure up; indeed, there is no limit to the number of concepts that humans can conjure, and these almost certainly are not going to correspond to the true $Z\\mathrm{s}$ . Because of this mismatch between the \u201ctrue\u201d $Z\\mathrm{s}$ and interpretable concepts, even if we could recover the $Z\\mathrm{s}$ , they may not be interpretable to humans and therefore less useful for downstream HIL purposes. The second caveat, and which follows from the first as a soft corollary, is that interventions on these will be much harder to obtain, particularly perfect interventions which require us to isolate the generative mechanisms of the latent factor with the other factors. Furthermore, some concepts are not manipulable, e.g. psychological traits, biological mechanisms, so obtaining interventional data is not possible in these applications. Accordingly, there has been considerable recent work, especially in the explainable AI (XAI) community on extracting human-interpretable concepts from latent generative factors, or more generally from complex foundation model representations [55, 103, 18, 41, 137].

Here, identifiability is the notion that a unique set of parameters fit the model (up to trivial transformations).

Then, a series of transformer layers act on this vector which passes through a residual stream, to obtain vectors $x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}$ .

[66], ITI was shown to significantly improve the truthfulness of various LLMs after having been trained on as few as a few dozen samples, compared to what\u2019s needed for Reinforcement Learning based techqniues [84, 34]. ITI was evaluated on the TruthfulQA benchmark [68], which is a hard adversarial benchmark to evaluate truthfulness of language models. In particular, it contains 817 questions with a multiple-choice and generation tracks, spanning 38 categories such as logical falsehoods, conspiracies and common points of confusion. For the multiplechoice questions, the accuracy is determined by the conditional probabilities of candidate answers given the question. Evaluating the generation track questions is harder, and it is done by generating a model output and then evaluating it via a finetuned GPT-3-13B model [68, 80]. Moreover, the choice of the intervention strength $\\alpha$ is calibrated so that it\u2019s neither too small (to promote truthfulness) nor too large (to ensure the original capabilities of the LLM are not lost). To check if the original capabilies are preserved, [66] compute two additional quantities to measure how far the modified model deviates from the original model. These are the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss, which is standard in language modeling and the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (KL div.) of the next token probabilities before and after intervention. To compute these quantities, a subset of Open Web Text is used [91]. Finally, it was shown that ITI implemented on the LLaMA [119], Alpaca [116] and Vicuna [20] models significantly improved their performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark compared to the baseline models.

We use our framework to illustrate in more detail one possible explanation of what ITI does to the model representations and why it works, in the next section.   \n2. The authors visualize the geometry of \u201ctruth\u201d representations in section 3.2 of their work via the following experiment: For the most significant head (layer 14, head 18), after finding the first truthful direction via the linear probing technique, they remove it and attempt to find a second probe orthogonal to the first. They find surprisingly that the second probe is also very informative, leading them to predict that the concept of \u201ctruth\u201d lies in a subspace, not a single direction.
