These inferred rewards serve dual purposes: they act as value targets for further refining the process reward model and also facilitate the selection of high-quality traces for policy model self-training. We first show that the treesearch policy in ReST-MCTS\u2217achieves higher accuracy compared with prior LLM reasoning baselines such as Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thought, within the same search budget.

Similar to most Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, LLM self-training requires a reward signal. Most existing reinforced self-improvement approaches (e.g., STaR [4], RFT [5], $\\mathrm{ReST}^{\\mathrm{EM}}$ [6], V-STaR [7]) assume to have access to a ground-truth reward model (labels from supervised dataset, or a pre-trained reward model). These approaches use an LLM to generate multiple samples for each question, and assume the one that leads to high reward (correct solution) is the high-quality sample, and later train on these samples (hence self-training). Such procedures can be effective in improving LLM performance, in some cases solving reasoning tasks that the base LLM cannot otherwise solve [8; 9; 10]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, a key limitation of the above procedure is that even if a reasoning trace results in a correct solution, it does not necessarily imply that the entire trace is accurate.

Consequently, a self-training dataset can often contain many false positives \u2014 intermediate reasoning traces or plans are incorrect, but the final output is correct \u2014 which limits the final performance of LLM fine-tuning for complex reasoning tasks [18; 19]. One way to tackle this issue is to use a value function or reward model to verify reasoning traces for correctness (which then serves as a learning signal for self-training) [1; 12]. However, training a reliable reward model to verify every step in a reasoning trace generally depends on dense human-generated annotations (per reasoning step) [1], which does not scale well. Our research aims to address this gap by developing a novel approach that automates the acquisition of reliable reasoning traces while effectively utilizing reward signals for verification purposes.
