Unfortunately, the beneftis of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS\u2019s convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The pointbacktracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes.

Furthermore, these techniques must be considered for running on mobile devices which have a limited computing power and storage space. In this aspect, it is crucial to not only achieve photorealistic rendering results, but also reduce the computational cost related to storage, memory and rendering pipeline. To achieve this, the spatio-temporal representation should be explicit and efficient to handle the complexity of dynamic motions in videos.

The MLP-based methods have shown high-fidelity rendering quality. However, the inevitable cost of decoding the implicit representation makes rendering critically slow. Various methods try to reduce the cost by adapting explicit representation, such as voxel [9, 10] and matrix decomposition [11, 12].

However, these methods can only be trained under a restricted condition with dense point clouds. Moreover, these approaches borrow implicit representations for implementation, which lose the inherent advantage of 3DGS and make real-world applications more difficult.

Our key idea is to apply interpolation techniques under temporal explicit representation to realize the scalable 3DGS model. Temporal interpolation is a widely used technique in computer graphics [16] that only stores keyframe information in video and determines smooth transitions for the rest of the frames. We select keyframes with sparse time intervals and save the additional temporal information at each keyframe which includes each Gaussian\u2019s position, rotation and opacity. This information is fully explicit; it is stored without any encoding process, and continuous motion is calculated to have smooth temporal transitions between adjacent keyframes. Here, we use a polynomial basis interpolator for position, a spherical interpolator for rotation, and a simplified Gaussian mixture model for opacity. Specifically, the polynomial basis of cubic Hermite spline (CHip) [17] is used to effectively avoid overfitting or over-smoothing problems by spanning low-degree polynomials. For rotation, we introduce Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) [18] to do a linear transition over angles.

We first initialize all Gaussian points in a scene to be static which are assumed to move linearly. During training, static points with large movements are automatically classified as dynamic points. Next, we adopt a progressive training scheme to train our model even under sparse point cloud conditions. The progressive training, starting with a short duration and scaling up, can prevent falling into local minima by reducing the sudden appearance of objects. Lastly, an additional point backtracking technique is introduced to enhance rendering quality. Detecting redundant points in a dynamic scene is challenging because we need to consider all visible timestamps.

The ability of neural networks to process implicit information in images enables novel view synthesis with a sparse set of observations. Prior works on constructing multi-plane images (MPI)[23, 24, 25] use aggregated pixel information from correspondences in sparsely sampled views. MPI representation may fail with wide angles between the camera and depth planes.

To resolve this issue, works in [54, 55] develop light field-inspired representations for single-pass pixel rendering. Both [56] and [57] introduce efficient voxel-based scene representations to improve the rendering speed. However, continuous representation inevitably combines with neural networks to implement its complex nature, and this limits rendering speed. As an alternative, 3DGS [13] is designed to construct an explicit radiance field through rasterization, not requiring MLP-based inference.

First, our reconstruction can get stuck in local minima for newly appeared objects that are not initialized with 3D points and have no relevant 3D Gaussians in neighboring frames. This issue could be mitigated by initializing new 3D points with an additional geometric prior such as depth information. Second, as 3DGS suffers from scale ambiguity, training on monocular videos is challenging. This is because every 3D Gaussians are treated as dynamic due to the lack of accurate geometric clues for objects at each timestamp. This challenge can be addressed by incorporating an additional semantic cue information like object mask and optical flow, which account for objects\u2019 motions more explicitly.
