This presents a significant challenge for applications where only limited user feedback is available (e.g., web search results).  Existing learning algorithms, while providing some solutions, are often inefficient and impractical for real-world settings. This paper addresses the problem of learning RUMs from small slates (subsets of available choices).\nThe researchers demonstrate that for accurate predictions, a surprisingly small slate size is sufficient for accurate prediction.  They then introduce new algorithms to efficiently learn RUMs from these limited data points and establish matching lower bounds.  **These lower bounds provide critical insights into the limitations of learning RUMs from small datasets**.  The work also has implications for related theoretical problems, like fractional k-deck and trace reconstruction.  This addresses a fundamental challenge in the field, leading to better predictive models and insights.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "0nSY8NiILP/podcast.wav"}
