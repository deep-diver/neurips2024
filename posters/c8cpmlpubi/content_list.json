A notable body of work within RL has been dedicated to integrating expert demonstrations to accelerate the learning process, employing strategies like offline pretraining [7] and the use of combined offline-online datasets [8, 9]. While these approaches are theoretically sound and empirically validated [10, 11], they typically presume homogeneity between the offline and online datasets.

In the original version of Deep Sea, the goal is always on the bottom-right corner of the map.
