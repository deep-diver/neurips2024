Given a single image, our framework reconstructs an animatable 3D Gaussian-based head avatar, achieving real-time expression control and rendering. Some examples are shown in Fig. 1. The core challenge lies in faithfully reconstructing 3D Gaussians from a single image, as a 3D Gaussian typically requires multi-view input and millions of Gaussian points for detailed reconstruction. To address this, we propose a novel dual-lifting method that reconstructs the 3D Gaussians from one image. Specifically, instead of directly estimating Gaussian points from the image, we predict the lifting distances of each pixel relative to the image plane, and then map the image plane and lifted points back to 3D space based on the camera position. By predicting forward and backward lifting distances, we can form an almost closed Gaussian points distribution and reconstruct the head as completely as possible. This approach leverages the fine-grained features of the input image and significantly reduces the difficulty of predicting 3D Gaussian positions. We also utilize priors from 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) [Li et al., 2017] to further constrain the lifting distance, helping the model obtain correct 3D lifting and capture details from the source image. We then bind learnable features to the 3DMM vertices and construct expression Gaussians using image global features, 3DMM learnable features, and 3DMM point positions to ensure expression control capability. Finally, we use a neural renderer to refine the splatting-rendered results, producing the final reenacted image. Our model is learned from a large number of monocular portrait images and can be generalized to unseen identities after training.

A popular strategy of early works is inserting the expression and head pose features of the driving image into the 2D generative network to achieve realistic and animatable image generation. For example, these methods [Zakharov et al., 2019, Burkov et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2023] inject latent representations of expression into the U-Net backbone or StyleGAN-like [Karras et al., 2019] generators to transfer driving expressions to reenacted images.

Since neural radiance fields (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al., 2020] have demonstrated excellent results, many recent methods [Li et al., 2023b,a, Ma et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2023, Chu et al., 2024, Ye et al., 2024, Deng et al., 2024b,a, Park et al., 2021a, Zheng et al., 2023, Bai et al., 2023a, Ki et al., 2024] have adopted NeRF for head reconstruction.

There are also methods [Hong et al., 2022b, Zhuang et al., 2022b, Ma et al., 2023] to perform test-time optimization on the source image to obtain reconstructions, but the need for test-time optimization limits their applicability.

For example, GOHA [Li et al., 2023a] learns three tri-plane features to capture details. HideNeRF [Li et al., 2023b] utilizes multi-resolution tri-planes and a deformation field to generate reenactment images. GPAvatar [Chu et al., 2024] uses a point-based expression field and a multi tri-plane attention module to reconstruct head avatars. Real3DPortrait [Ye et al., 2024] generates a tri-plane from images and adds motion adapters to get reenactment images. CVTHead [Ma et al., 2024a] reconstructs head avatars using point-based neural rendering and a vertex-feature transformer.
