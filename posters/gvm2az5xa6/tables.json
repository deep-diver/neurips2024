The metrics used for evaluation include PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS (for self-reenactment), and CSIM, AED, APD (for cross-reenactment).  Higher PSNR and SSIM values indicate better image quality, while lower LPIPS and AED values indicate better perceptual similarity and expression accuracy respectively.  The table highlights the superior performance of GAGAvatar across various metrics.", "section": "4.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "gVM2AZ5xA6/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative results on the VFHQ [Xie et al., 2022] dataset.
