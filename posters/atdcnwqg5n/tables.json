The first row contains the results obtained without relativizing to a background logic and the second row contains results relative to MSO. Here x = y means that x and y have the same expressive power while x < y means that y is strictly more expressive than x. Further, \"bnd.\" stands for \u201cbounded\u201d and \u201cAC\u201d for \u201caggregate-combine\u201d.", "description": "This table summarizes the main findings of the paper, comparing the expressive power of different recurrent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with reals and floats, along with their corresponding logical characterizations.  The comparison is shown both absolutely and relative to Monadic Second-Order Logic (MSO).  Abbreviations are provided for clarity.", "section": "Related Work"}]
