It includes notations for generic sequential decision-making problems, POSTs/POSGs, generalized PSRs, and general mathematical notations.  The notations cover variable spaces, sets of observations and actions, histories and futures, probability distributions, dynamics matrices, policies, and various quantities related to the predictive state representation.", "section": "A Summary of Notation"}, {"figure_path": "QgMC8ftbNd/tables/tables_15_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: DAG representation of various information structures. Solid edges indicate the edges in E\u2020 and light edges indicate the information sets of action variables. Grey nodes represent unobservable variables, blue nodes represent past observable variables, green nodes represent future observable variables, and red nodes represent the information structural state I. To find I, as per Theorem 1, we first remove the incoming edges into the action variables, then we find the minimal set among all past variables (both observable and unobservable) which d-separates the past observations from the future observations.", "description": "This figure shows five different DAG representations of information structures in sequential decision-making problems, including Decentralized POMDP/POMG, Mean-field, Point-to-point real-time communication with feedback, Limited-memory (m=2), and Fully connected structures. Each DAG illustrates the causal dependencies between variables, explicitly showing information sets of action variables and the d-separation between past and future observations to determine the information-structural state. This visualization aids in understanding how the complexity of the dynamics of a sequential decision-making problem is characterized by its information structure.", "section": "3 Information Structure"}]
