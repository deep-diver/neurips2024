Therefore, AS is more essential than AC. AS can be viewed as binary semantic segmentation assuming that pixel-level annotated images are available. Unfortunately, it is usually difficult to collect anomaly images due to their scarcity in practical applications, and pixel-level annotations also involve labor costs. Based on available training images, e.g., only normal, normal with noise, few-shot normal or anomaly, and multi-class normal, have led to different types of AS tasks, such as unsupervised [47, 31, 72, 12, 37, 29], fully-unsupervised [9, 27, 38], fewshot [24, 14, 66, 69, 15], and unified AS [70, 17], etc. These methods achieve excellent performance on seen objects but often perform poorly on unseen objects.

Further, AnomalyCLIP [76] learns general prompt embedding through developing specialized modules but requiring fine-tuning on an auxiliary domain dataset with pixel-level annotations. In addition to being flexible, these vision-language-based methods are still weak in anomaly segmentation. Accurate anomaly segmentation is crucial in real-world applications, such as industrial inspection, as anomalies often relate to the area, shape, and location where they occur. On the other hand, we know that visual representations are not dependent on language in the animal world [16]. In particular, the principles of visual perception in non-human primates are very similar to humans [58]. Although there is room for universal AS based on visual-language models and worthwhile further to pursue, in this paper, we want to explore how far we can go with a pure visual model without any guidance from language.

Generally, humans can perceive anomalies when an input significantly deviates from those normal patterns stored in our brains. There is evidence to support this point in neuroscience. For example, predictive coding theory [43] postulates that the brain constantly generates and updates a \u201cmental model\u201d. The mental model compares its expectations (or predictions) with the actual inputs from the visual cortex. This process allows the brain to perceive anomalies. In fact, PatchCore [47] captures normal local patch features, stores them in a memory bank, and recognizes anomalies by comparing input features with the memory bank. In addition, some distribution-based methods [12] learn a multivariate Gaussian distribution from normal local features and then utilize a distance metric to measure anomalies. However, these memory- and distribution-based methods usually require a certain number of normal images and thus are limited in universal (i.e., open-world) scenarios.

Then, the actual input could be any query images from the same class of the normal prompt. Last but not least, how to construct a \u201cmental model\u201d to compare between a given normal image prompt and any query images. Despite these challenges, we can imagine that the \u201cmental model\u201d should satisfy several basic principles. First, it should have a strong generalization ability to perceive anomalies facing unseen objects or textures. Second, it can perform pixel-level anomaly segmentation only given one normal image prompt. Third, its training does not depend on target domain distribution or any guidance from language.

We assume these synthesized image pairs carry mask annotations indicating change regions. Inspired by the \u201cmental model\u201d in predictive coding theory [43], we propose a simple but effective framework that learns the \u201cmetal model\u201d in a one-prompt meta-learning manner.

In contrast, the unified models attempt to detect anomalies for all categories using a single model. Compared to the separated mode, the unified paradigm is more challenging as it requires handling more complex data distributions. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "From a modeling perspective, AS methods can be roughly grouped into three groups, embedding, discriminator, and reconstruction. Embedding-based methods, such as PaDiM [12], MDND [44], PatchCore [47], CS-Flow [49] and PyramidFlow [29], assume that offline features extracted from a pre-trained model preserve discriminative information and thus help to separate anomalies from normal samples. They usually model normal features to a normal distribution or store them in a memory bank. Then, anomaly scores are calculated by comparing testing features and the modeled distribution or the memory bank. Discriminator-based methods, such as CutPaste [31], DRAEM [72], [10], and SimpleNet [37], typically convert unsupervised AS to supervised ones by introducing pseudo (synthesized) anomaly samples. The pseudo-anomaly samples are generated by pasting random patches or adding Gaussian noise to normal images or features. Naturally, a binary anomaly classifier or segmentation model can be trained on normal and pseudo-anomaly samples in a supervised manner. Reconstruction-based AS, such as autoencoder [59, 2, 20, 23], generative adversarial networks [41, 67, 71] and reconstruction networks [73, 45, 36], assume that anomalous regions should not be able to be properly reconstructed and thus result in high reconstruction errors since they do not exist in normal training samples. These methods tend to be computationally expensive because they involve reconstruction in image space. The recent knowledge distillation [5, 62, 61, 52, 13] or feature reconstruction methods [70, 75, 68] train a student or reconstruction network to match a fixed pre-trained teacher network and achieve a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

RegAD [24] learns the category-agnostic feature registration, enabling the model to detect anomalies in new categories given a few normal images without fine-tuning. GraphCore [66] utilizes graph representation and provides a visual isometric invariant feature. FastRecon [15] utilizes a few normal samples as a reference to reconstruct a normal version for a query sample with distribution regularization, where the final anomaly detection can be achieved by sample alignment. Some works [14, 69] consider another few-shot setting where a limited number of samples is given from the anomalous classes. Instead of learning few-shot models with a few normal or anomaly images, we push it to a new extreme only using one normal image as a visual prompt at the inference stage, not involving model training.

AnomalyCLIP [76] learns object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. InCtrl [77] detects residual CLIP visual features between test images and in-context few-shot normal samples. However, optimizing AnomalyCLIP [76] and InCtrl [77] requires an auxiliary domain dataset including normal and anomaly images. PromptAD [32] introduces the concept of explicit anomaly margin, which mitigates the training challenge caused by the absence of anomaly images. Furthermore, AnomalyGPT [21] incorporates a visual-language model and a large language model applying multiturn dialogues. It not only indicates the presence and location of the anomaly but also provides a detailed description of anomalies. Instead of visual-language models, ACR [30] and MuSc [33] perform zero-shot AS only requiring information from batch- and full-level testing images, but they may be limited in privacy protection scenarios. Overall, existing most methods primarily use textual prompts based on visual-language models to identify anomalies.

Change segmentation aims to identify changes that occur on a pair of images captured at different times. Therefore, anomaly segmentation will be absorbed into change segmentation if we regard normal prompt and query as a pair of images captured at different times. Indeed, one can imagine that if a model is capable of perceiving changes, it would naturally generalize to anomaly segmentation. This simple transformation allows us to achieve universal AS with visual modality alone.

First, MetaUAS with one normal image prompt achieves competitive performance among all zero-, few- and full-shot methods both on MVTec and VisA. This suggests that it is possible to boost anomaly classification and segmentation performance only with visual information alone. But on Goods dataset, MetaUAS seems to perform similarly to other methods. Different from MVTec and VisA, Goods consists of six groups and each group contains dozens or even hundreds of subcategories (484 in total). In fact, it is challenging to address multi-classes with a single model, and the state-of-the-art UniAD is not good even using all normal training images. In contrast, MetaUAS only uses one normal image prompt for each group, which means that the prompt image does not match most query images from multiple subcategories. Furthermore, MetaUAS\u22c6significantly outperforms almost all competing models when the best-matched normal image is used to take as the normal prompt of each query image.

The Concat operation is the best one. The Add is not suitable to fuse two types of features as it fails to depict the image changes, and it may lead to confusion between these two features, as its results are the worst.

First, we rethink anomaly segmentation tasks and find they can be unified into change segmentation. This paradigm shift allows us to break away from the persistent challenge of lacking large-scale anomaly segmentation datasets. Naturally, we are capable of leveraging large-scale synthetic image pairs with object-level and local region changes derived from available image datasets. Second, we propose a simple but effective universal anomaly segmentation framework, i.e., MetaUAS. We train MetaUAS in a one-prompt meta-learning manner on this synthesized dataset. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change segmentation and singe-image semantic segmentation. This makes it possible to use sophisticated semantic segmentation modules for change segmentation. MetaUAS achieves a superior generalization using only one normal image prompt on three industrial datasets. Meanwhile, MetaUAS enjoys faster inference speed and fewer parameters. We believe MetaUAS will serve as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal anomaly segmentation. Limitation. The performance of MetaUAS can be affected by using inappropriate normal image prompts. In this study, we leverage cosine similarity to identify the most suitable prompts when the category of the query image is unknown. In scenarios involving fine-grained objects, it may be essential to train a classification model to accurately predict the categories of the query images.
