This paper introduces Self-Guiding Exploration (SGE), a novel prompting strategy that significantly boosts LLM performance on CPs.", "takeaways": ["Self-Guiding Exploration (SGE) significantly enhances LLM performance on combinatorial problems.", "SGE outperforms existing prompting strategies by a substantial margin.", "The method's effectiveness extends beyond combinatorial problems, showing promise in other reasoning tasks."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for reasoning, but their application to complex combinatorial problems (CPs) remains limited. Existing prompting techniques often fall short when dealing with the inherent complexity and NP-hard nature of these problems.  This leads to inadequate solutions, especially for larger problem instances.  This necessitates the development of more robust and effective prompting strategies to fully utilize LLMs' potential in solving CPs.\nThis research introduces a novel prompting strategy called Self-Guiding Exploration (SGE) to improve the performance of LLMs on CPs.  SGE autonomously generates multiple solution trajectories, breaks them down into subtasks, executes them sequentially, and refines results for optimal outcomes. It significantly outperforms existing strategies, showcasing its effectiveness across diverse CPs and achieving higher accuracy than the best-existing results in other reasoning tasks. This demonstrates the potential of SGE as a versatile metaheuristic for tackling combinatorial challenges, highlighting its applicability and effectiveness across various domains.", "affiliation": "MBZUAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "BGOGknwHbi/podcast.wav"}
