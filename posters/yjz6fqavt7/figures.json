(a) shows a fully connected graph where every pair of latent variables is directly correlated. This approach is highly expressive but computationally expensive. (b) presents TreeVI, which uses a single tree structure to capture correlations. The correlations between non-adjacent nodes are calculated by multiplying the correlations along the path connecting them. This approach reduces computational cost while still capturing high-order correlations. (c) extends this to MTreeVI, a mixture-of-trees model, which further improves the accuracy by allowing more complex correlation structures.", "section": "2 Tree-structured Variational Inference"}, {"figure_path": "YjZ6fQAvT7/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: T-SNE visualization of MNIST samples in the embedded space and the learnt tree structure of our proposed TreeVI. 100 samples are randomly selected to plot their instance-level tree structure (colored in black).", "description": "This figure shows a t-SNE visualization of MNIST samples in a two-dimensional embedding space generated by TreeVI.  The points are colored according to their class labels.  A subset of 100 samples is selected to highlight the learned tree structure connecting the samples, with edges representing correlations between instances as captured by TreeVI. The black nodes are the randomly selected samples, and the connections between them represent the learned tree structure.  This visualization demonstrates TreeVI's ability to capture instance-level correlations, grouping samples of the same class more closely together in the embedding space and reflecting this relationship in the tree structure.", "section": "4.2 Constrained Clustering"}]
