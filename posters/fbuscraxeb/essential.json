{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in data security and machine learning.  It **directly addresses the vulnerability of contrastive learning models to availability attacks**, a significant gap in current research. By introducing novel attack methods, it **motivates further research in developing robust defenses** against these attacks, directly contributing to safer and more secure machine learning practices.  Its efficient methods offer practical implications for real-world data protection scenarios, which significantly enhances its relevance.", "summary": "New attacks foil both supervised and contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art unlearnability with less computation.", "takeaways": ["Existing availability attacks are ineffective against both supervised and contrastive learning.", "The proposed AUE and AAP attacks achieve state-of-the-art worst-case unlearnability across supervised and contrastive learning algorithms.", "AUE and AAP attacks are more efficient than existing methods."], "tldr": "Availability attacks aim to make trained models unusable by poisoning training data.  While effective against supervised learning, existing attacks often fail against contrastive learning (CL), which is increasingly popular due to its ability to learn from unlabeled data. This creates a significant vulnerability, as attackers could bypass existing defenses by using CL after supervised learning fails. This research paper highlights the limitation of existing attacks and emphasizes the need for more robust data protection methods that can withstand both SL and CL approaches.\nThis work proposes two new availability attacks: Augmented Unlearnable Examples (AUE) and Augmented Adversarial Poisoning (AAP).  These attacks leverage a novel technique of employing contrastive-like data augmentations within supervised learning frameworks to simultaneously achieve unlearnability against both SL and CL.  The authors demonstrate that their methods outperform state-of-the-art attacks in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, providing superior worst-case unlearnability across various algorithms and datasets.  The results showcase a promising approach to improving the security of machine learning models, especially in scenarios where sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized use.", "affiliation": "Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "FbUSCraXEB/podcast.wav"}
