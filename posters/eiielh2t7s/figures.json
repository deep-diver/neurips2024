We show the last dimension as it is the lowest frequency part of ROPE, which suffers OOD mostly in extrapolation. (a) For a 4k context-length model with base value as 1e4, when we extend the context length to 32k without changing the base value, the context length from 4k to 32k is OOD for RoPE (red area in the figure). (b) OOD can be avoided with a small base value like 500 [15], since the full period has been fitted during fine-tuning stage. (c) We set base as b. s2 from NTK [11].The blue line denotes the pre-training stage (base=1e4) and the red dashed line denotes the fine-tuning stage (base=b \u00b7 sa\u22122), we can observe that the RoPE's rotation angle of extended positions is in-distribution.", "description": "This figure illustrates the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) when extending context length and proposes two solutions.  The leftmost panel shows the OOD region when using a standard base value (1e4) for a 4k context model extended to 32k. The middle panel shows that using a much smaller base (500) avoids the OOD problem.
