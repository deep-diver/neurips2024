The results are presented for three different set sizes (k = 2<sup>12</sup>, 2<sup>16</sup>, 2<sup>20</sup>) and demonstrate DPSet's superior utility across all metrics, particularly in terms of significantly lower error probability than competing methods.", "section": "5 Experimental evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "GQNvvQquO0/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparisons of of DPSet, ALP, and DP Count Sketch with \u03b4 < 2\u207b\u2074\u2070.

It shows three sets of graphs: one for error probability, one for encoding time, and one for decoding time.  Each set of graphs is broken down by the size of the input set (k = 2\u00b9\u00b2, 2\u00b9\u2076, 2\u00b2\u2070). The x-axis represents the privacy parameter \u03b5, which controls the privacy-utility trade-off, and the y-axis shows either the error probability, encoding time in milliseconds, or decoding time in milliseconds. The figure demonstrates that DPSet generally achieves lower error probability and comparable or faster encoding/decoding times compared to ALP and DP Count Sketch, especially as the input set size grows.", "section": "5 Experimental evaluation"}]
