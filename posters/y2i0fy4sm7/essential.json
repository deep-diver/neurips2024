Traditional approaches struggle to efficiently handle the massive tensor sizes involved in training and inference, leading to performance bottlenecks due to excessive data movement between accelerators and slower memory. This is further exacerbated by the high cost of inter-node and inter-device communication. \nSpeedLoader tackles these challenges head-on by implementing a novel data flow and intelligent scheduling strategies. **By strategically offloading and prefetching activations,** it minimizes redundant I/O operations and maximizes hardware utilization. This approach significantly enhances training and inference speed across various hardware configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant speed improvements compared to existing methods, showcasing SpeedLoader's effectiveness in both single-device and distributed settings.  The project also provides an efficient tensor management system to further reduce overhead.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Y2I0Fy4sm7/podcast.wav"}
