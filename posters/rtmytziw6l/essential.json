Recently, machine learning has been applied to solve ILPs, but a key challenge arises from the symmetry found in many ILPs: multiple equivalent optimal solutions exist. Randomly selecting one optimal solution as training data introduces variability, hindering effective model training. \nThis paper introduces SymILO, a novel framework that directly addresses this symmetry issue.  It incorporates solution permutations as learnable parameters, jointly optimized with neural network weights.  Using an alternating algorithm, SymILO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an average improvement of over 50% in solving accuracy across various ILPs.", "affiliation": "Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "RtMyTzIW6l/podcast.wav"}
