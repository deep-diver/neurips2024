The graphs plot the trade-off between accuracy and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD), a measure of fairness where lower values indicate better fairness. For the UCI Adult dataset (Figure 3a), we observe that the FairBiNN method consistently outperforms the Lagrangian approach. The FairBiNN curve is closer to the top-left corner, indicating that it achieves higher accuracy for any given level of fairness (SPD). The difference is particularly pronounced at lower SPD values, suggesting that FairBiNN is more effective at maintaining accuracy while enforcing stricter fairness constraints. The Heritage Health dataset results (Figure 3b) show a similar trend, but with a more dramatic difference between the two methods. The FairBiNN curve dominates the Lagrangian curve across the entire range of SPD values. This indicates that FairBiNN achieves substantially higher accuracy for any given fairness level, or equivalently, much better fairness for any given accuracy level. In both datasets, the FairBiNN method demonstrates a smoother, more consistent trade-off between accuracy and fairness. The Lagrangian method, in contrast, shows more erratic behavior, particularly in the Heritage Health dataset where its performance degrades rapidly as fairness constraints tighten.", "section": "4.3 Bilevel (FairBiNN) vs. Lagrangian Method"}, {"figure_path": "e2R4WNHHGQ/figures/figures_27_6.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Accuracy of various benchmark models compared to the FairBiNN model versus statistical demographic parity for the (a) UCI Adult dataset and (b) Heritage Health dataset.
