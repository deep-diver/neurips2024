Existing methods struggle with high-frequency signals and lack the ability to perform localized operations, hindering their flexibility.  Furthermore, parallelization capabilities remain underdeveloped, impacting computation time.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces Neural Experts, a novel MoE-based INR architecture. This framework subdivides the input domain, allowing for localized fitting of piecewise continuous functions.  The method incorporates a manager network that dynamically routes inputs to the most appropriate expert network, and innovative pretraining and conditioning techniques further optimize the model's performance and address local minima issues.  Extensive evaluation across image, audio, and 3D reconstruction tasks demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to standard INRs and other MoE variants.", "affiliation": "Roblox", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "wWguwYhpAY/podcast.wav"}
