Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods, while offering photorealistic results, are computationally expensive and lack scene-editing flexibility.  This research tackles these issues. \n\nThe proposed Event-3DGS framework utilizes 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for event-based 3D reconstruction.  It directly processes event data, optimizing scene and sensor parameters simultaneously.  A key innovation is a high-pass filter to reduce noise in event data, improving robustness.  The method demonstrates superior performance and robustness in various challenging scenarios compared to existing techniques.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "EJZfcKXdiT/podcast.wav"}
