Demystifying the internal mechanisms of LLMs becomes increasingly vital, particularly in applications emphasizing fairness, trust, and ethical decision-making [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]. In recent years, many works have focused on explaining pre-trained transformers. For instance, [32] regards the FFN as unnormalized Key-Value Memories; [56] presents a conceptual framework where all parameters are interpreted by projecting them into the embedding space; [9] analyzes the FFN updates in the vocabulary space, showing that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates; [17] studies how the model aggregates information about the subject and relation to predict the correct attribute; while [11] localizes the weights and mechanisms used by a language model to memorize and recite entire paragraphs of its training data.

Neuron attribution aims to reveal the black box of pre-trained transformers by answering the following questions [7, 57, 6]: (1) What concepts are learned within neurons of the network? (2) Are there neurons that specialize in learning particular concepts? (3) How localized/distributed and redundantly is the knowledge preserved within neurons of the network? To achieve these goals, many recent works have focused on exploring the properties of neurons in LLMs. Specifically, [16] present preliminary studies on how factual knowledge is stored in LLMs by introducing the concept of knowledge neurons; [5] finds the special neurons whose activations on soft prompts are highly predictive of the task labels of inputs, and dub them skill neurons.

Additionally, despite the aforementioned methods are all based on activation and gradients to identify target neurons, some recent works focused on knowledge editing have discovered an alternative approach [15, 13].

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
