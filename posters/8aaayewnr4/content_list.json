Conventional verification only in pure natural language processing benchmarks can be insufficient. Since emotions often influence human decisions, this paper examines LLM alignment in complex strategic and ethical environments, providing an in-depth analysis of the drawbacks of our psychology and the emotional impact on decision-making in humans and LLMs. We introduce the novel EAI framework for integrating emotion modeling into LLMs to examine the emotional impact on ethics and LLM-based decision-making in various strategic games, including bargaining and repeated games. Our experimental study with various LLMs demonstrated that emotions can significantly alter the ethical decision-making landscape of LLMs, highlighting the need for robust mechanisms to ensure consistent ethical standards. Our game-theoretic analysis revealed that LLMs are susceptible to emotional biases influenced by model size, alignment strategies, and primary pretraining language. Notably, these biases often diverge from typical human emotional responses, occasionally leading to unexpected drops in cooperation rates, even under positive emotional influence. Such behavior complicates the alignment of multiagent systems, emphasizing the need for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the degree of emotional alignment.

LLMs\u2019 alignment with human values is essential not only for improving user satisfaction and trust but also for ensuring the safety and predictability of LLMs in real-world decision-making.

For example, human decisions are significantly influenced by emotions and are often irrational [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This irrationality is also well observed in unaligned LLMs exhibiting signs of aggression [10] producing falsehoods. It is worth noting that even aligned LLMs may intentionally deceive under specific circumstances [11, 12] or when influenced by jailbreaks [13]. These observations raise questions about the capacity of LLMs to mirror human emotions and how these emotions might influence their decision-making. Accurate emotion modeling in agentic environments is essential for various applications, starting with correct simulations in behavioral economics and recommender systems and ending with predictable and safe human-agent interactions. The first part of the raised question is partially addressed in [14, 15, 16].

We evaluate the quality of emotional reactions by comparing LLM behavior with humans in ethical benchmarks and game-theoretical experiments. Our findings reveal that emotions significantly alter the decision-making processes of LLMs across various alignment strategies. We highlight three main influencing factors: model size, open-source versus proprietary status with corresponding alignment technique, and the primary pretraining language of the model. These factors collectively shape the model\u2019s rationality, alignment with human emotional responses, and decision-making optimality. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "The first two factors are deeply intertwined. Our analysis shows that larger models with stronger alignment, like GPT-4, tend to display a high degree of rationality and deviate significantly from human emotional responses. Smaller proprietary models, such as GPT-3.5 and Claude-Haiku, along with mid-sized open-source models like LLAMA-70b, exhibit emergent emotional understanding and align more closely with human-like behavior. Among these, GPT-3.5 notably produces responses that are most consistent with human responses. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Further analysis demonstrates that while proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude Opus outperform open-source alternatives in decision-making optimality, they still show notable deviations under negative emotions. Such deviations are likely rooted in inherent biases present in human-generated pretraining data [71, 72]. Researchers have attempted to cleanse datasets of potentially harmful content and align models using various techniques. However, these efforts appear insufficient to create entirely rational agents, likely due to the prevalence of emotionally charged dialogues in the training data. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "The third factor, the primary language used for pretraining, is also a key influence in achieving human-aligned emotional responses. We observed a significant drop in alignment when switching from English to other languages. Even the intentionally balanced multilingual LLM \u2019Command $\\mathbf{R}+\\mathbf{\\dot{\\Phi}}$ \u2019 exhibited less accurate emotional understanding than GigaChat, which was specifically designed for a single non-English language, highlighting a language bias in emotional comprehension. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Thus, emotional prompting in LLMs exposes ethical risks by revealing significant biases in human alignment. It is crucial to develop models with reasonable emotional alignment, and the controlled settings provided in our framework can serve as the basis for new benchmarks in this task.

We aim to evaluate our framework with multi-agent LLMs arena and LLM vs. Humans experiments to study in detail to what extent emotions may be internally responsible for controlling generation in aligned auto-regressive LLMs. However, it is important to emphasize that if we observe significant biases for all LLMs in current scenarios, we must mitigate this alignment problem before scaling up our benchmarks. In addition, the release of GPT-4o and RLEF methods by Hume.ai poses new research for analyzing end-to-end multi-modal architectures aligned with emotional data.
