This is attributed to two main factors: limitations in SDF-to-density representation and issues with geometric regularization. These issues hinder the optimization of the SDF field, resulting in suboptimal surface quality. \nNeuRodin tackles these challenges with a two-stage approach. The first stage uses a coarse optimization process similar to density-based methods to handle topological changes effectively, while the second stage refines the reconstruction to produce smooth surfaces. This innovative framework incorporates local adaptive parameters for SDF-to-density conversion and a novel loss function to improve the alignment between volume rendering and implicit surface representations.  Extensive evaluations demonstrate its superiority, particularly for scenes with intricate details.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "hVGAGU4TKk/podcast.wav"}
