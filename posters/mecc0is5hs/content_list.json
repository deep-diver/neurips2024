This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance beneftis of existing pre-trained stateof-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and superresolution.

Such models are usually trained to maximize fidelity metrics like PSNR or SSIM, but the visual quality of the resulting images is sub-optimal [6].

In particular, inference of such models involves a sampling process that requires a large number (in the order of hundreds) of neural function evaluations (NFEs), which can be computationally very expensive, especially when considering images of high resolution. Another important limitation is that an efficient conditioning on the image measurements has yet to be proposed for DPMs in order to make them applicable to a wider range of blind IR problems. Indeed, all of the existing methods aim to learn the parameters of a single input-conditioned network for a specific blind IR task. As a result, the trained model overftis on the distribution of the condition space, and the whole model has to be retrained if we need to employ it to a different reconstruction task than the one that was initially trained for.

At the second stage we train our Fusion Modules with $n_{f}=64$ for each IR task and the corresponding pre-trained off-the-shelf IR network. It is worth noting, that at this stage the parameters of Denoising and IR modules are kept frozen and only the Fusion Module is trained.

One of the main benefits of our framework is its ability to capitalize on the performance of existing restoration networks at a relatively low additional computational cost.

UDP is trained with the same settings as MIRNet-S and the fusion module is retrained for each of the three cases. From Table 4, we observe that the same IR network combined with a better denoising module, leads to better fidelity (see PSNR, SSIM). A same trend, but for perceptual metrics is observed if one upgrades the IR module from RRDB to the SwinIR and keeps the same denoising module. This clearly indicates that one can achieve better results by employing either a more powerful denoiser or IR module, without the need to fully retrain the entire score estimator as is the common practice followed in most of the existing methods (e.g. LDM, SRDiff, DvSR, etc. ).

In contrast, L-DWT directly learns weights for each scale and channel of a 3-level Haar DWT [24]. L-DWT has only 30 trainable parameters, which needs significantly less training time and data.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
