In this method, each entity and relation in a knowledge graph is mapped to a unique embedding vector. As the number of entities (N) grows, the complexity and memory requirements increase linearly. This is because the embedding matrix becomes larger, which makes the method computationally expensive and unsuitable for large-scale knowledge graphs. The figure highlights the trade-off between the number of entities in the knowledge graph and the complexity of the model, which motivates the need for more efficient embedding methods.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "BpJ6OTfWw3/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The illustration of our model, which is an anchor-based KGE model, termed RecPiece, by introducing a more explainable and scalable relational clustering-based anchor selection strategy. Note that different factual triplets are coloured in different colours according to relation types, i.e., blue for r\u2081, orange for r2, and green for r3. p(\u00b7) and f(\u00b7) are two encoders for feature preparation and propagation, respectively. Besides, g(\u00b7) is the adopted clustering algorithm with the cluster number set as the number of relation type |R|, and anchor set construction contains two steps \u03c6a(\u00b7) and \u03c6b(\u00b7). Note that the detailed description of the above modules is illustrated in Section 3 and the notations are summarized in Tab. 1.", "description": "This figure illustrates the RecPiece model, which uses a relational clustering-based anchor selection strategy. It shows the five main steps: feature preparation using encoder p(.), clustering the features of factual triplets using algorithm g(.) into |R| clusters (where |R| is the number of relation types), candidate triplet selection \u03c6a(.), triplet-entity mapping \u03c6b(.), and feature propagation using encoder f(.).
