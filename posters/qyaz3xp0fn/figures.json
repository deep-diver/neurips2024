In contrast, parametric model reduction with score-based diffusion denoising and flow-based modeling requires conditioning on time t, which leads to separate, costly inference steps for each time step of a sample trajectory.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of the proposed HOAM method and compares it with other state-of-the-art methods for parametric model reduction. HOAM learns vector fields that represent the evolution of population dynamics over time, unlike score-based and flow-based models that condition on each time step, leading to more efficient inference. The figure visually depicts this difference by showcasing how HOAM directly predicts entire trajectories, whereas score-based and flow-based models require separate inference steps for each point in time.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "qyaz3XP0FN/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Left: During training the high-variance function q(s)(t) needs to be numerically integrated for estimating the loss.
