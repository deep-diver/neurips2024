The comparison is based on compression ratio, size, Chamfer distance (CD), Normal Consistency (NC), F1-score at thresholds of 0.005 and 0.01. Lower CD indicates better reconstruction accuracy, while higher NC and F1-scores represent better surface reconstruction. The table aims to demonstrate the advantages of TSDF-Def over TSDF.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}, {"figure_path": "lizRmKCnBp/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative comparisons of different resolutions of TSDF-Def volumes.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of using different resolutions (64, 128, and 256) for TSDF-Def volumes in the NeCGS model.  It shows the resulting compressed file size (in MB), compression ratio, Chamfer Distance (CD), Normal Consistency (NC), F-Score (at thresholds 0.005 and 0.01), optimization time (in hours), and inference time (in milliseconds).  The results demonstrate the trade-off between compression effectiveness and computational cost at various resolutions.", "section": "4.3 Ablation Study"}]
