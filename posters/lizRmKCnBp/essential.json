This necessitates efficient and accurate methods capable of handling diverse datasets containing hundreds or thousands of models.  The sheer size and complexity of such datasets make efficient storage and transmission extremely challenging.\nNeCGS tackles this challenge head-on with a two-stage approach.  First, it converts irregular mesh models into regular 4D TSDF-Def volumes.  Then, it uses a quantization-aware auto-decoder network to compress these volumes, exploiting redundancy across models.  This innovative approach achieves a compression ratio of nearly 900 times on some datasets while maintaining high geometric fidelity, significantly exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "lizRmKCnBp/podcast.wav"}
