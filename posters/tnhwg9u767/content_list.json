As a result, being able to accurately recall and encode a graph described in earlier text is a basic yet pivotal ability that large language models (LLMs) need to demonstrate if they are to perform reasoning tasks that involve graph-structured information. Human performance at graph recall by has been studied by cognitive scientists for decades, and has been found to often exhibit certain structural patterns of bias that align with human handling of social relationships. To date, however, we know little about how LLMs behave in analogous graph recall tasks: do their recalled graphs also exhibit certain biased patterns, and if so, how do they compare with humans and affect other graph reasoning tasks? In this work, we perform the first systematical study of graph recall by LLMs, investigating the accuracy and biased microstructures (local subgraph patterns) in their recall. We find that LLMs not only underperform often in graph recall, but also tend to favor more triangles and alternating 2-paths. Moreover, we find that more advanced LLMs have a striking dependence on the domain that a real-world graph comes from \u2014 by yielding the best recall accuracy when the graph is narrated in a language style consistent with its original domain.

In fact, graph-structured information is ubiquitous across many language-based applications, such as structured commonsense reasoning [32], multi-agent communications [3], multi-hop question answering [15], and more. LLMs\u2019 graph reasoning ability has thus become an active research topic.

Thus, our key starting observation here is that all of these tasks rely on a pivotal (and perhaps seemingly trivial) ability of LLMs \u2013 to recall and encode a set of relations described in earlier text. In this paper, we consider a graph recall task which has been extensively studied in cognitive science [8, 44, 7, 9, 41], and which formalizes this basic goal, illustrated in Figure 1: a set of pairwise relationships is described in a simple narrative form to the experimental subject (human or LLM); then at a later point in the experiment, the subject is asked to recall and describe these relationships explicitly in the form of a graph.

Therefore, we consider it important to investigate LLMs\u2019 graph recall ability, a topic absent from existing literature.

Cognitive scientists have found through substantial human experiments that, when memorizing a social network, humans extensively employ certain compression heuristics, such as triadic closure, near-clique completion, and certain degree biases [8, 35], due to natural limits on cognitive capacity. Further studies show that a person\u2019s ability to accurately recall a social network, along with the microstructures (local subgraph patterns, or network motifs [2, 34]) in their recalled network, not only has profound influence on their social decisions [25, 11, 52], but also varies on different styles of graph narrative [44], and the sex of the person [7, 22]. Do LLMs use similar compression heuristics as humans, and how are they affected by different working contexts?

Since advanced LLMs yield unsatisfactory performance in this test, we need to re-examine the recent development of approaches that attempt to directly solve more challenging graph reasoning tasks. Meanwhile, notice the association between graph recall test and the \u201cNeedle in a Haystack\u201d test (i.e. random fact retrieval from long context) [26, 19]: in some sense, the former can viewed as a \u201cgraph-customized\u201d version of the latter. Therefore, existing techniques for boosting LLM\u2019s performance in the \u201cNeedle in a Haystack\u201d test, e.g. recurrent memory augmentations [26], may likely benefit LLM\u2019s graph recall ability as well.   \n\u2022 Our experiment shows that LLMs tend to favor more triangles and alternating 2-paths. Researchers of Graph Foundation Models (GFM) [31, 33, 59, 29] should be alerted of such systematic bias. Because the procedures for training GFMs are largely inspired by those for LLMs, similar retrieval bias could emerge. A potential mitigation strategy worthy of exploration is to consider balancing/compensating the frequencies of different graph motifs that occur in the training data.   \n\u2022 We have also found that more advanced LLM\u2019s performance have a striking dependence on the compatibility between the application domain of a real-world graph and its narrative style. This hints a potential direction for designing more powerful graph encoding for LLMs via certain domain adaptation strategies \u2013 by combining the adaptation strategy with either the graph-to-text methods [18, 20] or the graph-to-embedding methods [12, 37, 13].
