Training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which offer faster inference, is notoriously difficult. This is due to the intractability of their likelihoods and their tendency towards mode-averaging during training. \nThis paper introduces Variational Diffusion Distillation (VDD), a novel method to overcome these challenges. VDD leverages variational inference to distill pre-trained diffusion policies into MoE models. A key innovation is the use of a decompositional upper bound of the variational objective, allowing for efficient, separate training of each expert.  Experiments across nine complex behavior learning tasks demonstrate that VDD accurately distills complex distributions, surpasses existing methods, and sets a new benchmark for MoE training.", "affiliation": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "iiYadgKHwo/podcast.wav"}
