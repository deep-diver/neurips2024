(4)). Since the iteration complexity of several research works (such as Zhao et al. [75], Alacaoglu et al. [3] and Zeng et al. [72]) involve concentrability coefficient and initial distribution mismatch coefficient, we will not delve into them here.", "description": "This table compares several policy optimization methods used to find an approximate Nash Equilibrium in infinite horizon two-player zero-sum Markov games.  The comparison is based on the iteration complexity required to achieve a certain level of approximation (\u03b5-approximate NE) of the solution. The table notes which methods use a single loop iteration process and highlights that the proposed method in this paper has a faster iteration complexity than those previously published.", "section": "1.2 Related Works"}]
