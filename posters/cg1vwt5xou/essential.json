{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in optimal stopping problems and online decision-making.  It **significantly advances our understanding of prophet inequalities**, a classic model often too pessimistic for real-world scenarios, by incorporating the realistic possibility of revisiting past opportunities. The results **offer refined competitive ratio analyses** and **novel algorithms**, opening avenues for improving online selection strategies in various applications.", "summary": "This paper enhances prophet inequalities by allowing lookback, improving competitive ratios and providing algorithms for diverse observation orders, thereby bridging theory and real-world online selection.", "takeaways": ["Lookback significantly improves competitive ratios in prophet inequalities under mild monotonicity assumptions.", "The optimal competitive ratio is determined solely by the decay function parameter \u03b3, in adversarial and random order models.", "Novel algorithms are introduced for the y-prophet inequality, outperforming classical prophet inequalities."], "tldr": "Prophet inequalities model sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but are often too simplistic for real-world applications. They assume irreversible decisions, ignoring possibilities like revisiting past options at a cost. This limitation motivated research into *D-prophet inequalities*, which allow recovering a fraction of a rejected item's value based on how long ago it was observed. This paper examines *D-prophet inequalities* under different observation orders (adversarial, random, IID), using a more general decay function. The classical prophet inequality provides a baseline for comparison.\nThe paper introduces new algorithms and establishes theoretical upper and lower bounds for competitive ratios in *D-prophet inequalities*. It shows that the decay function parameter (\u03b3) significantly impacts the competitive ratio, surpassing the classical 1/2 bound under certain conditions. Results are generalized for random decay functions, further enhancing the applicability of the *D-prophet inequalities* model to real-world scenarios.  The paper provides both theoretical and algorithmic advancements for handling lookback in prophet inequalities, making it a valuable contribution to the optimal stopping and online decision-making literature.
