It demonstrates how the training and sampling processes are combined to provide a full error analysis, highlighting the importance of considering both aspects for optimal model performance. The figure also emphasizes the connections to existing empirical works by Karras et al. and Song et al., showcasing how the theoretical findings complement and extend the existing empirical understanding.

The curve's shape is described as \"bell-shaped,\" indicating that the weighting is highest for intermediate values of \u03c3 and lower for small or large values. This agrees with the theoretical findings in the paper, which suggests that the optimal rate of convergence is obtained when the weighting is similar to this bell-shaped curve.", "section": "4 Theory-based understanding of the design space and its relation to existing empirical counterparts"}]
