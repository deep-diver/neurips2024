This graph is used as an example in the paper's proof of Theorem 4 to demonstrate a reduction from the Hamiltonian Cycle problem to the Optimal Control Discrete Pure (OCDP) problem. The reduction shows that determining whether an optimizer can achieve a certain reward against a best-response learner is computationally hard (NP-hard). The graph's structure is critical to the reduction, showing how the existence of a Hamiltonian Cycle in the graph maps to the optimizer's ability to achieve a high reward in the game.", "section": "C Computational lower bound"}]
