", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Unsupervised RL. In recent years, there are many works that tried to promote the unsupervised representation learning manner in various fields including computer vision (CV) [12, 23, 25] and natural language processing (NLP) [9, 46, 14]. These works encourage the RL community to explore the more efficient way of learning [34, 32, 51, 56, 69, 11, 26], however, these works still need to optimize an extrinsic reward. Recently, there have been works to adopt a pure unsupervised manner (reward-free pre-training followed by reward-specific fine-tuning), which can be categoried into three kinds. (i) Data-based: maximal entropy RL has enabled agent for diverse exploration and data [38, 53, 68]; (ii) Knowledge-based: increase knowledge about the world with self-supervised prediction [44, 45]; (iii) Competence-based: methods based on mutual information [16, 22, 37, 55] shows capability for diverse discovery and generalization. URLB-pixels offers a unified model-based framework to implement some methods referred to above, we make use of this benchmark to serve as the baseline. A shared limitation of existing unsupervised exploration methods lies in their exclusive reliance on state information for exploration, lacking the ability to explicitly extract endogenous information. This inherent limitation renders these methods susceptible to performance degradation when confronted with visually rich environments containing complex distractors.

To tackle this intricate scenario, we introduce SeeX, a bi-level optimization framework that leverages a separated world model and task-relevant uncertainty maximization to mitigate the impact of distractors and enhance exploration efficiency. Furthermore, Our theoretical analysis formalizes URL with distractors: the policy maximizes task-relevant uncertainty to drive exploration, while the world model minimizes environmental uncertainty to reduce distractor influence. SeeX utilizes a separated world representation to disentangle exogenous and endogenous factors from the original observation domain. Policy training is then conducted exclusively on imaginary trajectories generated within the endogenous latent representation. Extensive experiments on the DMC-suite benchmark demonstrate that SeeX outperforms other baseline methods. Ablation studies provide insights into the contributions of individual components to our final performance. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and Future Work.
