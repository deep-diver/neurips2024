It is well known that the approximator thus obtained usually achieves a linear representation, which brings various computational benefits, while maintaining great representation power (i.e., universal approximation). However, when non-negativity constraints are imposed on the function\u2019s outputs, the literature usually takes the kernel method-based approximators as offering linear representations at the expense of limited model flexibility or good representation power by allowing for their nonlinear forms. The main contribution of this paper is to derive a sufficient condition for a positive definite kernel so that it may construct flexible and linear approximators of non-negative functions. We call a kernel function that offers these attributes an inverse M-kernel; it is a generalization of the inverse M-matrix. Furthermore, we show that for a one-dimensional input space, universal exponential/Abel kernels are inverse M-kernels and construct linear universal approximators of non-negative functions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the existence of linear universal approximators of non-negative functions has been elucidated.

Kernel method, one of the most established techniques, learns flexible function approximators by embedding data points into higher dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) [26, 29]. For a broad class of learning problems, kernel methods invoke the representer theorem [27, 35] and recast the infinite-dimensional functional problems as their finite-dimensional counterparts, where the obtained approximators have linear representation, i.e., finite linear combinations of kernel functions evaluated on data points.

However, as discussed in Section 3.1, the discrepancy between NCM and IMK becomes small if $s(N+1)$ for the condition $(K\\!+\\!s(N+1)I)\\alpha\\geqslant0$ is large, and thus $s(N+1)=N-2$ implies that improvements of IMK (11) against NCM (4) should exist but are likely to be marginal for $N\\gtrsim10$ . Because the lower bound $\\eta\\geq N-3$ in the theorem above is not tight, a pressing need is to develop a method to find a smaller value of $\\eta$ satisfying $(K{+}\\eta I)\\in\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}^{-1}$ given kernel $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and input points $(x_{1},\\hdots,x_{N})$ .

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
