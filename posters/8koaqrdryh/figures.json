The left panel shows a point p on a surface, with a tangent vector v and the surface normals at nearby points p and q. The middle panel shows a mapping from the surface to the unit sphere (Gauss map), where each point on the surface is mapped to its corresponding normal vector. The right panel depicts this mapping on the sphere, with the tangent vector v mapped to the vector Sp(v) which represents how the normal vector changes with respect to the tangent vector v at point p.  The length and orientation of Sp(v) provide information about the curvature of the surface at point p.", "section": "3 The Shape Operator"}, {"figure_path": "8koaqRdRYH/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Principal curvature visualisation of a Louis XIV statue.", "description": "This figure shows a 3D model of a Louis XIV statue.
