This necessitates efficient gradient compression methods, especially in distributed learning, to mitigate communication bottlenecks. Lossy compression sacrifices precision, while lossless methods lack effective statistical models for gradients.\nThis research introduces LM-GC, a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors for arithmetic coding.  LM-GC converts gradients into text-like formats, enabling LLMs to estimate probabilities for arithmetic encoding, achieving higher compression rates than state-of-the-art baselines.  Experiments show significant improvements in compression ratios (10% to 17.2%) across various datasets and architectures, highlighting the potential of using LLMs for lossless gradient compression and its compatibility with lossy techniques.", "affiliation": "CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "77kCJzvpOa/podcast.wav"}
