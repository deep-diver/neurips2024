First-order methods (FOMs) are promising but their performance hinges on a crucial parameter: the choice of distance-generating function (DGF).  The paper addresses the challenge of selecting the optimal DGF for FOMs in EFGs, noting previous approaches have relied on indirect analysis using iterate equivalence with existing algorithms. This equivalence prevents fully understanding the optimality of previous solutions and also limits the ability to refine algorithm design to leverage the chosen DGF. \nThis research introduces novel primal-dual treeplex norms to directly analyze the strong convexity of the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) DGF.  **The analysis shows DilEnt achieves a near-optimal diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio**, matching the state-of-the-art performance of existing algorithms (KOMWU) while offering a direct and more insightful analysis. Furthermore, **a new regret lower bound is proven**, confirming the near-optimality of DilEnt.  The paper showcases the new analytic techniques by using them to refine the convergence rate of Clairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing a new state-of-the-art.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "6PMfJT2O7G/podcast.wav"}
