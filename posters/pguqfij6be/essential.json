This is particularly true when dealing with problems involving many nodes and complex objective functions. The challenge lies in finding algorithms that balance communication efficiency with computational cost, especially under different assumptions on data similarity and function properties. \n\nThe paper introduces SVOGS, a novel algorithm designed to overcome these limitations.  SVOGS uses mini-batch client sampling and variance reduction to achieve near-optimal communication complexity, communication rounds, and local gradient calls.  The algorithm's performance is rigorously analyzed, showing that its complexities nearly match theoretical lower bounds, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness, especially under the assumption of second-order similarity among local functions.", "affiliation": "School of Data Science, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "pgUQFIJ6BE/podcast.wav"}
