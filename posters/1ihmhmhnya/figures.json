It comprises two phases: Phase 1 focuses on identifying self-consistent activity patterns from historical trajectories using LLMs and a self-consistency evaluation. Phase 2 leverages these identified patterns and retrieved motivations (using two strategies: evolving-based and learning-based) to generate daily activity trajectories. The framework incorporates elements like action, memory, and planning, and utilizes GPT-3.5 APIs for LLM functionality.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "1iHmhMHNyA/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Evolving-based motivation retrieval.", "description": "This figure illustrates the evolving-based motivation retrieval method used in the LLMob framework.  It shows how the LLM agent infers the motivation for a target day (day d) by considering the activities and motivations from the preceding k days (d-1, d-2,...d-k).  The LLM processes the activities of the previous days to generate a summary of the motivations behind those activities. These summarized motivations are then used as input to predict the motivation for day d.", "section": "3.2 Motivation-Driven Activity Generation"}, {"figure_path": "1iHmhMHNyA/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Daily activity frequency.", "description": "This radar chart compares the daily activity frequencies of different activity categories (Arts & Entertainment, Nightlife Spot, Professional & Other Places, Outdoors & Recreation, Shop & Service, Food, College & University) generated by three models: TrajGAIL, LLMob-L, and LLMob-L with a \"Pandemic\" prompt.
