The average model acts as a good inductive bias and makes it easier to distinguish between the learned functions during training. We additionally compare against an oracle prediction approach (Oracle), which has access to the hidden parameters as an additional input with a neural ODE as the underlying architecture. While its 1-step prediction accuracy demonstrates good empirical performance, the long-horizon predictions are unstable. This is because Oracle is required to generalize to an entire space of dynamics with one NODE, which is a complex and difficult function to learn.

Techniques such as Taylor series, Fourier series, and orthogonal polynomial systems utilize an infinite set of basis functions, theoretically allowing perfect function representation [6, 23, 7]. However, in high-dimensional spaces, these techniques become impractical due to the exponential growth in the number of basis functions. Additionally, many approaches depend on the choice of a feature map or kernel to define the function space [29, 25], which imposes structure by selecting the class of functions to learn from (e.g. using radial basis functions [3]). These design choices necessarily introduce approximation errors through the choice of function class, or may depend on prior domain knowledge, which may not always be available. Methods for identifying system dynamics that use a large library of pre-defined basis functions, such as Koopman operators [2] or nonlinear system identification through sparse regression such as SINDy [4, 26, 15], have received considerable attention. Yet these approaches typically employ a finely-crafted finite dictionary of basis functions, which requires careful choice to achieve good data-driven performance [20]. Neural network approaches such as functional-link and orthogonal networks [30, 7] omit hidden layers and use gradient descent to learn a linear combination of features, encoding the function class into the network architecture, but fail to generalize well, and are not amenable to zero-shot transfer. In contrast, we compute the coefficients of the model through a well-defined inner product, which scales well with data and can be computed quickly. Furthermore, our basis functions are entirely learned from data during the training phase, similar to representation learning [1], and thus require no prior assumptions or domain knowledge.

While the model training can be enhanced [8] and the models can incorporate prior knowledge [9, 10] to reduce the training time, they inherently focus on a single system at a time. This inherently limits their ability to generalize across different systems without retraining. Notably, parameterized neural ODEs [19] pass the model parameters as an additional input to the neural ODE. This approach has been shown to achieve a form of transfer within the set of allowable parameters, but requires extensive knowledge of the system parameters and the structure of the dynamics, both at training and test time. In principle, our approach can be combined with these existing approaches to incorporate their distinct advantages, making our approach highly generalizable to different systems and modeling frameworks.

However, meta learning requires gradient updates to the learned models, which may be too slow for real-time control. Transformers are another technique that can adapt given an online dataset by feeding that dataset as input to the encoder side of the transformer. However, transformers have long forward pass times and scale quadratically with the amount of data [16], and so they are not amenable for model-based control. Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is another technique to generate a policy which is robust to a large set of dynamics [27]. In contrast, our dynamics model adapts to the current dynamics, and thus our controller is adaptive, rather than robust.
