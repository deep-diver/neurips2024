However, current computational models struggle to explain how this generalization is achieved efficiently. The paper aims to address this by proposing that the brain maps spatial domains to abstract cognitive spaces by extracting low-dimensional descriptions of displacements. This sidesteps the computational cost associated with high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nThe paper proposes a neural network model to learn consistent, low-dimensional velocity signals across various abstract domains. This self-supervised model leverages geometric consistency constraints and outperforms conventional methods in dimensionality reduction and motion extraction.  The model highlights the importance of grid cells, demonstrating that they maintain their population correlation and manifold structure across different domains, thus explaining their flexible cognitive mapping capabilities and providing a potential self-supervised framework for transfer learning.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hocAc3Qit7/podcast.wav"}
