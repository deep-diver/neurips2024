The errors are calculated using a mean squared error metric that measures how well the model's inferred velocities align with the ground truth velocities, following the application of a linear transformation. Each result is an average of six different runs with distinct random seeds, ensuring reproducibility across experiments.", "section": "3.1 Single learning framework infers geometrically consistent representations of velocity across cognitive domains"}, {"figure_path": "hocAc3Qit7/tables/tables_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Mean and standard deviation of errors for various tasks and models.
