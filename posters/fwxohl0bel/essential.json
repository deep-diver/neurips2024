Coarse-graining (CG) techniques simplify the system by reducing degrees of freedom but often lead to inaccuracies and require force-matching and back-mapping steps. This is particularly problematic in systems like proteins where interactions occur on multiple scales.\nThis paper introduces neural network reparametrization as a novel approach to molecular simulations. Unlike traditional CG, this method uses a neural network to represent the fine-grained system as a function of coarse-grained modes. The flexibility of this approach allows for adjusting the system's complexity in order to simplify the optimization process, which can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. The method also eliminates the need for force-matching, thereby enhancing the accuracy of energy minimization.  Importantly, the proposed framework incorporates graph neural networks and physically meaningful 'slow modes', which are naturally arising from the structure of physical Hessians, further accelerating convergence and helping guide the optimization toward more stable configurations.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "FwxOHl0BEl/podcast.wav"}
