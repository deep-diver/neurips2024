This is inefficient and limits robot adaptability.  Existing solutions attempt to train universal controllers, which is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.  This paper tackles this problem with a new approach.\nThe proposed framework, MeMo, learns modular controllers that handle specific parts (like legs or arms).  This modularity, combined with noise injection during training, allows for effective knowledge transfer between robots built with similar components. MeMo demonstrates improved training efficiency and generalization across diverse robotic morphologies and tasks, showcasing the benefits of a modular approach for learning reusable robot control policies.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "5DJBBACqim/podcast.wav"}
