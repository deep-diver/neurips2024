Note that \u03c6(z) is the point-wise maximum of the two.", "description": "This figure shows the piecewise potential function \u03c6(z), which is defined as the pointwise maximum of the two functions (z+2)e\u207b\u1dbb and 2-z.  The blue curve represents (z+2)e\u207b\u1dbb and the red line represents 2-z. The graph visually demonstrates how the piecewise function combines the two functions to define a continuously differentiable potential function used in the agnostic boosting algorithm.", "section": "4 The algorithm and main results"}]
