This often hinders timely detection of crucial changes in dynamic systems.  The non-conjugacy arises from the incompatibility between the likelihood function of the Hawkes process and commonly used priors.\nThis paper introduces CoBay-CPD, a novel method that solves the computational challenges by employing data augmentation.  This technique introduces auxiliary latent variables to create a conditionally conjugate model, allowing for the derivation of an efficient and accurate Gibbs sampler for parameter inference.  The proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing techniques, making it a valuable tool for real-time change point detection in various applications.
