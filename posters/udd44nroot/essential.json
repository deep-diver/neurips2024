Existing methods often struggle with overfitting or inadvertently learning from sub-optimal data. This necessitates gathering more expert data which is often difficult, expensive, or simply not feasible. \n\nThe proposed method, SPRINQL, tackles this by incorporating both expert and sub-optimal demonstrations.  It uses inverse soft-Q learning with learned weights to prioritize expert data while still benefiting from the larger sub-optimal dataset.  SPRINQL's formulation as a convex optimization problem improves efficiency and avoids adversarial training. Empirical results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on offline IL benchmarks, demonstrating the value of utilizing readily available sub-optimal data to enhance the learning process.", "affiliation": "Singapore Management University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "uDD44NROOt/podcast.wav"}
