Current conformal prediction methods offer valid prediction intervals but only marginally (across all contexts), not conditionally within specific contexts.  This limits the usefulness in real-world applications where decisions are context-dependent. Furthermore, miscalibration in point predictions can affect the reliability and interpretability of prediction intervals.\nThis paper introduces Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction (SC-CP), a novel method that addresses these issues. SC-CP combines Venn-Abers calibration for calibrated point predictions and conformal prediction to create prediction intervals with valid coverage conditional on the calibrated point predictions (prediction-conditional validity). Experiments demonstrate that SC-CP improves interval efficiency and offers a practical alternative to context-conditional validity.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "BJ6HkT7qIk/podcast.wav"}
