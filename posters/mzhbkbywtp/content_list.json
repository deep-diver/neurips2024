We propose an alternative algorithm that addresses this issue by assuming only linear control. The algorithm leverages the fact that the cost function can be computed from closed-form moment expressions, which can then be minimized numerically. To handle potential high computational costs, we derive an analytical counterpart for the optimization, based on the efficient propagation of cost function derivatives over time. For simplicity, the algorithm is derived for a simpler, yet relevant, case as outlined in Section 3.3, with extensions to the more general case also discussed.

One of the underlying assumptions in this work and in [1] is that the agent has complete knowledge of the updating rules of the latent dynamical system. By using the same set of matrices to update the state and the state estimate, we implicitly assume that all uncertainty in the estimation process arises solely from noise sources: the problem of inferring the matrices $A$ and $B$ goes beyond the objectives of this approach. For this reason, to extend our work to the more general and realistic case of Switching Linear Dynamics (SLD), we can consider a matrix $A$ depending on the time step $t$ , $A_{t}$ . A complete formulation of SLD might require adding another variable, a discrete switch variable $s_{t}$ regulating the way the matrices $A_{t}$ vary with time and context [45]. Given that in our case the agent has access to the updating rules of the dynamical system, we can omit $s_{t}$ (the agent does not have to infer $s_{t}$ and $A_{t}$ ) and directly consider the case in which we have a predetermined set of matrices $A_{1,\\cdots,T-1}$ . The same applies to the matrix $B$ , that can be replaced by $B_{1,\\cdots,T-1}$ . Note that to preserve linearity we assume $A_{t}$ and $B_{t}$ to be independent on $x$ and $\\hat{x}$ . We consider here the multidimensional case to be as general as possible. To extend the GD algorithm we only need to modify the block matrix $M_{t}$ that we use to update the moments $\\Sigma_{t},\\mu_{t}$ and eventually propagate the expected cost $\\mathbb{E}[J]$ through Eq. 3. Indeed, once we can compute the expected cost at fixed control and filter gains, $L_{1,\\cdots,T-1}$ , and $K_{1,\\cdots,T-2}$ , we can use Algorithm 1 to define the objective function to be minimized through gradient descent with respect to $L_{t}$ and $K_{t}$ . To update the block matrix $M_{t}$ we have to substitute $A$ and $B$ respectively with $A_{t}$ and $B_{t}$ in Eq. 12. To handle the potentially high computational costs of performing a numerical gradient descent, we introduced the analytical counterpart of the GD algorithm, the FPOMP algorithm. For the one-dimensional case, it supports all the noise sources mentioned in Section 2 (additive, multiplicative and internal). We extended this algorithm to the multi-dimensional case for additive and internal noise for the sake of simplicity, leaving the more general version for future work (Appendix A.6.2 outlines how this can be done). Here, we extend the afore-mentioned FPOMP algorithm (for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases) to switching linear dynamics, following a similar procedure to that of the numerical algorithm. For the one-dimensional case, we replace $A$ and $B$ respectively with $A_{t}$ and $B_{t}$ in Eqs. 78-80, and 94-97. For the multi-dimensional case we have to substitute $A$ with $A_{t+j}$ and $B$ with $B_{t+j}$ in Eq. 114 and $B$ with $B_{t}$ in Eq. 115. Finally, as previously done, we replace $A$ with $A_{t}$ in Eq. 119 for $\\tilde{M_{t}}$ . With these changes, we can implement Algorithm 2 for the case with switching linear dynamics.

When $L_{t}$ and $K_{t}$ are both optimized with the GD method, a lower accumulated cost is achieved (green dashed line). An interesting feature of our algorithm is that, being fully analytical, it can enhance numerical solutions. Due to a potentially shallow parameter landscape (vanishing gradient) or limited computation time, the GD optimization may stop near the global optimum without fully reaching it.
