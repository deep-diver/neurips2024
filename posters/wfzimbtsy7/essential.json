This makes them computationally expensive for long-horizon tasks. The Mamba model, known for its efficient processing of long-term dependencies, offers a potential solution.\nThis paper proposes Decision Mamba-Hybrid (DM-H), a novel method that combines Mamba and transformer models. DM-H leverages Mamba to generate high-value sub-goals from long-term memory, which are then used to prompt the transformer for high-quality predictions. The results demonstrate that DM-H achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark tasks while being significantly faster than transformer-based baselines. This shows the **effectiveness of combining Mamba and transformers for solving long-term RL problems.**", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "wFzIMbTsY7/podcast.wav"}
