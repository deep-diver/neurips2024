Existing linear scalarization methods struggle to explore complex, non-convex Pareto frontiers effectively.  This research highlights the limitations of linear scalarizations and motivates the exploration of non-linear alternatives. \nThis paper focuses on hypervolume scalarizations, a non-linear approach proven to effectively explore the Pareto frontier. The authors present novel theoretical results, including optimal sublinear hypervolume regret bounds, and demonstrate the efficacy of hypervolume scalarizations through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. They also introduce a new algorithm for multi-objective stochastic linear bandits that leverages the properties of hypervolume scalarizations to achieve superior performance.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "30NS22tgCW/podcast.wav"}
