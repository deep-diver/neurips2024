The right plot (b) depicts the optimal allocation when a fairness constraint is imposed which requires a minimum average allocation for each of two groups. The boundary of the optimal allocation region depends on the difference in virtual valuations and a constant gamma, which represent a cost of reallocating to satisfy the fairness constraint.

Figure 1a depicts the optimal allocation without a fairness constraint. The item is allocated to the buyer with the highest virtual value, above a certain threshold. Figure 1b depicts the optimal allocation with a fairness constraint. This allocation involves subsidizing one group, allowing allocation to that group even when its maximum virtual value is below the other group\u2019s. The extent of subsidization depends on the difference in future utilities for the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the other. The two figures highlight how the fairness constraint changes the allocation strategy. ", "section": "3 The static case"}]
