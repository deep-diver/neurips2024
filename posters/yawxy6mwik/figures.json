[{"figure_path": "YawXY6mWiK/figures/figures_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Left. Overview of the agent design that enables LLM-based full-duplex dialogue models. The agent is equipped with one LLM, one perception module, and one motor function module. The latter operates continuously and simultaneously to collect input to the LLM and produce voice-based LLM outputs. Right. The LLM operates a two-state neural FSM with SPEAK and LISTEN states. At each timestep, the LLM either 1) receives an external input token, 2) generates a textual token for speech, or 3) produces a control token to signal state transition in the neural FSM. This simple workflow enables full-duplex dialogue without any external moderation module.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of a full-duplex dialogue system based on a large language model (LLM).  The left side shows the system's components: an LLM, a perception module (ASR), and a motor function module (TTS). These modules work together allowing simultaneous speech and listening. The right side details the neural finite state machine (FSM) used by the LLM to control the dialogue flow. The FSM has two states, SPEAK and LISTEN, and the LLM generates tokens to switch between these states, handling speech input, generating output, and making decisions regarding the conversation.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "YawXY6mWiK/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: In LLM based full-duplex dialogue system, the LLM operates a two state FSM, governing state transitions in the dialogue.", "description": "This figure illustrates how the Large Language Model (LLM) interacts with the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) modules through a two-state finite state machine (FSM).  The FSM controls whether the LLM is in SPEAK or LISTEN mode. ASR provides the LLM with user input, while TTS converts the LLM's textual output into speech. Control tokens (C.SPEAK, C.LISTEN, S.SPEAK, S.LISTEN) generated by the LLM direct the state transitions of the FSM, enabling simultaneous speaking and listening during the conversation.", "section": "3 Methods"}]
