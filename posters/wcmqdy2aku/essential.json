However, integrating PH into graph neural networks (GNNs) has been challenging due to marginal improvements with low interpretability.  This research highlights the problem of using PH in GNNs in current approaches, emphasizing the need for a more effective integration method.\nThis paper introduces Topology-Invariant Pooling (TIP), a novel mechanism that aligns PH with graph pooling operations.  TIP injects global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, improving performance consistently. Experiments demonstrate that TIP significantly boosts the performance of several graph pooling methods across multiple datasets. The success is supported by the observed monotone relationship between pooling ratio and the proportion of non-zero persistence in PH, showcasing the alignment between PH and graph pooling.  The method's flexibility and consistent performance enhancements highlight its potential as a valuable tool for advancing graph neural network research.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "WcmqdY2AKu/podcast.wav"}
