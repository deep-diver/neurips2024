To bridge this gap, we introduce Cross-model Control (CMC), a method that improves multiple LLMs in one-time training with a portable tiny language model.

For instance, in the case of instruction following (Wei et al., 2022), after pre-training, vanilla models typically require instruction tuning to develop the capacity to comprehend user instructions accurately. Alternatively, unlearning and detoxification are also necessary considerations (Gehman et al., 2020; Chen and Yang, 2023). During the training process, models may encounter data containing real-world personal privacy information or content that is harmful, offensive, or prejudiced. This could lead them to output these information during the inference stage (Wei et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022).

When the delta model is applied to LLAMA2-70B, a larger delta model size may have a negative effect. We believe this is because the 70B LLM, with a massive parameter size, does not need to make significant adjustments to the output to acquire the ability to follow instructions, and an overly large parameter size in the delta model may lead to overfitting. This indicates that a delta model used for adjusting LLM output logits does not necessarily require a large number of parameters. It also demonstrates the significant potential for small models to assist large models.

As shown in Figure 4a, we found that the performance was optimal when the $\\alpha$ value was 1.0, and increasing or decreasing $\\alpha$ resulted in decreased performance. This is similar to causing the delta model to overfit or underfit, so we explored whether adjusting the $\\alpha$ value during inference could counteract the overftiting and underftiting during training. Specifically, the delta model performed best after training for four epochs, and we selected the checkpoint after training for two epochs as the underftiting scenario and the checkpoint after training for eight epochs as the overfitting scenario. We found that adjusting the $\\alpha$ value could counteract the overfitting or underfitting during training. The underfitting delta model had a win rate of 54 when $\\alpha$ was 1.0, which increased to 64 when $\\alpha$ was 2.0. Similarly, the overfitting delta model had a win rate of 48 when $\\alpha$ was 1.0, which increased to 64 when $\\alpha$ was 0.75.

As demonstrated in Table 4, our findings reveal that the removal of LogSoftmax results in a decline in performance. This suggests that projecting the logits output by the LLM into the logarithmic space can reduce the gap between training and inference. Similarly, the absence of prefix matching in token mapping diminishes the supportive effect of the delta model on the LLM. This indicates that prefix matching has a higher priority than selecting tokens with the minimal edit distance. Eliminating prefix matching could lead to the aggregation of token logits that are semantically unrelated.

", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Training-Intensive methods One of the most effective methods for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks involves updating only a subset of the model parameters, rather than the entire set. For instance, LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) achieves parameter updates by decomposing them into trainable low-rank vectors. Prefix-tuning (Li and Liang, 2021) introduces a series of continuous, task-specific vectors at the beginning of the input sequence for task adaptation. Adaptertuning (Houlsby et al., 2019) integrates compact, trainable modules within the layers of a pre-trained model to facilitate transfer learning. BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021) selectively updates individual bias vectors in the model\u2019s parameters. Although these methods enhance performance in downstream tasks, they still require significant computational resources. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Decoding-Time methods To reduce training costs, some researchers have explored decoding-time methods. For example, DExperts (Liu et al., 2021) enhances or suppresses certain text attributes by integrating expert and anti-expert models during decoding. GeDi (Krause et al., 2021) employs smaller LMs as generative discriminators to steer the output of larger LMs, enhancing safety and control. Proxy-tuning (Liu et al., 2024a) modifies the predictions of an untuned larger model towards a desired outcome. ITI (Li et al., 2024) adjusts activation values during inference to generate more accurate responses. EFT (Mitchell et al., 2023) employs two smaller LMs to emulate the behavior of a larger LM without the need for additional training. Although these methods are effective, they often require the use of two additional language models during inference, increasing inference costs.

Through comparative analysis of the logits shifts in different LLMs before and after fine-tuning, we observed a similarity in these shifts. Based on this observation, we introduced a portable tiny delta model to fit the logits shifts of LLMs, enabling the adjustment of outputs for LLMs of varying sizes and vocabularies. Our experiments in instruction tuning and unlearning tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.
