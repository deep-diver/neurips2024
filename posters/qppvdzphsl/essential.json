Existing methods rely on uni-modal models, leading to suboptimal performance. This limitation motivates the need for innovative approaches that effectively bridge the binary-source semantic gap. \n\nThis paper introduces ProRec, a novel probe-and-recover framework that addresses this challenge by incorporating both binary-source encoder-decoder models and black-box LLMs.  ProRec synthesizes relevant code fragments as context, enhancing the LLMs' ability to accurately summarize binary functions and recover function names.  Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of ProRec in automating and improving binary code analysis.", "affiliation": "Purdue university", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Summarization"}, "podcast_path": "qPpVDzPhSL/podcast.wav"}
