Classical communication methods face limitations in terms of bandwidth and latency, especially as model size grows. Moreover, data privacy concerns become critical in such distributed settings. This necessitates the design of more efficient and secure distributed architectures.\nThis research introduces a framework for distributed computation using a quantum network, where data is encoded into quantum states. The authors demonstrate that, within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent requires exponentially less communication compared to classical methods. They show this advantage holds for specific graph neural networks, which are empirically evaluated on standard benchmarks. The quantum nature of communication also enhances privacy by limiting information extraction about data and model parameters.", "affiliation": "Google Quantum AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gGR9dJbe3r/podcast.wav"}
