Vision-language foundation models, especially   \n3 CLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary   \n4 capabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction   \n5 ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment   \n6 between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability   \n7 on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP, a symmetrical   \n8 parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space   \n9 for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved   \n10 by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a   \n11 dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since   \n12 the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the   \n13 misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional   \n14 constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy   \n15 principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the   \n16 intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of   \n17 the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder.

Vision-language foundation models [43, 5, 34, 39, 11, 17, 26, 21, 27, 13, 18, 29, 10,   \n25 28, 45], especially CLIP [39], are often utilized to endow open-vocabulary recognition capabilities.   \n26 Consequently, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation essentially boil down to transferring these   \n27 vision-language foundation models, originally trained with image-level supervision, to perform   \n28 pixel-level predictions.   \n29 To this end, current methods [52, 48, 7, 50] typically fine-tune CLIP on a benchmark dataset with   \n30 segmentation annotations, i.e., COCO [2], to equip it with the segmentation ability. However, this   \n31 often leads to three main issues. First, fine-tuning CLIP on limited categories would affect its   \n32 generalization ability, resulting in significant performance degradation on unseen categories. Second,   \n33 current fine-tuning strategies are usually asymmetrical, which inevitably causes a misalignment   \n34 between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, i.e., image and text [52], which may lead to sub  \n35 optimal performance. Third, although remarkable performance gains, these approaches often rely on   \n36 computationally extensive full fine-tuning, which raises concerns about scalability and affordability.   \n37 To address these issues, we propose a symmetric parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy   \n38 for CLIP, dubbed H-CLIP. Specifically, we implement this PEFT through a partial orthogonal fine  \n39 tuning (POF) strategy, which introduces a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation   \n40 matrices into the hyperspherical space. Then, to preserve CLIP\u2019s generalization ability, we leverage   \n41 the hyperspherical energy principle [32, 38], which suggests that maintaining the same hyperspherical   \n42 energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure, i.e., generalization ability. In light of this,   \n43 we upgrade our POF by incorporating orthogonal constraints in the learnable matrices for updating   \n44 CLIP\u2019s text encoder, as orthogonal transformations keep the hyperspherical energy unchanged during   \n45 fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a dual cross-relation communication (DCRC) module to   \n46 explicitly encourage cross-modal and cross-layer communications within all learnable matrices.   \n47 This communication not only preserves the hyperspherical energy but also further mitigating the   \n48 misalignment problem.   \n49 Extensive results demonstrate that H-CLIP achieves new state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic   \n50 segmentation results across three benchmarks by fine-tuning CLIP with approximately $4\\%$ of the   \n51 total parameters of CLIP.

However, they claim that fine-tuning CLIP\u2019s encoder significantly reduces its ability   \n57 to generalize to unseen classes. To address this issue, some methods [15, 8, 51, 49] swing to the   \n58 opposite extreme, fine-tuning an additional mask generator [6] for segmentation while keeping CLIP   \n59 frozen to maintain generalization-oriented recognition. However, this frozen parameter space lacks   \n60 segmentation awareness, resulting in a misalignment between regions and text descriptions [30].   \n61 Other studies [52, 50, 7] propose an advanced solution that fine-tunes only selected parameters, e.g.,   \n62 certain layers of CLIP, to enable pixel-level predictions while keeping most of CLIP\u2019s parameters   \n63 fixed, thus minimizing losing of generalization. Although the advantages are remarkable, these   \n64 methods often work with a very small learning rate, implicitly encouraging a small deviation from   \n65 the pre-trained CLIP, limiting the segmentation performance. In a nutshell, the trade-off between   \n66 preserving CLIP\u2019s generalization and learning segmentation knowledge persists, hindering the final   \n67 performance.

The core of these approaches   \n73 lies in updating only limited parameters to capture the specific characteristics of different scenarios,   \n74 while keeping most parameters fixed to maintain generalization. In contrast, fine-tuning CLIP   \n75 for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation often meets a dilemma. On the one hand, limited   \n76 parameters typically fall short in facilitating the transition from a classification model, i.e., CLIP, to a   \n77 segmentation task. On the other hand, directly increasing the number of trainable parameters risks   \n78 undermining CLIP\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen classes, as experimented in CAT-Seg [7]. Most   \n79 methods [52, 48] solve this issue by simply freezing CLIP\u2019s text encoder and fine-tuning its image   \n80 encoder, inevitably causing misalignment between the two modalities of CLIP.

According to   \n88 the inspiration from Thomson problem[44] which is to determine the minimum electrostatic potential   \n89 energy configuration of $N$ mutually-repelling electrons on the surface of a unit sphere, we adopt the   \n90 Hyperspherical Energy to characterize the diversity of the model.

Following previous studies [7, 48], we utilizes the COCO-Stuff dataset [2] as our training   \n196 set. This dataset comprises approximately 118,000 densely annotated images across 171 distinct   \n197 semantic categories. During inference, we carry out comparisons with state-of-the-art methods across   \n198 several semantic segmentation datasets, including ADE20K [55], PASCAL VOC [12], and PASCAL  \n199 Context [35]. ADE20K [55] is a classical semantic segmentation dataset comprising around 20,000   \n200 training images and 2,000 validation images. Besides, it includes two different test sets: A-150 and   \n201 A-847. The test set A-150 has 150 common categories, while the test set A-847 has 847 categories.   \n202 PASCAL VOC [12] is a small dataset for semantic segmentation, which includes 1464 training   \n203 images and 1449 validation images. The dataset contains 20 different foreground categories. We   \n204 name it as PAS-20. In line with [7], we also report a score on ${\\tt P A S}_{-20}{}^{b}$ , which involves \u201cbackground\u201d   \n205 as the 21st category. PASCAL-Context [35] is upgraded from the original PASCAL VOC dataset.   \n206 It includes two different test sets: PC-59 and PC-459 for evaluation. The test set PC-59 has 59   \n207 categories, while the test set PC-459 has 459 categories.   \n208 Evaluation metric. Following prior works [7, 48], we adopt mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)   \n209 to evaluate the semantic segmentation performance on the three benchmarks.   \n210 Implementation Details. We implement our method using the Transformer-based CLIP model.   \n211 Following the protocol established in [7], we evaluate our results on two versions of the CLIP model:   \n212 ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14. For training, we use the Adam optimizer [22] with an initial learning rate   \n213 of $5\\times10^{-6}$ for CLIP, and a weight decay of $10^{-4}$ . Training is conducted with one image per   \n214 mini-batch. We set $q=128$ for balancing efficiency and performance. The function $f_{3}(\\cdot)$ and $\\bar{f_{4}}(\\cdot)$   \n215 are implemented using two 2-layer MLPs. We act the cost-based approach provided in [7] as our   \n216 decoder.

Among   \nthese methods, CAT-Seg [7] achieves performance comparable to ours.

We use the ViT-B/16 [9] version of CLIP as the baseline, shown in   \n249 row 1 of Table 3. Additionally, we implement a mainstream parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)   \n250 method, LoRA [16], for comparison with a similar number of learnable parameters, as shown in row   \n251 2. Note that LoRA can improve performance compared to the baseline, demonstrating that PEFT is a   \n252 viable approach for this task. Then, comparing row 5 to row 2, we observe significant performance   \n253 gains, indicating that our results are driven by our targeted solution rather than merely the number of   \n254 parameters. Moreover, row 3 shows that using only POF preserves generalization on unseen classes,   \n255 particularly in the A-847 dataset. Meanwhile, solely adapting DCRC shows limited improvement, as   \n256 it only enhances communication among frozen weight matrices. Finally, integrating DCRC with POF   \n257 yields clear performance gains, e.g., a $12.6\\%$ improvement on the PC-459 dataset.   \n258 Different Design of POF. Table 4 presents experiments introducing different designs into POF.

In (a), the results show that larger In (a), the results show that larger $q$ generally performs   \n261 better than smaller $q$ . However, we find a good trade-off between performance and parameter   \n262 efficiency, with $q=128$ working well across datasets and tasks. Therefore, we maintain this setting   \n263 in other experiments. In (b), we show that both blindly applying orthogonality constraints to the   \n264 learnable matrices of all layers and not using any constraints at all can degrade performance on most   \n265 test sets, demonstrating the value of our analysis with the hyperspherical energy principle.

Specifically, we propose a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)   \n271 strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the   \n272 PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and   \n273 a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices to mitigate misalignment   \n274 between different modalities. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP   \n275 text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy   \n276 during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the   \n277 destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder.

We aim to address a significant challenge in open-vocabulary semantic   \n511 segmentation: fine-tuning CLIP to achieve per-pixel predictions without compromising   \n512 its generalization capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel H-CLIP, which introduces   \n513 a partial orthogonal fine-tuning strategy that prevents a drop in hyperspherical energy,   \n514 thereby preserving generalization. Subsequently, H-CLIP employs dual cross-relation com  \n515 munication to increase projection flexibility, facilitating the acquisition of segmentation   \n516 knowledge.   \n517 2. Limitations   \n518 Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?   \n519 Answer: [NA]   \n520 Justification: Those are not discussed in the paper.   \n521 Guidelines:   \n522 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that   \n523 the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.   \n524 \u2022 The authors are encouraged to create a separate \"Limitations\" section in their paper.   \n525 \u2022 The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to   \n526 violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,   \n527 model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors   \n528 should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the   \n529 implications would be.   \n530 \u2022 The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was   \n531 only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often   \n532 depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n533 \u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.   \n534 For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution   \n535 is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be   \n536 used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle   \n537 technical jargon.   \n538 \u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms   \n539 and how they scale with dataset size.   \n540 \u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to   \n541 address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n542 \u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by   \n43 reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover   \n44 limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best   \n545 judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor  \n546 tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

Broader Impacts   \n693 Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative   \n694 societal impacts of the work performed?   \n695 Answer: [NA]   \n696 Justification: there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n697 Guidelines:   \n698 \u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n699 \u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal   \n700 impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.   \n701 \u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses   \n702 (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations   \n703 (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific   \n704 groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.   \n705 \u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied   \n706 to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to   \n707 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n708 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n709 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n710 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n711 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n712 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n713 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n714 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n715 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n716 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n717 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n718 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n719 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n720 11. Safeguards   \n721 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible   \n722 release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,   \n723 image generators, or scraped datasets)?   \n724 Answer: [NA]   \n725 Justification: the paper poses no such risks.   \n726 Guidelines:   \n727 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.   \n728 \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with   \n729 necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring   \n730 that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing   \n731 safety filters.   \n732 \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors   \n733 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n734 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n735 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n736 faith effort.   \n737 12. Licenses for existing assets   \n738 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in   \n739 the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and   \n740 properly respected?   \n741 Answer: [NA]   \n742 Justification: All the assets used are properly credited and are the license and terms of use   \n743 explicitly mentioned and properly respected.   \n744 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.   \n745 \u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.   \n746 \u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a   \n747 URL.   \n748 \u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.   \n749 \u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of   \n750 service of that source should be provided.   \n751 \u2022 If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the   \n752 package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets   \n753 has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the   \n754 license of a dataset.   \n755 \u2022 For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of   \n756 the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.   \n757 \u2022 If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to   \n758 the asset\u2019s creators.   \n759 13. New Assets   \n760 Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation   \n761 provided alongside the assets?   \n762 Answer: [NA]   \n763 Justification: The paper does not release new assets.   \n764 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.   \n765 \u2022 Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their   \n766 submissions via structured templates.

Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. \u2022 Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. \u2022 We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. \u2022 For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
