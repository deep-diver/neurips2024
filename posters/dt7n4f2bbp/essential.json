This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages higher-order interactions between three or more cameras by employing block trifocal tensors.  These tensors provide richer geometric information, overcoming the challenges posed by pairwise methods.\nThe proposed method introduces a novel synchronization algorithm based on the low multilinear rank property of the block trifocal tensor. This algorithm uses a higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) to enforce the low-rank constraint and iteratively refines scale estimates.  Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in location estimation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art global synchronization techniques. The work also provides a rigorous theoretical foundation demonstrating the sufficiency of the low-rank constraint for camera recovery in noiseless conditions.", "affiliation": "University of Minnesota", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "DT7n4F2bbP/podcast.wav"}
