The performance is evaluated using two metrics: Average Progressive Reward and Test Accuracy.  Each algorithm is tested with two different reward estimators: Binary and Lipschitz. The numbers represent the mean and standard deviation (in parentheses) across multiple runs.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
