Existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) often use multiple regression-based surrogates, leading to high computational costs and difficulty maintaining solution diversity.  Classification-based SAEAs, while using fewer surrogates, suffer from exponential increases in training data size. \nLORA-MOO addresses these issues by using a novel surrogate model. It learns ordinal relations from spherical coordinates, employing a single ordinal regression-based surrogate for convergence and separate surrogates for diversity. This approach enhances efficiency by reducing surrogate-related costs and utilizing parameter-free diversity maintenance.  The results demonstrate that LORA-MOO significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both convergence and diversity across benchmark problems and real-world applications.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "hc9GkYw9kR/podcast.wav"}
