The results demonstrate LI-DiT's superior performance across different model sizes (1B and 10B parameters), showcasing its ability to handle complex prompts and achieve high image quality. The comparison includes both open-source and closed-source commercial models to illustrate LI-DiT's overall competitiveness.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "7b2DrIBGZz/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: The performance of LI-DiT on T2I-CompBench, DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmark.
