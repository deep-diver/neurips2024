The interaction is usually modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Research on MDPs can be broadly divided into two lines based on the reward generation mechanism. The first line of work [Jaksch et al., 2010, Azar et al., 2013, 2017, He et al., 2021] considers the stochastic MDPs where the reward is sampled from a fixed distribution. In many real-world scenarios, however, the assumption of fixed reward distributions may not hold, as rewards can vary over time. This motivates the study on adversarial MDPs [Even-Dar et al., 2009, Yu et al., 2009, Zimin and Neu, 2013, Jin et al., 2020a], where rewards might change in an adversarial manner. To address the challenges of large-scale MDPs, recent studies have extended these two frameworks to incorporate function approximation, allowing RL algorithms to handle large state and action spaces.

Non-stationary stochastic MDPs address scenarios where transitions and rewards are stochastically generated from varying distributions. The non-stationarity measure is typically defined as the total variation of the transitions or rewards over time. For infinitehorizon MDPs, the seminal work of Jaksch et al. [2010] investigates the piecewise stationary setting where both the transitions and rewards are subject to changes at specific time and remain fixed in between. Ortner et al. [2019] further advance the field by allowing for changes at every step. Subsequently, Cheung et al. [2020] introduce the Bandit-over-RL algorithm, which addresses the limitations of earlier works by eliminating the need for prior knowledge about the non-stationarity. Additional advancements have been made in episodic non-stationary MDPs [Mao et al., 2021, Domingues et al., 2021] and episodic non-stationary linear MDPs [Touati and Vincent, 2020, Zhou et al., 2022]. A breakthrough is the black-box method by Wei and Luo [2021], which can transform any algorithm with the optimal static regret under certain conditions, into another one that achieves optimal dynamic regret without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity. However, this method is inapplicable in adversarial settings. The limitation arises from its dependence on an optimistic estimator, constructed via a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based algorithm for environmental change detection, a technique that performs well in stochastic environments but is less effective in adversarial scenarios.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
