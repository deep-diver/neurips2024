Since we need to improve the generalization while also specialize on the testing distribution, we need to fit the adversarial model with clean model features both on the diversely augmented and basic augmented distributions. Inspired by previous work in supervised AT [1], we adopt a multi-stream structure that takes samples from different distributions as inputs. In the previous ACL and SAT works, there were no clear conclusion on the usage of BatchNorm layers. While some works [22, 14] suggested to use different BatchNorm layers for adversarial sample, Zhang et al. [38] suggested that separate BatchNorm layers are not necessary. In this work, we find that each training distribution is worth one set of BatchNorm parameters in SAT and even if the clean model only contains one set of BatchNorm layers, it can provide effective guidance for the multi-BatchNorm adversarial model. Specifically, we define four different input streams based on the combination of their adversarial type (adversarial vs. natural) and augmentation type (strong vs. weak), where the basic augmentation contains random resized crop and horizontal flip while diverse augmentation contains Trivial Augmentation [27] and basic augmentation.

Second, different from previous works that focused on introducing sample perturbation to the SSL pretext task, we suggest that regulating the smoothness of the SSL loss landscape by adversarial weight self-perturbation boosts robust generalization transferable to downstream classification.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
