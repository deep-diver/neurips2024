The left side displays the results for CIFAR-100, and the right side for CIFAR-10.  The bar chart compares training and testing accuracy under clean and robust conditions. The key observation is a significant difference between clean and robust accuracies in the testing phase for SAT, indicating poor generalization under adversarial attacks. This motivates the need for improved SAT methods.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "CIHdlhfrOo/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: A demonstration of our proposed DAQ-SDP.

In the first stage, a self-supervised model is trained with clean data. Then, in the second stage, the features predicted by the clean model are used to guide the adversarial training of a robust encoder. The robust encoder uses a pairwise-BatchNorm to handle diverse augmented queries and self-supervised double perturbation.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "CIHdlhfrOo/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Motivation: Large robust generalization gap and reduced clean accuracy for SAT (SimCLR) on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10.
