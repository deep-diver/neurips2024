The significance of this area has been amplified by the emergence of prominent machine learning architectures and applications relying on multi-agent, typically zero-sum, games [42, 32, 46, 52, 14, 49, 10]. Symmetric zero-sum games and their dynamics are actually of particular interest both from a traditional evolutionary perspective [54, 13] as well as from a modern Machine Learning perspective as creating a population of agents that compete against each other in a heads-up fashion to outperform each other (\u201cself-play\u201d) has been shown to be a reliable recipe for creating super-humanly capable agents for a wide range of tasks [9, 38]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite growing interest in understanding and predicting the long-term behavior of such systems, recent studies have revealed a wide array of negative results, demonstrating the elusiveness of game dynamics. These range from non-convergence results to the establishment of chaotic or even essentially arbitrary behavior [44, 28, 30, 40, 3, 4, 55, 26, 45]. Notably, these instability and chaotic behaviors persist even in the analysis of well-known online optimization algorithms, such as Multiplicative Weights Updates (MWU/Hedge), Online Gradient Descent, Follow-the-RegularizedLeader a.o., even within the narrow but seminal class of (symmetric) zero-sum games [7, 18, 19, 20]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Although it is possible to stabilize learning dynamics in zero-sum games using e.g., optimistic variants of MWU [22, 43, 23], such results leave something to be desired as they presuppose that the agents coordinate to use a specific instantiation of a learning algorithm. Ideally, we would like instead to be able to prove such strong convergence results based on more abstract properties of the dynamics. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Swap (internal) regret is once such abstract property of online learning dynamics. Unlike the more permissive case of no-(external) regret, where the algorithm\u2019s performance needs to compete against the best fixed action with hindsight, no-swap-regret algorithms need to compete against the best adaptive deviation policy with hindsight (i.e., for each occurrence of action $i$ we consider to the best possible deviating action $j$ with hindsight). Somewhat surprisingly, it is possible to adapt no-regret algorithms to no-internal-regret algorithms efficiently [11, 53] with very recent work providing further efficient such reductions [21, 48]. The stronger nature of swap regret results into numerous applications, such as (multi)-calibration [31, 37, 51, 35, 33], robustness against dynamic strategic behavior [24, 41, 15, 5] and AI Safety [17]. Arguably, however, its most important application is due to its tight connection to correlated equilibria, introduced by Aumann [6], as it is well known that the time-average empirical distribution of play resulting from no-internal/swap regret algorithms is guaranteed to converge to the set of correlated equilibria $(\\mathrm{CE})^{1}$ , a (typically strict) relaxation of the predominant game theoretic solution concept of Nash equilibria. In contrast, no-regret algorithms only guarantee time-average convergence to the even more relaxed solution concept of coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) (see preliminary section for precise definitions). Interestingly, in the special case of zero-sum games, for almost all but pathological zero-measure instances of them, the notions of Nash equilibria and correlated equilibria coincide and are in fact unique (whereas CCE do not).

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "At a technical level, the result depends on two different arguments. First, even in the case of symmetric zero-sum games it is still possible to show that generically the correlated equilibria remain unique, however, the argument does not follow the analysis of general zero-sum games as symmetric cases are themselves non-generic within the larger class. Secondly, we leverage the symmetry of the trajectories to show that time-averaged convergence of symmetric action proflies to a product distribution implies the desired convergent behavior. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "This unexpected connection between swap regret minimization and symmetry in games inspires the investigation of other ways that symmetry can insert itself in the study of online learning itself. For example, it is well understood that most standard no-regret algorithms such as MWU, can be completely determined by the vector of cumulative rewards and thus their outputs remain invariant to any permutation of their history, i.e. they exhibit a strong type of time-symmetry. Interestingly, we show that such time-symmetry is provably at odds with swap regret minimization. At a technical level, this argument is based on a construction that couples the behavior of online learning dynamics to particular classes of card guessing games (e.g., [25]) that enable precise control over the algorithm\u2019s optimal expected utility (in particular, showing that the play of any such algorithm must be very close to the Follow-The-Leader algorithm, at least when averaged over certain segments of time).

By [29] a zero-sum game has a unique correlated equilibrium if and only if it has a unique Nash equilibrium, thus it suffices to prove the generic uniqueness of Nash equilibria. Let $A$ be the skew-symmetric ( $A^{\\top}=-A\\mathrm{)}$ ) payoff matrix corresponding to the symmetric zero-sum game. A Nash equilibrium is called quasi-strict (sometimes also referred to as regular or quasi-strong [34]) if for all agents deviations to strategies outside their support result in a strict decrease of their payoff. By Corollary 3.4 in [36] we have that in any two agent game if all equilibria are quasi-strict then the number of equilibria is finite. Thus, if a symmetric zero-sum game has multiple equilibria, this implies the existence of a non-quasi-strict equilibrium/optimal strategy. Let $x$ be that non-quasi-strict mixed strategy and let $S_{x}$ denote its support, i.e., the set of strategies played in $x$ with positive probability and let $i$ be the index of the strategy not in $S_{x}$ such that deviating to that strategy from the symmetric $(x,x)$ Nash equilibrium still results into payoff of zero (since the game value of any zero-sum symmetric game is zero). This implies that both antisymmetric sub-matrices of $A$ defined by its restrictions to the sets $S_{x}$ and $S_{x}\\cup i$ respectively have a zero eigenvalue where the corresponding eigenvector is the analogously restr i\u222acted subvector of $x$ . Thus, both of their determinants are equal to zero. However, at least one of them has even dimension. It is well known that the determinant of an even dimension skew-symmetric matrix is a non-trivial polynomial (and in fact is the square of a polynomial in its coefficients, see e.g. [39]). The entries of this submatrix correspond to the vanishing set of a non-trivial polynomial and therefore have Lebesgue measure zero.
