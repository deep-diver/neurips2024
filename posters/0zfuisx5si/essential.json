However, existing methods often struggle with data biases, particularly the under-representation of amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs). These biases lead to inaccurate sequencing results, hindering progress in understanding protein functions and disease mechanisms.\n\nAdaNovo is a novel framework that addresses these limitations by calculating the Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between mass spectra and amino acids. This approach helps to identify amino acids with PTMs by highlighting the importance of their mass shifts in the spectra. AdaNovo also uses a robust training approach based on CMI, improving the models' accuracy and reliability. Experiments showed that AdaNovo outperforms previous methods, achieving significant improvements in PTM identification and overall sequencing accuracy.", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "0zfUiSX5si/podcast.wav"}
