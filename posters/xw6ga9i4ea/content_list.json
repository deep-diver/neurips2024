In this paper, we present an innovative approach, named pFedClub, which addresses these challenges. pFedClub introduces personalized federated learning through the substitution of controllable neural network blocks/layers. Initially, pFedClub dissects heterogeneous client models into blocks and organizes them into functional groups on the server. Utilizing the designed CMSR (Controllable Model Searching and Reproduction) algorithm, pFedClub generates a range of personalized candidate models for each client. A model-matching technique is then applied to select the optimal personalized model, serving as a teacher model to guide each client\u2019s training process. We conducted extensive experiments across three datasets, examining both IID and non-IID settings.

To mitigate these privacy concerns, techniques such as distillation [20, 21, 22] and model reassembly [23] have been introduced in heterogeneous FL, wherein only model parameters are exchanged, akin to traditional FL approaches [1].

This approach ensures both the functionality of personalized models and their similarity to the original models. To enhance the diversity of the generated models, we permit arbitrary substitutions from the group for the first block (Step 1). For subsequent blocks, we introduce an order-constrained block search strategy (Step 2), ensuring the quality of the generated models. If the order constraint halts the substitution prematurely, the remaining blocks are directly added to the substituted ones (Step 3). This completion strategy not only reduces the number of newly added parameters in the stitching blocks but also ensures similar functionality. As pFedClub may generate multiple personalized candidate models for each client, we employ the similarity-based model-matching technique to select the personalized model, as discussed in Section 3.2.3.
