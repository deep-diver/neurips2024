Moreover, their analyses often fall prey to the 'curse of dimensionality'\u2014the difficulty in accurately approximating high-dimensional functions with limited data. These limitations hinder the understanding and advancement of few-shot diffusion models. \nThis work introduces the first theoretical analysis of few-shot diffusion models.  **It provides novel approximation and optimization bounds that show these models are significantly more efficient than previously thought, overcoming the curse of dimensionality.** The paper introduces a linear structure distribution assumption, and then using approximation and optimization perspectives, proves better bounds than existing methods.  A latent Gaussian special case is also considered, proving a closed-form minimizer exists. Real-world experiments validate the theoretical findings.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "JrraNaaZm5/podcast.wav"}
