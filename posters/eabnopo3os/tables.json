After each prediction, the weights are updated based on whether the prediction was correct.  Experts that consistently make inaccurate predictions will have their weights diminish over time, leading to a greater influence of more accurate experts in future predictions.", "section": "A.4 Proof of Lemma 22"}, {"figure_path": "EAbNopo3os/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1.

It shows which conditions (on concept classes and data processes) are necessary and sufficient for optimistic universal learnability under different scenarios (realizable and agnostic cases).", "section": "3 Examples"}]
