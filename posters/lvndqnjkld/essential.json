However, existing solutions often struggle with complex data structures or high dimensionality.  This is especially true for problems where data resides on non-Euclidean spaces known as Riemannian manifolds.  These manifolds capture geometric structures inherent in various types of data, such as images or graphs. Efficiently solving bilevel problems in these settings remains a challenge.\nThis research paper introduces a novel framework to tackle this challenge head-on. The authors developed intrinsic Riemannian hypergradient estimation strategies and a hypergradient descent algorithm, providing rigorous convergence and complexity analyses for both deterministic and stochastic settings. They demonstrated its effectiveness through diverse applications, including hyper-representation, meta-learning, and unsupervised domain adaptation, showcasing its practical impact across machine learning.", "affiliation": "RIKEN AIP", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LvNDqNJKlD/podcast.wav"}
