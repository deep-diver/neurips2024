Several effective neural network architectures have been proposed, such as Graph Attention Network (GAT) [2], Graph Convolution Network (GCN) [1], and GraphSAGE [3]. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in exploring transformer-based encoders for graph machine learning [41, 42, 31, 32].

Some methods represent graph structure information as text input to LLMs [9, 11, 12]; however, this approach often leads to suboptimal solutions [13]. Another paradigm involves using LLMs as enhancers [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], where they generate data or node text representations. Despite this, since GNNs are ultimately used for prediction, this approach significantly limits the model\u2019s transferability. Recently, considerable efforts have been made to utilize LLMs as predictors. For instance, GraphGPT [19] attempts to align LLMs with pre-trained Graph Transformer encoders through two-stage fine-tuning. However, the fine-tuning, conducted on specific datasets, might weaken the method\u2019s transferability. In light of this, LLaGA [20] introduced a novel encoding method that directly translates graph data into sequences compatible with LLMs. However, this approach may compromise performance due to the lack of GNN filtering and aggregation of graph information. Inspired by these challenges, we propose a pre-training strategy that enhances GNN transferability by aligning its representations with the token embeddings of LLMs, resulting in improved performance in zero-shot tasks. Notably, similar to our method, TEST [51] aligns time series representations with several selected LLM token embeddings. However, our approach differs in that we project graph representations into a feature space defined by the principal components of LLM token embeddings. This enables the LLM to function as a zero-shot learner for graph machine learning tasks, rather than just enhancing performance on specific, seen tasks.
