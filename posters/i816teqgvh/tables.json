Parameters shared if not specified.", "description": "This table presents the hyperparameters used for skill learning and task learning in the experiments.  It details settings for the skill policy, graph selection policy, learned dynamics model, and task skill selection policy.  Different algorithms (Rainbow, TD3, PPO, Adam) are used, with varying hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, network sizes, etc.) depending on the environment (Printer, Thawing, Cleaning Car, iGibson) and specific policy.", "section": "Implementation Details"}]
