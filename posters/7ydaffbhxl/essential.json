This gap between theory and practice needs to be addressed.  Most AIL algorithms use complex designs unsuitable for neural network approximation, presenting further challenges.  Existing theoretical works primarily focus on restricted settings, which are not reflective of current practice.\nThis paper introduces OPT-AIL, a new online AIL method using general function approximation that centers on online optimization of reward functions and Bellman error minimization for Q-value functions.  Theoretically, it achieves polynomial sample and interaction complexities for learning near-expert policies; practically, it's easier to implement due to only needing the approximate optimization of two objectives.  Empirical results show OPT-AIL outperforms previous deep AIL methods in various challenging tasks.", "affiliation": "Polixir.ai", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7YdafFbhxL/podcast.wav"}
