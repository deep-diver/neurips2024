Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) offers a promising solution but faces challenges.  Current training methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) struggle to converge accurately due to the inherent asymmetry and noise in analog devices, resulting in significant asymptotic errors. This paper addresses this critical limitation.\nThis paper offers a rigorous theoretical analysis of AIMC training. It shows why standard methods fail and proposes a new discrete-time mathematical model to more precisely capture the non-ideal dynamics. The authors then introduce Tiki-Taka, a novel training algorithm that cleverly mitigates the effects of asymmetry and noise, thus eliminating asymptotic errors and showing exact convergence.  This provides both a better theoretical understanding and a superior practical solution for training AI models on AIMC hardware.", "affiliation": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "5GwbKlBIIf/podcast.wav"}
