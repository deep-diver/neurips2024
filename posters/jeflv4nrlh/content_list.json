To better understand the underlying factors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a synthetic data generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input by modeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g., \u201cdesign\u201d) versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon (e.g., a \u201ccycle\u201d vs. a \u201cbomb\u201d). Using this, we investigate three well-known safety finetuning methods\u2014supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and unlearning\u2014and provide significant evidence demonstrating that these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafe inputs into its weights\u2019 null space. This yields a clustering of inputs based on whether the model deems them safe or not.

While pre-training enables a model to learn different capabilities (Wei et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023), instruction fine-tuning enables use of open-ended, generic inputs to control said capabilities (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Raffel et al., 2020). Since this pipeline does not restrict what tasks the model can be used for, potential misuse is left feasible under its purview (Bengio et al., 2023; Anwar et al., 2024): as long as an instruction can be formulated and the model possesses the relevant capabilities to perform the instructed task, it will strive to perform it. To prevent such misuse, safety fine-tuning is used as an additional training phase for LLMs, in which the model is supervised to prioritize generation of outputs deemed safe as per human preferences. Popular approaches for safety fine-tuning include: (i) supervised safety fine-tuning (SSFT) (Ouyang et al., 2022); (ii) reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020) and its recent renditions that avoid use of an explicit reward model, e.g., DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023); and (iii) machine unlearning (Liu et al., 2024). Despite immense use of these protocols to enable system release (Chao et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), several recent works show that safety fine-tuned models continue to produce unsafe generations when prompted via adversarially designed inputs, e.g., jailbreaks (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Chao et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2023).

A sequence of text tokens $\\tau$ is hence sampled by simply traversing through the PCFG tree, starting from the root node $\\gamma$ , propagating through non-terminal nodes $(N T)$ via production rules $(R)$ according to their associated probabilities $(P)$ , and terminating at the terminal nodes $(T)$ .

We next develop an abstraction for such preference data for studying the mechanisms of safety fine-tuning. Specifically, we note that an operator or operand, by itself, cannot determine whether an instruction is safe or unsafe. For example, consider the following strings: Design a bomb (s1), Design a cycle (s2), and Provide the history of bombs (s3), where s1 is deemed unsafe and s2, s3 are deemed safe. One can easily see that it is the contextual meaning an operator and an operand acquire from being part of the same string that renders the overall string unsafe. For example, the operator design when seen in the context of operand bomb renders the overall string s1 to be unsafe, but not so when seen in the context of operand cycle. Similarly, the string s3, despite having bomb as its operand, is likely to be deemed safe, since therein the operator is merely Provide history.

During pre-training, an LLM is supervised to predict the next token using a large amount of data scraped from web (Radford et al., 2019, 2018). This enables an LLM to learn various capabilities. In the instruction fine-tuning stage (Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020), the model is prompted by an instruction and supervised to output a predefined output for that specific instruction. However, due to the random sampling process of pre-training data from the internet, the instruction fine-tuned model can demonstrate unsafe capabilities as well. Therefore, as a last step, safety fine-tuning is performed to limit the capabilities of an LLM to yield unsafe outputs. For this purpose, data is gathered by having humans rank multiple outputs from the instruction fine-tuned LLM for a given prompt considering whether the output is safe or unsafe. Then, using this dataset, the LLM is commonly trained by one of the following four different protocols. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "1. Supervised safety fine-tuning (SSFT) (Ouyang et al., 2022) relies only on the highly ranked outputs, i.e., the safest ones. Thus, the aim here is to make the model safe by fine-tuning it to follow the safe instructions and generate safe output for unsafe samples.   \n2. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020). The instruction fine-tuned model is trained as a reward model to replicate the human preferences, by assigning high reward to human aligned generations and low for others. A copy of the instruction fine-tuned model is then treated as a \u201cpolicy\u201d and fine-tuned using the reward model as a proxy, where high reward is given when it generates human aligned generations.   \n3. Direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) also uses safe and unsafe outputs similar to RLHF, but differently does not require an additional reward model. Instead, the LLM is directly supervised to suppress unsafe outputs by the constructed objective function.   \n4. Unlearning (Liu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Goel et al., 2024; Lynch et al., 2024) has been commonly used to address privacy concerns, where the aim is to make the model forget certain data samples (Maini et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2022). However, in case of safety fine-tuning, the objective is to unlearn the capabilities responsible for generation of malicious and unsafe outputs. Given similar goals, unlearning has recently become popular as a protocol to perform safety fine-tuning (Liu et al.,   \n2024). This motivates us to investigate this fine-tuning protocol as well. We note that past works (Liu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Goel et al., 2024; Lynch et al., 2024) have used different objective functions to perform unlearning, however, in most of these cases, the loss functions include two contrasting losses: one enforces the model to retain its safe capabilities to generate coherent outputs, while the other loss aims to force the model to forget its unsafe capabilities. Given this characteristic, we adopt the loss function used in Liu et al. (2024). ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Understanding fine-tuning in LLMs. Fine-tuning is an exceedingly ubiquitous tool in the modern era of foundation models. Given this success of fine-tuning, it has become imperative to understand how it impacts the capabilities of pre-trained models. Recent works in this vein (Kotha et al., 2023; Tripuraneni et al., 2020; Neyshabur et al., 2021) show that fine-tuning works by re-weighting and transferring task relevant features to the downstream task. Relatedly, Jain et al. (2023b), Prakash et al. (2024), and Lubana et al. (2022) analyze the effect of fine-tuning in a more mechanistic manner, where they conclude that fine-tuning minimally alters the pre-trained mechanisms, rather than fundamentally changing them. Relatedly, Lee et al. (2024) analyze DPO and concluded that DPO makes the model learn to bypass the activations corresponding to toxic regions in its activation space. We believe that our observations discussed in App. C.1 implicitly indicate the span of activations in the toxic regions of activation space reduces with safety fine-tuning.

Adversarial attacks are generally easier to identify programmatically when compared to jailbreaks. However, optimizing a prompt using adversarial training is prone to end up generating gibberish tokens in the input space. Therefore, it is easy to detect such attacks by using simple pre-processing techniques like perplexity (Jain et al., 2023a). On the other hand, since jailbreaks are more natural and difficult to detect, they pose a bigger threat to safety of LLMs. Wei et al. (2023) characterize jailbreaks into two broad categories: (i) jailbreaks with mismatched generalization and (ii) jailbreaks with competing objectives.

For simplicity of analysis, in this work we consider uniform sampling. We provide a detailed description of the grammar rules considered, along with different task tokens corresponding to sets $\\mathcal{F}_{A}^{u}$ , $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{B}}^{u}$ , $\\mathcal{F}_{A}^{s}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{B}}^{s}$ , in Fig. A.8.

Thus, to force the model to learn to utilize the context, we utilize multiple different PCFGs (four in our experiments) such that different bijective mappings corresponds to the same task tokens across different PCFGs. For example, the task token \u2018(\u2019 in a PCFG might imply bijective mapping $f_{1}$ , whereas the same token might imply $f_{2}$ in another PCFG. Also, we ensure that the generated text tokens from each PCFG do not completely overlap. Thus, in order for the underlying model to perform well on this dataset, it has to learn the grammar corresponding to each PCFG which would require using context from previous text tokens. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now we will discuss some additional intricate design choices considered while designing this setup to imitate real world scenario as much as possible, which we could not discuss in the main paper due to space constraints. Through a single traversal from the PCFG tree during pre-training we generate a sample which is of length 50-75 tokens and later crop it by randomly selecting the starting and ending index of a window sampled randomly to be between $15-25$ . This generation is started from the root node of the PCFG tree (See Fig. A.8). However, during safety fine-tuning, we divide the non terminal nodes at level three into safe dominant $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ and unsafe dominant $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Omega}}_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ nodes. Using these nodes in sets $\\mathcal{A}$ or $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\rho}}_{\\perp}$ as the root node reduces the length of the generated sequence to between 15-25. Therefore, to ensure consistency between pre-training and safety fine-tuning, we crop $\\tau$ to contain between 15-25 text tokens during pre-training. We define different sets of task tokens being safe and unsafe with each of the sets $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ or $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\rho}}_{\\perp}$ : $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{N}}^{s}$ for safe and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{N}}^{u}$ for unsafe. We ensure that $|\\mathcal{F}_{B}^{u}|=8$ , $|\\mathcal{F}_{B}^{s}|=2$ $|\\mathcal{F}_{A}^{u}|=2$ , $|\\mathcal{F}_{A}^{s}|=8$ . Further $\\mathcal{F}_{A}^{u}\\subset\\mathcal{F}_{B}^{u}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{B}^{s}\\subset\\mathcal{F}_{A}^{s}$ . This helps in controlling how often a task token is associated with safe vs unsafe generations. The PCFG trees utilized in our analysis have a depth of 6 levels and this is selected based on the design choices considered in Allen-Zhu & Li (2023). Another reason for choosing this depth is that it ensures the length of the sequence generated to remain in the expected limit. To ensure simplicity of the safety fine-tuning task, for safety fine-tuning we only consider the grammar generated by the first PCFG. Further we choose the third level to divide the non-terminal nodes into the sets $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\rho}}_{\\perp}$ because it helps in generating a good enough sequence length, which could decrease significantly on increasing the levels or going down the tree. We did not choose level 2 because it would mean lesser number of non-terminal nodes are involved in determining if the sample is safe or unsafe. This would in tern make the safety fine-tuning task easier for the model. In order to balance this trade-off between the task complexity and the length of text tokens generated, choosing the third level suits the best.
