Existing LLM unlearning methods struggle with degenerated outputs and catastrophic forgetting, hindering their effectiveness. These methods often involve a combination of two objectives: maximizing loss on forget documents while minimizing loss on retain documents.  This approach faces challenges due to unbounded loss functions and under-representative retain data.\nThe proposed method, Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), tackles the problem from the opposite direction.  It trains an \"assistant LLM\" to remember the forget documents and forget retain documents.  The unlearned LLM is then derived by subtracting the assistant LLM's logits from the original LLM's logits.  This reversed approach overcomes the challenges of previous methods, significantly improving efficiency and retaining the LLM's overall capabilities.  Experimental results show that ULD efficiently achieves the intended forgetting with minimal loss of model utility, offering a superior approach to LLM unlearning.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "tYdR1lTWqh/podcast.wav"}
