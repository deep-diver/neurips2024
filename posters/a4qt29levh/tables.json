Realism can be improved through hard constraints or scaling.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of realism metrics for scene generation on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validation set.  Four different models are evaluated: the M/1 model (a medium-sized model), the M/1 model with generalized hard constraints (GHC) applied, the L/1 model (a large model), and an oracle model that perfectly matches the logged data distribution.  The metrics assess various aspects of realism, including linear and angular speed and acceleration, distances to objects and road edges, collision rates, and off-road occurrences.  The results show that the addition of hard constraints and increasing model scale can significantly enhance the realism of generated scenes.", "section": "4.2 Scene Generation"}, {"figure_path": "a4qT29Levh/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Distrib. realism metrics on WOSAC.

It compares the performance of the Amortized AR model (at 10Hz) against other state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, such as composite score, collision rate, and offroad rate.  The L/1 model indicates the large model with a patch size of 1. The table highlights that Amortized AR achieves a higher composite score, indicating better realism and fewer errors compared to its competitors while being more computationally efficient.", "section": "4.1 Simulation Rollout"}, {"figure_path": "a4qT29Levh/tables/tables_7_3.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Design analysis and ablation studies.", "description": "This table presents the results of ablation studies conducted on the SceneDiffuser model.  It shows the impact of removing specific components or features of the model on three key metrics: Composite Metric (overall performance), Collision Rate, and Offroad Rate.  The negative percentage changes indicate that the removal of ADALN-Zero, Spatial Attention, or Multitask learning resulted in a decrease in overall performance and increases in collision and offroad rates, suggesting these components are important for model effectiveness. Conversely, removing the 'Size, Type' features resulted in only a small improvement in performance, indicating that predicting both agent size and type might not significantly benefit the overall model performance.", "section": "4.3 Model Design Analysis and Ablation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "a4qT29Levh/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Per-component WOSAC metric results on the test split of WOMD, representing likelihoods.
