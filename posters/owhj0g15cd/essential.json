These issues lead to mis-calibrated reward models and inefficient use of human time and computational resources.  This limits the applicability of PBEMO methods to real-world scenarios.\nThis paper introduces D-PBEMO, a novel framework that tackles these issues directly. It uses a clustering-based stochastic dueling bandits algorithm, eliminating the need for a predefined reward model. This model-free approach learns preferences directly from pairwise comparisons, scaling efficiently to high-dimensional problems.  Furthermore, D-PBEMO incorporates a principled termination criterion to manage human cognitive load and computational cost.  Experiments show D-PBEMO's effectiveness, exceeding the performance of existing algorithms on diverse benchmark problems, including those involving RNA inverse design and protein structure prediction.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "owHj0G15cd/podcast.wav"}
