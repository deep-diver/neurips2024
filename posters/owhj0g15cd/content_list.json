The goal of MO is to assist human decision-makers (DMs) in identifying solutions of interest (SOI) that optimally reconcile these conflicting objectives according to their preferences. This field has been a subject of rigorous study within the multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) community [43] for more than half a century.

It queries the DM about their preferences to effectively recommend solutions. This closely aligns with preference learning in the machine learning community. There are three strategies to accomplish this. The first, as shown in Figure 1(b-1), involves reward models [51] or ranking mechanisms [29, 27, 38]. In this approach, DMs often provide scores or rankings for a large set of solutions. However, this overburdens the DM and risks introducing errors into the optimization process due to overlooked human cognitive limitations. The other two strategies are grounded in the dueling bandits settings [66], utilizing pairwise comparisons in consultation but with different assumptions about human feedback. Specifically, the second strategy relies on a parameterized transitivity model [5] or a structured utility function for dueling feedback, such as the Bradley-Terry-Luce model [11] in Figure 1(b-2). While theoretically appealing, this method faces a challenge in model selection that can be as complex as the original problem, posing difficulties in practical applications. Different from the previous two strategies, the last one tackles human feedback as stochastic events such as Bernoulli trials [63], and it learns DM\u2019s preferences from their feedback as shown in Figure 1(b-3). However, a key bottleneck here is the souring number of DM queries required when considering a population of solutions in PBEMO. \u2022 The preference elicitation module acts as a catalyst, transforming the preference information learned in the consultation module\u2014usually not directly applicable\u2014into a format usable in the underlying EMO algorithm. The stochastic nature of human feedback [1] can lead to a misuse of learned preferences that adversely disturb search processes. This issue is pronounced in PBEMO contexts, where the number of consultations is constrained to reduce the human cognitive burden. Additionally, there is no thumb rule for determining the frequency of DM interactions or terminating such interactions, where current methods are often heuristics (e.g., setting a fixed number of interactions [36]).

This observation can be attributed to the ineffectiveness of the traditional dueling bandit algorithms for tackling a large number of arms. In our PBEMO context, DTS requires at least thousands comparisons when encountering more than 100 candidate solutions. This is not feasible under the limited amount of computational budget.

The a posteriori methods first generates extensive efficient solutions through MO algorithms, then ask DM to select SOI from these solutions. In this way, DM is involved only when solution generation from the optimization module is finished, where the decision making process can be finished according to multi-criterion decision analysis [26] or certain SOI analysis [13, 6, 40]. However, the absence of DM\u2019s preferences in solution generation can paradoxically complicate pinpointing the SOI, and the sheer number of generated solutions can be cognitively overwhelming for DM to choose from. The a priori method, leverages pre-defined DM\u2019s preference to guide the search of SOI [7, 42, 57, 37]. In other words, the decision making happens before optimization. This is more related to offline preference learning such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [38]. However, given the black-box nature of real-world problems, eliciting reasonable preferences a priori can be controversial. [39, 54] pointed out that the a priori method may lead to disruptive preferences and result in faulty decisions. Moreover, elaborating the DM labeled dataset used for offline preference learning such as RLHF is also a difficult task. In contrast, the interactive method also known as preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization (PBEMO) [39] presents a valuable opportunity for the DM to gradually comprehend the underlying black-box system and consequently refine user preference information [44, 15, 8, 36, 59, 38].

In addition, as presented in [50], relative preference can only be leveraged by ranking on more than three candidates. However, providing reward or ranking on a bunch of solutions will not only increase the workload of DMs, but will also introduce uncertainty and randomness into optimization processes due to the limited capacity of DMs [48].

These algorithms can be traced back to 1982, when [32] introduced the UTA (UTilit\u00e9s Additives) method for deducing value functions based on a provided ranking of reference set. Following up work included [24] that employed pairwise preference to predict a ranking for potential labels associated with new training examples, [11] that utilized GP for pairwise preference learning (PGP) within a Bayesian framework, and [9] that proposed the ListNet which was an NN-based learning-to-rank method to model preference feedback. In addition, [29] extended the work in [9] to handle multi-user scenarios by introducing a weight vector for each user and combining multiple preference latent functions. More recently, [25] proposed a novel pairwise preference learning method using the concept of Bayesian optimization based on a structured surrogate model assumption, named preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO). Moreover, in [71], a comparative study towards four prominent preference elicitation algorithms was conducted, and results shown that ranking queries outperformed the pairwise and clustering approaches in terms of utility models ad human preference.

MergeRUCB, an extension of RUCB, is particularly designed for scenarios with a large number of arms. RCS combines UCB and Beta posterior distribution to recommend one arm for each duel in each iteration step.   \n\u2022 The third method employs Thompson sampling, as demonstrated by double Thompson sampling (DTS) [62] and MergeDTS [35].

Traditional Protein Data Bank files contain Cartesian coordinates of all atoms in a protein, often totaling over 1000 atoms for a modest 70-amino acid sequence. This abundance of coordinates renders Protein Backbone Exploration with EMO algorithms nearly impracticable. To mitigate this, protein structures are represented using torsion and dihedral angles, obtained by converting atom coordinates along consecutive bonds, effectively reducing the search space while retaining essential structural information. Protein backbones are primarily defined by three torsion angles: $\\Phi$ (around the $-N-C_{\\alpha}-$ bond), $\\Psi$ (around the $-C_{\\alpha}-C-$ bond), and $\\Omega$ (around the $-C-N-$ peptide bond). Additionally, each amino acid residue may feature varying numbers of sidechain torsion angles $(\\chi_{i},i\\in{1,2,3,4})$ ) depending on its structure. Despite this, the conformational search space remains extensive. To address this, secondary structures and backbone-independent rotamer libraries [21] are utilized to further constrain backbone and side-chain angles, respectively. These libraries also integrate biological insights from protein secondary structures. Moreover, this approach necessitates less optimization space compared to those relying on contact maps. For instance, reconstructing the main and side chains of a 50-amino acid sequence requires only $250-300$ angles using dihedral angles, whereas contact maps demand 2500 distances for the main chain alone.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
