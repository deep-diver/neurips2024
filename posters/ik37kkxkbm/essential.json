However, a theoretical understanding of how transformers generalize to unseen examples within a prompt is lacking.  Existing studies often require long prompts with sufficient examples to determine the underlying pattern.  This limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where prompts are often short and lack extensive query-answer pairs.\nThis paper tackles this challenge by analyzing the training dynamics of transformers using non-linear regression. It demonstrates that transformers can acquire contextual knowledge by learning template functions for each task.  **The researchers prove that under specific assumptions, the training loss converges linearly to the global minimum, even when the number of examples is insufficient to fully determine the underlying template**. This provides valuable insights into how transformers generalize beyond the seen examples, enhancing our comprehension of ICL.  **The findings reveal that transformers effectively perform ridge regression over basis functions, demonstrating a new level of understanding of contextual generalization in transformers.**", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "ik37kKxKBm/podcast.wav"}
