As sample gets vaguer, EDL tends to extract a minimal quantity of sharp evidence, results in elevated uncertainty estimation. HEDL demonstrates the capability to extract vague evidence as sample vagueness increases, thereby maintaining lower uncertainty levels.", "description": "This figure compares the belief and uncertainty masses produced by traditional Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) and the proposed Hyper-opinion Evidential Deep Learning (HEDL) methods for in-distribution (ID) samples with varying degrees of vagueness.  It shows that as the vagueness of the ID samples increases, EDL extracts less sharp evidence, leading to higher uncertainty. In contrast, HEDL effectively leverages vague evidence, resulting in lower uncertainty estimates even when dealing with ambiguous data points.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "Te8vI2wGTh/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Framework of HEDL. HEDL framework is composed of three integral components. The first part transfers the extracted features to evidence and models them with in hyper-opinion framework.
