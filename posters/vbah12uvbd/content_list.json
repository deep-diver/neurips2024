In Figure 2, we compare the resulting credal sets of different nonconformity functions for three specific instances.

To compare the prediction set size, aka efficiency, across different nonconformity functions, we discretize the simplex using a fine grid. The efficiency is gauged by considering the fraction of all distributions that lie within the predicted credal sets. We perform training, calibration, and testing using 10 different random seeds and depict the average coverage and efficiency results of each credal set predictor under different miscoverage rates $(\\alpha)$ in Figure 3.

The Inner method, on the other hand, tends to construct credal sets by incorporating corners (degenerate distributions), thereby setting the lower entropy to zero.

Another unintended behavior observed in the TV, KL, and WS approaches is that low epistemic uncertainty coincides solely with high aleatoric uncertainty. This issue arises mainly from the lack of adaptivity in the credal sets constructed by first-order predictors.

Besides, for our generalization to the case of imprecise first-order data, practical implementation depends on a meaningful choice of the hyperparameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ to ensure inference that is both valid and efficient. When labels are based on relative frequencies (as in the case of multiple annotators), classical statistical methods might apply. However, determining an appropriate choice of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ for broader practical problems remains an open issue. Another challenge lies in representing credal sets as subsets of the probability simplex. Although the credal sets can always be precisely described by equation (10), for the nonconformity functions used in this work, there are no closed-form equations for the resulting credal sets. Instead, the sets are represented implicitly through the nonconformity threshold. Numerical approximation is feasible but generally limited to scenarios with a small number of classes.

While tackling classification tasks, our method for constructing conformal credal sets has more similarity with conformal regression [37, 45], particularly in multivariate settings [17], as we essentially conformalize the simplex space of categorical distributions. Our nonconformity scores differ, however, in that they are specific for distributions rather than considering general multivariate spaces.
