It shows the data flow, starting from the input smoke image, through a feature extractor, to pixel-prototype matching in the embedding space.  The core of the method involves calculating a regularized within-prototype entropy and deriving conditional sample weights. These weights are then used to calculate a weighted loss function which helps train a robust model resistant to noise in the labels.  The diagram clearly displays the process of how noisy labels are given low weight, while clean pixels are given higher weight during training, leading to a more accurate segmentation model.  Prototypes are updated using the sample weights to improve performance.", "section": "4 CoSW for Smoke Segmentation"}, {"figure_path": "RRRyQMn6dv/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Regularized prototype update", "description": "This figure illustrates the impact of conditional sample weighting (CoSW) on prototype updates in the presence of noisy labels.

In contrast, panel (b) demonstrates that with CoSW, the prototype update is more stable, better maintaining its original position.
