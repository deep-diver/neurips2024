It shows the two main stages: a language modeling stage (Stage I) and a diffusion stage (Stage II). Stage I utilizes a dual-sequence language model (DSLM) to process lyrics and optional conditional signals (vocal prompt, accompaniment prompt, pre-determined vocal/accompaniment track) to generate semantic tokens for vocals and accompaniment.  These tokens represent high-level musical information. Stage II employs a U-Net-based latent diffusion model to convert the semantic tokens into actual audio signals (song, vocals, and accompaniment).  The BEST-RQ module acts as a bridge between these two stages, translating raw audio into semantic tokens and vice versa.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "GlD9Juva5V/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overview of DSLM with the attention mask strategies. The DSLM can utilize specific attention mask strategy to achieve different song generation tasks. We illustrate multiple attention mask strategies of what each vocal token's representation attend to in both self-attention and bidirectional cross-attention. Attention mask strategies in the accompaniment decoder are similar.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the Dual-Sequence Language Model (DSLM) which is a core component of SongCreator.  The DSLM consists of three decoders: one for vocals, one for accompaniment, and one for the complete song.  Each decoder utilizes self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Notably, a bidirectional cross-attention (BCA) layer allows interaction between the vocal and accompaniment decoders, enabling a more harmoniously coordinated output.  The figure highlights various attention mask strategies used for different song generation tasks (lyrics-to-song, vocals-to-song, accompaniment-to-song, song editing, etc.).  These attention masks control information flow within and between the decoders, adapting DSLM for various song-related tasks.", "section": "3.2 Dual-sequence language model"}, {"figure_path": "GlD9Juva5V/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Results of the AB preference test between SongCreator and the model without using BCA.", "description": "The figure shows the results of an A/B preference test comparing SongCreator's performance to a version of the model without the Bidirectional Cross-Attention (BCA) layer.

The test was conducted across three tasks: lyrics-to-song, vocals-to-song, and accompaniment-to-song. The results demonstrate a significant performance decrease in all three tasks when the non-causal mask was removed, especially for the vocals-to-song task.
