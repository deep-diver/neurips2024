While significant efforts have been made in this field, most were focused on mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue to achieve better classification ability, at the cost of a much heavier training workload. They overlooked that in real-world scenarios, e.g., in high-speed data stream environments, data do not pause to accommodate slow models. In this paper, we emphasize that model throughput\u2013 defined as the maximum number of training samples that a model can process within a unit of time \u2013 is equally important. It directly limits how much data a model can utilize and presents a challenging dilemma for current methods. With this understanding, we revisit key challenges in OCL from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, highlighting two critical issues beyond the well-documented catastrophic forgetting: (i) Model\u2019s ignorance: the single-pass nature of OCL challenges models to learn effective features within constrained training time and storage capacity, leading to a trade-off between effective learning and model throughput; (ii) Model\u2019s myopia: the local learning nature of OCL on the current task leads the model to adopt overly simplified, task-specific features and excessively sparse classifier, resulting in the gap between the optimal solution for the current task and the global objective. To tackle these issues, we propose the Non-sparse Classifier Evolution framework (NsCE) to facilitate effective global discriminative feature learning with minimal time cost. NsCE integrates non-sparse maximum separation regularization and targeted experience replay techniques with the help of pre-trained models, enabling rapid acquisition of new globally discriminative features.

Existing OCL methods are designed to promote effective learning by mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving model plasticity through various techniques like gradient regularization[41], contrastive learning[31], experience replay[16, 10] and knowledge distillation[1].

Furthermore, maintaining a real-time accessible memory buffer, as required by current OCL methods, also proves challenging in real-world applications[38, 42]. Under these practical concerns, a reexamination of the challenges in OCL from both empirical and theoretical perspectives is in urgent need. In this paper, we reveal that model\u2019s ignorance caused by single pass nature of data streams and model\u2019s myopia resulting from the continuous arrival of tasks may be more impactful than the well-documented catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.

Even if models can quickly achieve decent performance on individual tasks, performance degradation remains a persistent issue for existing OCL models. Previous studies often attribute this to the model forgetting previously learned information. But in this paper, we propose a different perspective. We observed that, in OCL training, the model initially acquires perfect classification accuracy for a specific class, e.g., \"car\". However, there arrives a critical moment when the model becomes completely confused, mistakenly identifying a \"car\" as a newly introduced class (e.g., \"truck\"). We believe this confusion cannot solely be attributed to the model forgetting previous learned knowledge, as the forgetting process should be gradual rather than abrupt. Besides, as training progresses, the parameters in the final layer of the model\u2019s classifier become increasingly sparse. The emergence of such an excessively sparse classifier causes the model to focus on few discriminative features specialized for the current task. When the model is exposed to only a limited range of categories, this narrow focus on the current task restricts its capability to acquire features with broader discriminative power.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide theoretical insights into the relationship between model throughput and performance in this area.

As a regularization applied uniformly across tasks, it helps to minimize the differences in the distributions of model parameters between tasks. Furthermore, to enhance the model\u2019s throughput and diminish the reliance on a real-time memory buffer, we propose an efficient selective replay mechanism. By selectively replaying past experiences, we specifically target data from classes that the model frequently misidentifies and implement the targeted binary classification tasks on them during experience replay.

We compare our NsCE method 8 replay based methods and 5 regularization based ones. To more effectively assess model performance over time, we employ $A_{A U C}$ as the primary metrics.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our method by comparing its performance with several existing state-of-the-art OCL methods as well as various continual learning variants. Table1 displays the $A_{A U C}$ (area under the accuracy curve) for three synthetic benchmark datasets, showcasing the impact of different memory buffer sizes and replay frequencies. This evaluation metric offers a more comprehensive assessment compared to the commonly used average accuracy[43]. The results demonstrate that our proposed method, NsCE, consistently outperforms other approaches. Notably, the performance improvement achieved by NsCE is particularly significant when the memory buffer size is relatively small and the number of memory buffer access times is very limited. This finding highlights that the proposed framework helps prevent the model from excessively focusing on the current task which is crucial when memory capacity or access frequency are constrained. Plus, we also evaluate NsCE on real-world domain incremental datasets largescale image classification dataset. It allows us to assess the performance and generalizability of our approach in real-world scenarios, where the challenges and characteristics may differ. Table2 demonstrates that NsCE can also enhance the performance in real-world domain incremental settings and complex data streams. More experimental results including model\u2019s last time accuracy, sensitivity analysis and evaluation on model throughput are provided in C.2. Moreover, we visualize the predictions of our proposed NsCE in Figure5.

We believe that when ACE and AML nudge the learned representations to be more robust to new future classes, they indirectly decrease the sparsity of the model parameters. For GSA[32], the sparsity is not affected.

Continual learning is a research field dedicated to learning continuously while mitigating the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge[54, 52, 27, 52, 27, 63]. Most continual learning approaches employ three types of techniques. Regularization-based approaches introduce regularization terms or constraints to the learning process to preserve previously learned knowledge[41, 75, 3, 25]. Memory-based approaches utilize external memory buffers or replay mechanisms to store and replay past data, allowing the model to retain access to previous experiences[33, 82, 15, 16, 60, 65]. Architecture-based approaches involve modifying the model architecture to facilitate continual learning[61, 73, 50, 40].

Unlike traditional batch learning, where the entire dataset for each task is available upfront, OCL operates in scenarios where data distributions dynamically change over time. In OCL, similar to memory-based approaches in CL, most methods leverage a real-time accessible memory buffer and employ various experience replay methods to mitigate the issue of forgetting[15, 16, 4, 6, 60, 5, 19, 14, 58, 21, 62, 67, 11]. Besides, other OCL methods aim to improve the learning of better features and classifiers in a single-pass training manner[58]. Techniques like contrastive learning[49, 13], mutual information maximization[29, 31], and prototype learning[82, 68] have been employed to enhance the discriminative abilities of the model and improve its performance. Moreover, there are other works that focus a more proper evaluation of existing algorithms[43, 28].

Meanwhile, it is possibly the largest term in the divergence term $D$ . This emphasizes the significance of a good initialization and pre-trained model in achieving favorable results. Furthermore, by examining LemmaB.5, we can observe that the derived bound deteriorates as the number of tasks $T$ increases.

Indeed, considering the performance of the model at each time step can be seen as a compromise that aligns the generalization gap with a notion of regret. Compared with the regret bound provided in [34], the deteriorated convergence rate is mainly caused by the fact that at each time step we don\u2019t have an access to all the past data to predict the future as the projected Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm. In summary, this is just a simple and natural extension of [8] in the context of OCL.

First, it is important to clarify that the bound discussed is specifically used to illustrate the generalization risk associated with each individual task, rather than representing a global risk. This limitation means that our current theoretical analysis can not extend to data streams composed of disjoint tasks. Despite this constraint, we believe that it does not detract from the main findings presented in the core sections (model\u2019s ignorance and myopia) of our paper. Minimizing the distribution divergence across tasks remains one of the most fundamental concepts in OCL, despite our theoretical results can not fully reflect the beneftis of mitigating model\u2019s forgetting or myopia. Part of the reason is that such a sum of risk is easier to account for the problem of the trade-off between effective learning and model throughput. On the other hand, it is actually extremely challenging to directly establish the relationship between the expected risk of the posterior distribution $Q_{t}$ and the empirical losses of the entire training process.

Before delving into the specifics experimental results, it is essential to highlight a significant distinction in the utilization of memory buffers between this paper and other works.

However, in this work, we impose limitations on the number of requests allowed to retrieve data from the memory buffer. Furthermore, we will assess the time and storage overhead incurred by any additional computations, including data augmentation, knowledge distillation, and gradient calculations. For our experiments, we employ three distinct memory sizes along with their corresponding experience replay frequencies, as presented in each respective table. In contrast to existing replay-based methods that sample a small batch of data from the memory buffer at every training iteration, we evaluate the performance of OCL methods under the assumption that they only have access to the memory buffer every 10, 50, 100 or 500 training iterations.

The potential reason for this improvement may be that when NsCE Lite encounters simpler datasets, despite constraining the sparseness of the classifier parameters with the dataset, model\u2019s myopia caused by intensified parameter sparsity exists not only in the classifier but also in the feature extraction process. This becomes especially apparent when the model acquires highly separable features.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.   \n(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).   \n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
