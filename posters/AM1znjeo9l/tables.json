It presents the distributions for both single-layer and two-layer networks, distinguishing between cases with and without weight decay, and considering both interpolation (y = kx) and non-interpolation scenarios. The formulas show how the distribution depends on various parameters (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b3, k, T), including the learning rate (T) and whether the data follows a linear relationship (interpolation). Some factors are omitted for brevity.", "section": "4.1 Depth-0 Case"}]
