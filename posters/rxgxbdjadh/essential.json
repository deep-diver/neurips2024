Malicious actors could exploit these systems for attacks by introducing backdoors that trigger unwanted behavior.  Current research overlooks this critical security concern, focusing primarily on improving navigation performance.\nThis paper addresses this gap by introducing the concept of object-aware backdoors in VLN.  The authors propose a novel paradigm called IPR Backdoor that leverages imitation, pre-training, and reinforcement learning to implant these backdoors effectively. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method across various VLN agents in both physical and digital environments, showcasing its robustness to visual and textual variations while maintaining excellent navigation performance. This work is significant for highlighting a critical security flaw in VLN and providing a comprehensive approach to address it.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "rXGxbDJadh/podcast.wav"}
