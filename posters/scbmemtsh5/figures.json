Specifically, over each 2D Gaussian distribution representing the 3D scene, we first introduce it with a new attribute Ccurve \u2208 R4M\u00d72 (represented by the red and purple points in (a)). Here we set M = 2. After that, given a viewpoint, as shown in (b), we project both the Gaussian distribution and the points stored in Ccurve onto the image plane corresponding to the viewpoint. Finally, leveraging the modified a-blending function in Eq. 6, we can perform discontinuity-aware rendering and render only the part of the Gaussian distribution masked with the dotted lines in (c).
