While Judea Pearl\u2019s influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of natural counterfactuals and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a \u201cnaturalness\u201d criterion.

For AI systems to achieve human-like abilities of reflection and decision-making, incorporating counterfactual reasoning is crucial. Judea Pearl\u2019s structural approach to counterfactual modeling and reasoning [26] has been especially influential in recent decades. Within this framework, counterfactuals are conceptualized as being generated by surgical interventions on the variables to be changed, while leaving its causally upstream variables intact and all downstream causal mechanisms invariant. These counterfactuals are thoroughly nonbacktracking in that the desired change is supposed to happen without tracing back to changes in causally preceding variables. Reasoning about these counterfactuals can yield valuable insights into the consequences of hypothetical actions. Consider a scenario: a sudden brake of a high-speed bus caused Tom to fall and injure Jerry. Non-backtracking counterfactuals would tell us that if Tom had stood still (despite the sudden braking), then Jerry would not have been injured. Pearl\u2019s approach supplies a principled machinery to reason about conditionals of this sort, which are usually useful for explanation, planning, and responsibility allocation. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, such surgical interventions are sometimes so removed from what are or can be observed that it is difficult or even impossible to learn from data the consequences of such interventions. In the previous example, preventing Tom\u2019s fall in a sudden braking scenario requires defying mechanisms that are difficult or even physically impossible to disrupt. As a result, there are likely to be no data points in the reservoir of observed scenarios that are consistent with a person standing still during a sudden braking. If so, it can be very challenging to learn to generate such a counterfactual from the available data, as we will demonstrate in our experiments.2 ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this paper, we introduce a notion of \u201cnatural counterfactuals\u201d to address the above issue with non-backtracking counterfactuals. Our notion will allow a certain amount of backtracking, to keep the counterfactual scenario \u201cnatural\u201d with respect to the available observations. For example, rather than the unrealistic scenario where Tom does not fall at a sudden bus stop, a more natural counterfactual scenario to realize the change to not-falling would involve changing at the same time some causally preceding events, such as changing the sudden braking to gradually slowing down. On the other hand, our notion also constrains the extent of backtracking; in addition to a naturalness criterion, we formulate an optimization scheme to encourage minimizing backtracking while meeting the naturalness criterion.

This issue becomes particularly pronounced when non-parametric models are employed, as they often struggle to generalize to unseen, out-of-distribution data [31]. The risk of relying on such counterfactuals is thus substantial, especially in high-stake applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. In contrast, our approach amounts to searching for feasible changes that keep generated counterfactuals within its original distribution, employing backtracking when needed. This strategy effectively reduces the risk of inaccurate predictions and ensures more reliable results.

Second, we appeal to backtracking when and only when it is necessary to avoid infeasible interventions, and need to develop an optimization framework to realize this strategy. To be clear, our aim is not to propose a uniquely correct semantics for counterfactuals or to show that our notion of counterfactuals is superior to others for all purposes. Rather, our goal is to develop a notion of counterfactual that is theoretically well-motivated and practically useful in some contexts and for certain purposes. There may in the end be a general semantics to unify fruitfully our notion and other notions of counterfactual in the literature, but we will not attempt that in this paper.

Backtracking in counterfactual reasoning has drawn plenty of attention in philosophy [14], psychology [9], and cognitive science [12]. [14] proposes a theory that is in spirit similar to ours, in which backtracking is allowed but limited by some requirement of matching as much causal upstream as possible. [12] shows that people use both backtracking and non-backtracking counterfactuals in practice and tend to use backtracking counterfactuals when explicitly required to explain causes for the supposed change in a counterfactual. [35] is the first work, as far as we know, to formally introduce backtracking counterfactuals in the framework of structural causal models. The main differences between this work and ours are that [35] requires \u201cfull\u201d backtracking given a causal model, all the way back to exogenous noise terms, and measures closeness in terms of these noise terms, whereas we limit backtracking to what is needed to render the counterfactual \u201cnatural\u201d, and the measure of closeness in our framework can be defined directly on endogenous, observed variables, which is arguably desirable because changes to the unobserved variables are by definition outside of our control and not actionable.
