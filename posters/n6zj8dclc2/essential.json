This limits their applicability and usefulness. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing \"natural counterfactuals\", which incorporates a controlled amount of backtracking to find more realistic scenarios while prioritizing the least amount of changes needed. This approach involves a novel optimization that balances backtracking and naturalness. \nThe proposed method utilizes an optimization framework that balances backtracking with a 'naturalness' criterion. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that natural counterfactuals significantly reduce prediction errors compared to existing approaches, showcasing their ability to learn more effectively from real-world data and provide more reliable insights in various application scenarios.  The framework is especially beneficial in high-stake applications involving machine learning. **The improved feasibility of generated counterfactuals enhances the reliability of predictions and the usefulness of the method in practical settings.**", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "N6zJ8DclC2/podcast.wav"}
