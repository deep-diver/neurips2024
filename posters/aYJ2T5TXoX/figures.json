Example 3.1.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of generalizability in experimental studies using the example of a checkmate-in-one task. Two empirical studies are shown, each evaluating three Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task.  The first study uses positions pos5, pos7, and pos8 and the second uses pos3, pos4, and pos6.  The red dashed lines indicate the results of the first study, while the blue dashed lines indicate the results of the second study. The central question is whether the results from these two studies are \"similar\", which directly relates to the concept of generalizability of the experimental study.", "section": "3 Experiments and experimental studies"}, {"figure_path": "aYJ2T5TXoX/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Predicted n* for categorical encoders.", "description": "This figure shows the predicted number of experiments (n*) needed to obtain generalizable results for categorical encoders, as a function of the desired generalizability (\u03b1*) and similarity threshold (\u03b4*).  The boxplots represent the distribution of n* across different choices of design factors (model, tuning strategy, and quality metric), highlighting the influence of these factors on the required number of experiments.

The box plots represent the distribution of n* for various combinations of design factors (model, tuning strategy, quality metric).

The plots compare the relative error (|n* - n0|/n0) for different goals (g1, g2, g3) across various values of N, both for categorical encoders and LLMs.  The boxplots visually represent the distribution of relative errors across different design factor combinations for each goal.
