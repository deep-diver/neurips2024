Existing causal representation learning (CRL) methods offer identifiability guarantees, but lack scalability; conversely, dynamical system methods are scalable but lack identifiability. This creates a critical need for methods that combine both strengths.\nThis research proposes a novel framework to address these limitations by bridging causal representation learning and dynamical systems.  It demonstrates how parameter estimation problems in dynamical systems can be reformulated as latent variable identification problems in CRL. The proposed framework leverages scalable solvers for differential equations to build identifiable and practical models, allowing for out-of-distribution classification and treatment effect estimation. The efficacy of this approach is validated through experiments using a wind simulator and real-world climate data.", "affiliation": "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MWHRxKz4mq/podcast.wav"}
