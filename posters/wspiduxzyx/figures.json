More generally, a foundation model trained on different kinds of PDEs can learn representations across multiple domains and then transfer them to new problems. Such foundation models have found immense success in computer vision and natural language processing [5, 6]. Foundation models are first trained in a self-supervised manner on large and often unlabeled datasets.
