Existing methods often use complex, step-by-step network architectures which overlook the intrinsic collaboration between spatio-temporal information. This limits the quality and efficiency of image reconstruction.\n\nThis paper introduces STIR, an efficient network that jointly performs inter-frame alignment and intra-frame filtering.  **STIR utilizes a hybrid spike embedding representation and a symmetric interactive attention block**, improving interaction between spatio-temporal features. Experiments show that STIR outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency while maintaining low model complexity, paving the way for real-world high-speed imaging applications.
