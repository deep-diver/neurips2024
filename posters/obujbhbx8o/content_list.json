However, this approach has been found to underperform on certain groups of data [4, 15, 11] due to the prevalence of spurious correlations within training datasets [31, 38, 39]. Spurious correlations refer to the strong correlations between target labels and easy-to-learn attributes (i.e., bias attributes), which are present in a majority of the training examples. ERM-trained models often rely on these bias attributes [12], leading to biased predictions and poor generalization on minority groups where spurious correlations are absent. For example, consider the cow/camel classification task illustrated in Figure 1. A majority of camel images feature desert backgrounds, while a majority of cow images feature pasture backgrounds. Models trained via ERM might learn to recognize animals based on their backgrounds\u2014desert for camels and pasture for cows\u2014rather than on their distinctive features.

Numerous studies have initially relied on the assumption that bias attributes are given in the training dataset [38, 18, 24, 35]. However, annotating bias attributes is labor-intensive and expensive, rendering methods dependent on such annotations impractical. Consequently, research has shifted towards developing debiasing techniques that do not require bias labels during training [34, 27, 1, 29, 28, 49]. In this line of research, samples with spurious correlations are called bias-aligned samples, whereas those lacking such correlations are termed bias-conflicting samples [34, 27, 23]. In the absence of explicit bias labels, many existing methods focus on identifying bias-conflicting samples and employ strategies such as upweighting or upsampling these samples to counteract the negative impacts of spurious correlations [34, 28, 1].

Specifically, our debiasing objective is built on two groups: the bias-aligned group and the bias-conflicting group, each consisting of bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples, respectively. This objective encourages the model to perform equally well across both groups. The key insight behind the objective is that models relying on spurious correlations exhibit worse performance on the bias-conflicting group compared to the bias-aligned group, whereas models that do not rely on spurious correlations should exhibit strong performance across both groups. Then, under a simple condition, we derive an objective function as a weighted loss, with weights proportional to the bias-confilcting probability for each training example. Since we consider cases where bias labels are not provided, we use the disagreement probability between the target label and the prediction of an intentionally biased model as a substitute for the bias-confilcting probability.

Numerous previous works utilize bias labels for debiasing [38, 48, 18, 3, 44, 53]. For example, Group DRO [38] employs bias labels to define groups and directly enhances worst-group accuracy to mitigate the effect of spurious correlations; meanwhile, LISA [48] mixes two samples with the same label but different domains, or with different labels but the same domain, canceling out spurious correlations and learning invariant predictors. These methods have demonstrated their effectiveness across multiple benchmarks with spurious correlations. However, annotating bias labels for each training example is labor-intensive, and obtaining such labels can sometimes be challenging due to privacy concerns as well [51]. Consequently, in more recent studies, some researchers have utilized only a small set of bias-annotated data to reduce reliance on bias labels [24, 35, 19]. For example, DFR [24] uses a small group-balanced dataset with bias labels to retrain the last layer of the ERM-trained model.

Given the unavailability of bias labels, these methods commonly employ a two-stage strategy: (1) identifying bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples, and (2) training the debiased model by leveraging information obtained from (1). The identification of bias-conflicting samples is accomplished through the use of a deliberately biased model, trained either with generalized cross-entropy loss [34, 22, 27, 1, 29] or standard cross-entropy loss [28, 49, 45]. For instance, LfF [34] and DFA [27] regard samples as bias-conflicting samples if the biased model exhibits higher cross-entropy losses on these samples compared to the debiased model. Subsequent efforts then focus on enhancing classification accuracy for these identified bias-conflicting samples.

This method is derived from a novel training objective designed to achieve consistent performance across both bias-aligned and bias-conflicting groups. It does not rely on bias annotations and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across spurious correlation benchmarks. However, DPR has certain limitations: its effectiveness depends on how well the biased model captures the spurious correlation structure, as it uses the predictions of this model to infer the group to which each training sample belongs. Moreover, DPR employs a two-stage approach that complicates the training process and introduces additional hyperparameters. Despite these limitations, DPR\u2019s simple implementation and strong performance, supported by theoretical analysis illustrating its ability to reduce loss disparity between groups and minimize average loss, underscore its usefulness in mitigating reliance on spurious correlations.
