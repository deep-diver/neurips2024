A core challenge is balancing privacy preservation and model accuracy.  Existing methods, particularly Poisson subsampling, struggle with memory efficiency and tight privacy guarantees.  The variable-sized minibatches in these methods pose practical problems when training on resource-constrained devices or handling datasets of massive size.\nThis research introduces a novel R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant for DP-SGD using fixed-size minibatches with and without replacement.  This approach provides tighter privacy guarantees by considering both add/remove and replace-one adjacency relationships.  The authors demonstrate that fixed-size subsampling, particularly without replacement, often outperforms Poisson subsampling due to its constant memory usage and comparable privacy levels.", "affiliation": "Texas State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "TJsknGasMy/podcast.wav"}
