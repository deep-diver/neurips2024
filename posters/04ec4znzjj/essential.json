Existing efficiency improvements like linear attention mostly focus on optimizing self-attention, neglecting the equally computationally expensive fully-connected layers. This limits the potential scaling of LLMs and increases their overall energy consumption.\n\nMemoryFormer tackles this issue head-on.  It introduces a novel memory layer that replaces fully-connected layers with a memory-efficient hashing-based approach.  Instead of computationally expensive matrix multiplications, the model retrieves relevant vectors from pre-computed lookup tables, dramatically reducing FLOPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate MemoryFormer achieves comparable performance to traditional transformers with significantly lower computational requirements, showing its potential for building more efficient and scalable LLMs.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "04EC4ZnZJj/podcast.wav"}
