This limits their practical value, as attackers typically have limited knowledge about a target system's specifics. The lack of realistic adversarial models makes it difficult to effectively assess and enhance the robustness of NIDS.\nThis paper introduces DiffuPac, a novel adversarial packet generation model. DiffuPac cleverly combines a pre-trained BERT model with a diffusion model to generate adversarial packets. This approach allows the system to understand the context of network traffic, creating more realistic and effective adversarial packets that evade detection. **DiffuPac significantly outperforms existing methods** across various attack types and multiple classifiers, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world setting. The classifier-free nature of this method also makes it particularly relevant for testing the robustness of NIDS.", "affiliation": "Nagaoka University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "KYHVBsEHuC/podcast.wav"}
