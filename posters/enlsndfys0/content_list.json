Many of these methods focus on object-centric diffusion, utilizing textual descriptions to manipulate objects within images through operations like composition [58], addition [36; 15], removal [63], replacement [7], movement [29], and adjustments in size, shape, action, and pose [17]. In contrast, we study an object synthesis task that creates a new object image by combining an object text with an object image.

On the left side of Fig. 2, when inputting an axolotl (image) and a toucan (text), SDXL-Turbo only generates an image of a toucan, showing a bias towards the toucan text (green circles). Conversely, when inputting a rooster (image) and an iron (text), it produces an image of a rooster, which closely resembles the original rooster image (orange circles).

To mitigate the image degeneration, Plug-and-Play [61] can inject the guidance image features into self-attention. Unfortunately, even with the application of the best inversion editing method, PnPinv [27], which incorporates the plug-and-play inversion into diffusion-based editing methods for improved performance, we still observe similar imbalances, as shown on the right-side of Fig. 2.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
