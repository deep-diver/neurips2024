These methods struggle to balance strong reconstruction power with compact ID data representation, leading to ineffective OOD identification.  Existing generative models often rely on pixel-level reconstruction, consuming significant time and resources. \nThe proposed method tackles these issues by using a diffusion model for layer-wise semantic feature reconstruction.  This approach leverages the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID and OOD samples in the latent feature space, achieving a comprehensive and discriminative representation. The multi-layer strategy ensures compact ID representation while effectively separating OOD samples.  Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showcasing enhanced accuracy and speed compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "Xidian University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Out-of-Distribution Detection"}, "podcast_path": "3m5ndUNQYt/podcast.wav"}
