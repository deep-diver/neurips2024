Among ECOCs, the one-hot code has become the default choice in modern deep neural networks (DNNs) due to its simplicity in decision making. However, it suffers from a significant limitation in its ability to achieve high robust accuracy, particularly in the presence of weight-errors. While recent studies have experimentally demonstrated that the non-one-hot ECOCs with multi-bits error correction ability, could be a better solution, there is a notable absence of theoretical foundations that can elucidate the relationship between codeword design, weighterror magnitude, and network characteristics, so as to provide robustness guarantees. This work is positioned to bridge this gap through the lens of neural tangent kernel (NTK). We have two important theoretical findings: 1) In clean models (without weight-errors), utilizing one-hot code and non-one-hot ECOC is akin to altering decoding metrics from $l_{2}$ distance to Mahalanobis distance. 2) There exists a threshold, determined by the normalized distance among codewords, the DNN architecture, and the scale of weight-errors. If the distance between a clean output (without weight-errors) and its nearest codewords is smaller than this threshold, then the DNN can make predictions as if it is free of weight-errors. Based on these findings, we further demonstrate how to practically use them to identify optimal ECOCs for simple tasks (small number of classes) and complex tasks (large number of classes), by balancing the code orthogonality (as per finding 1) and code distance (as per finding 2). Extensive experimental results across four datasets and four DNN models validate the superior performance of constructed codes, guided by our findings, compared to existing ECOCs. To our best knowledge, this is the first work providing theoretical explanations for the effectiveness of ECOCs and offers associated design guidance for optimal ECOCs specifically tailored to DNNs.

As deep neural networks (DNNs) are ever-increasingly popular in machine learning, one-hot code, as a special ECOC providing one bit protection, has been most widely adopted in the output layer of modern DNNs due to its simplicity in decision making and decent generalization performance. However, it experiences notable accuracy degradation in the presence of weight errors, such as those originating from hardware defects in non-volatile compute-in-memory (NVCiM) DNN accelerators [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

While these studies demonstrate that ECOCs with stronger error correction capability, can outperform one-hot codes to some extent through experiments, they often directly apply existing ECOCs to DNNs, with no explicit code design optimization tailored to modern DNNs. In this regard, there lacks a systematic theoretical study to answer the following key questions: 1) What is the mechanism behind ECOC\u2019s efficacy in DNNs? 2) How effective can ECOC be? 3) How optimal ECOCs tailored for DNNs can be designed principally? To bridge this gap and provide insights to code construction, in this work, we overcome the challenges of characterizing the connection between the actual DNN performance and the application of ECOCs, and answer these questions rigorously based on novel theoretical proof. For the first question, the prevailing intuition in existing research, which suggests that enlarging the distance among codewords enhances robustness, is somewhat imprecise. In fact, we prove that the normalized distance (by the square root of the code length) among codewords is the crucial quantity in improving the DNNs\u2019 robustness. For the second question, we establish that there exists a threshold, determined by the normalized distance among codewords, DNN architecture, and the scale of weight-errors. If the distance between a clean output (in the absence of weight-errors) and its nearest codewords is smaller than this threshold, the DNN can make predictions as if it is free of weight-errors. For the third question, we analyze the overall performance of ECOCs by separating it into clean performance (in the absence of weight-errors) and performance degradation due to weight-errors. We demonstrate that the clean performance is influenced by the correlation among ECOC codewords (code orthogonality), while robustness is determined by the normalized distance among the codewords (code distance). Thus, both aspects should be carefully considered during code construction.

We made the following observations from Tables 1 and 2: 1) The clean accuracy $(\\omega=0$ ) of different codes are similar for small scale tasks in Table 1, even with different code lengths. We believe this is partially due to the simplicity of the tasks. Besides, these codes all have good orthogonality, therefore they have similar generalization performance according to Proposition 1. In contrast, the clean accuracy is more varied for large scale tasks in Table 2. We believe this is because the assumption of infinitely wide DNN does not hold when the code length is comparable to the width of networks. In these cases, ECOCs with better structures can reduce more generalization error. 2) One-hot and repetition codes have much worse performance than other codes under large weight-errors. This is due to their smaller normalized distances. On the contrary, our proposed codes outperform other benchmarks under large weight-errors because of their larger normalized distances. 3) Larger code length $n_{L}$ yields better robustness under weight-errors since more protections are applied by the additional nodes. Besides, longer codes lead to higher success probability of bounds in our theoretical results, making the proposed methods inspired by them more effective. 4) Interestingly, Hadamard and random codes perform similarly when the code length is large.
