Existing research often lacks rigorous analysis of training dynamics and sample complexity. This makes it difficult to design efficient training algorithms.\nThis paper addresses these issues by introducing the Sparse Contextual Bigram (SCB) model, a simplified yet informative model for studying transformers' learning capabilities. The researchers used a one-layer linear transformer with a gradient-based algorithm to analyze training dynamics and sample complexity of SCB.  They provide theoretical convergence and sample complexity guarantees, showing that training can be divided into a sample-intensive initial stage and a more sample-efficient later stage.  Furthermore, they demonstrate how transfer learning can be used to bypass the initial intensive stage if a sufficient correlation exists between the pretraining and downstream tasks.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "PukaVAwYBo/podcast.wav"}
