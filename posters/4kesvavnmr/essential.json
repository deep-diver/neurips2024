However, most existing methods assume specific data distributions (e.g., Gaussian), leading to inaccurate predictions when assumptions fail.  This is particularly problematic with tabular data, widely used across many domains. \n\nTreeffuser tackles this challenge by employing conditional diffusion models, offering flexibility and non-parametric nature, combined with gradient-boosted trees for efficient training and robustness.  The results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing techniques across diverse datasets, including those with complex distributions. **Treeffuser addresses the limitations of existing probabilistic methods on tabular data, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of predictive uncertainty quantification.**", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Columbia University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4KeSvAvNMr/podcast.wav"}
