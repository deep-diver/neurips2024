This paper investigates this critical role from three perspectives: input encoding, role at different stages, and output features, revealing distinct characteristics of text-based control information. \n\nTo address these issues, the authors propose TextGen, a novel framework that optimizes control information.  They improve input features using Fourier analysis and introduce a two-stage generation framework to align control information's varied roles at different stages. The output features are enhanced via frequency balancing.  TextGen demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation using a novel, lightweight dataset, showing that careful consideration of control information at each step leads to significant improvements in quality.  The code and dataset are publicly available.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "r3c0WGCXgt/podcast.wav"}
