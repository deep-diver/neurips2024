Recent works primarily use a ControlNet-based framework, employing standard font text images to control diffusion models. Recognizing the critical role of control information in generating high-quality text, we investigate its influence from three perspectives: input encoding, role at different stages, and output features. Our findings reveal that: 1) Input control information has unique characteristics compared to conventional inputs like Canny edges and depth maps. 2) Control information plays distinct roles at different stages of the denoising process. 3) Output control features significantly differ from the base and skip features of the U-Net decoder in the frequency domain. Based on these insights, we propose TextGen, a novel framework designed to enhance generation quality by optimizing control information. We improve input and output features using Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information and reduce noise. Additionally, we employ a two-stage generation framework to align the different roles of control information at different stages. Furthermore, we introduce an effective and lightweight dataset for training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation.

Current methods directly utilize ControlNet [36] for text generation control, using a global glyph image of a standard font as the condition (as shown in Figure 1).

Hence, we pose a meaningful question: How does control information influence multilingual text image generation? ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address the above issue, we investigate the impact of control information on visual text generation from three perspectives, as illustrated in Figure 1. For the input of control information, the current model uses a glyph image to guide the generation of accurate text textures. However, unlike general ControlNet inputs such as Canny edges, depth, or M-LSD lines, text glyph images have unique properties: 1) Glyph images have areas of high information density concentrated within specific regions, with the rest being meaningless backgrounds. 2) Generation in text region is fine-grained, but extracting fine-grained features from glyph images using standard convolution methods is challenging (further discussed in Sec. 3.1.1). These properties limit the performance. For the control information in different time steps, current models follow ControlNet [36] by using fixed control, but they often overlook the role of different time steps in the generation process. We further explore the impact of control at various steps in Sec. 3.1.2. Control in early steps influences both text and non-text regions, ensuring that the background reasonably matches the text. Control in late steps still plays a significant role in modifying mistakes, which is different from the general generation [2, 15]. For the output of control feature, these features are injected into the U-Net decoder, which receives three types of features: base, skip, and control. Each of these components differs in the frequency domain, which explains their respective roles (discussed in Sec. 3.1.3). Balancing these components during inference is crucial. Overall, we explore the influence of control information in text generation, raising several critical questions essential for advancements in visual text generation.

Recent studies, such as Imagen [22] and eDiff-I [2], have focused on improving text generation from the perspective of text encoders. They found that T5-based encoders [19] outperform CLIP text encoders [18]. GlyphDraw [14] presents a robust baseline for visual text generation by incorporating conditions. It utilizes a glyph image representing a single word as the content condition and a mask image as the positional condition. However, GlyphDraw is limited to generating only one text line per image.

Recently, leveraging the diffusion model, some approaches have conducted generation on complete scene images directly, without decomposing the task into sub-processes.

As illustrated in Figure 2, general ControlNet conditions typically influence only macroscopic coarse-grained style and global edges, and some incorrect minor texture generation is considered acceptable. However, small differences in texture details can lead to content errors or unrealistic and unreasonable textures in visual text generation. Therefore, using the general ControlNet poses challenges in controlling detailed textures and fine-grained handwriting. Moreover, the text glyph condition concentrates only on certain regions, making it a sparse condition unlike other general conditions. This characteristic causes the convolution-based ControlNet encoder to introduce noise in empty areas when extracting features, which interferes with the text area\u2019s features and affects the correct allocation of attention between edge and background areas. Enhancing the ControlNet encoder\u2019s perception of locally useful details and edge information is essential for improving text image generation.

Our network excels at generating high-quality scene images with text. However, the framework based on latent diffusion presents certain limitations. 1) The VAE employed in latent diffusion restricts the performance of fine-grained texture generation, particularly for complex texts. Because the diffusion process operates in the latent feature space, the VAE decoder struggles to generate small or complex texts. Consequently, our method is unable to generate such images. This issue can be addressed by generating each local sub-region separately. 2) The text condition controls the content of the generated image. However, the CLIP text encoder has limited ability to comprehend text, resulting in performance limitations. To resolve this issue, we can pre-train the diffusion model with a large language model serving as the text condition encoder.

For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
