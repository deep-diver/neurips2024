It illustrates the sensitivity of KFNN to different values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 for two datasets, Income and Leaves. The x-axis represents \u03b1, the y-axis represents \u03b2, and the z-axis shows the Macro-F1 score.

It compares the performance of KFNN with three variants: KFNN-KF (without K-free optimization), KFNN-LDE (without label distribution enhancement), and KFNN-KF-LDE (without both). The Macro-F1 score is shown in (a), indicating that both components are important for KFNN's performance. The class margin is shown in (b), illustrating the impact of the Kalman filter in mitigating noise from neighbor instances.", "section": "Ablation experiment"}]
