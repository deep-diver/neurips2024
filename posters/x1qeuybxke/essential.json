However, adapting pre-trained diffusion models to user-specified objectives (like generating images with specific features) faces challenges. Simply using the gradient of the objective function as guidance often disrupts the inherent structure of the generated samples. This paper addresses these issues.\nThis work introduces a new optimization framework for guided diffusion, demonstrating that gradient-guided diffusion essentially solves a regularized optimization problem.  The authors propose a modified form of gradient guidance, \"look-ahead loss,\" that preserves the latent structure of generated samples. They also present an iteratively fine-tuned version, showing a guaranteed convergence rate.  The key contribution lies in providing a strong theoretical understanding and algorithm guarantees for guided diffusion models.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "X1QeUYBXke/podcast.wav"}
