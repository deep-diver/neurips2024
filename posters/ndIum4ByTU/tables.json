The experiment uses four variations of the Meta Flow Matching (MFM) model, each differing in a parameter (k).  The results are reported in terms of three distributional distance metrics: 1-Wasserstein, 2-Wasserstein, and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which quantify the difference between the predicted and actual letter distributions.  The results show the performance of the models on both the training (seen) and testing (unseen) populations, which is important for determining the model's ability to generalize.", "section": "5.1 Synthetic Experiment"}, {"figure_path": "ndIum4ByTU/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Experimental results on the organoid drug-screen dataset for population prediction of treatment response across replicate populations averaged over co-culture conditions.
