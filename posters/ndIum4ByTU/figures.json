Flow Matching learns the tangent vectors to a single curve on the manifold. Conditional generation corresponds to learning a finite set of curves on the manifold, e.g. classes c1 and c2 on the plot. Meta Flow Matching learns to integrate a vector field on P2(X), i.e. for every starting density po Meta Flow Matching defines a push-forward measure that integrates along the underlying vector field.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core concepts of Flow Matching, Conditional Flow Matching, and Meta Flow Matching using the 2-Wasserstein manifold visualized as a sphere. Flow Matching focuses on a single curve, representing the evolution of a single population. Conditional Flow Matching extends this to multiple curves representing different conditions. Meta Flow Matching goes further by learning a vector field, allowing for generalization to unseen initial distributions.", "section": "2 Background"}, {"figure_path": "ndIum4ByTU/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Model-generated samples for synthetic letters from the source (t = 0) to target (t = 1) distributions.", "description": "This figure shows the results of a synthetic experiment on denoising letters.  Three models are compared: Flow Matching (FM), Conditional Flow Matching (CGFM), and Meta Flow Matching (MFM). For each model, the figure displays samples from the source distribution (t=0), intermediate distributions at t=0.5 and t=1, and the target distribution (t=1). The samples are generated for both seen (train) and unseen (test) letter orientations.
