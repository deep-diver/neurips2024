Ignoring these relationships leads to inefficient learning and high regret (difference between the expected reward and the actual reward).  This paper addresses these limitations by exploring the relationship between bandit tasks using a graph structure, improving learning efficiency and reducing regret.\nThe proposed algorithm, Network Lasso Bandits, utilizes graph total variation regularization to model piecewise constant relationships between tasks.  It overcomes the overconfidence issues of clustering-based methods and significantly reduces regret. Theoretical analysis provides a novel oracle inequality and regret bound, showcasing the benefits of dense intra-cluster connections and sparse inter-cluster ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over baselines.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "WxW4nZMD3D/podcast.wav"}
