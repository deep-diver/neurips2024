(2016) introduces an entropic regularization into the GW objective \u2013 this leads to a formulation that permits Sinkhorn scaling-like updates, much like the original scheme to solve entropic Wasserstein distance in Cuturi (2013). The work of Vayer et al. (2019b) adapts the ideas from the Wasserstein problem in one dimension in which closed-form solutions are available (this is known as the sliced Wasserstein problem, Rabin et al. 2012) to the GW context. Finally, the work in Sejourne et al. (2021); Vincent-Cuaz et al. (2021) relaxes the constraints on the probability distributions.

A piece of related work by Villar et al. (2016) proposes a SDP relaxation of the closely related Gromov-Hausdorff problem, with an extension to the Gromov-Wasserstein problem. The relaxation is primarily designed for the Gromov-Hausdorff problem and is not equivalent to ours. The formulation also requires the probability distributions to be uniform whereas we do not. Another recent work by Ryner et al. (2023) also studies the Gromov-Hausdorff problem, and proposes a Branch-and-Bound approach for solving integer programs. The GW problem does not contain integer constraints, and hence Branch-and-Bound techniques are not applicable. That said, SDP relaxations can be used in conjunction with Branch-and-Bound.
