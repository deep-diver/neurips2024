The runtime is broken down by the number of samples (n = 6, 12, 20) and the algorithm used (GW-SDP, GW-CG, eGW).  Standard deviations are included in parentheses. This illustrates the computational cost comparison between the proposed GW-SDP method and existing methods.", "section": "4.1 Matching Gaussian Distributions"}, {"figure_path": "rM3FFH1mqk/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparisons of GW-SDP solver and GW-CG solver with a varying number of sample points n.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the GW-SDP solver and the GW-CG solver for the Gaussian matching experiment with different numbers of sample points. It shows the objective values obtained by each solver and their corresponding runtimes for various sample sizes (n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000). The results demonstrate the trade-off between the accuracy and efficiency of the two approaches, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each method in terms of computational cost and quality of solution.", "section": "4 Numerical Experiments with Off-the-shelf Convex Solvers"}, {"figure_path": "rM3FFH1mqk/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Value of different GW formulations for the realistic 3D shape matching dataset, visualized in Figure 5.
