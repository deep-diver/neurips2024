This limits their application in resource-constrained scenarios. Previous linear attention methods attempted to reduce the complexity but often compromised accuracy.  \n\nThis paper introduces QT-ViT, a novel approach to improve linear self-attention using quadratic Taylor expansion.  By cleverly approximating the softmax function, QT-ViT maintains superior performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.
