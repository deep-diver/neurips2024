Early 3D generation works optimized single 3D object with CLIP loss [36] or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [33] from 2D text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. Since the models providing supervision lacked 3D prior, those works usually suffered from spatial inconsistency, i.e., multi-face Janus problem [50, 28, 53]. To tackle this problem, on the one hand, some works [31, 40, 41, 32, 35] lifted the T2I diffusion to multi-view image diffusion by injecting new spatial attention layers and fine-tuning on large-scale 3D synthetic datasets [13, 12]. Although 3D consistency was improved, these optimization-based methods still required a relatively long time to optimize a 3D object. On the other hand, some feed-forward 3D generation foundation models [22, 61, 47, 67, 54, 60, 30], also trained on large-scale 3D datasets, were able to produce a good-quality 3D object in several seconds in an inference-only way.

Previous T2V works usually built upon T2I diffusion models [20, 42, 19, 18, 21], leveraging their pre-trained weights by leaving the spatial blocks unchanged and inserting new temporal blocks to model the temporal camera or object motions. The I2V works [58, 17, 64], building upon the aforementioned T2V methods, typically incorporate image semantics into video models. This is achieved through cross-attention mechanisms between noisy frames and the conditional image, while retaining the motion module design from the T2V models unaltered. We draw inspiration from the development paradigm of video generation to design our 4D generation foundation model, which is a multi-view image conditioned multi-view video diffusion model building upon pre-trained multi-view 3D and video diffusion models.

Very recently, Consistent4D [24] proposed a video-to-4D generation task, which used single-view video reconstruction and SDS from Zero123 [31] for motion and appearance learning. This paradigm was adopted by following works [38, 63, 66, 57, 16, 11] and extended to text/image-to-video then video-to-4D generation.

", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Qualitative Comparison. As shown in Fig. 3, it is obvious that 4Dfy\u2019s results are blurred and deviate much from the given 3D object, owing to the use of text-conditioned diffusion models to optimize the motion and appearance. Additionally, its generated objects are almost static. This is because at the beginning of the training process, the noisy rendered image sequence, i.e., the input to the T2V model, has no temporal changes, which misleads the video diffusion model to generate almost static supervisions, as illustrated in Fig 1. For DG4D, its results align well with the given 3D object in front view, i.e., the view used for generating guided video. However, it doesn\u2019t align with the object in the novel view, as indicated by the tail in Bear and Penguin, distorted goggles in bear, and blurred back and side views in Fig 3. This is because it adopts Zero123 to optimize the novel views. Zero123 only conditions on the front view, leading to NVS optimization favoring pre-trained data distributions, which could lead to potential appearance degradation. More importantly, DG4D fails when the object in the guided video is assigned with movements toward the camera. For example, the frog is moving forth and back in the guided video, however, DG4D interprets it as enlargement and reduction of the object. The same thing comes to the penguin which nods towards the camera and leans forward. This misinterpretation usually results in blurry effect and strange appearance.

MV-VDM is the first 4D foundation model, which can generate spatiotemporal consistent multi-view videos conditioned on multi-view renderings of a static 3D object. To train MV-VDM, we present the largest multi-view video (4D) dataset, MV-Video, containing about 84K animations with over 1.3M multi-view videos. Based on MV-VDM, we propose an effective pipeline to animate any static 3D object by jointly optimizing the 4DGS via both reconstruction and 4D-SDS. Animate3D is a highly practical solution for downstream 4D applications since it can animate any generated or reconstructed 3D objects.

Meanwhile, the appearance supervision signal prevents 4D object from updating along the direction that follows the exact score function of the video diffusion model, leading to less natural motion. Small motion amplitude in [5, 69] and shaky appearance in [29] could partly support this point. As for monocular-video-guided motion learning, previous work [38, 63, 66] rely on 3D diffusion model (Zero123 [31]) to supervise both motion and appearance in novel view. Since Zero123-SDS is applied per-frame, temporal consistency in novel view cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, monocular video doesn\u2019t provides information about depth/distance, so moving closer to or farther away from the camera can be perceived as the magnification or reduction of the object, resulting in appearance distortion.

Our motion and appearance supervision signal inherently don\u2019t conflict with each other, since MV-VDM is conditioned on multi-view attributes of the 3D object to generate multi-view videos. Besides, multi-view motion supervision in our work enables more natural motion generation when compared with single-view motion supervision in other works.

Specifically, the larger the motion amplitude, the higher the risk of temporal incoherence. Third, our model sometimes fails to animate realistic scenes due to the domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world test data.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
