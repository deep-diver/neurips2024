However, the preference   \n4 datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never   \n5 updated, thus the feedback is purely offilne. Moreover, responses in these datasets   \n6 are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and   \n7 since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy.   \n8 In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods.   \n9 Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each   \n10 training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the   \n11 LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback.   \n12 Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that   \n13 OAIF outperforms both offilne DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the   \n14 feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the   \n15 LLM annotator.

More   \n22 recently, direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods have emerged as popular alternatives   \n23 to RLHF, such as direct preference optimisation (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023), sequence likelihood   \n24 calibration with human feedback (SLiC, Zhao et al., 2023), and identity policy optimisation (IPO,   \n25 Azar et al., 2023). In contrast to RLHF, the DAP methods directly update the language model (a.k.a.   \n26 policy) $\\pi_{\\theta}$ using pairwise preference data, making the alignment simpler, more efficient and more   \n27 stable (Rafailov et al., 2023).   \n28 However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are often collected ahead of training and   \n29 the responses in the dataset are usually generated by different LLMs. Thus, the feedback in DAP   \n30 methods is usually purely offline, as $\\pi_{\\theta}$ cannot get feedback on its own generations over training.   \n31 This is problematic because of the significant distribution shift between the policy that generated the   \n32 dataset and the policy being aligned: we train on the distribution induced by $\\rho$ but evaluate on the   \n33 distribution induced by $\\pi_{\\theta}$ in the end. In contrast, in RLHF, the RM provides online feedback to   \n34 generations from $\\pi_{\\theta}$ during the RL step. This practice leads to on-policy learning, which was shown   \n35 to improve exploration and overall performance (Lambert et al., 2022).   \n36 Inspired by RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023), we hereby propose   \n37 Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for DAP methods. Our method inherits both the practical advantages of   \n38 DAP methods and the online nature of RLHF. Specifically, when aligning an LLM policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ , we   \n39 follow a three-step procedure: 1) we sample two responses to a prompt from the current policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ ; 2)   \n40 we obtain online feedback over the two responses by prompting an LLM to mimic human preference   \n41 annotation; 3) we use this online feedback to update the model $\\pi_{\\theta}$ through standard DAP losses. Our   \n42 approach is depicted in Fig 1. Unlike methods proposed by Xu et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023); Xiong   \n43 et al. (2023), OAIF skips the RM training, and directly extracts the preference from an LLM.   \n44 To show the effectiveness of our proposal, we perform an extensive empirical comparison between   \n45 OAIF, existing offline DAP methods and RLHF methods. Our experimental protocol uses both AI   \n46 and human evaluation on standard LLM alignment tasks: TL;DR (Ziegler et al., 2019), Anthropic   \n47 Helpfulness and Harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a). To summarise, we make the following   \n48 contributions.   \n49 \u2022 We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of OAIF for turning offilne DAP methods (DPO,   \n50 IPO, SLiC) into online methods. Our human evaluation shows that the average win rate of online   \n51 DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) over offline versions of the same methods is ${\\sim}66\\%$ .   \n52 \u2022 We confirm the usefulness of making DAP methods online: human raters favour DPO with OAIF   \n53 (thus, online DPO) over SFT baseline, RLHF and RLAIF $58.00\\%$ of time on the TL;DR task in   \n54 4-way comparisons.   \n55 \u2022 We demonstrate the controllability of the LLM annotator, by injecting specific instructions into   \n56 the prompts. We use response length as a test-bed. By asking the LLM annotator to prefer shorter   \n57 responses, the average length of responses from the aligned policy is significantly shortened from   \n58 $\\mathord{\\sim}120$ to ${\\sim}40$ , while its quality is still improved over the SFT baseline.

To avoid the distribution shifts arising when aligning   \n111 LLMs with offilne DAP methods on a given dataset $\\mathbb{D}$ , an intuitive and straightforward solution is to   \n112 introduce an RM to provide online feedback. Liu et al. (2023) proposed RSO, a method that uses an   \n113 RM to perform rejection sampling in order to sample from the optimal policy, which improved the   \n114 alignment compared to offilne DAP baselines. Besides, pseudo-labelling the generations from $\\pi_{\\pmb{\\theta}^{t}}$ by   \n115 RMs can also be helpful, as done in the Iterative DPO method ( $\\mathrm{\\DeltaXu}$ et al., 2023) and the West-of-N   \n116 method (Pace et al., 2024). Although the aforementioned RM-based methods make the alignment of   \n117 a policy online and on-policy, the distribution shift problem still exists when training the RM. More   \n118 specifically, the RM is trained on the preference dataset $\\mathbb{D}\\sim\\rho$ , but used to annotate preference over   \n119 responses from $\\pi{\\}_{\\theta}t$ at training step $t$ , where $\\pi_{\\theta}\\neq\\rho$ . Therefore, RM-based online feedback cannot   \n120 fully avoid distribution shift issues.   \n121 LLM-based online feedback for   \n122 DAP methods. The method we   \n123 propose next, \u201cOnline AI Feedback\u201d   \n124 (OAIF), consists in using an LLM as   \n125 an online annotator. Our method re  \n126 lies on the observation that LLMs can   \n127 approximate well human labelling and   \n128 can generate reliable preferences over   \n129 responses (Lee et al., 2023).

Naturally, using human feedback would be prohibitively expensive. Prior   \n147 studies have shown that AI feedback is a reliable and effective approximation to human labellers,   \n148 especially for pairwise preference labelling (Lee et al., 2023). We therefore propose to use an LLM   \n149 as online annotator, in order to collect the preference over pairs of responses, sampled from $\\pi_{\\pmb{\\theta}^{t}}$   \n150 on-the-fly during its alignment. We refer to the proposed approach as OAIF, which stands for online   \n151 AI feedback.   \n152 Proposed algorithm. An overview of OAIF is given in Figure 1, and a more formal description   \n153 is provided in Algorithm 1 (for simplicity, we use batches of size 1). Given a prompt $\\textbf{\\em x}$ , sampling   \n154 $\\boldsymbol{y}^{\\mathrm{1}},\\boldsymbol{y}^{\\mathrm{2}}$ from $\\pi_{\\pmb{\\theta}^{t}}(\\bar{\\cdot}|\\pmb{x})$ ensures on-policy learning. Prompting the annotating LLM to obtain ${\\boldsymbol{y}}^{+},{\\boldsymbol{y}}^{-}$   \n155 ensures online learning. We emphasise that the approach is general and works with any differentiable   \n156 DAP loss function $\\ell(\\bar{{\\pmb x}},{\\pmb y}^{+},{\\pmb y}^{-},{\\pmb\\theta})$ .   \n157 Gradient computation. An important technical detail of online DAP methods is that $\\theta$ is involved   \n158 in both the response sampling and the DAP loss function. In contrast, $\\theta$ is involved only in the loss   \n159 for offline DAP methods and only in the sampling for RLHF methods. In addition, using OAIF,   \n160 the sampled responses go through an LLM annotator to obtain $(\\pmb{y}^{+},\\pmb{y}^{-})$ , thus $(\\pmb{y}^{+},\\pmb{y}^{-})$ are also in   \n161 principle functions of $\\theta$ . In practice, we propose to simply use $\\nabla_{\\theta}\\ell(x,y^{+},y^{-},\\theta)$ as our gradients,   \n162 which amounts to placing a stop_gradient on both the sampling and LLM annotation steps.   \n163 Annotating prompts with text-controllability. We adopt a pairwise prompting scheme to collect AI   \n164 feedback, i.e. we instruct the LLM annotator to choose which response is preferred among a pair, as   \n165 in (Lee et al., 2023). To avoid position bias, we calculate scores for the two response possible orders   \n166 and use the average as the final score. Since OAIF leverages prompting techniques to collect feedback,   \n167 the reward signals or the preference function can be easily adapted by modifying the prompts (Sun   \n168 et al., 2024). This offers high flexibility without incurring any extra computation (such as retraining   \n169 the RM) compared to RLHF and RLAIF. For example, in our experiments, we show that we can   \n170 control the response length by simply prompting the annotator to prefer shorter responses.

This indicates that the human preference annotation might change dramatically and frequently.   \n304 In RLHF, such changes require re-annotating the preference dataset and re-training the RM, leading   \n305 to high cost. In contrast, as OAIF is obtained through prompting the LLM annotator, its reward signal   \n306 could be adjusted by simply modifying the prompts.   \n307 To examine this, we choose to explore the controllability of the length of responses by modifying   \n308 the prompts to the LLM annotators. We take the online DPO model $\\pi_{\\theta}$ trained to be as helpful as   \n309 possible in Section 4.2 as the reference. We further train another two online DPO models with the   \n310 same experiment setup, but in which the annotator is prompted to favour \u201chelpful and short\u201d and   \n311 \u201chelpful and very short\u201d responses. The exact prompts given to the LLM annotators are provided in   \n312 Table 6 and Table 8.   \n313 We display the average length of responses over training in Figure 6a. The \u201cshort\u201d and \u201cvery short\u201d   \n314 prompts given to the LLM annotator significantly shorten the responses from $\\mathord{\\sim}120$ tokens to ${\\sim}90$   \n315 and ${\\sim}40$ tokens respectively. This direct evidence demonstrates that the behaviour of policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ can   \n316 be significantly changed through prompting the annotating LLM differently, and the degree of the   \n317 changes can be controlled as well.   \n318 However, the above changes come at a cost. In Figure 6b, we plot the win rate of the \u201chelpful\u201d,   \n319 \u201chelpful and short\u201d, and \u201chelpful and very short\u201d models against the initial SFT baseline.

To verify that a weaker AI labeller can improve the performance of a stronger LLM   \n329 model, we perform experiments using PaLM 2-S as the policy model (student) under two teacher   \n330 settings: one with PaLM 2-XS (weaker teacher) and the other with PaLM 2-L (stronger teacher).   \n331 The side-by-side automatic evaluation results on Helpfulness comparing against the SFT baseline   \n332 and offline DPO are given in Figure 7.

In the meantime, we use a separate annotating prompt for each task   \n358 studied in Section 4, whereas aligning LLMs towards general human values requires a universal   \n359 prompt to get OAIF across tasks.

We also exhibited the tendency of offline DAP methods to overfit, and in   \n370 contrast the usefulness of OAIF as a way to mitigate reward overoptimization. We further verified the   \n371 generality of OAIF, as our empirical results hold for three prominent DAP methods: DPO, IPO and   \n372 SLiC.   \n373 Beyond the empirical evaluation of OAIF, our work also contributes the comparison of two types   \n374 of methods: online DAP methods (e.g., online DPO) and RLAIF. Since the feedback comes from   \n375 identical models in both learning algorithms, our experiment setup ensures that the AI feedback is of   \n376 the same quality and that only the learning procedures differ. Our experimental results in various tasks   \n377 show that online DPO outperforms RLAIF and RLHF, which further confirms the effectiveness of   \n378 OAIF, compared to offilne feedback.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they   \n714 should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.   \n715 \u2022 At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized   \n716 versions (if applicable).   \n717 \u2022 Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the   \n718 paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.   \n719 6.

Experiment Statistical Significance   \n732 Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate   \n733 information about the statistical significance of the experiments?   \n734 Answer: [No]   \n735 Justification: We directly compare outputs of the proposed method and various baselines to   \n736 get the win rate in our experiments. Moreover, it is expensive to run experiments we tried in   \n737 Section 4, especially the human evaluation.   \n738 Guidelines:   \n739 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n740 \u2022 The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi  \n741 dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support   \n742 the main claims of the paper.   \n743 \u2022 The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for   \n744 example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall   \n745 run with given experimental conditions).   \n746 \u2022 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,   \n747 call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)   \n748 \u2022 The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).   \n749 \u2022 It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error   \n750 of the mean.   \n751 \u2022 It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should   \n752 preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a $96\\%$ CI, if the hypothesis   \n753 of Normality of errors is not verified.   \n754 \u2022 For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or   \n755 figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative   \n756 error rates).   \n757 \u2022 If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how   \n758 they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.   \n759 8. Experiments Compute Resources   \n760 Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com  \n761 puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce   \n762 the experiments?   \n763 Answer: [Yes]   \n764 Justification: We provided details for computational resources in the experimental setup   \n765 section.   \n766 Guidelines:   \n767 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n768 \u2022 The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,   \n769 or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.   \n770 \u2022 The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual   \n771 experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.   \n772 \u2022 The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute   \n773 than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that   \n774 didn\u2019t make it into the paper).   \n775 9. Code Of Ethics   \n776 Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the   \n777 NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?   \n778 Answer: [Yes]   \n779 Justification: We confirm that this work follows the ethics guidelines from NeurIPS-2024.   \n780 Guidelines:   \n781 \u2022 The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.   \n782 \u2022 If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a   \n783 deviation from the Code of Ethics.   \n784 \u2022 The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid  \n785 eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).   \n786 10. Broader Impacts   \n787 Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative   \n788 societal impacts of the work performed?   \n789 Answer: [Yes]   \n790 Justification: The broader impact of this work is discussed in Appendix G.   \n791 Guidelines:   \n792 \u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.   \n793 \u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal   \n794 impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.   \n795 \u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses   \n796 (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations   \n797 (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific   \n798 groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.   \n799 \u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied   \n800 to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to   \n801 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n802 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n803 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n804 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n805 models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n806 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n807 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n808 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n809 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n810 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation   \n811 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n812 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from   \n813 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n814 11. Safeguards   \n815 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible   \n816 release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,   \n817 image generators, or scraped datasets)?   \n818 Answer: [NA]   \n819 Justification: We don\u2019t release models and data from this project.   \n820 Guidelines:   \n821 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.   \n822 \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with   \n823 necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring   \n824 that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing   \n825 safety filters.   \n826 \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors   \n827 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.   \n828 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n829 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best   \n830 faith effort.   \n831 12. Licenses for existing assets   \n832 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in   \n833 the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and   \n834 properly respected?   \n835 Answer: [Yes]   \n836 Justification: All works of the baselines used in this works are cited, and the credit is due   \n837 to the authors of the original papers. Regarding the LLM infrastructure provided by our   \n838 affiliation, we will acknowledge their credit in the camera-ready version by a separate   \n839 acknowledgement section.   \n840 Guidelines:   \n841 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.   \n842 \u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.   \n843 \u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a   \n844 URL.   \n845 \u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.   \n846 \u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of   \n847 service of that source should be provided.   \n848 \u2022 If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the   \n849 package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets   \n850 has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the   \n851 license of a dataset.   \n852 \u2022 For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of   \n853 the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.   \n854 \u2022 If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to   \n855 the asset\u2019s creators.   \n856 13. New Assets   \n857 Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation   \n858 provided alongside the assets?   \n859 Answer: [NA]   \n860 Justification: This work doesn\u2019t release new assets.   \n861 Guidelines:   \n862 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.   \n863 \u2022 Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their   \n864 submissions via structured templates.
