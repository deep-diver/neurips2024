Recent studies have revealed that focusing the optimization of Bellman equations solely on in-sample actions tends to result in more stable optimization, especially in the presence of function approximation. Upon on these findings, in this paper, we propose an Empirical MDP Iteration (EMIT) framework. EMIT constructs a sequence of empirical MDPs using data from the growing replay memory. For each of these empirical MDPs, it learns an estimated Q-function denoted as $\\widehat{Q}$ . The key strength is that by restricting the Bellman update to in-sample bootstrapping, each empirical MDP converges to a unique optimal $\\widehat{Q}$ function. Furthermore, gradually expanding from the empirical MDPs to the original MDP induces a monotonic policy improvement. Instead of creating entirely new algorithms, we demonstrate that EMIT can be seamlessly integrated with existing online RL algorithms, effectively acting as a regularizer for contemporary Q-learning methods. We show this by implementing EMIT for two representative RL algorithms, DQN and TD3. Experimental results on Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks show that EMIT significantly reduces estimation errors and substantially improves the performance of both algorithms.

Notably, on MuJoCo tasks, EMIT significantly surpasses other baselines. These results corroborate our intuition that Empirical MDP Iteration is a more effective approach than focusing on the original MDP from the outset. This strategy circumvents bootstrapping error, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. While the Double Q technique mitigates overestimation by employing the target network to evaluate actions, the target network may still overestimate or underestimate certain state-action pairs. The distributional perspective of value estimation fosters more stable and risk-aware behavior. However, estimation error persists due to the maximization bootstrapping from out-of-sample actions. In contrast, EMIT seeks to simplify the problem, addressing it incrementally and progressively approximating the original problem. This approach can provide accurate target values for each empirical MDP, leading to consistent improvement. In summary, EMIT reduces estimation error and provides accurate targets, thereby making the learning process more efficient. Detailed learning curves can be found in Appendix C.2.

Therefore, we assess the change on Breakout and Pong, which have discrete action spaces. The results are shown in Fig. 6a, with additional results in Fig. 22 in Appendix C.4.

The use of erroneous bootstrapping targets can degrade the $Q$ function, resulting in suboptimal performance [44, 45, 46, 47]. Overestimation can occur when bootstrapping error is combined with maximizing over action values [20]. Double DQN [21] mitigates this overestimation by computing the maximum from two $Q$ functions. Maxmin Q-learning [48] learns multiple Q functions to strike a balance between overestimation and underestimation. It requires meticulous hyper-parameter fine-tuning, which can be computationally intensive. CEER [49] constructs a graph to merge similar states and computes an additional conservative $Q$ estimation akin to solving Eq. (2). However, CEER is effective only when the constructed graph is dense. C51 [36] and IQN [37] are distributional RL methods that are generally more stable and risk-aware than DQN. Nonetheless, estimation error remains due to the maximization bootstrapping from out-of-sample actions. Rainbow [38] integrates six enhancements to the DQN algorithm for improved empirical performance: double Q-learning [21], prioritized replay [50], dueling networks [51], multi-step learning [52], distributional RL [36], and noisy nets [53].

They aim to extract best possible policy from the existing dataset. While earlier methods focused on constraining the distance between the learned policy and the behavior policy to avoid distributional shift caused by taking actions outside of the behavior distribution [54, 55, 56], recent studies found that selecting actions within the support of the dataset during training, similar to Eq. (2), is more effective [57, 30, 58, 31]. Implicit $Q$ -Learning (IQL) [30] estimates the value of the best available action at a given state with expectile regression, without ever directly querying the $Q$ function for unseen actions. In-Sample Actor-Critic (InAC) [31] approximates an in-sample softmax using only actions in the dataset. Extreme Q-learning (XQL) [32] models the maximal value using Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and avoids computing Q-values using out-of-sample actions.

Bootstrapping from in-sample transitions with Eq. (2) theoretically leads to a unique solution and significantly reduces the estimation error in practice, even with function approximation. We introduce a novel learning paradigm, termed Empirical MDP Iteration (EMIT). Unlike previous methods that solely focus on solving the entire original MDP, we propose a regularization approach for learning by solving a series of empirical MDPs using only the transitions present in the data. EMIT provides an iterative learning pathway that uniquely solves each empirical MDP and incrementally approaches the original MDP through new data collection. We instantiate EMIT with the $Q$ -learning algorithm DQN and the actor-critic algorithm TD3. Results demonstrate a substantial improvement in performance in applications of both video games and continuous control tasks. A shortcoming is that since the policy derived from $\\widehat{Q}$ lacks an exploration mechanism, we learn two $Q$ functions in our algorithm design and the wall-c lock time would be double. One future work could be designing a learning process that is directly based on in-sample Bellman update to avoid out-of-sample bootstrapping and also taking the exploration mechanism into consideration.
