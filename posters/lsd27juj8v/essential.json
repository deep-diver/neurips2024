This leads to unstable optimization and suboptimal performance.  Existing methods like double Q-learning attempt to mitigate this issue, but they face limitations in complex scenarios.\nThis paper introduces the Empirical MDP Iteration (EMIT) framework to enhance RL algorithms. EMIT constructs a sequence of simplified Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) from data in a replay memory, solving them iteratively.  **By restricting Bellman updates to in-sample actions, EMIT ensures that each simplified MDP converges to a unique optimal Q-function, improving overall stability and performance.**  Experimental results showcase the method's effectiveness in reducing estimation errors and improving the performance of both Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradients (TD3) across diverse benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Department of Computing Science and Amii, University of Alberta", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "lsd27JUJ8v/podcast.wav"}
