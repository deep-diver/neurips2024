Note that the case of h = 1 fails to converge in any reasonable number of iterations in both environments.", "description": "This figure shows the training curves for the PMD-MCTS algorithm on two bsuite environments, Catch and DeepSea, for various lookahead depths (h).  The left panel displays the Catch environment, and the right panel shows the DeepSea environment.  The x-axis represents training time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the reward. Each line represents a different lookahead depth.  The key observation is that a lookahead depth of 1 fails to converge within a reasonable number of iterations for both environments.  The figure demonstrates the effectiveness of lookahead in improving algorithm performance.", "section": "D Further Simulations"}]
