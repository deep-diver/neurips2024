However, 1-step greedy policies might not be the best choice and recent remarkable empirical successes in RL such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero have demonstrated that greedy approaches with respect to multiple steps outperform their 1-step counterpart. In this work, we propose a new class of PMD algorithms called $h$ -PMD which incorporates multi-step greedy policy improvement with lookahead depth $h$ to the PMD update rule.

Motivated by the surge of interest in understanding popular Policy Gradient (PG) methods, PMD has been recently investigated in a line of works [25, 53, 29, 20]. Notably, PMD encompasses several PG methods as particular cases via its flexible mirror map. A prominent example is the celebrated Natural PG method. PMD has also close connections to state-of-the-art methods such as TRPO and PPO [50] which have achieved widespread empirical success [41, 42], including most recently in fine-tuning Large Language Models via RL from human feedback [35]. Interestingly, PMD has also been inspired by one of the most fundamental algorithms in RL: Policy Iteration (PI). While PI alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement, PMD regularizes the latter step to address the instability issue of PI with inexact policy evaluation.

In particular, PI has been studied in conjunction with the lookahead mechanism [12], i.e. using multistep greedy policy improvement instead of single-step greedy policies. Intuitively, the idea is that the application of the Bellman operator multiple times before computing a greedy policy leads to a more accurate approximation of the optimal value function. Implemented via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), multi-step greedy policy improvement2 contributed to the empirical success of some of the most impressive applications of RL including AlphaGo, AlphaZero and MuZero [44, 46, 45, 40]. Besides this practical success, a body of work [12, 13, 49, 52, 51] has investigated the role of lookahead in improving the performance of RL algorithms, reporting a convergence rate speed-up when enhancing PI with $h$ -step greedy policy improvement with a reasonable computational overhead.

This class collapses to standard PMD when $h\\,=\\,1$ . When the stepsize parameter goes to infinity, we recover the PI algorithm with multiple-step greedy policy improvement previously analyzed in [12]. When solving a Markov Decision Process problem with $h$ -PMD, we show that the value suboptimality gap converges to zero geometrically with a contraction factor of $\\gamma^{h}$ . This rate is faster than the standard convergence rate of PI and the similar rate for PMD which was recently established in [20] for $h\\geq2$ . This rate improvement requires the computation of a $h$ -step lookahead value function at each iteration which can be performed using planning methods such as tree-search. These results for exact $h$ -PMD are exposed in Sec. 4, when value functions can be evaluated exactly.   \n\u2022 We examine the inexact setting where the $h$ -step action value functions are not available. In this setting, we propose a Monte Carlo sample-based procedure to estimate the unknown $h$ - step lookahead action-value function at each state-action pair. We provide a sample complexity for this Monte Carlo procedure, improving over standard PMD thanks to the use of lookahead. Larger lookahead depth translates into a better sample complexity and a faster suboptimality gap convergence rate. However, this improvement comes at a more intensive computational effort to perform the lookahead steps. Sec. 5 discusses this inexact setting and the aforementioned tradeoff.   \n\u2022 We extend our results to the function approximation setting to address the case of large state spaces where tabular methods are not tractable. In particular, we design a $h$ -PMD algorithm where the $h$ -step lookahead action-value function is approximated using a linear combination of state-action feature vectors in the policy evaluation step. Under linear function approximation and using a generative sampling model, we provide a performance bound for our $h$ -PMD algorithm with linear function approximation. Our resulting sample complexity only depends on the dimension of the feature map space instead of the size of the state space and improves over prior work analyzing PMD with function approximation.   \n\u2022 We perform simulations to verify our theoretical findings empirically on the standard DeepSea RL environment from Deep Mind\u2019s bsuite [34].

Among these works, a line of research focused on the analysis of PMD [53, 25, 28, 29, 20, 3] as a flexible algorithmic framework, and its particular instances such as the celebrated natural policy gradient [21, 54]. In particular, for solving unregularized MDPs (which is our main focus), Xiao [53] established linear convergence of PMD in the tabular setting with a rate depending on the instance dependent distribution mismatch coefficients, and extended their results to the inexact setting using a generative model. Similar results were established for the particular case of the natural policy gradient algorithm [6, 21]. More recently, Johnson, Pike-Burke, and Rebeschini [20] showed a dimension-free rate for PMD with exact policy evaluation using adaptive stepsizes, closing the gap with PI. Notably, they further show that this rate is optimal and their analysis inspired from PI circumvents the use of the performance difference lemma which was prevalent in prior work.

Multi-step greedy policies have been successfully used in applications such as the game of Go and have been studied in a body of works [12, 13, 52, 15, 49]. In particular, multi-step greedy policy improvement has been studied in conjunction with PI in [12, 52]. Efroni et al. [12] introduced $h$ -PI which incorporates $h$ -lookahead to PI and generalized existing analyses on PI with 1-step greedy policy improvement to $h$ -step greedy policies. However, their work requires access to an $h$ -greedy policy oracle, and the $h$ -PI algorithm is unstable in the stochastic setting even for $h=1$ because of potentially large policy updates. We address all these issues in the present work with our $h$ -PMD algorithm. Winnicki and Srikant [52] showed that a first-visit version of a PI scheme using a single sample path for policy evaluation converges to the optimal policy provided that the policy improvement step uses lookahead instead of a 1-step greedy policy. Unlike our present work, the latter work assumes access to a lookahead greedy policy oracle. More recently, Alegre et al. [2] proposed to use lookahead for policy improvement in a transfer learning setting. Extending Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) [4] which identifies a new policy that simultaneously improves over all previously learned policies each solving a specific task, they introduce $h$ -GPI which is a multi-step extension of GPI.

Our paper offers several interesting directions for future research. A possible avenue for future work is to investigate the use of more general function approximators such as neural networks to approximate the lookahead value functions and scale to large state-action spaces. Recent work for PMD along these lines [3] might be a good starting point. Enhancing our algorithm with exploration mechanisms (see e.g. the recent work [33]) is an important future direction. Our PMD update rule might offer some advantage in this regard as was recently observed in the literature [28]. Constructing more efficient fully online estimators for the lookahead action values using MCTS and designing adaptive lookahead strategies to select the tree search horizon [38] are promising avenues for future work. Our algorithm brings together two popular and successful families of RL algorithms: PG methods and tree search methods. Looking forward, we hope our work further stimulates research efforts to investigate practical and efficient methods enjoying the beneftis of both classes of methods.
