(Left) Average of Mk(t) over 25 sample paths vs. iterations t. (Right) Average of I(t) over 25 sample paths vs. iterations t. In both plots, shaded regions depict the range statistic over 25 sample paths.", "description": "This figure shows the results of applying the smoothed alternating gradient descent ascent (sm-AGDA) algorithm to a nonconvex-PL (NCPL) minimax problem.  The left panel displays the average of the stationarity measure Mk(t) across 25 sample paths, plotted against the number of iterations.  The right panel shows the average squared distance I(t) to the solution across the same 25 sample paths.  In both panels, the shaded regions represent the range of values obtained across all 25 sample paths, highlighting the variability of the results.  The two different line colors represent the results obtained with different step sizes (\u03c4\u2081 = 2 and \u03c4\u2081 = 120). The figure demonstrates the algorithm's convergence behavior and the effect of step size on convergence speed and variability.", "section": "Numerical Illustrations"}, {"figure_path": "XMQTNzlgTJ/figures/figures_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of our theoretical upper bound in Theorem 11 and the empirical stationarity measure of sm-AGDA for Problem (13). Results are reported as cumulative distribution functions.", "description": "The figure compares the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the theoretical upper bound on the stationarity measure from Theorem 11 with the empirical CDF obtained from 1000 sample paths of the sm-AGDA algorithm for Problem (13). The theoretical CDF provides an upper bound on the quantiles of the stationarity measure. The empirical CDF shows the actual distribution of the stationarity measure observed in the simulations.  The plot shows that the theoretical bounds are reasonably tight, especially at higher quantiles. The difference between the two curves may be because the theoretical quantiles are designed to capture the worst-case behavior across the class of NCPL problems, while the specific NCPL example used in the simulations may not necessarily represent a worst-case scenario.", "section": "Numerical Illustrations"}, {"figure_path": "XMQTNzlgTJ/figures/figures_8_3.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Histograms for the stationarity measure log10 || f(xt, Yt) || 2 for sm-AGDA and baseline algorithms (SAPD+, SMDA, and SMDAVR) on a9a, gisette, and sido0 datasets.

Each algorithm was run 200 times. The histograms show the distribution of the stationarity measure at two different points in the training process: after 20 epochs (first row) and at the end of training (second row).  This visualization helps to compare the convergence behavior and the concentration of the stationarity measure for each algorithm.", "section": "Numerical Illustrations"}]
