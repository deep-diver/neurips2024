It shows the complexity (number of stochastic gradient calls) needed to achieve a certain level of stationarity (defined by different metrics) with a specified probability for different problem classes (convex-concave, monotone variational inequality, and nonconvex-PL). The table highlights whether each method allows for nonconvexity in the primal variable.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
