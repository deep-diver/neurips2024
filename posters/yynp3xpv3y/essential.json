This often leads to unpredictable behavior in real-world scenarios, hindering the adoption of data-driven models. The challenge lies in ensuring stability not just around training data but across the entire state space.  Prior works often struggle with this issue due to limitations in expressing complex dynamics. \nThis paper introduces Extended Linearized Contracting Dynamics (ELCD), a novel approach that uses **extended linearization and latent space transformations** to guarantee global stability, equilibrium contractivity, and global contractivity.  The authors prove these properties theoretically.  ELCD demonstrates superior performance on high-dimensional datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art models; achieving notably better results in trajectory fitting and generalization.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "YYnP3Xpv3y/podcast.wav"}
