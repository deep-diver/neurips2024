The left panel shows an ELCD model trained without a transformation; its trajectories converge quickly to the equilibrium point, reflecting the model's inherent contractivity. The right panel displays an ELCD model that utilizes a learned transformation, and its trajectories more closely match the behavior of a vector field that is contractive with respect to a non-Euclidean metric. This highlights the importance of the coordinate transformation for capturing complex dynamics that may not fit the standard ELCD framework.", "section": "3.4 On the Interdependence of Diffeomorphism and Learned Dynamics"}, {"figure_path": "YYnP3Xpv3y/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Plots of the vector fields and induced trajectories learned by ELCD (Top) and NCDS (Bottom) after different training epochs.

The top row shows ELCD's vector field and trajectories, demonstrating consistent contraction towards a single equilibrium point across all epochs. The bottom row shows NCDS, where the vector field and trajectories exhibit multiple equilibria and divergence, indicating a failure to maintain consistent contraction during training.", "section": "3.6 Training"}, {"figure_path": "YYnP3Xpv3y/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Plots of the 2D LASA data.
