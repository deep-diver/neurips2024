Different molecular properties have datasets with varying accuracies and data sources, hindering model training and prediction.  For example, accurate equilibrium structures are expensive to compute, leading to reliance on lower-accuracy data for larger datasets. This limits the performance of multi-task models.  Existing multi-task learning methods are insufficient to overcome these limitations. \nThis paper introduces a novel approach to address this heterogeneity by using 'physical consistency' between molecular properties (e.g., energy and structure). The authors propose consistency training approaches.  These ensure that predictions from different tasks align with known physical laws, enabling information exchange and accuracy improvements.  **The method successfully leverages more accurate energy data to improve structure prediction and integrates data from force and off-equilibrium structures**, demonstrating the broad applicability of this approach to heterogeneous molecular data.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GnF9tavqgc/podcast.wav"}
