It highlights the differences in their sampling strategies (adaptive, uniform, apriori fixed anchors), the assumptions made (bounded spikiness, incoherence, noiseless), and their resulting sample complexities.  LME, the method proposed in this paper, stands out for its adaptive sampling, milder assumption (bounded spikiness), and order-optimal sample complexity. The table shows that existing methods either require strong incoherence assumptions or have complexities that are not order-optimal.", "section": "1 Leveraged matrix estimation with entry-wise guarantees"}, {"figure_path": "HavKlV22xJ/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of methods with entry-wise guarantees.
