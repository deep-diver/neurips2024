[{"figure_path": "LGG1IQhbOr/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (a) and (b): Mixture of Gaussians. (a) shows samples obtained from semi FB Euler at iteration 40 and (b) shows KL divergence along the training process: semi FB Euler with sound theory is as fast as FB Euler. We also show the ULA\u2019s final result as a horizontal line for reference; (c) and (d): Relaxed von Mises-Fisher. (c) shows true probability density, and (d) shows the sample histogram obtained from semi FB Euler. In this experiment, FB Euler fails to work, attributed to the high curvature of the relaxed von Mises-Fisher.", "description": "This figure contains four subfigures visualizing the results of the semi FB Euler algorithm applied to Gaussian Mixture and Relaxed von Mises-Fisher distributions.  Subfigure (a) shows a heatmap of samples generated by the algorithm for Gaussian Mixture. Subfigure (b) is a plot showing KL divergence vs. number of iterations for semi FB Euler, FB Euler, and ULA algorithms, highlighting the faster convergence of the semi FB Euler method. Subfigures (c) and (d) show the true probability density and a histogram of samples obtained by the semi FB Euler algorithm, respectively, for the Relaxed von Mises-Fisher distribution; FB Euler failed for this case.
