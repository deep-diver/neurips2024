When the density depends on only a few variables or, more generally, is supported on a low-dimensional manifold, it is known that the curse of dimensionality can be circumvented by substituting the ambient dimension $d$ with the effective dimension $s$ (e.g. Lafferty and Wasserman, 2008; Yang and Tokdar, 2015).

We treat both cases where $G$ is a priori known, and where it is unknown but is in some known subset of all graphs. The graph $G$ encodes the underlying dependence structure between the variables, which we hope simplifies the estimation problem. For example, when $P$ is a Gaussian, this gives rise to the well-known Gaussian graphical model (Speed and Kiiveri, 1986), and various extensions of this idea to nonparametric settings are known, including trees (Liu et al., 2011; Gy\u00f6rf iet al., 2022) and nonparanormal models (Liu et al., 2009). While this line of work also discusses the problem of structure learning, our focus is on the problem of nonparametric density estimation, which is comparatively understudied in graphical models. This may come as a surprise given the outsized literature on the general density estimation problem; see Section 2 for an overview of related work.

To capture the effective dimension of the problem and its resulting sample complexity, we introduce the concept of graph resilience.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
