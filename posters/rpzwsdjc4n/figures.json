It shows how the method takes a point cloud as input, processes it through a 3D backbone network to generate a feature map. Then, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is applied to decompose the feature map into concept activation maps. These are aggregated to obtain a global concept activation map.  Simultaneously, object-specific gradients are computed and used to refine the global map, generating an object-specific saliency map for each detection. Finally, voxel upsampling aligns the scales between the activation map and the input point cloud, resulting in a final object-specific saliency map that highlights important points for each detection.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "rpZWSDjc4N/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Saliency maps for SECOND [36] and CenterPoint [37].
