InstructGPT [Ouyang et al., 2022] fine-tunes GPT-3 like models [Brown et al., 2020] to enhance helpfulness by combining SFT with RL based on human preference dataset. Askell et al. [2021] trains a preference model for aligning the LLM with human values. It argues that ranked preference modeling proves to be the most effective training objective for distinguishing between desirable and undesirable LLM behaviors. Bai et al. [2022] incorporates an iterative online training mode where preference model and LLM are updated weekly using fresh human feedback data. Existing research acknowledges the inherent complexity, instability, and hyperparameter sensitivity of RLHF, particularly when employing PPO Zheng et al. [2023]. Several works have attempted to address these challenges by introducing maxentropy regularization [Wen et al., 2024], hyperparameter tuning [Zheng et al., 2023], and reward shaping [Yang et al., 2024a]. However, these methods does not show significant improvement over the vanilla PPO algorithm.

Under the interaction relationship (cooperation, competition, mixed), multi-agent could spontaneously emerge complex and diverse policies, so as to solve the complex problems that single-agent reinforcement learning is difficult to solve. For example, in Kim et al. [2023], the RL based prompt tuning is decomposed into multi-agent joint tuning. The huge joint action space is equally split across agents, learning better and longer prompt. Such mechanisms have also been applied in the field of combinatorial optimization. The paper that is most similar to us on the architecture of agent training is Gao et al. [2023]. It proposes an asymmetric training symmetric execution framework to deal with the two-agent Stackelberg game Fang et al. [2021]. In the Stackelberg game, two agents make decisions asynchronously. The agent that makes the decision later can observe the former agent, but the former agent cannot observe the later agent. The training framework proposed by the authors is able to converge in Stackelberg equilibrium empirically.

This can be attributed to our extension of single-agent RL fine-tuning into a cooperative MARL version. In this section, we delve into a discussion of how the multi-agent learning can benefti LLM fine-tuning. The primary benefit is that multi-agent learning encourages the coevolution of LLMs through collective living, social relationships and major evolutionary transitions [Du\u00e9\u00f1ez-Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2023]. This process generates a variety of new data, which further facilitates coevolution. This mechanism contributes to many breakthroughs in games AI, such as Go [Silver et al., 2016, 2017, Clark and Storkey, 2015], StarCraft II [Vinyals et al., 2019], and Diplomacy [Bakhtin et al., 2022].

These approaches create an auto-curriculum mechanism driven by a natural arms race, which propels agent learning and enables mastery of complex tasks.

These mechanisms enable the two LLM agents to learn collaboratively, and after the fine-tuning process, either the LLM agent can be chosen to perform the task independently. We also provide an in-depth analysis of RL fine-tune from the perspective of multi-objective RL, revealing the existence of a Pareto frontier between KL divergence and task reward. We empirically illustrate that CORY has an advantage over single-agent RL method in approaching the Pareto frontier. Experiment results indicate that CORY surpasses PPO regarding policy optimality, resilience to distribution collapse, and robustness during training, highlighting its potential as an advanced method for improving LLMs in practical applications.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
