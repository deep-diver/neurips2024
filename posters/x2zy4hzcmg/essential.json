Model Predictive Shielding (MPS), a popular SRL approach, uses a backup policy to ensure safety, but this often hinders progress.  Existing MPS methods' backup policies are conservative and task-oblivious, leading to high recovery regret and suboptimal performance. \n\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Model Predictive Shielding (DMPS) to overcome these limitations. **DMPS employs a local planner to dynamically choose safe recovery actions** that optimize both short-term progress and long-term rewards.  The planner and neural policy work synergistically; the planner uses the neural policy's Q-function to estimate long-term rewards, and the neural policy learns from the planner's actions.  **DMPS guarantees safety during and after training, with theoretically proven bounded recovery regret**. Experiments show **DMPS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both safety and reward**.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "x2zY4hZcmg/podcast.wav"}
