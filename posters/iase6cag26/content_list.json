Figure 1 illustrates a toy example of such uncertain correspondences. Firstly, the weak semantic associations among diverse modal knowledge of entities pose a considerable challenge in inter-modal enhancement. In $M M K G_{1}$ , \u201cTwilight\u201d has attributes \u201cRelease Date\u201d and \u201cRuntime Duration\u201d along with an image of a movie poster containing two roles. The poster does not include content that could semantically overlap with these attributes, which makes it hard to capture their feature commonality to perform inter-modal enhancement. Secondly, the distinct descriptive manners of entities across different MMKGs complicate the matching of attributes with the same meanings between aligned entities. For instance, \u201cRelease Date\u201d for \u201cTwilight\u201d in $M M K G_{1}$ and \u201cDebut Date\u201d for \u201cTwilight (flim)\u201d in $M M K G_{2}$ both mean the initial release date of the movie. This requires a more profound semantic understanding to ascertain if they convey the same meanings. Thirdly, MMKGs often lack complete entity knowledge, with certain modalities entirely devoid of data. This impedes the differentiation of whether two entities are aligned, as this distinction can be readily misled by consistent modality features of unaligned entities. Due to missing attributes for \u201cKristen Stewart\u201d in $M M K G_{1}$ and images for \u201cKStew\u201d in $M M K G_{2}$ , there is a high chance of erroneous matching \u201cBella Swan\u201d in $M M K G_{2}$ based on its visual similarity to \u201cKristen Stewart\u201d.

Therefore, entity alignment was proposed to match the identical entities in various KGs for their integration [9]. Existing methods mainly rely on entity embedding techniques, which can be grouped into triple-based embedding [53, 31] and neighborbased embedding [36, 42]. Triple-based embedding defines an energy function to measure the plausibility of triples. For example, MTransE [9] adopted TransE [2] as the entity encoder to embed different KGs into independent vector spaces and then learned the transitions between aligned entities. IPTransE [53] implemented an iterative strategy and employed it to supplement probably aligned entities into the training set. Neighbor-based embedding exploits the subgraph structure organized by partial relations between entities. For instance, GCN-Align [36] used graph convolutional networks to aggregate the neighborhood information of entities. MixTEA [42] instructed the graph model learning by an end-to-end mixture teaching of manually labeled mappings and probabilistic pseudo mappings.

Due to the urgent demand for the integration of MMKGs, extensive research has been dedicated to multi-modal entity alignment [23, 6, 21, 19]. Initially, multi-modal entity alignment was regarded as a special type of link prediction task, aiming to connect entities through the \u201cSameAs\u201d relation [23]. Subsequently, the first attempt in multi-modal entity alignment introduced the pioneering MMEA [5] approach, which transferred multi-modal representations into a unified space by minimizing the distance between the fused embeddings and each uni-modal embedding. Later, Liu et al. [22] believed that visual modality has abundant features as the advantage, thus leveraging visual similarities to augment the training data by iteratively adding aligned pairs. The previous studies employed independent encoders for feature extraction of each modality, without considering interactions between different modalities. Therefore, MSNEA [6] proposed a modality interaction mechanism to guide relationship learning and attribute selection using visual features, and designed multi-modal contrastive learning to make features of aligned entities more similar. Owing to the impact of contextual gaps on effectiveness, ACK-MMEA [19] utilized merge and generate operators to build an attribute-consistent MMKG, and aggregated the consistent information through graph neural networks.

An attribute triple can be denoted as $(e,a,v)\\in\\tau_{A}$ . Aligning attributes across different MMKGs is challenging due to the variations in the expression of identical attributes. It necessitates more than a basic lexical comparison and requires a profound semantic understanding to ascertain whether attributes with different labels indeed represent the same concept. Recently, the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs have been proven across multiple tasks [1, 8, 10]. The pre-existing knowledge within LLMs can help bridge gaps in information that may not be explicitly stated. Moreover, in-context learning [37, 52] is a prompt engineering method where task demonstrations are included in the prompt.

For attribute alignment, the prompt is devised as shown in Appendix A. As the attributes that cannot be aligned often become noise [45], we only retain those attributes that can be aligned according to the results of GPT 3.5.

Specifically, we have the following findings. First, TMEA exhibits significant improvements with a notable margin compared to not only traditional but also multimodal methods. Compared to the strongest traditional alignment method, BootEA, TMEA achieves at least a $168.4\\%$ , $63.0\\%$ , and $118.3\\%$ improvement in $\\operatorname{H@1}$ , $\\mathrm{H}@10$ , and MRR on two datasets, respectively.

Besides, we test the statistical significance and the results suggest TMEA has significant improvements $(p\\mathrm{-}v a l u e<0.001)$ over baselines. Second, comparing multi-modal entity alignment methods to traditional ones, we observe a clear advantage in favor of multi-modal approaches in most cases. TMEA, MSNEA, and MCLEA surpass all traditional approaches, which suggests the effect of leveraging the rich and varied information that multi-modal knowledge provides. This additional context and modeling allow for a more comprehensive depiction of entity features, facilitating a more accurate determination of potential alignments. Third, our TMEA method, leveraging only $20\\%$ of aligned entity pairs for training, achieves a remarkable $\\mathrm{H}@10$ score of 0.944 and 0.916 on two datasets. This large margin of superiority over other multi-modal entity alignment methods can be attributed to the considering and effective tackling of uncertain correspondences in the alignment process.

In MKE, to address the diversity of descriptive manners of attribute knowledge, we particularly designed alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporated the LLM and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. To mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we devised a Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module to complete the missing modality by unifying diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via VAEs based on existing modal features. For enhancing the semantic associations between modalities, we invented an intermodal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints in Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement (MCE) module. Finally, extensive experiments on two realworld datasets were conducted to verify the effectiveness of TMEA with a significant improvement over competitive baselines.

Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "3.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
