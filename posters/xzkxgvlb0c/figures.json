(a) depicts the causal direction where X1 and X2 are parents of Y (causes). (b) shows the anticausal direction where X1 and X2 are children of Y (effects). These graphs are fundamental to the study of causal vs. anticausal merging of predictors discussed in the paper. The asymmetry between these directions is the central theme of the paper.", "section": "3 Known predictor covariances"}, {"figure_path": "xZKXGvLB0c/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Decision boundaries of the solution of CMAXENT in the causal (left) and anticausal (right) direction when we do not have the covariance between the predictor variables \u03a31,2.", "description": "This figure shows the decision boundaries resulting from causal and anticausal merging of predictors using the CMAXENT method when the covariance between the two predictors is unknown.  The left panel displays the decision boundary when the causal direction is assumed, which resembles a logistic regression. The right panel shows the decision boundary under the anticausal assumption, similar to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The different shapes of the boundaries highlight how causal assumptions affect the model's interpretation of the data, even with similar data distributions.", "section": "Partially known covariances"}]
