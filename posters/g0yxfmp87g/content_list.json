Before the advent of LLMs, transformer-based language models [52, 53, 54, 55] demonstrated their ability to effectively analyze relationships among tokens in complex input sequences, facilitated by the attention mechanism [52]. These models also exhibit notable scalability [56, 57, 58] with respect to model size and the scale of pre-training datasets. This decent scalability has led to the emergence of LLMs, such as GLM [59], OPT [60], BLOOM [61], the Llama family [1, 1, 2], Gemma [3], and GPT-4 [4], which exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning capabilities. However, these LLMs often feature billions of parameters and prohibitive computation complexity, which limits their widespread use across diverse platforms. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Large language model compression. To facilitate efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications, existing works primarily focus on compressing LLMs by extending traditional compression techniques such as knowledge distillation [62, 63], quantization [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69], system acceleration [70, 71], and pruning [6, 5, 72]. Our work is most closely related to LLM pruning. Along this direction, early works [5, 6] employ unstructured and semi-structured pruning [73] by zeroing out connections among neurons. Despite their plausible performance, these methods require specialized support to achieve real-device speedup. To benefti commodity platforms, structured LLM pruning methods remove more coarse-grained components, such as all connections related to a single neuron [7, 8, 10] or even entire layers [9, 33]. For instance, LLM-Pruner [7] and FLAP [8] reduce LLM width by eliminating identified redundant neurons, while Sheared-LLaMA [10] learns a set of binary masks to reduce both the width and depth of LLMs. However, these methods either focus on a single dimension of compression (i.e., depth or width) with limited efficiency improvements, or they require a costly fine-tuning process for each target configuration and platform. In contrast, our AmoebaLLM can instantly extract subnets of arbitrary shapes that reach the accuracy-efficiency frontier, thus facilitating rapid deployment across devices. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "One-for-all networks. Slimmable networks [74, 75] are pioneering works that enable a single model to operate at varying widths. Follow-up works [11, 76, 12, 13, 14, 15] further extend this approach to train more general one-for-all networks with switchable depth and width, thus enabling tasks like neural architecture search. In particular, BigNAS [11] builds one-for-all networks using a sandwich sampling strategy that samples a random set of subnets and jointly trains them in each iteration through in-place distillation, where the largest model guides the learning of the smaller ones. This approach has been inherited by subsequent works [12, 13, 14]. Additionally, this idea has been extended to any-precision networks [77, 78, 79] that allow switchable precision at runtime. A very recent work [80] has further extended this concept to any-precision LLMs. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Nevertheless, directly applying these methods to the depth and width of pre-trained LLMs would likely fail because their subnet sampling strategies often select the first layers of a model or the first channels of a layer, which are intended for models trained from scratch. This approach is unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs, as it may omit layers or neurons containing crucial knowledge. Our AmoebaLLM framework addresses these challenges by developing three key components: the subnet selection strategy, the trainable adapter design, and the fine-tuning objective. One concurrent work [81] also aims to train many-in-one LLMs that support instant subnet derivation, targeting a full-model continual training setting on 90 billion tokens. In contrast, our method targets a parameter-efficient tuning setting with only 8.5 million fine-tuning tokens.

Extensive experiments validate that our AmoebaLLM framework can deliver efficient LLMs with instantly serviceable subnets of any shape, which outperform SOTA LLM compression techniques in terms of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
