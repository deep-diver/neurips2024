They have also been selected for their diversity in terms of the PDE types as they contain linear (4) and nonlinear (11), time-dependent (12) and time-independent (3), elliptic (2), parabolic (1), hyperbolic (4) and mixedtype (8). The tasks also cover a wide gamut of physical processes across a range of spatio-temporal scales. Moreover, we emphasize that each of the downstream tasks is out-of-distribution with respect to the pretraining data. While 6 of them do pertain to the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations seen in the pretraining dataset but with very different data distributions, the remaining 9 involve PDEs not seen during pretraining. These include 3 (NS-Tracer-PwC, FNS-KF, GCE-RT) which add new physical processes (tracer transport, forcing, gravity) to the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. 3 more (Wave-Gauss, Wave-Layer, ACE) involve completely new time-dependent PDEs (Wave Eqn., Allen-Cahn Eqn.) and the final 3 (SE-AF, Poisson-Gauss, Helmholtz) even consider time-independent PDEs, which is in stark contrast to the pretraining dataset where only 2 time-dependent PDEs are covered. For these steady state PDEs, we finetune them by using the interpretation of the PDE (2) as a long-time limit of the time-dependent PDE (1) with a normalized lead time of 1. Finally, the tasks have also been selected to probe the ability of the foundation model to handle different task or operator types. To this end, we point out that all the operators in the pretraining dataset simply map the initial conditions to the solution at later times in time-dependent fluid flows on the two-dimensional unit square with periodic boundary conditions. While some of the downstream tasks (8 out of 15) do pertain to this type of operators, the remaining (7 out of 15) tasks involve different types of operators which include operators mapping the coefficients or PDE parameters to the PDE solution (5 out of 15), forcing term to the PDE solution (2) and domain shape to the PDE solution. Moreover, many of the downstream tasks are with non-periodic boundary conditions while one of them is even on a non-Cartesian domain. Thus, these downstream tasks deviate from the setup of the pretraining operators and provide a hierarchy of challenges for any foundation model.

In order to understand the surprising ability of POSEIDON to generalize so well to unseen and a priori unrelated PDEs and physical processes downstream, we present three case studies in SM D.4 to uncover some of the inner workings of this foundation model. In particular, we first consider the CE-RPUI downstream task. This task pertains to the compressible Euler equations, which are included in the pretraining dataset. However, the underlying initial data distribution is not seen during pretraining, making the task out-of-distribution. We show in SM D.4.1, how POSEIDON leverages different features of different operators from the pretraining dataset to learn this task accurately with very few samples (see SM Figure 39). In particular, the diversity of the pretraining dataset is more instrumental in ensuring better generalization to this unseen initial condition than the size of the dataset. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "In SM D.4.3, we study the Poisson-Gauss task to understand arguably the most surprising finding about the POSEIDON foundation models, i.e., their ability to generalize well to PDEs that are completely unrelated to the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics. This task pertains to the Poisson equation (68) with a forcing term, which is a superposition of Gaussians. The task is very different from those seen during pretraining in multiple ways, namely the underlying PDE is not only time-independent (in contrast to the time-dependent PDEs of pretraining) but also elliptic (whereas the PDEs during pretraining are either hyperbolic or convection-dominated) and the boundary conditions are Dirichlet (instead of Periodic) leading to very different physics, that of diffusion and smoothing, being manifested for this task, when contrasted with the physics seen during pretraining which is dominated by transport, shock wave propagation and fluid mixing. Given this context, one would not expect POSEIDON to perform well on this task. Yet, from SM Figures 20 and 74, we know that POSEIDON performs exceptionally well, learning the solution operator accurately with a few samples. As we elaborate in SM D.4.3, POSEIDON does not use the first few training examples to forget the physics that it has learned during pretraining and learn the new physics for this task after that. Rather surprisingly, as illustrated in SM Figure 43, already with one task specific training example, POSEIDON outputs an (approximation of the) input, rather than the expected dynamic evolution of fluids with Gaussian inputs (see SM Figures 56 and 60) seen during pretraining. Then, with very few (16) examples, it is able to learn the rudiments of diffusion and smoothing of features (SM Figure 43), which are characteristics of elliptic equations. To further test how the foundation model leverages physics representations learned during pretraining, we froze the latent space by only finetuning the embeddings and freezing the latent space parameters by setting $\\widehat{\\theta}_{r}=\\widehat{\\theta}_{*}\\$ for all $r$ , in (10) for finetuning.

In this paper, we have presented POSEIDON, a family of foundation models for learning PDEs. The backbone of POSEIDON is scOT, a multiscale vision transformer with shifted-windowed (SwinV2) attention that maps input functions (initial data, coefficients, sources) etc. to the solution (trajectory) of a PDE. Lead-time conditioning through a time-modulated layer norm allows for continuous-in-time evaluation and a novel all2all training strategy enables the scaling up of training data by leveraging the semi-group structure of solutions of time-dependent PDEs. POSEIDON is pretrained on a diverse large-scale dataset of operators for the compressible Euler and incompressible Navier-Stokes PDEs. Its performance is evaluated on a challenging suite of 15 out-of-distribution downstream tasks covering a wide variety of PDEs and data distributions. POSEIDON displays excellent downstream performance and is the best performing model on 14 of the 15 tasks. In particular, it requires orders of magnitude (median of 50) fewer task-specific samples to attain the same error as the widely used FNO. This large gain in sample efficiency as well as order of magnitude gains in accuracy also holds for PDEs that are not seen during pretraining, making us conclude that POSEIDON generalizes well to new physics. POSEIDON also scales with model and dataset size, with respect to pretraining and even downstream task performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it has been clearly demonstrated that by pretraining on a very small set of PDEs, a foundation model can generalize to a wider variety of unseen and unrelated PDEs and data distributions downstream. Thus, we provide an affirmative answer to the very fundamental question of whether foundation models for PDEs are even feasible. Moreover, we investigate possible mechanisms via which POSEIDON can effectively leverage representations, learnt during pretraining, to accurately learn downstream tasks by finetuning on a few task-specific examples. Our case studies suggest hitherto undiscovered relationships between different PDEs that enable this transfer to materialize. Finally, all the models are made publicly available, as well as the pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced in the PDEGYM collection.

The foundation model of [67] is limited to very specific elliptic Poisson and Helmholtz PDEs with a FNO backbone whereas ICON [74] considers a very small 1-D dataset. Neither of these models are comparable in scope to POSEIDON. Universal physics transformers [1] employs transformers but its focus is on incompressible fluid flows and the ability to generalize across Eulerian and Lagrangian data. Thus, a direct comparison with POSEIDON is not possible. On the other hand, MPP [49] and DPOT [19] are designed to be general purpose foundation models for PDEs that can be compared to POSEIDON. We have already extensively compared MPP with POSEIDON in Section 3 to demonstrate the very large superiority of POSEIDON across various metrics. Although DPOT has a different architecture (Adaptive FNO) and was trained on more datasets than MPP, it follows a similar training and evaluation strategy of next time-step prediction, given a context window of previous time-steps. As argued before, this does not solve the operator learning task of generating the entire trajectory, given initial data. At the time of writing this paper, DPOT was not publicly available but it was released by the time this paper has been revised, enabling us to modify the fine-tuning procedure of DPOT and to perform comparisons between it and POSEIDON. While directing the interested reader to SM D.5 for details, we summarize our findings by observing that POSEIDON models are significantly better performing than DPOT foundation models, both in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency.

In particular, pretraining with time-independent PDEs (particularly elliptic PDEs) as well as a larger range of time-scales in time-dependent PDEs will greatly enhance POSEIDON. The focus here was on Cartesian geometries although POSEIDON displayed the ability to generalize to non-Cartesian geometries, via masking, on the SE-AF task. We plan to add several non-Cartesian examples in the pretraining dataset to augment POSEIDON\u2019s performance on general geometries/boundary conditions. Moreover, given the fact that POSEIDON serves as a fast and accurate neural PDE surrogate, its extension to qualitatively different downstream tasks such as uncertainty quantification [45], inverse problems [53] and PDE-constrained optimization [46] is fairly straightforward and will be considered in future work.

The quality of approximation continues to improve with 32 and 128 downstream trajectories, as shown in the right-most columns of Figure 39.

However, it is precisely these perturbations that are responsible for the roll-up of small-scale vortices that are absent in the CE-RP operator.

Perhaps, the model leverages shock propagation from CE-RP, large vortex roll-ups from CE-KH and small-scale vortex dynamics, as well as curved shock propagation, from CE-CRP in order to provide very good approximation with a few training examples on CE-RPUI. A partial test of this hypothesis is to check if the model, pretrained with the less-diverse dataset that excludes CE-CRP performs worse than the model pretrained with the full dataset. This is already shown in Figure 30 (Right) where the performance of the model, pretrained with the less-diverse dataset is worse than the model trained with the similarly sized but fully diverse dataset. This behavior is further reinforced from Figure 40, where the approximation of the same sample, considered in Figure 39, with these ablated models is shown. As predicted, the model pretrained on the less diverse dataset is clearly less accurate at resolving small-scale vortices than the competing one trained on the more-diverse dataset.
