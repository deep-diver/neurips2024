Approximate QSP (AQSP) offers scalability but typically involves iterative parameter optimization, leading to long runtimes. This limits the practical applications of AQSP in near-term quantum computers. \nThis research introduces SuperEncoder, a pre-trained classical neural network model. It directly estimates the optimal parameters of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to approximate any quantum state without the need for iterative optimization.  **SuperEncoder eliminates the time-consuming iterative process of AQSP, making quantum computations faster and more scalable.** The proposed method shows improvement in fidelity compared to existing approaches. The authors verify SuperEncoder's effectiveness on both synthetic data and various downstream tasks.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "r7mj17BKzw/podcast.wav"}
