Existing methods like sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) have limitations in MMDG due to modality competition (modalities compete for resources, hindering generalization) and discrepant uni-modal flatness (modalities have inconsistent flat minima, making it hard to find a good solution for all). This paper identifies these challenges as major roadblocks to effective MMDG. \nTo overcome these, the paper proposes Cross-Modal Representation Flattening (CMRF). CMRF optimizes the representation-space loss landscape instead of the parameter space, building connections directly between modalities.  It uses a novel method to flatten high-loss regions between minima from different modalities by creating and optimizing interpolated representations, assigning different weights based on generalization capabilities.  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets showcase the effectiveness of CMRF under various settings, proving that it outperforms existing methods.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "UixTytSVOl/podcast.wav"}
