The metrics used are PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS for albedo, environment map, and relighting.  MAE is also reported for roughness. The table highlights the superior performance of the proposed method (Ours) in achieving high-quality results across all metrics. The coloring helps to quickly identify the best, second best, and third-best performing methods for each metric.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "y7oxY5pq4j/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative evaluations.
