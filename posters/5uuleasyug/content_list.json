Meanwhile, the generated gestures should synchronize with the speaker\u2019s rhythm, emotional cues, and intentions [31, 1, 8, 42]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Recent works in co-speech gesture generation have shown great progress [11, 46, 67, 66, 2, 62]. By introducing new datasets [71] and more modalities [70, 33], previous work achieved end-to-end gesture generation based on RNN-based models [11, 46]. With the success of transformer in nature language processing [58] and video sequence modeling [26, 27, 75], recent works [8, 43, 55] leverage the power of attention mechanism to generate more expressive gestures that better synchronize with speech. By further combining emotional and style related features, EMoG [69] achieve better quality gesture generation. With the development in human recognition model [37], EMAGE [32] proposes a masked audio-gesture modeling strategy to enhance unified holistic gesture synthesis. Recently, with the development of diffusion model in generative tasks [39, 20, 40], the latest works [74, 2, 62, 7, 65] have applied the diffusion model to gesture synthesis, significantly improving the diversity of generated gesture. DiffuseStyleGesture [63] presents a diffusion model-based approach for generating diverse co-speech gestures by incorporating cross-local attention and self-attention mechanisms, and utilizing classifier-free guidance for style control. DiffuseStyleGesture+ [66] further considers the text modality as an additional input and utilizes channel concatenation to merge the text feature with the audio feature. Deichler et al. [9] also incorporates the text modality as an additional input and employs contrastive learning to enhance the features. However, the exploration of generation for co-speech gesture sequences with low latency remains relatively uncharted, constraining its application in dynamic, interactive environments. RNN-based models often struggle with the longterm forgetting issue [54, 29], which impairs their ability to generate long sequences of gestures effectively. Additionally, these models may produce gestures that lack variability, tending towards an average representation [36]. Transformer-based models depend heavily on subtle positional encoding to capture the order of input elements [44, 50, 73]. Meanwhile, their computational complexity, which grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, poses a challenge for generating long sequences of gestures. For the diffusion-based model, the intricate sampling strategy and iterative process lead to high computational expenses [48], which hinder their broad adoption in gesture generation scenarios.

These advancements have been integrated into large-scale representation models [38, 41]. Some pioneering works have applied SSMs for tasks like language understanding [38, 41], content-based reasoning [12], and visual recognition [35, 57].

Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into three groups: (i) Rule-based methods: These methods rely on pre-defined rules and gesture libraries to generate gestures based on speech features [23, 56]. While offering interpretable results, they require significant manual effort in creating gesture datasets and defining rules. (ii) Statistical models: These approaches leverage data-driven techniques to learn mapping rules between speech and gestures, often employing pre-defined gesture units [22, 25]. While overcoming the limitations of manual rule creation, these methods still rely on handcrafted features. (iii) Deep learning methods: Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled neural networks to capture the complex relationship between speech and gestures directly from raw multimodal data [70, 33, 68, 32]. This progress has established deep learning approaches, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [70, 33, 61], transformers [4, 45], and diffusion models [2, 74, 51, 72, 21, 6], as the prevailing paradigm for co-speech gesture generation. However, each of these models suffers from certain limitations that hinder their performance. RNNs inherently process sequences in a serial manner, where each timestep\u2019s computation depends on the output of the previous timestep. This limits their ability to efficiently handle long sequences and introduces cumulative latency. Meanwhile, RNNs lack inherent parallelism, further restricting their potential for high-speed computation. Transformers consider all positions within a sequence at every timestep, resulting in high computational complexity, especially for long sequences. While diffusion models significantly enhance the diversity of generated outputs, the sampling process is computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations, our method investigates the capacity of selective state space models in the field of gesture synthesis.

In each evaluation session, participants were presented with 20 seconds video clips generated by various models. They were instructed to assess the clips across the following dimensions: (i) naturalness, (ii) appropriateness, (iii) synchrony and (iv) smoothness. For naturalness, they evaluated the similarity of the generated gestures to those made by humans, paying attention to the authenticity and smoothness of the movements. In terms of appropriateness, they considered the alignment of the gestures with the spoken content, taking into account both the explicit meaning and the underlying semantics. For synchrony assessment, they examined the timing of the gestures in relation to the speech rhythm, audio, and facial expressions to ensure a harmonious and integrated performance. For smoothness, they assessed the gestures for any abrupt stops or unnatural jerks that might indicate a lack of fluidity in motion.

We measured the runtime of various components on the NVIDIA A100 GPU in our method over three runs and presented the average results in Table 5.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
