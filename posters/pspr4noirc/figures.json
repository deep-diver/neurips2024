It starts with a high-level natural language instruction from a user.

Next, a diffusion model is used to generate crystal structures based on the top-ranked formulas.

The diffusion model in GenMS represents crystal structures by the x, y, z location of each atom plus the atom number a represented as a continuous value. Each atom undergoes blocks consisting of multi-layer perceptrons followed by order-invariant self-attention. The MLP and self-attention blocks are repeated k times where each repetition increases the dimension of the hidden units. The concatenation of skip connections are employed as in other U-Net architectures.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the diffusion model used in GenMS for generating crystal structures.  The model uses a compact representation of crystals, where each atom is represented by its x, y, z coordinates and atomic number (as a continuous value).  The model consists of multiple blocks, each containing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) followed by an order-invariant self-attention mechanism.  These blocks are repeated to increase the dimensionality of the hidden units.  Skip connections are used to enhance information flow between different layers, similar to the U-Net architecture.", "section": "2.3 Choices of parametrization for the submodules"}, {"figure_path": "PsPR4NOiRC/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Qualitative evaluation.

The formation energies are predicted by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The results indicate that selecting the best out of 10 samples significantly improves the energy compared to using just a single sample for about 80% of the 1000 compositions tested.
