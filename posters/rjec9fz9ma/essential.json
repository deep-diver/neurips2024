Existing methods often struggle to address this imbalance effectively, leading to poor performance on the under-represented classes.  This is especially problematic in real-world scenarios where data imbalance is common.  This research focuses on Neural Collapse (NC), a recently observed phenomenon where the output features and classifier weights of a neural network converge to optimal geometric structures. However, the relationship between these optimal structures and classification performance in imbalanced datasets remains unclear.\nThe study introduces a novel technique called Neural Collapse to Multiple Centers (NCMC), where features from different classes collapse to distinct centers. This is achieved using a new Cosine Loss function, which is shown to induce NCMC in an unconstrained feature model. The number of centers for each class is dynamically determined using a class-aware strategy, further enhancing performance. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets, showing the effectiveness of NCMC in handling imbalanced data and improving the classification accuracy for minority classes.", "affiliation": "Shanxi University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "RJEC9fZ9Ma/podcast.wav"}
