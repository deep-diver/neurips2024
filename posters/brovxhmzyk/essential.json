These methods typically employ pre-defined reasoning strategies that may not be optimal for every problem.  This limitation hinders LLMs' ability to solve complex reasoning problems effectively.  \n\nTo overcome this, the researchers developed SELF-DISCOVER, a framework that allows LLMs to autonomously discover the most effective reasoning structures for a given task.  This approach significantly enhances LLMs' performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, achieving improvements as high as 32% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, SELF-DISCOVER is significantly more efficient, requiring substantially less computational resources.  The discovered reasoning structures show universality, working well across different LLM families. The findings suggest that enabling LLMs to self-compose their reasoning processes leads to superior problem-solving abilities.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "BROvXhmzYK/podcast.wav"}
