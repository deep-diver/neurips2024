Existing methods struggle to efficiently capture label correlations and quantify uncertainty, hindering the effectiveness of active learning.  This often leads to suboptimal selection of data points for labeling, wasting valuable resources. \nThe paper introduces Evidential Mixture Machines (EMM), which uses a mixture of Bernoulli models to efficiently represent the label space and combines this with evidential learning to predict weight coefficients. This innovative approach provides fine-grained uncertainty information, allowing for better active sample selection.  EMM incorporates a novel multi-source uncertainty metric which considers both predicted label embedding covariances and evidential uncertainty, leading to improved performance.  Experimental results demonstrate that EMM outperforms existing MLAL methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "affiliation": "Rochester Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "n5lLSskwtu/podcast.wav"}
