The model predicts a conditional vector field v using interpolated positions (xt), molecular structure (G), and time-step (t). Samples are drawn from the harmonic prior (xo ~ po) and then rotationally aligned with the samples from data (x1 ~ p1). A conditional probability path is constructed between pairs of x0 and x1, and xt is then sampled from this path at a random time t. (b) The ET-Flow architecture consists of a representation module based on the TorchMD-NET architecture (Th\u00f6lke and De Fabritiis, 2022) and an equivariant vector output module.

It involves rotational alignment of x0 and x1 to shorten the path for efficient computation, minimizing transport costs.

A noisy intermediate state (purple line) is created by adding noise to the position at time t (xt).

The position is then updated using this predicted vector field to get the position at time t+1 (Xt+1), as shown by the yellow line.
