It starts by initializing parameters like regularization parameter, ensemble size, perturbation scales, and then iteratively computes and updates m+1 d-dimensional vectors. This includes a ridge regression estimate of theta* and m perturbation vectors, and selects an action that maximizes the predicted reward based on a randomly chosen perturbation. It updates the ensemble and repeats the process for each time step.", "section": "2.2 Algorithm: linear ensemble sampling"}]
