However, real-world offline RL faces two major challenges: **inaccurate model estimation due to limited data** and **performance degradation from model mismatch between the training and deployment environments.**  Existing methods often tackle these issues separately, leading to redundancy or complexity. \nThis research introduces a novel unified framework that integrates both principles of pessimism into a single robust Markov Decision Process (MDP). This unified approach addresses both data sparsity and model mismatch simultaneously by carefully constructing a robust MDP with a single uncertainty set.  The results demonstrate **near-optimal sub-optimality gap under the target environment across three uncertainty models**: total variation, chi-squared divergence, and KL divergence. These findings improve upon or match state-of-the-art performance for total variation and KL divergence and provide the first result for chi-squared divergence.", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Central Florida", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cBY66CKEbq/podcast.wav"}
