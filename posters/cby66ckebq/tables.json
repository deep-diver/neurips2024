[{"figure_path": "cBY66CKEbq/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison with related works on offline RL under model mismatch. In [5], Cob is the robust partial coverage coefficient [5], which is similar to C\u03c0*, and the exp((1 \u2013 \u03b3)\u22121) term can be eliminated with an additional cost on Pmin\u22121 and \u03bcmin\u22121.", "description": "This table compares the sample complexities of three different offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods under three different divergence measures (Total Variation, Chi-squared, and Kullback-Leibler).  It highlights the improvements achieved by the proposed unified framework in terms of sample complexity compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The table showcases the trade-off between the complexity of handling data sparsity and model mismatch.", "section": "Related Works"}]
