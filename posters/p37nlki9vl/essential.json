This paper focuses on the Gauss-Newton method, which is a second-order optimization method, and investigates its generalization properties in deep reversible neural networks. The authors find that while Gauss-Newton shows faster convergence during training, compared to first-order methods, it fails to generalize well to unseen data. \nThe researchers found that the poor generalization is due to a phenomenon called \"lazy training.\" In lazy training, the model's internal representation does not change significantly during training. This means that the model does not learn new features that would help it generalize to unseen data. This is in contrast to first-order methods such as Adam, which exhibit better generalization and more significant changes in internal representations during training. The study also provides an efficient way to compute exact Gauss-Newton updates in deep reversible architectures and highlights the need for further investigation into the generalization properties of second-order optimization methods in deep learning.", "affiliation": "MediaTek Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "p37NlKi9vl/podcast.wav"}
