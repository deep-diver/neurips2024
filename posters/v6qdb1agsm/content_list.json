Let this set of dyadic intervals be called $\\mathcal{T}$ . In the version of the binary tree algorithm of Chan et al. [8], the noise added to the sum of the values so far (i.e. the non-private output) at any time step $1\\leq t\\leq T$ is equal to  I\u2208D[0,t 1] , where $D_{[0,t-1]}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{Z}}$ is the dyadic interval decomposition of the interval $[0,t-1]$ .

This allows us to control the asymptotic growth of the expiration function, and the error. This change, however, requires a more careful privacy analysis.

Note that different algorithms have different parameters that can affect privacy loss; thus, it is not clear how to perform a fair comparison at first. We use the following approach: In the design of $\\varepsilon$ -differentially private algorithms the error is frequently bound as a function of the privacy loss, i.e., the error of different algorithms is measured with the same value of the privacy loss parameter $\\varepsilon$ . Here, we turn this approach around: We compare the privacy loss (as a function of elapsed time) of different algorithms whose privacy parameter $\\varepsilon$ is chosen to achieve the same error. As for both algorithms that we evaluate it is straightforward to compute the mean-squared error (MSE) for all outputs on a stream of length $T$ , while the corresponding maximum absolute error can only be observed empirically, we fix the MSE for $T=d_{m a x}+1$ , where $d_{m a x}$ is the greatest $d$ shown in each plot. We normalize each plot to achieve the same MSE over the first $T$ outputs, across all algorithms and parameter choices. For all runs of Algorithm 3 we used $B=0$ , as for larger but practical values of $B$ , the primary effect would be to shift the privacy loss curve to the right.
