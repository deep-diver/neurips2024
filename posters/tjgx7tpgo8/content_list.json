Existing methods are designed to preserve effective information of old models or graph data to alleviate forgetting, but there is no clear theoretical understanding of what matters in information preservation. In this paper, we consider that present practice suffers from high semantic and structural shifts assessed by two devised shift metrics. We provide insights into information preservation in GCIL and find that maintaining graph information can preserve information of old models in theory to calibrate node semantic and graph structure shifts. We correspond graph information into low-frequency local-global information and high-frequency information in spatial domain. Based on the analysis, we propose a framework, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP). Specifically, for low-frequency information preservation, the old node representations obtained by inputting replayed nodes into the old model are aligned with the outputs of the node and its neighbors in the new model, and then old and new outputs are globally matched after pooling. For high-frequency information preservation, the new node representations are encouraged to imitate the near-neighbor pair similarity of old node representations.

Therefore, it is critical for a graph model to incrementally integrate new classes on an extended graph, which is referred to as Graph class incremental learning (GCIL). However, this poses a major challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, where the model needs to preserve previous information while continuously acquiring new information [3, 4].

The parameter isolation methods entirely or partially preserve parameters of different tasks to protect model performance, such as dynamically incrementing feature extractors and prototypes [2]. Regularization methods, on the one hand, preserve important parameters, such as assessing parameter importance by considering loss and topology [1], and maintaining orthogonality with parameters from previous tasks [5], on the other hand, preserve the absolute position of nodes in feature space or output space, such as aligning the outputs of samples on old and new models [6]. The replay methods preserve a few nodes or subgraphs to retrain the model to prevent forgetting, such as saving representative nodes [7], selecting subgraphs according to node degree [8], and compressing training graphs [9]. The hybrid methods combine different learning paradigms (i.e. the combination of replay and regularization methods), such as feature distillation after identifying critical nodes [10] and minimizing distribution disparity of selected nodes across new and prior models [11]. These hybrid methods have demonstrated considerable potential and achieved state-of-the-art results.

The key insight is that preserving graph information from spatial domain plays a vital role in preserving information about old model, and subsequently calibrates semantic and structural shifts and reduces catastrophic forgetting risk. To accomplish this objective, we introduce a framework, GSIP, which utilizes the outputs of nodes in old model to diffuse the outputs of new model and its neighbors, then aligns the outputs of new model with old model after pooling. Finally, GSIP maintains kernel distance of neighbor pairs on both old and new models. The graph information is remembered by low-frequency local-global information preserving and high-frequency information preserving in feature and topological space. Evaluations over benchmark datasets show the superiority of GSIP in handling different dataset splitting cases. In the future, we will investigate comprehensive analysis for the preservation of complicated graph signals.

We make three observations: (1) Low-frequency local graph information is well preserved. Figure 10(a) measures the degree of feature similarity. It can be observed that losses of the first two variants start to rise around the 50th epoch. However, the GSIP loss remains much lower than the first two variants and converges quickly. (2) The learning of low-frequency information is ensured after global graph embedding similarity correction. It can be seen that the loss of GSIP is slightly lower than the other two variants in Figure 10(b). (3) GSIP can preserve high-frequency information and reduce the forgetting of topology. In Figure 10(c), we can see that the losses of the first two variants decrease and then increase at each increment.
