This issue is particularly significant in real-world applications where data is often imperfect.  Previous attempts to solve this problem required computationally expensive full model retraining, limiting their practicality.\nThis research tackles the problem of noisy labels in fair machine learning by introducing a novel label-correction method. This method uses label spreading on a nearest-neighbors graph built from model embeddings.  This approach significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art last-layer retraining methods, achieving the best accuracy while maintaining efficiency and minimal computational overhead. The method also works across a wide range of datasets and noise levels, making it applicable to various settings and problems in fair machine learning.", "affiliation": "Arizona State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "ChnJ3W4HFG/podcast.wav"}
