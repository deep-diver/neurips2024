However, our study finds that ESMs do not solve the ID-OOD trade-offs: they achieve peak performance for ID and OOD accuracy at different mixing coefficients. When optimized for OOD accuracy, the ensemble model exhibits a noticeable decline in ID accuracy, and vice versa.

For each test sample, we calculate its distance to the ZSF set and assign a higher weight to the fine-tuned model in the ensemble if the distance is small.
