[{"heading_title": "GaussianCube: Fitting", "details": {"summary": "The core of GaussianCube lies in its novel fitting procedure.  Instead of directly using the Gaussian Splatting algorithm's adaptive density, **GaussianCube employs a densification-constrained approach**. This ensures a fixed number of Gaussians regardless of the object complexity, paving the way for efficient structured representation.  The constraint is cleverly implemented by controlling the densification process, balancing the addition of new Gaussians with the removal of less-significant ones. This innovative strategy cleverly addresses the challenge of maintaining high-accuracy fitting while adhering to the predetermined number of Gaussians.  This makes subsequent organization into a structured voxel grid far more tractable, setting the stage for straightforward integration with standard 3D diffusion models.  **The choice to constrain the number of Gaussians is crucial**, not only for structural simplicity but also for computational efficiency. It directly addresses the limitations of previous methods that struggled with the high dimensionality of unstructured radiance representations. Overall, the GaussianCube fitting algorithm represents a significant methodological contribution, demonstrating an effective balance between accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for 3D generative modeling."}}, {"heading_title": "3D Diffusion Model", "details": {"summary": "The application of diffusion models to 3D data presents unique challenges and opportunities.  **3D diffusion models** must address the higher dimensionality and complexity of 3D representations compared to images.
