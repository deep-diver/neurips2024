Existing test-time adaptation often relies on entropy minimization, causing overconfident predictions and instabilities. This paper introduces Protected Online Entropy Matching (POEM), a novel method that dynamically adapts models without the need for labeled test data. \nPOEM uses a statistical framework to detect distribution shifts by monitoring the classifier's entropy.  It then employs an online adaptation mechanism that drives the distribution of test entropy values to match those of the source domain, building invariance to distribution shifts. This approach is shown to improve accuracy under distribution shifts across various models and datasets, while avoiding overconfidence and maintaining accuracy when shifts are absent.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qamfjyhPeg/podcast.wav"}
