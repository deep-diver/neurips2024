It iteratively chooses decisions, observes outcomes and rewards, and updates its model.  The core logic involves testing whether a new model g is significantly better than the current model f based on a log-likelihood ratio test,  incorporating a penalty term involving the maximum contamination. If a better model is found, the algorithm switches to it.  This procedure is repeated until the end of the time horizon.", "section": "4.2.3 Algorithm Simply-Test-To-Commit (ST2C)"}]
