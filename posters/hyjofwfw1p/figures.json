Each example represents a different decision (\u03c01, \u03c02, \u03c03), with the blue line representing the given delay model and the red line representing the true delay model. The difference between the given and true delay models illustrates the concept of model misspecification (epsilon-contamination) discussed in the paper.  The total variation distance between the true and given models is used as a measure of misspecification.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
