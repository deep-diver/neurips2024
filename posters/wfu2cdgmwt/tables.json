The results are based on the QUADRATIC OU (EASY) experiments, as shown in Figure 2 of the paper, and are obtained using an exponential moving average with a coefficient of 0.01 to smooth out the data. The algorithms are implemented using a 16GB V100 GPU.", "section": "F.3 Additional tables and plots"}]
