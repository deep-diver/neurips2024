The y-axis represents the norm of the true projected gradient at each iteration, and the x-axis represents the sample complexity. The green vertical dashed line indicates the transition point between Phase I and Phase II of Algorithm 1. The result shows that the projected gradient decays and converges to a small value, which matches the theoretical result of Theorem 2 in the paper.", "section": "A Experiments"}]
