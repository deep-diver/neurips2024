Deep learning offers potential acceleration but existing methods fall short in leveraging the richness of dynamical information.  They often fail to perform well in various downstream tasks, such as transition path sampling and trajectory upsampling. This makes it difficult to fully exploit MD data for deeper scientific understanding and development.\nThe paper introduces MDGEN, a generative model that directly learns the full molecular trajectory from data. This allows for various applications such as forward simulation, interpolation, upsampling, and dynamics-conditioned molecular design (inpainting). MDGEN demonstrates these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and shows promising scaling up to protein monomers.  The method significantly accelerates calculations with minimal loss in accuracy, addressing various inverse problems that are difficult to solve with conventional methods.  This showcases its potential to greatly enhance MD studies.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "yRRCH1OsGW/podcast.wav"}
