This figure demonstrates variations in CIF files, either with or without symmetry control command denoted as \"symprec\", for the same crystal structure subjected to periodic transformations. Changes in the CIF contents are highlighted in red.

The figure highlights the non-uniqueness problem in using CIF files directly for generating crystal structures with language models, as different CIF files may represent the same underlying crystal structure, leading to ambiguity in model training.", "section": "2.2 Language model for 3D crystal structures"}, {"figure_path": "18FGRNd0wZ/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Converting determined unit cells into invariant crystal sequences.", "description": "This figure illustrates the Mat2Seq pipeline's final step, converting the determined SO(3) equivariant unit cells into SE(3) invariant sequences.  It details the components of the generated sequence: compositional information (chemical formula), space group information (symmetry), invariant lattice parameters (unit cell dimensions and angles), and irreducible atom sets. Each atom within the irreducible set is further represented by its atom type and fractional coordinates within the unit cell. This unique sequence representation ensures SE(3) and periodic invariance for the crystal structure.", "section": "3 Tokenization of 3D crystal materials"}, {"figure_path": "18FGRNd0wZ/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Limitations of directly using CIF files in achieving unique crystal sequence representations.

The variations highlighted in red demonstrate how periodic transformations (shifting the unit cell or changing lattice vectors) lead to different CIF files with varying fractional coordinates, atom ordering, and lattice parameters despite representing the same underlying crystal structure.  This lack of unique representation is a limitation for using CIF files directly in language models for crystal structure generation.", "section": "2.2 Language model for 3D crystal structures"}]
