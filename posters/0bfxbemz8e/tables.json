Four different noise standard deviations (0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04) were tested. The metrics evaluated were Validity (Structural and Composition), and Coverage (Recall and Precision).  The results show that adding noise did not significantly impact these proxy metrics, suggesting that the LLM's base distribution is relatively robust to noise.", "section": "5.3 Results"}]
