Existing methods, like autoregressive LLMs and denoising models, have shown promise, but each has limitations: LLMs struggle with continuous values, while denoising models are less adept at handling discrete elements. Additionally, generating materials with desirable properties (e.g., high bandgap and thermal stability) requires complex conditional generation, which is difficult to achieve with existing methods.\nFlowLLM tackles these challenges head-on. It leverages the strengths of both LLMs and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) in a synergistic way.  It fine-tunes an LLM to learn a base distribution of metastable crystals, which is then refined using RFM. The result is a significant improvement in the generation rate of stable materials, exceeding existing methods by over 300%.  Furthermore, FlowLLM's output materials are much closer to their relaxed states, substantially lowering the computational cost of subsequent analysis.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "0bFXbEMz8e/podcast.wav"}
