Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer structured, accurate information, but integrating them effectively with LLMs is challenging. Existing methods often rely on pre-defined exploration paths, leading to inefficiency and a lack of self-correction when errors occur. \n\nPlan-on-Graph (PoG) tackles these issues by introducing a self-correcting adaptive planning approach.  PoG decomposes complex questions into sub-objectives, guiding an LLM to explore KG reasoning paths. A memory mechanism tracks exploration history, and a reflection mechanism allows for self-correction.  Experimental results demonstrate PoG's improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing KG-augmented LLMs on various datasets, highlighting its potential for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.", "affiliation": "Alibaba Cloud Computing", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "CwCUEr6wO5/podcast.wav"}
