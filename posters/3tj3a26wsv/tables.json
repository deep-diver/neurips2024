The notations cover various aspects of the Hierarchical UCB-VI algorithm, including sub-MDPs, policies, rewards, regret, and visit counts.  Understanding these notations is crucial for following the mathematical derivations and understanding the algorithm's workings.", "section": "3 Learning from Cardinal Feedback"}]
