Under this unsupervised multi-domain setting, we have identified inherent model bias within CLIP, notably in its visual and text encoders. Specifically, we observe that CLIP\u2019s visual encoder tends to prioritize encoding domain over discriminative category information, meanwhile its text encoder exhibits a preference for domain-relevant classes. To mitigate this model bias, we propose a training-free and label-free feature calibration method, Unsupervised Multi-domain Feature Calibration (UMFC). UMFC estimates imagelevel biases from domain-specific features and text-level biases from the direction of domain transition. These biases are subsequently subtracted from original image and text features separately, to render them domain-invariant.

This phenomenon indicates that CLIP\u2019s visual encoder exhibits a higher sensitivity to domain information over category information. When the domain of downstream tasks shifts from pre-trained tasks, the mismatch in domain-specific information encoded in image features could adversely affect classification accuracy. On the side of textual encoder, we observe that CLIP demonstrates varying category preferences across different domains. Specifically, CLIP tends to classify images into categories whose name are closely related to corresponding domain.

The factors influencing $p(y|x)$ , affected by domain variable $z$ , can be decoupled into two parts: the sample distribution conditioned on classes $p(x|y,z)$ and the class distribution $p(y|z)$ . If the two probability distributions are independent of $z$ , domain shifts will not affect the predictions. To this end, we propose Unsupervised Multi-domain Feature Calibration (UMFC), a simple yet efficient framework for calibrating CLIP to generalize to various downstream tasks using multi-domain unlabeled data. UMFC jointly calibrates CLIP through two training-free modules: Image Feature Calibration module (IFC) and Text Feature Calibration module (TFC). Firstly, IFC focuses on calibrating CLIP\u2019s image encoder to prioritize category-level over domain-level information, thereby reducing prediction error caused by domain shifts. Specifically, we calculate the average image features for each domain $i$ , denoted as $\\mu_{i}$ , and posit that the prediction of $\\mu_{i}$ reflects the inherent bias of CLIP\u2019s image encoder within that domain. By subtracting this domain-specific bias from original predictions, we can derive domain-agnostic predictions. Secondly, TFC focuses on calibrating CLIP\u2019s text encoder to remove its preference towards domain-related class names. As observed by [7, 28, 8], a \u201cglobal direction\u201d exists in CLIP, representing the shift from training distribution to unseen distribution, shared across image and text embedding spaces. Motivated by this observation, we utilize the shift direction between different-domain images to estimate the text shift direction. Then, we subtract this shift vector to counteract the text encoder\u2019s bias towards domain-related categories. By combing IFC and TFC, we can calibrate the features on both CLIP\u2019s image and text encoders, thereby alleviating the model bias in downstream tasks.

Additionally, some semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods [26, 14, 15] tackle the scarcity of labeled samples by assuming access to extensive unlabeled data. While both FSL and SSL methods have achieved encouraging results, their generalization abilities are limited. Recently, the CLIP model is proposed, which is a vision-language foundation model that learns a shared vision-language embedding space. As pre-trained on large-scale data, CLIP exhibits impressive zero-shot ability across various downstream tasks. Based on CLIP model, many works focus on improving its performance further on downstream tasks with few labeled data.

However, creating domain-specific templates is challenging due to unknown and potentially mixed domain sources of test samples. So, we only use CLIP-D as an oracle result. As shown in Table 1, our method can achieve competitive performance with CLIP-D without prior domain labels for test samples. (2) On domains where CLIP performs poorly, e.g., \u201cquickdraw\u201d, our UMFC significantly outperforms others. Compared to CLIP, UMFC achieves about $5\\%$ performance gain on quickdraw domain. In addition, combined with more diverse prompts of CLIP-E, UMFC further improves performance. (3) MUST [25] uses abundant unlabeled data from 6 domains for fine-tuning.

We can observe that: (1) As shown in Table 6, UMFC achieves performance gains across all domains, with particularly noticeable gains in those where CLIP performs poorly. For example, UMFC substantially improves upon CLIP on \u201cquickdraw\u201d and \u201cinfograph\u201d domains, with an accuracy gain of $5.6\\%$ . Table 5 shows that the improvement on ImageNet-A is less significant than on ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S. The reason may be attributed to the absence of distinct domain styles in ImageNet-A, limiting the effectiveness of our calibration method that relies on domain information. (2) UMFC-Memory and UMFC-EMA with different statistical update strategies exhibit similar performance. However, UMFC-EMA, which updates features based on the most recent data, notably reduces storage requirements. Moreover, UMFC exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency without training, whereas TPT requires executing optimization steps on 64 different augmented views of each test image.

To assess the effectiveness of calibrated text features in eliminating domain bias, we construct a domain classifier. Specifically, we utilize the text features generate by CLIP, with domain prompts \u201c[domain]\u201d, as the domain classifer. Then, we use this domain classifier to perform domain classification for the text features before and after calibration (i.e., computing the cosine similarity between domain classifier and text features). As shown in Figure 2(b), the original text features exhibit a long-tail phenomenon, with a higher probability of being classified into the \u201creal\u201d domain. This suggests that the original text features are biased towards the \u201creal\u201d domain, overlooking their generalization ability to other domains. However, after calibration with TFC, the text features exhibit a near-uniform distribution across domains, indicating that the calibrated text features have largely eliminated domain bias. Consequently, our method enhances performance in other domains without compromising the model\u2019s performance in its strongest domain.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
