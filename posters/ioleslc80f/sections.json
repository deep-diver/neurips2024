Standard Mamba excels at long-range dependencies in sequential data but struggles with the unordered nature of point clouds.  This module elegantly bridges the gap by **decoding contextual scene features into object sets using learnable queries**. Unlike simply concatenating scene context, which hinders the model's ability to extract object-specific features, the Query-Aware Mamba leverages the queries to guide the feature extraction process.
