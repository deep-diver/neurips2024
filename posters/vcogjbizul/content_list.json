Shap-E [19], a 3D diffusion model trained on millions of 3D assets, is capable of producing plausible geometry, but it suffers from artifacts and holes in the meshes. Michelangelo [64] performs diffusion process on a 1D implicit latent space, and fails to align the generated mesh with the semantic content of the conditional images. Multi-view based approaches such as One-2-3-45 [27] and InstantMesh [57] heavily rely on the performance of multi-view 2D diffusion model. One-2-3-45 directly employs SparseNeuS [32] for reconstruction, resulting in coarse geometry. The meshes generated by InstantMesh perform decent quality, but lack consistency with the input images in certain details like the water spout on the sink and the windows of the school bus. It also produces some failure cases such as merging the hind legs of the horse together, due to the limitation of multi-view diffusion model. In contrast, our Direct3D consistently generates high-quality meshes that align with the conditional images in most cases. In Table 1, we report the Chamfer Distance, Volume IoU and F-Score to compare the quality of the generated meshes with other methods. It can be observed that our Direct3D achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when trained on Objaverse dataset. Integrating our internal data for training further enhances the model\u2019s performance, validating the scalability of our approach. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Text-to-3D.

It can be observed that these baseline methods fail in almost all cases, while our Direct3D is still able to generate high-quality meshes, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach. We also conducted a user study to quantitatively compare our D3D-DiT with other methods.

Our image-conditioned 3D diffusion transformer (D3D-DiT) further improves the generation quality by integrating image information at both pixel and semantic levels, ensuring high consistency between generated 3D shapes and conditional images.
