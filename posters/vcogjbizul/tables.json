Users rated the meshes on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better quality and consistency.  The methods compared include Shap-E, One-2-3-45, Michelangelo, InstantMesh, and the authors' proposed method (Ours).  The table shows that the authors' method achieved significantly higher scores for both quality and consistency, indicating that their approach generates superior 3D models.", "section": "4.3 Image and Text to 3D Generation"}, {"figure_path": "vCOgjBIZuL/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative comparisons of reconstruction with different latent representations on Objaverse evaluation set.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of 3D shape reconstruction results using two different latent space representations: an implicit 1D space (Shape2VecSet) and an explicit triplane (the authors' method).
