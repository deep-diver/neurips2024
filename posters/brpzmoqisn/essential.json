Existing methods often focus on either efficiently scoring the importance of parameters (differentiable pruning) or on efficiently searching the space of sparse models (combinatorial optimization). This research reveals limitations in existing methods, as they develop independently along these two directions.  Existing approaches have difficulties balancing performance gains from hardware utilization and computational efficiency.  \nThe researchers propose SequentialAttention++, a novel algorithm that combines the strengths of both approaches.  It uses differentiable pruning to guide combinatorial optimization, allowing for more accurate selection of important parameters to prune.  Theoretically, they show that many existing differentiable pruning methods can be seen as nonconvex regularizations. Empirically, SequentialAttention++ achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and Criteo datasets for block-wise pruning tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "BrPZMOQiSN/podcast.wav"}
