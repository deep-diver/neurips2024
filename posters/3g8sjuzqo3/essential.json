Traditional methods like Dinkelbach's transform struggle with this.  The challenge is exacerbated by the problem's fractional structure, making optimization complex. This paper tackles these issues. \n\nThis research introduces a novel multidimensional quadratic transform within fractional programming to address the NCut problem. This new approach effectively transforms the complex 0-1 NCut problem into a manageable bipartite matching problem, solved iteratively.  **The method's superior performance is demonstrated through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets**, showing improved accuracy and efficiency compared to other methods.  **Theoretical connections to minorization-maximization theory are used to confirm convergence.**", "affiliation": "School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3G8sjUZqO3/podcast.wav"}
