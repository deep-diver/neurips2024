This leads to inaccurate bounding boxes, impacting safety and reliability. Existing solutions often involve complex retraining procedures.\nDiffuBox offers a novel solution: a diffusion model refines initial bounding boxes by analyzing the LiDAR points around them.  This is a domain-agnostic method, meaning it works across various datasets without retraining, significantly improving localization accuracy for various datasets and object types.  The results highlight substantial improvements, especially for near-range objects where more LiDAR point information is available.  This method provides improved accuracy and robustness for 3D object detection systems in real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "J2wOOtkBx0/podcast.wav"}
