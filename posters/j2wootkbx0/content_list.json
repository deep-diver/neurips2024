For autonomous vehicles to navigate complicated traffic conditions, this amounts to identifying and localizing other road agents. Detection models under this setting need to make sense of LiDAR point clouds to identify accurate bounding boxes for pre-specified objects. Given the diverse driving environments that occur in practice it is common, however, for the train- and test-time distributions to differ significantly. Domain distributional differences mainly arise from differences in object size, point cloud density, and LiDAR beam angles. Consequently, models trained in one region or particular dataset (e.g. Germany) may not perform well in another region or dataset (e.g. USA) [48]. As a result, the domain adaptation problem raises concerns over the reliability and safety of 3D object detection in self-driving, that are often trained in a particular setting, then deployed into a diverse set of regions and locations.

Furthermore, the objects within the same object class (e.g., cars) have a similar shape with minor variance across different domains. What mostly varies, then, is the dimensions of the object, as opposed to this \u201csurface\" shape when normalized to be the same size. Specifically, the distribution of points the LiDAR detector receives, is therefore consistent when normalized across object sizes, regardless of domains; points will always land near the edge of the bounding box no matter where the object is located. Thus, if we can somehow capture the distribution of points relative to a box\u2019s coordinate system, we would be able to use same process to fix incorrectly positioned bounding boxes to fti the correct point-distribution, even across domains.

While DiffuBox effectively improves the existing bounding boxes, one limitation is that DiffuBox currently does not consider false negatives that are due to completely missed detections. This could potentially be addressed through further distilling the detectors by DiffuBox\u2019s refined boxes, or by incorporating exploration strategies to capture possibly missed objects. Alternatively, a view that we did not discuss in this work, but is of potential interest to the field, is the use of DiffuBox for automatic label refinement. This can be useful for correcting slightly mis-aligned boxes, or labels across sensors that may have slightly unsynchronized sensors. We leave this discussion for further work, and will provide code and model checkpoints for this use case. With our work, we do not foresee any negative societal impacts and hope the field continues to develop such label refinement methods for 3D object detection.

Afterwards, they finetune the object detector on the adapted dataset. In short, SN attempts to explicitly construct a new size prior to replace the old one. Despite great effectiveness, SN is very sensitive to the accuracy of size statistics in the target domain, and requires careful retraining for each new target domain.
