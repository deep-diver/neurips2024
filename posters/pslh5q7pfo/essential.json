Existing methods often struggle with sample efficiency and generalization to new items due to the absence of contextual information. This paper tackles these issues by proposing a novel algorithm called GURO that addresses limitations of non-contextual approaches and active preference learning baselines.\nGURO employs a contextual logistic preference model, incorporating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in comparisons, to guide active sampling.  A hybrid model variant is also introduced to mitigate model misspecification.  Experiments on multiple realistic ordering tasks using human annotators demonstrate GURO's superiority in sample efficiency and generalization capabilities, outperforming non-contextual baselines and other active learning strategies.  The findings provide a significant advancement for applications requiring efficient and accurate ordering of items based on limited pairwise comparisons.", "affiliation": "Chalmers University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PSLH5q7PFo/podcast.wav"}
