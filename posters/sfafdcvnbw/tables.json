It shows the impact of different components on FID scores, starting from a model without any constraints and progressively adding components like clipping scale, position regularization, scale regularization, background generator, and finally, anchor Gaussian. Each row represents the FID score of a model with cumulative addition of these components.  Lower FID scores indicate better performance. ", "section": "4.2 Experimental results"}]
