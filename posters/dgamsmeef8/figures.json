It shows how to obtain different regret guarantees (static, dynamic, adaptive) and feedback types (full information, semi-bandit, bandit, first-order, zeroth-order) for DR-submodular optimization by combining different base algorithms (SO-OGD, Improved Ader) and meta-algorithms (OMBQ, FOTZO, STB, SFTT, OTB).", "section": "Applications"}]
