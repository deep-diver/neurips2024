In this paper, we address these limitations by theoretically revisiting SHGL from the spectral clustering perspective and introducing a novel framework enhanced by rank and dual consistency constraints. Specifically, our framework incorporates a rank-constrained spectral clustering method that refines the affinity matrix to exclude noise effectively. Additionally, we integrate node-level and cluster-level consistency constraints that concurrently capture invariant and clustering information to facilitate learning in downstream tasks.

As a result, SHGL captures meaningful representations of nodes and edges, enabling better performance in downstream tasks like node classification and node clustering. Due to its powerful capability, SHGL has been applied to various real applications, such as social network analysis [22, 62, 10], and recommendation systems [44, 17, 15]. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "Existing SHGL methods can be broadly classified into two groups, i.e., meta-path-based methods and adaptive-graph-based methods. In meta-path-based methods, several graphs are usually constructed based on different pre-defined meta-paths to examine diverse relationships among nodes that share similar labels [18, 74]. For example, STENCIL [74] and HDMI [18] construct meth-path-based graphs and then conduct node-level consistency constraints (e.g., contrastive loss) between node representations in different graphs. In addition, HGCML [58] and CPIM [31] propose to maximize the mutual information between node representations from different meta-path-based graphs. However, pre-defined meta-paths in these methods generally require expert knowledge and prohibitive computation costs [69]. Therefore, adaptive-graph-based methods are proposed to learn the adaptive graph structures to capture the relationships among nodes that possess the same label, instead of using meta-paths. For example, recently, HERO [30] made the first attempt to learn an adaptive self-expressive matrix to capture the homophily in the heterogeneous graph, thus avoiding meta-paths.

", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "The spectral clustering methods can be broadly classified into two groups, i.e., traditional spectral clustering and deep spectral clustering. Traditional spectral clustering methods aim to group data points that are similar to each other while being dissimilar to points in other clusters by eigendecomposition [34, 35]. For example, CAN [34] proposes to learn the data similarity matrix and clustering structure simultaneously with the eigendecomposition. SWCAN [35] further assigns weights for different features to learn the similarity graph and partition samples into clusters simultaneously. Despite its effectiveness, traditional spectral clustering generally requires expensive computation costs, especially for large datasets. To alleviate this issue, deep spectral clustering methods have been proposed in recent years. For example, DSC [66] employs an encoder and two decoders to train the network, thus obtaining discriminative representations for clustering and implementing the cluster assignment via the neural network. DSCL [21] introduces a novel metric learning framework that leverages spectral clustering principles, thus reducing complexity to linear levels. SpectralNet [42] proposes to learn a mapping function via the orthogonalization network to address the out-of-sample-extension and scalability problems. ", "page_idx": 14}, {"type": "text", "text": "The above methods conduct spectral clustering explicitly. Surprisingly, recent research shows that some popular self-supervised methods also implicitly conduct spectral clustering [7, 46]. For example, [7] demonstrates contrastive learning performs spectral clustering on the population augmentation graph by replacing the standard InfoNCE [36] with its proposed spectral contrastive loss. [46] demonstrates that contrastive learning with the standard InfoNCE loss is equivalent to spectral clustering on the similarity graph. Although these methods make efforts to connect previous selfsupervised methods with spectral clustering, they cannot be easily transferred to SHGL. First, these methods are almost based on the augmentation graph, which assumes that different augmentations of the same sample connect each other and thus form a graph. In contrast, in SHGL, there is no augmentation, and the graph is constructed by connecting different samples. Second, compared to the above methods, SHGL incorporates the message-passing process, which makes it more complex. Therefore, connecting SHGL methods with the spectral clustering remains challenging.

Therefore, minimizing the cluster-level consistency constraint is equivalent to minimizing the lower bound of the model complexity. Therefore, the lower bound of complexity measure $C$ of the model with the dual consistent constraints is less than the model without it, i.e., $\\operatorname*{inf}(C_{S C H O O L})\\ <\\ \\operatorname*{inf}(C_{S H G L})$ . As a result, according to [33], we can conclude that the representations learned by the dual consistent constraints have a higher bound of generalization ability than previous methods with instance-level constraint only, i.e., $\\operatorname*{sup}(G_{S C H O O L})>\\operatorname*{sup}(G_{S H G L})$ thus we complete the proof. \u53e3 ", "page_idx": 22}, {"type": "text", "text": "C.5 Derivation of Eq.
