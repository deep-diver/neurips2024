However, finding efficient algorithms for this task is challenging, especially when dealing with correlated stochastic block models (correlated SBMs), which model networks with community structure and edge correlations.  Prior work established the information-theoretic limits for exact graph matching in correlated SBMs but lacked efficient algorithms.\nThis research introduces the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in correlated SBMs with two balanced communities.  The algorithm leverages subgraph counts and achieves near-perfect alignment under specific correlation strengths, resolving a significant open problem.  It generalizes previous work on simpler Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs and handles estimation errors due to imperfect community recovery in a novel way, demonstrating the algorithm's practicality and robustness.", "affiliation": "Northwestern University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "nBhfIcDnRP/podcast.wav"}
