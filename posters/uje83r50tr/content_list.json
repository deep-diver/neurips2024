Inspired by that LLM have unified various NLP tasks into a generation problem in one architecture, recent MLLM works manifest to solve traditional visual recognition tasks in a unified MLLM architecture. Object detection, a key visual recognition task, poses a challenge in expressing positional information in language within MLLM frameworks. Some literature [6, 20, 21, 2] convert the bounding box into natural language format and directly generate them in text response. However, representing bounding boxes in text form may not be optimal since the bounding box coordinates are numerical data and are typically predicted by regression. Some works [22, 23] use output embeddings of LLM as the understanding pivot to call an object detector for detection. However, the LLM can not benefit from the object detection results from the detector to enhance its own understanding. A more challenging scenario is the segmentation task, in which the ground-truth can be in random shape and seems indescribable via language. To tackle this problem, VisionLLM [24] represents the segmentation mask in text format by representing the mask by the coordinates of the mask polygon. Sphinx [21] and LLaVA-Plus [25] utilize an offline model SAM [26] for segmentation. They first generate the bounding box of the object to segment using MLLM, then they prompt SAM to generate the segmentation mask. LiSA [27] integrates SAM into MLLM for joint training. They introduce a special \u201c<SEG>\u201d token to predict the segmentation mask. However, a single \u201c<SEG>\u201d token cannot differentiate between multiple instances, limiting it to outputting only one segmentation mask.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
