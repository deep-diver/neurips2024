[{"figure_path": "s5Y3M5l1qg/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Schematic representation of the CARSO architecture used in the experimental phase of this work. The subnetwork bordered by the red dashed line is used only during the training of the purifier. The subnetwork bordered by the blue dashed line is re-evaluated on different random samples z\u1d62 and the resulting individual \u0177\u1d62 are aggregated into \u0177rob. The classifier f(\u00b7; \u03b8) is always kept frozen; the remaining network is trained on LVAE(x, z). More precise details on the functioning of the networks are provided in subsection 4.1. Upon completion of the training process, the encoder network may be discarded as it will not be used for inference.", "description": "This figure shows the architecture of CARSO.  It consists of a classifier and a purifier working synergistically. The classifier, which is adversarially trained and frozen during inference, processes the input. Its internal representation is fed to the purifier, a stochastic generative model that creates plausible clean reconstructions of the input. Multiple samples from this distribution are then classified by the classifier, and the results are aggregated to provide a robust prediction. The red dashed box highlights the part of the architecture used only during purifier training, while the blue dashed box shows the section used during inference.", "section": "4 Structure of CARSO"}]
