Current defense mechanisms like adversarial training and purification have limitations; adversarial training alone can reduce accuracy, while purification methods can be brittle. This creates a need for more robust and effective defenses.\nThis paper introduces CARSO, a new defense that effectively blends adversarial training and purification.  It trains a classifier adversarially and then adds a purifier that learns to map perturbed inputs to cleaner representations. Multiple samples from the purified representation are classified, and the results aggregated for a robust prediction.  **Experiments show CARSO significantly improves robustness against strong attacks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.**", "affiliation": "NVIDIA Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "s5Y3M5l1qg/podcast.wav"}
