However, existing methods often rely on pre-defined search spaces and validation scores, limiting their effectiveness.  **This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework called OCTree that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated feature generation.** OCTree uses LLMs to identify effective feature generation rules and decision trees to provide language-based reasoning information, improving the iterative rule refinement process. \n\nOCTree uses LLMs and decision trees to generate and iteratively refine column features for tabular data. **The framework enhances various prediction models across multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing automated feature engineering methods.** The use of LLMs allows OCTree to avoid pre-defined search spaces, incorporate feedback from previous experiments, and leverage language understanding for more effective optimization. The consistent performance improvements across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OCTree's novel approach.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "APSBwuMopO/podcast.wav"}
