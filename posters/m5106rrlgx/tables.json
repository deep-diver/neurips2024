It defines symbols used for key concepts such as input query, correct answer, number of LM calls, output from one LM call, output from an inference system, datasets used (test and training), answer space, and the proportion of 'easy' queries.  It also defines symbols representing probabilities of correctness for easy and difficult queries. Finally, it shows symbols for the accuracy of the inference system and its analytical performance model.", "section": "3 Inference System Designs"}, {"figure_path": "m5106RRLgx/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Optimal number of LM calls prediction. For each data distribution with specific 2-level difficulty parameters \u03b1, p1, p2, we sample 100 data points, employ a simulated Voting Inference System with 1000 number of LM calls, estimate the parameters by their empirical mean and adopt the analytical optimal number of LM calls predictor. Across evaluated query difficulties, our predicted optimal number of LM calls exactly matches the optimal number empirically observed.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the optimal number of language model (LM) calls predicted by the analytical model and the empirically observed optimal number.  For various combinations of difficulty parameters (\u03b1, p1, p2), 100 data points were sampled, a simulated voting inference system was run with 1000 LM calls to estimate parameters, and the analytical model was used to predict the optimal number of calls.  The results show an exact match between the predicted and empirically observed optimal numbers across all difficulty levels.", "section": "D.4 The optimal number of LM calls predicted by the scaling model"}]
