However, diffusion models, which offer direct visual supervision, underperform due to low information entropy in sparse data, leading to mode deviation during optimization. This creates a need for methods that effectively leverage diffusion priors under such challenging conditions.\nThe paper proposes Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which addresses this challenge. **IPSM uses visual inline priors (from pose relationships) to adjust the rendered image distribution.** It decomposes the original optimization objective of Score Distillation Sampling, enabling effective diffusion guidance without any additional training.  **The IPSM-Gaussian pipeline, integrating IPSM with 3D Gaussian Splatting, further enhances performance by adding depth and geometry consistency regularization.**  Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on various datasets.", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "i6BBclCymR/podcast.wav"}
