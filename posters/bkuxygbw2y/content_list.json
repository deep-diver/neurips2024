Due to the challenges posed by occlusion, unfavourable imaging conditions and low resolution, generating the BEV semantic maps corresponding to corrupted or invalid areas in the perspective view (PV) is appealing very recently. The question is how to align the PV features with the generative models to facilitate the map estimation. In this paper, we propose to utilize a generative model similar to the Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to acquire prior knowledge for the high-level BEV semantics in the tokenized discrete space. Thanks to the obtained BEV tokens accompanied with a codebook embedding encapsulating the semantics for different BEV elements in the groundtruth maps, we are able to directly align the sparse backbone image features with the obtained BEV tokens from the discrete representation learning based on a specialized token decoder module, and finally generate high-quality BEV maps with the BEV codebook embedding serving as a bridge between PV and BEV. We evaluate the BEV map layout estimation performance of our model, termed VQ-Map, on both the nuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks, achieving 62.2/47.6 mean IoU for surround-view/monocular evaluation on nuScenes, as well as $73.4~\\mathrm{IoU}$ for monocular evaluation on Argoverse, which all set a new record for this map layout estimation task.

Additionally, occlusion and inherent challenges in depth estimation often lead to inaccuracies in dense features, especially in the areas that are corrupted or invalid in the PV. These factors contribute to incoherent and unrealistic BEV layout results, often with numerous artifacts (see Fig. 1). Yet, humans can rely solely on partial observations of a scene in the PV to imagine the entire coherent BEV layout elements. A natural approach to imitating the human imagination process is to leverage generative models to learn the prior knowledge from the groundtruth BEV map layouts.

A significant limitation of our approach is our inability to handle semantics that are position-sensitive and have small areas.

Tokenization in our approach is more robust against noise and geometric changes. However, it may lead to a loss of some detailed spatial information. When the dangerous holes and some random obstacles appear in the realistic AD environment, an anomaly detection module may be needed to handle this situation.

In earlier BEV semantic segmentation works [3, 39], pixel-wise segmentation was applied to map both background static objects and foreground dynamic objects. However, because the nuScenes test set does not provide ground truth for dynamic objects, these works could not use it to evaluate their methods. To maintain consistency with prior work, we adopt the same dataset split as LSS [3] for the surround-view task, using the validation set for evaluation. For the monocular task, we follow the setup of the pioneering work PON [39], whose code provides a calibration set for tuning hyper-parameters and uses a re-divided validation set for evaluation. We also tested the off-the-shelf trained models from BEVFusion, DDP and our approach on the nuScenes test set to further show the superiority of our approach (although none of the previous works conduct the comparison on the nuScenes test set). Our approach in Tab. A2 consistently outperforms DDP and BEVFusion by large margins like in Tab. 1. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "About the realism (MMD) results. MMD is a metric of distance between the generated layout predictions and the ground truth distribution, which is to capture the realism in scene structures [17]. It is noteworthy that this realism metric and the common used precision metric are not closely coupled. It is possible to achieve higher IoU while generating non-realistic map layouts, or vice versa. MMD of MapPrior in nuScenes validation set is 28.4 [17]. We provide the MMD comparison between BEVFusion, DDP and our approach under the camera-only setting in Tab. A2, which is conducted on both the nuScenes validation set and test set. It shows that the generative prior models can enjoy the better structure preservation ability, and our approach VQ-Map is the best at pushing the limit of both the precision and realism simultaneously.

In MapPrior, its generative stage after the predictive stage during inference introduces a discrete latent code $\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}$ to guide the generative synthesis process through a transformer-based controlled synthesis in the latent space, where multiple diverse $\\mathbf{z}^{(\\bar{k})}$ are obtained using nucleus sampling and then decoded into multiple output samples (see Figs. 2 and 5 in [17]). So it is necessary to evaluate the uncertainty awareness (ECE) score for the generated multiple layout estimation samples. As for the discriminative BEV perception baselines that are trained end-to-end with cross-entropy loss, the predictions produced by the softmax function are assumed to be the pseudo probabilities to facilitate the computation of ECE score.

This process is similar to the 1-step version of MapPrior, in which there is no need to evaluate the ECE score as shown in Tab. 1 of [17].

Deformable attention can naturally use reference points to leverage these priors, whereas standard attention cannot.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
