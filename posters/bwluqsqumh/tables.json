The methods compared include the proposed IV-DL framework (with and without residualization), Inverse Probability Weighting with Multiple Robustness (IPW-MR), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), Robust Direct Learning (RD), Causal Forest with IV (CF), and MRIV.  Three metrics are reported: Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation, Accuracy Rate (AR) of optimal Individualized Treatment Regime (ITR) estimation, and the Value of the estimated ITR. Results are shown for two settings: one with a linear CATE and another with a non-linear CATE.", "section": "6.2 Numerical Results"}, {"figure_path": "bwlUQsQumh/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Simulation results: mean\u00d710-2(SE\u00d710-2).

The methods compared include the proposed IV-DL framework (and its robust variants IV-RDL1 and IV-RDL2), along with several other existing methods such as BART, RD, IPW-MR, CF, and MRIV. The evaluation metrics used are the mean squared error (MSE) of the CATE estimates, the average treatment effect (ATE), and the value function.  The results are presented for two different simulation settings, allowing for assessment of method performance across linear and non-linear CATE scenarios.", "section": "6.2 Numerical Results"}]
