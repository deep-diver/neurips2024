The bounds are categorized by whether they are for \"weak\" or \"strong\" subspace estimators, which are determined by the multiplicative singular-value gaps in the input dataset. The table ignores restrictions on the parameters ymax (maximum easiness) and \u03bb (utility parameter) for simplification.  It shows that the necessary number of samples to achieve certain accuracy in subspace estimation decreases with \"easiness\" of the data.", "section": "1.5 Quantifying Easiness - Our Approach"}]
