It starts with an image input that is encoded by a SAM (Segment Anything Model) backbone into feature maps. These features are then used for prototype extraction (using appearance and shape information from exemplars). The prototypes are generalized by a dense object query encoder (DQE) which outputs dense object queries. These queries are decoded by a dense query decoder (DQD) which outputs object detections and a counting result. The final detections are extracted and refined through a post-processing step, providing both bounding boxes and segmentation masks for the detected objects.", "section": "Single-stage low-shot object counting by detection and segmentation"}, {"figure_path": "mtOPyMkSRk/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Compared with state-of-the-art few-shot detection-based counters DAVE [20], PSECO [35], and C-DETR [19], GeCo delivers more accurate detections with less false positives and better global counts.
