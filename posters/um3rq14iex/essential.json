However, existing methods often assume the causal graph is fully known, which is unrealistic for many real-world scenarios. This paper tackles this critical limitation by focusing on causal bandits where the causal graph, potentially containing latent confounders, is unknown. This poses a significant challenge, as optimal interventions may not be limited to the reward node's parents and the search space for optimal actions grows exponentially with the number of nodes.\nThe researchers address this challenge by proposing a two-stage approach. First, they introduce a novel algorithm to learn a crucial part of the causal graph. This is crucial because only this subset of the graph is sufficient to identify the set of potentially optimal interventions (POMIS).  Their method is proven to be sample-efficient, requiring only a polynomial number of samples. In the second stage, they apply a standard bandit algorithm, like UCB, to these identified POMIS to obtain an optimal policy.  This innovative two-stage approach achieves sublinear regret, offering a practical solution to learning with unknown causal structures and latent confounders.", "affiliation": "Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "uM3rQ14iex/podcast.wav"}
