Early works focused on learning potential, where the improvement in an agent\u2019s performance determined the choice of training levels [1, 2, 31, 32]. However, robustness-oriented methods such as adversarial minimax introduced the notion of training on levels that minimise agent performance, though these often resulted in infeasible scenarios offering no learning beneftis [3, 14, 33]. Minimax regret (MMR), a more refined robustness approach, alleviates some of these issues by ensuring the chosen levels are learnable [3\u20135]. However, recent work [8] demonstrated that even true regret does not always correspond to learnability, and this mismatch can lead to stagnation during training. Our work extends this line of research by utilising a scoring mechanism that estimates expected improvement, targeting environments with a positive but not perfect solve rate. Unlike existing MMR methods, our approach directly optimises for learnability, instead of using an imperfect proxy for regret, leading to more effective training on our domains. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Relatedly, Tzannetos et al. [10] introduce $P r o C u R L$ , which uses a similar learnability score as SFL (and further introduce an approximation to the solve rate $p$ using the agent\u2019s value function). However, their problem setting is distinct from ours as they assume only a limited fixed pool of tasks are utilised during training, with the goal of improving an agent\u2019s performance over a uniform distribution over this pool. We, instead, consider the standard UED setting where we can sample an effectively unbounded number of tasks from some large distribution $\\Theta$ , with the goal of achieving an agent that is robust to worst-case settings and can generalise to unseen problems. Following on from this, Tzannetos et al. [34] extend ProCuRL to the setting where the target distribution of tasks is given, and they take into account both how learnable the selected task is, as well as how correlated it is with learnable tasks from the target distribution. While this approach outperforms the original method, it tackles a different problem to SFL and UED in general, i.e., where the target distribution is known. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Finally, robust RL methods have the goal of improving an agent\u2019s robustness to environmental disturbances, and worst-case environment dynamics [35\u201347]. However, these methods generally consider continuous perturbations instead of a mix of discrete and continuous environment settings. Furthermore, these methods tend to be overly conservative and prioritise unsolvable levels. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "9 Discussion and Limitations ", "text_level": 1, "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this work we only consider deterministic, binary outcome domains and due to the nature of the learnability score, SFL is only applicable to such settings. In other domains, we could potentially reuse the intuition that $p(1\\!-\\!p)$ is the variance of a Bernoulli distribution; in a continuous domain, an analogous metric would be the variance of rewards obtained by playing the same level multiple times. Furthermore, our implementation of SFL is in JAX but the method is general. However, one must take the cost of SFL\u2019s additional environment rollouts into account when considering implementing our algorithm; we chose JAX because its speed and parallelisation significantly alleviates this constraint. Next, while most current SoTA UED methods, including SFL, randomly generate and curate levels, this approach may become infeasible when the environment space is vast, as random generation may have a very low likelihood of generating valid levels. Finally, while JaxNav does have deterministic dynamics, Fan et al. [48] successfully transferred an RL-based multi-robot navigation policy from a simulator of identical fidelity to the real world, suggesting this should be equally possible with JaxNav.

We find that this is not the case and that these prioritisation metrics instead correlate with success rate, leading to a large amount of experience not contributing to learning an improved policy. Inspired by this analysis, we develop a method based on an intuitive notion of learnability and find that this improves the robustness of the final policies. We also introduce a new robustness-measuring evaluation protocol, reporting a risk measure on performance over the $\\alpha\\%$ worst-case (but solvable) levels for each method. We hope that our findings inspire future work on more general, domain-agnostic scoring functions, and we open-source all of our code to facilitate this process. Ultimately, we believe this work is a stepping stone towards bridging the gap between popular testbeds for UED and real-world applications.

Other methods use an RL-based level generator, where the generator\u2019s objective is based on how the agent performs on the generated level [3].
