For models composed of multiple features, the best sub-model is used which includes the last feature.", "description": "This table shows the mean R-squared values across participants for different models used to predict neural activity in the Pereira fMRI dataset.  The models vary in complexity, starting with just GPT2-XL, then incorporating sentence position (SP) and length (SL), static word embeddings (WORD), sense-specific word embeddings (SENSE), and syntactic representations (SYNT).  The table demonstrates how much of the variance in neural activity each model explains. For models with multiple features, only the best performing model is presented, ensuring that the addition of a new feature always improves performance. This table is crucial for comparing the performance of the complex model (GPT2-XL) with simpler models that only include basic linguistic features.", "section": "3.3 Sentence length, sentence position, and static word embeddings account for the majority of trained LLM encoding performance"}]
