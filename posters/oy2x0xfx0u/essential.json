This paper focuses on message-passing GNNs using ReLU activation, a standard choice in many applications.  A key challenge is characterizing the class of functions these networks can learn and understanding the impact of architectural choices on their expressive power and efficiency. Existing analysis based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy provides limited insights, especially for non-injective activation functions like ReLU.\nThis research addresses these limitations by employing tropical geometry.  The authors demonstrate that ReLU-activated message-passing GNNs are equivalent to feedforward neural networks and learn tropical rational signomial maps (TRSMs), which are continuous piecewise linear functions. They derive general upper and lower bounds on the geometric complexity of GNNs and reveal how different aggregation and update functions affect this complexity. They introduce new architectures to showcase various tradeoffs between different design choices. The study concludes by characterizing the decision boundary for node and graph classification tasks.", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Oy2x0Xfx0u/podcast.wav"}
