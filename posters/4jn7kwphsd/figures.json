'Jitter' corruption shows higher energy in high-frequency components, while 'Rotate' shows higher energy in lower frequency components. Figure 1(b) demonstrates a negative correlation between the model robustness (mOA) to corruptions and the model's sensitivity to high/low frequency components.  This suggests models less sensitive to specific frequency bands tend to be more robust to those types of corruptions. ", "section": "3.

First, the Jacobian matrix for the input point cloud is computed. The gradient value of the output loss is visualized for each point.

The sensitivity maps show how sensitive each model is to changes in different frequency bands of the input point cloud.  The x-axis represents the frequency band, and the y-axis represents the sensitivity.  The plots show that models trained with FAT have lower sensitivity across a wider range of frequency bands compared to models trained without FAT.
