Several methods were compared, including different diffusion models (Bit Diffusion, D3PM, DDSM) and other approaches (Language Model, Linear FM, Dirichlet FM). The Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric was used to evaluate the performance of each method, which measures the difference between the predicted and true transcription profiles. The proposed A&E method achieved the lowest MSE, indicating its superior performance in generating DNA sequences given the transcription profile as a condition. The result shows that combining a Language Model (AR) and a distilled Dirichlet FM (DM) via the A&E framework yields better result than using either model individually.", "section": "5.1 Transcription Profile (TP) conditioned Promoter Design"}, {"figure_path": "XHTl2k1LYk/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: A comparison of DNA generation datasets.
