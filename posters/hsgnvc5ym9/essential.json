Recent models try to speed up the process by simplifying the flow trajectories, but they still face limitations in accurately learning straight trajectories.  This leads to suboptimal performance, especially for few-step generation.\n\nThe authors introduce a novel framework called Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF) to overcome these limitations. **CAF uses a simple constant acceleration equation, adding acceleration as a learnable variable to enhance the estimation of the ODE flow.** The study also proposes initial velocity conditioning and a reflow process to improve estimation accuracy. Experimental results show that CAF significantly outperforms existing methods on various datasets, achieving superior performance in both one-step and few-step generation, and demonstrating improved coupling preservation and inversion capabilities.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hsgNvC5YM9/podcast.wav"}
