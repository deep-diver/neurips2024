The models are evaluated based on FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and IS (Inception Score), which are common metrics for assessing the quality of generated images. Lower FID values and higher IS values indicate better performance. The table also includes a comparison of conditional generation, where models are trained to generate images from specific classes within the dataset.

The components include constant acceleration, initial velocity conditioning, and a reflow procedure. Each row represents a different configuration, combining the presence or absence of these elements, and the corresponding FID score is reported.
