Panel (a) depicts a general time series model framework, while panel (b) illustrates how CCM enhances this framework. CCM adds a 'Cluster Assigner' module that groups similar channels together based on their inherent similarities, learned via a cross-attention mechanism. The resulting cluster information is then used by the 'Cluster-aware Feed Forward' module to generate weights, effectively averaging the weights of channels within each cluster.  The use of learned prototypes enables zero-shot forecasting on unseen time series data, meaning the model can make predictions on new channels without needing additional training.", "section": "4 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "MDgn9aazo0/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: t-SNE visualization of channel and prototype embedding by DLinear with CCM on (a) ETTh1 and (b) ETTh2 dataset.
