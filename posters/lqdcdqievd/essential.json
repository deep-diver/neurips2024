This loss stems from multiple 3D points mapping to the same 2D location, where only one is retained. This leads to incomplete geometric structures and hinders accurate identification of small objects. \nTo overcome this, SFCNet introduces a novel spherical frustum structure that preserves all points within a frustum.  A hash-based representation ensures efficient storage.  The network employs Spherical Frustum Sparse Convolution (SFC) and Frustum Farthest Point Sampling (F2PS) for efficient feature extraction and uniform sampling.  Experimental results demonstrate that SFCNet outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets, significantly improving the segmentation of small objects due to the preservation of complete geometric structures.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "LqdcdqIeVD/podcast.wav"}
