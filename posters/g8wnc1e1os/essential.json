Existing defenses often assume homogeneous data distributions or rely on validation datasets, limiting their applicability to real-world, heterogeneous settings.  Furthermore, these methods may struggle with adaptive attacks or cause conflicts with standard federated optimization strategies.\nThis paper introduces Fisher Discrepancy Cluster and Rescale (FDCR), a novel defense mechanism.  FDCR leverages Fisher Information to assess the importance of model parameters in local distributions. By identifying significant discrepancies between benign and malicious clients in parameter importance, FDCR effectively isolates and mitigates the influence of malicious updates.  The method also prioritizes the rescaling of important parameters, enhancing model robustness and addressing the limitations of previous methods. The effectiveness of FDCR is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments in various heterogeneous settings under various backdoor attacks.", "affiliation": "Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "g8wnC1E1OS/podcast.wav"}
