Generalized CIL (GCIL) tackles a more realistic scenario where incoming data includes mixed categories and unknown data distributions. Existing GCIL methods either struggle with poor performance or compromise data privacy by storing previous data samples (exemplars). \nThis paper introduces Generalized Analytic Continual Learning (GACL), a new exemplar-free method for GCIL.  **GACL uses analytic learning**, a gradient-free approach, to obtain a closed-form solution. This solution cleverly decomposes incoming data into exposed and unexposed classes, ensuring a weight-invariant property. This means that the model's weights don't change drastically between incremental learning steps, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and achieving an equivalence between incremental and joint training. Extensive experiments show that GACL significantly outperforms other methods.", "affiliation": "South China University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Continual Learning"}, "podcast_path": "P6aJ7BqYlc/podcast.wav"}
