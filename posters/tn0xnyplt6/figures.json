The x-axis represents the LUT volume (in KB), and the y-axis represents the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) achieved at a 4x upscaling factor.  TinyLUT demonstrates superior accuracy (higher PSNR) while requiring significantly less memory (smaller LUT volume) than competing methods.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "tN0xnYPLt6/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a)The network overview of TinyLUT.

The left side shows how a 2x2 input convolution is mapped to a 4-dimensional LUT, resulting in a large storage requirement. The right side demonstrates the proposed separable mapping strategy (SMS) and dynamic discretization mechanism (DDM). SMS decomposes the convolution kernel into smaller parts, reducing the storage complexity. DDM further compresses the activation data, resulting in an even smaller LUT size. The figure demonstrates how TinyLUT effectively reduces the storage size compared to traditional methods while maintaining competitive accuracy.
