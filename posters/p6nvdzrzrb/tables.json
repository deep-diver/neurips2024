(6) subsumes these as special cases.", "description": "This table presents a new taxonomy for classification-based evidential deep learning (EDL) methods.  It categorizes EDL methods based on two key distinguishing features: (1) the parametric form of the meta distribution (direct vs. density parameterization) and (2) the learning criteria (objective function used during training).  The table lists several representative EDL methods and specifies their likelihood model, divergence function (forward KL or reverse KL), prior parameters (\u03b10), OOD regularization parameter (\u03b3ood), and parameterization type.  The unifying objective function L(\u03c8) from equation (6) in the paper subsumes the various loss functions used by these methods.", "section": "4 New Taxonomy for EDL Methods"}, {"figure_path": "P6nVDZRZRB/tables/tables_26_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: OOD detection AUROC score.
