However, their high computational cost at inference time (sampling) hinders broader applications.  Existing diffusion-based RL methods often struggle with slow inference and planning challenges, particularly in balancing exploration and exploitation.  The inherent flexibility of diffusion models also presents difficulties in implementing efficient exploration strategies.\nThis research introduces Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a novel framework that leverages the connection between diffusion models and energy-based models. Diff-SR bypasses the sampling bottleneck by directly learning value function representations. The approach facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms, delivering robust performance across various benchmarks.  The effectiveness is validated through comprehensive empirical studies in both fully and partially observable settings, showcasing significant improvements over existing methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.", "affiliation": "Georgia Tech", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "C3tEX45hJX/podcast.wav"}
