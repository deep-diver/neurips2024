Existing CL methods often rely on complex replay strategies or suffer from learning-forgetting trade-offs. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel method called ZAF (Zero-shot Antidote to Forgetting).\n\nZAF leverages a key insight: zero-shot prediction stability is strongly correlated with anti-forgetting. It employs a parameter-efficient architecture (EMA-LORA) to update models for new tasks efficiently while simultaneously regularizing zero-shot predictions on unseen data to maintain stability and reduce forgetting.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZAF significantly outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and a dramatic speedup in training time.  **The zero-shot antidote and decoupled learning-forgetting framework introduced by ZAF offer a novel perspective on addressing catastrophic forgetting.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "C4zmR2kyP8/podcast.wav"}
