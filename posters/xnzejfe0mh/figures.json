Subfigure (a) shows the impact of varying the communication interval (I) on the performance of FGDRO-CVaR and FGDRO-KL-Adam algorithms on the Camelyon dataset. It demonstrates the robustness of both algorithms to less frequent communication. Subfigure (b) compares the performance of LocalAdam (using Adam-type updates in local steps) against FedAdam (using Adam updates in global steps and SGD in local steps) on the Pile dataset.  This highlights the improvement gained by using adaptive steps locally.", "section": "7 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "xNZEjFe0mh/figures/figures_30_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Ablation Experiments", "description": "This figure consists of two subfigures.
