Existing approaches either approximate RTRL, leading to biased gradient estimates, or restrict RNN architectures, limiting representational power. This paper tackles these issues.\nThis work introduces Recurrent Trace Units (RTUs), a lightweight modification to Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs). RTUs leverage complex-valued diagonal recurrences, making RTRL efficient.  Experiments across several partially observable environments show that RTUs significantly outperform existing RNN architectures in terms of performance and computational efficiency when trained with RTRL. The findings are particularly relevant to online reinforcement learning where agents learn and interact with their environments simultaneously.", "affiliation": "University of Alberta", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "4UvMOnZMam/podcast.wav"}
