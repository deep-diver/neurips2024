Existing skill chaining methods often struggle with these issues, leading to unstable and unreliable task completion. \n\nThe paper introduces Skill Chaining via Dual Regularization (SCaR) to address these challenges. SCaR uses dual regularization during sub-task skill pre-training and fine-tuning to enhance both intra-skill (within each sub-task) and inter-skill (between sequential sub-tasks) dependencies. **Experiments on various benchmarks show that SCaR significantly outperforms existing methods**, achieving higher success rates and demonstrating greater robustness to perturbations. This is a valuable contribution to the field of long-horizon robotic manipulation.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "RnxJc4vTVi/podcast.wav"}
