This is particularly true for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones and IoT devices.  Previous attempts to binarize diffusion models for efficiency resulted in significant performance loss. \nThis paper introduces BI-DiffSR, a novel binarized diffusion model that achieves impressive SR results while dramatically reducing computational costs. This was made possible by designing a UNet architecture optimized for binarization, incorporating consistent-pixel downsampling/upsampling and channel-shuffle fusion, and dynamically adjusting activation distributions across timesteps using timestep-aware redistribution and activation functions.  The model's impressive results demonstrate its potential for efficient deployment on limited hardware platforms.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "yXpfrLMIr2/podcast.wav"}
