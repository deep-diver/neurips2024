It uses a Mean Teacher architecture with a student and teacher model, both employing transformer-based encoders and decoders.  The student model is trained with labeled and unlabeled data, while the teacher model uses only labeled data to provide guidance via an exponential moving average of the student's parameters.  The framework incorporates three loss functions: recognition loss (Lrec), character consistency regularization loss (Lccr), and character unidirectional alignment loss (Lcua).  The Online Generation Strategy (OGS) generates additional background-free samples to enhance data diversity for the student model.  Green arrows represent the flow of labeled and unlabeled data through the student and teacher models, and green lines show the flow of information specifically from the labeled data to the teacher model.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "7NrYnCN2be/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) All possible representations of English text images according to character orientation and reading order.
