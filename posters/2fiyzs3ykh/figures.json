We introduce an auxiliary variable xta and transform the inverse problem into a two-variable constrained optimization problem which can be solved using the projection gradient method.", "description": "The figure illustrates the framework of the proposed ProjDiff algorithm for solving inverse problems.  It shows how a diffusion model's denoising capability is integrated with an optimization process.  The inverse problem is transformed into a constrained optimization problem using an auxiliary variable xta representing a noisy sample at a specific step in the diffusion process. The solution involves iterative updates of both the original variable x0 and the auxiliary variable xta.  The update process for xta is constrained by the observation equation, and uses projection gradient descent, shown visually as a projection onto the constraint. The update for x0 leverages the denoising capability of the diffusion process to refine the estimate towards the noise-free solution. The PDF contours visualize the probability density functions involved in the optimization.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "2fiYzs3YkH/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 10: Noise-free nonlinear restoration on FFHQ (\u03c3 = 0).", "description": "This figure shows the results of noise-free nonlinear restoration on the FFHQ dataset with \u03c3 = 0.

The x-axis represents either FID or LPIPS, and the y-axis represents PSNR.  Each point represents an algorithm's performance.  The red lines trace the change in PSNR across different FID and LPIPS values for the ProjDiff algorithm, showing how PSNR changes with different hyperparameter settings (step size).
