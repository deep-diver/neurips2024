Conversely, higher values of $\\lambda_{1}$ (e.g., 0.2 and 0.3) may overemphasize the supervised loss term, potentially causing the model to overfit the labeled data and ignore useful information from the unlabeled data. The sweet spot lies in the middle (around 0.1), attaining a balance between learning from labeled data and leveraging information from unlabeled data. Regarding $\\lambda_{2}$ , very low values (e.g., 1e-4 and 1e-3) may not enforce sufficient consistency in the model predictions on unlabeled data, resulting in a model that fails to generalize well. However, if $\\lambda_{2}$ is too high (e.g., 0.2 and 0.3), the model may overemphasize the consistency constraint, possibly leading to a model that is too rigid to capture the diverse patterns in the data. An optimal value of $\\lambda_{2}$ (around 0.1 in our experiments) ensures a good balance between encouraging prediction consistency and allowing the model to adapt to the diverse patterns in the data. The optimal value choice for hyperparameters $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ (around 0.1) also validates that the RL loss is the main leading term, while the supervised loss and consistency loss are augmenting terms.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
