Existing SSL methods often rely on heuristics or predefined rules for pseudo-label generation, hindering performance. This often leads to suboptimal model training.  The paper tackles this problem by formulating SSL as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. \nThe proposed method, RLGSSL, uses an RL agent to learn how to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. It introduces a novel RL loss function that incorporates a weighted reward, balancing labeled and unlabeled data to maximize model generalization.  RLGSSL also integrates a teacher-student framework for increased stability. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLGSSL consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art SSL methods, showcasing its effectiveness. **This innovative approach addresses key limitations of existing SSL techniques by dynamically adapting to data and improving pseudo-label quality.**", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Carleton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "PSMBefUZa2/podcast.wav"}
