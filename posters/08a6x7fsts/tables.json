Lower BRISQUE and NIQE scores indicate better image quality, while a higher CLIP-Score suggests better alignment between generated images and text prompts. The comparison is performed on the T3Bench dataset, which includes object-level descriptions. The \"Ours w/o refining\" row shows the performance of the proposed method without the refinement stage, highlighting the impact of the refinement process on overall quality.", "section": "5.4 Quantitative Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "08A6X7FSTs/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative comparison of scene-level models with 64 prompts", "description": "This table quantitatively compares the performance of Director3D against three other scene-level text-to-3D generation models using 64 different text prompts.  The metrics used are NIQE (Natural Image Quality Evaluator), CLIP-Score (a metric measuring the alignment between generated images and text prompts), and Inference Time. Lower NIQE scores indicate better image quality, higher CLIP-Score scores represent better alignment with text descriptions, and lower inference times show faster model processing.", "section": "5.4 Quantitative Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "08A6X7FSTs/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Quantitative ablation study of SDS++ loss", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study on the SDS++ loss, a key component of the Director3D model.  Different configurations of the SDS++ loss are tested, removing components or changing parameters. The results are evaluated using two metrics: NIQE (Natural Image Quality Evaluator), which measures image quality, and CLIP-Score, which measures the alignment between generated images and textual descriptions. The \"full\" row shows the results with the complete SDS++ loss, while subsequent rows show results after removing or modifying specific parts of the loss function.  Lower NIQE scores are better (indicating higher quality images), and higher CLIP scores are better (indicating better alignment with text descriptions). The table shows that the complete SDS++ loss achieves the best performance, highlighting the importance of all its components for high-quality image generation.", "section": "5.6 Ablation Study"}]
