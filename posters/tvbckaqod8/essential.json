This study investigates the trade-offs involved in choosing between two popular diagonal FIM estimators, highlighting the variance differences between them. \n\nThe paper derives analytical variance bounds for these estimators in neural networks used for both regression and classification tasks.  These bounds depend on the non-linearity of the network and the properties of the output distribution.  The study concludes that selecting the appropriate estimator involves balancing the trade-off between computational cost and estimation variance, which varies significantly based on factors such as the network architecture, activation function and task type.  The paper contributes novel analytical and numerical insights into the practical challenges of FIM estimation in deep learning.", "affiliation": "Australian National University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "TVbCKAqoD8/podcast.wav"}
