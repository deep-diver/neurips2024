To utilize a more appropriate ranking metric and more comprehensive information among the alternative set, we propose a novel in-context example selection framework to approximately identify the global optimal prompt, i.e. choosing the best performing in-context examples from all alternatives for each query sample.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "There are a few key challenges in choosing the best prompt for VICL. (1) Choosing the Right Metric: Since we cannot directly test how well a prompt works on a specific image, we need to find a different way to measure it. Previous methods like VPR [32] mainly use two metrics from ranked observations in the training set: visual similarity and pair-wise relevance instantiated through contrastive learning. However, visual similarity does not always work well as in our experiments. The contrastive learning method naturally restricts how much the model can learn because of how its objective function is designed. To make contrastive learning effective, VPR needs to collect the most representative positive and negative examples for each query, which are the best and worst in-context examples. Consequently, a large amount of ranking observations remain unused during training. (2) Deciding on the Comparison Set: When considering the ranking metric, it is best to exhaustively compare each example against all the candidates available. However, directly ranking all alternatives globally is often not always possible. Instead, we have to aggregate rankings from partial predictions. Pair-wise ranking, like in VPR, ensures consistent ranking predictions by comparing each option\u2019s similarity to the query individually. But it cannot grasp the overall relationship between options. Conversely, methods with larger capacity, such as list-wise ranking, struggle to create a unified ranking due to inconsistencies among different partial predictions. Anyway, balancing feasibility and capacity is crucial for VICL sample selection algorithms.

Partial2Global involves several list-wise partial rankers based on transformers to rank multiple alternative samples, and a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to achieve globally consistent ranking from the partial rankers. (1) To approximate the ground-truth ranking metric, we propose a transformer-based list-wise ranker to rank multiple alternative samples in a more informative and comprehensive manner. This model takes features of several alternatives together with the query sample from pretrained foundation models as input. The ranking predictions can then be inferred with more comprehensive knowledge from multiple alternatives and query sample by merging information among class tokens regarding each sample. Through meta-learning based training strategy, our model can learn a generalizable ranking metric for each specific task, thus better facilitating VICL example selection. (2) To approximate the global ranking, we propose a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to strike the balance between feasibility and ranking capacity. Particularly, partial and noisy ranking predictions from the trained ranking model are collected and divided into several groups, which can be reorganized and aggregated by learning a global ranker that has minimized average distance with all ranking groups. The resulted global ranking enjoys better ranking consistency and thus provides better in-context examples to boost VICL performance.

For example, Pan et. al. [15] designed an in-context learning system to generate symbolic representation, which can then be used for logical inference. Zhang et. al. [33] proposed to leverage in-context learning to edit factual knowledge in LLMs. Handel et. al. [7] showed that in-context learning works by compressing training set into task representations which can modulate models during inference for desired output.

In the example selected by VPR, the monitor is placed at the right, which is the same as the non-target monitor in the query image, thus leading to wrong guidance and prediction. Apart from that, VPR tends to select small objects for detection, as shown in Fig. 5. This can lead to failed detection even though the query objects are large enough for huamns to detect them. In comparison, our method can generally select more proper in-context examples, thus enjoying better performance.

Specifically, we consider three models: (1) Rank-10 Naive: A rank-10 model is trained, of which the ranking predictions are directly used for example selection. (2) Rank-10 Aggr.: After training the rank-10 model and getting the ranking predictions, we use the proposed consistencyaware ranking aggregator described in Sec. 3.2 to process these data, then we pick the top-ranked sample in the post-processed global ranking as in-context example. (3) Rank-{5,10} Aggr.: Our full model, in which the ranking prediction of both ranking models are mixed and processed with consistency-aware ranking aggregator to get the final global ranking. The results are presented in Tab. 2. We find that the naive ranking model enjoys 1.54 higher average mIoU than SupPR, which supports our motivation of using ranking model instead of pair-wise contrastive learning model. Since ranking model can make better use of the training data, and comparing multiple samples enables the model to discover the inner relationship between them, rather than simply judging if one sample is better than another one. Moreover, We find that using consistency-aware ranking aggregator to process the ranking predictions can lead to further improvement, which can be enlarged by including results from rank-5 model. This is because the predictions of ranking models can be thought of as from different annotators. Even for a single model, its predictions will not be consistent when given two sequences which share partial same samples. Therefore, simply utilizing the inconsistent predictions can lead to suboptimal results, and consistency-aware ranking aggregator helps regulate the predictions to produce more globally consistent ranking results, thus having better results.

A basic claim in VPR is that the more similar an image is to the query image, the better it is as an in-context example. Nonetheless, VPR utilizes performance metrics instead of visual similarity for contrastive learning and provides better results, which makes one wonder if such a claim is indeed solid. To check this out, we take a look at the best performing in-context examples selected by our method. The results are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). We first visualize the correlation between visual similarity, which is computed by extracting CLIP features for each image and then calculating and averaging the cosine similarity between the alternatives and query, and mIoU on segmentation for both VPR and our method. It is clear that visual similarity can be a basic heuristic for choosing visual in-context examples. Generally well performing examples appear to share high similarity with query samples. On the other hand, there are also large amount of failure cases with high similarity, which indicates the ground principle should be much more complex than visual similarity. Based on this conclusion, we further visualize several cases in Fig. 4(c) selected by our method, which better shows that one should consider more than visual similarity and stress other factors such as object size, spatial position. On the opposite, we find that the background similarity, which can contribute significantly to the visual similarity, is hardly related to the quality of in-context examples.

First, directly using ranking prediction from our ranking models through the naive ranking strategy performs better than VPR no matter which backbone is utilized. VPR also conducted such an experiment to try their method with different backbones such as CLIP, EVA and supervised ViT, but none of those results can outperform ours, which illustrates the efficacy of our design of ranking model against the contrastive learning based model. Second, adopting consistency-aware ranking aggregator consistently improves the naive ranking method by nearly 1-2 mIoU for both segmentation and detection, which is compatible with the results in Tab. 2, showing the robustness of the proposed method among different backbone choices. Third, the in-context performance is not totally correlated with the capacity of backbones. It is commonly known that DINO v2, as an improved version of DINO v1 with more comprehensive objective functions and more data, should be equipped with higher capacity. However, we find that DINO v2 performs worse than DINO v1 on segmentation whether naive ranking or consistency-aware ranking aggregator is adopted.

To show that we test two strategies: (1) directly using samples ranked second and third as in-context examples and (2) adopting a simple late fusion method to average predictions generated with 2, 3, 5 top ranked samples.

Moreover, fusing 2 or 3 samples together leads to 0.73 and 1.43 higher average mIoU, which also supports the consistent optimality brought by the consistency-aware ranking aggregator.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
