A core challenge is selecting the most effective prompts (contextual examples).  Current methods struggle with finding the globally optimal prompt, often relying on limited metrics or inconsistent comparisons. \n\nPartial2Global tackles this by using a transformer-based list-wise ranker to comprehensively compare various prompts.  It leverages a consistency-aware aggregator to ensure globally consistent rankings, thereby identifying the most effective prompt for each query.  **Experiments show Partial2Global consistently outperforms existing methods in diverse visual tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results.**", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "N2PwbxJ3o6/podcast.wav"}
