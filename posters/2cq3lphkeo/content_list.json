We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. The penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines.

For the out-of-distribution responses, which are dissimilar with (or not well covered by) the responses in the data, the high inherent uncertainty of underlying human preferences could make the learned reward model misleading for out-of-distribution responses. In this situation, reward overoptimization can occur because the LLM is fine-tuned towards maximizing a reward model with defective out-ofdistribution prediction, giving a potential consequence that the LLM responses are favored by the learned reward but less preferred by a human [86].

Calling back to the theoretical Algorithm 1, such a modification of gradient direction originates from the reward penalty in the adversarial objective for the reward model.

Due to the overoptimization, the model tends to disprefer the chosen responses as they are away from the maximizers of the proxy reward despite that some chosen responses are highly preferred by humans. Consistent with our theoretical conclusion, we empirically find that RPO can indeed alleviate overoptimization in DPO.

The technique of RLHF [12, 87, 42, 6, 18, 55] has recently demonstrated its great importance in building the state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT [1], Gemini [61], Claude [2]. In the RLHF pipeline, the LLM is fine-tuned towards maximizing a learned reward model for better alignment [52, 57] with human preference using RL algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO; [51]). Meanwhile, PPO-style algorithm is also known for its instability, sample-inefficiency, and especially, a high demand for proper hyperparameter tuning [22].

Each of them aims to address further challenges of direct preference learning from varying perspectives. Specifically, the algorithm proposed by [44, 26] share similar algorithmic components as RPO proposed in this work. Both work consider SFT style regularization during preference optimization. However, theoretical understanding of how SFT loss can help alignment remains unknown. In contrast, we provide theoretical justifications to the SFT loss as an implicit adversarial regularizer that provably mitigates overoptimization in preference learning.

Initiated from the literature of dueling bandits and dueling RL [76, 7, 43], recent success of RLHF in fine-tuning LLMs also motivates a long line of research to investigate the theoretical foundations of RLHF under different settings [11, 85, 78, 79, 67, 31, 71, 74, 19, 84], aiming to propose provably sample-efficient algorithms to learn a human-rewardmaximizing policy from human preference signals. Our theoretical study of RLHF falls into the paradigm of offline learning from a pre-collected preference dataset, and is mostly related to the work of [85, 78, 31, 71, 74]. In this setup, the main challenge is to address the overoptimization issues due to human reward uncertainty and distributional shifts when only a fixed dataset is available.

Typically, to encompass the pessimistic principle in the face of uncertainty, the existing literature proposes to return the optimal policy against either an estimated reward model plus a structure-aware reward uncertainty penalty [71] or the most pessimistic reward model inside a confidence region [85, 78]. Both of these two types of method involve intractable components for implementation and needs for additional algorithmic design to approximate the theoretical algorithm in practice. In contrast, our theory works in the context of general function approximations while being friendly to be implemented. Finally, we remark that, while our study focuses on the standard Bradley-Terry model of human preference with general reward function approximations, the work of [74] further considers a general human preference model.

It serves as an interesting direction to extend our technique to RLHF with general reward model and device new practical algorithms.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
