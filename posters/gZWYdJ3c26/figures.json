The left side shows the steps involved: transforming a point cloud (Xji) to a common coordinate system, marking occupied voxels (green) based on point presence, and then marking empty voxels (red) based on the line-of-sight (LoS) from the LiDAR to each voxel.  The right side shows a real-world example of this binary map projected onto a 2D plane.  The map indicates occupied (green), empty (red), and ignored (gray) voxels, aiding in semantic scene completion by providing self-supervision.", "section": "3.2 Test-time Adaptation via Line of Sight (TALOS)"}, {"figure_path": "gZWYdJ3c26/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Left: Verification of the reliability metric.

The left panel shows a graph verifying the correlation between the reliability metric (R) and the semantic completion accuracy.  Higher reliability scores correspond to higher accuracy. The right panel illustrates how pseudo-ground truth (pGT) is constructed by combining predictions from different moments. The blue boxes highlight instances where unreliable predictions were discarded, while red boxes showcase instances where predictions from other time steps improved the overall pGT.
