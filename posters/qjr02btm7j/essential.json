Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) are a promising approach due to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-range dependencies.  However, a lack of theoretical understanding hinders the reliable training and optimization of deep FNOs.  Training instability and difficulty in achieving optimal performance are significant obstacles.\nThis paper introduces a mean-field theory for FNOs, providing a theoretical framework to analyze their behavior.  **By examining the ordered-chaos phase transition, the researchers established a connection between the FNO's expressivity and its trainability**.  They found that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively.  This crucial finding informs practical initialization strategies for stable FNO training and provides valuable insights into the limitations and potentials of FNOs.", "affiliation": "University of Tokyo", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "QJr02BTM7J/podcast.wav"}
