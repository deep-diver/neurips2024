For IRD, it shows the number of expectations violated by the generated policy and the time taken. Note that our method is guaranteed not to choose a policy that results in violated expectations.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the proposed method against the Inverse Reward Design (IRD) method.  The proposed method uses a query-based approach to identify expectation-aligned policies. The table shows the number of queries required by the proposed method, the time taken to find these policies, the number of violated expectations by IRD, and the time taken by IRD. The key finding is that the proposed method is significantly faster than IRD and guarantees that no expectations are violated, unlike IRD.", "section": "Evaluation"}]
