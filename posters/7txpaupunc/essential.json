Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to identify the network's features by learning a sparse dictionary that reconstructs the network's internal activations; however, these SAEs may focus more on dataset structure than the network's computational structure.  Existing SAEs suffer from feature splitting and feature suppression, hindering accurate feature identification. \nThis paper introduces a novel method: end-to-end (e2e) SAE training.  Instead of minimizing reconstruction error, e2e SAEs minimize the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. This approach ensures that the learned features are functionally important. Results show that e2e SAEs require fewer features, achieve better performance, and maintain high interpretability compared to standard SAEs, representing a Pareto improvement. The authors also provide a library and resources to facilitate reproducibility.", "affiliation": "Apollo Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "7txPaUpUnc/podcast.wav"}
