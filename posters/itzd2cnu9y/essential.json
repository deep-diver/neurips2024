Current sparsification methods, while computationally efficient, may lead to suboptimal treatment quality by neglecting crucial small elements in the dose influence matrix.  This results in potential side effects or ineffective tumor targeting. \n\nThis paper introduces a novel randomized matrix sketching method to address this issue.  The method efficiently sparsifies the matrix without significantly impacting the quality of treatment.  Experimental results on lung and prostate cancer datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods, offering significantly improved computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.
