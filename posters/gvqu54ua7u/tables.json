It includes mathematical symbols representing concepts such as the ordering cone, number of arms and objectives, Pareto sets, the reward matrix, rewards, confidence balls, distances between Pareto fronts, allocation vectors, families of policies, and estimated/true mean rewards, among others. These notations are crucial for understanding the mathematical formulations and algorithms presented in the paper.", "section": "Notations"}]
