This paper tackles these issues. \nThe proposed method, LinUProp, uses linear uncertainty propagation to model uncertainty additively.  This provides **linear scalability**, **guaranteed convergence**, and **closed-form solutions**. LinUProp's accuracy is validated through theoretical analysis and experiments, showcasing its superiority over existing methods in uncertainty-based active learning.
