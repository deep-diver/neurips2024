However, these methods often fall short in practical applications, and more complex methods are favored.  This paper investigates this gap by proposing that sum-based aggregators fail to effectively \"mix\" features from different neighbors, hence limiting their ability to succeed on more complex downstream tasks.\nThis paper introduces a new aggregation module called Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation (SSMA).  **SSMA addresses the \"mixing\" problem by treating neighbor features as 2D signals and sequentially convolving them.** The proposed method demonstrates substantial performance improvements across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results when combined with existing GNN architectures.  **The theoretical analysis supports SSMA's enhanced ability to mix features and its efficient representation size.**", "affiliation": "Technion", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aRokfUfIQs/podcast.wav"}
