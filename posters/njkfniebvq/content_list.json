Accurately estimating an instance\u2019s noise transition matrix is crucial for estimating its clean label.

To leverage these estimated transition matrices to help estimate the transition matrices of other instances, it is essential to explore relations between the matrices of these \u201cspecial\u201d instances and those of others. Existing studies typically build the relation by explicitly defining the similarity between the estimated noise transition matrices of \u201cspecial\u201d instances and those of other instances. However, these similarity-based assumptions are hard to validate and may not align with real-world data. If these assumptions fail, both noise transition matrices and clean labels cannot be accurately estimated. In this paper, we found that by learning the latent causal structure governing the generating process of noisy data, we can estimate noise transition matrices without the need for similarity-based assumptions. Unlike previous generative label-noise learning methods, we consider causal relations between latent causal variables and model them with a learnable graphical model. Utilizing only noisy data, our method can effectively learn the latent causal structure.

Subsequently, the noise transition matrices of other instances can be estimated by making use of the estimated noise transition matrices of the \u201cspecial\u201d instances. To offer some intuition, in Fig. 1, we illustrate two noisy examples in the benchmark noisy dataset CIFAR-10N. Suppose there is a latent variable for the \u201cpresence of fur\u201d, and an annotator is biased by the \u201cpresence of fur\u201d. If the first \u201ccat\u201d image containing \u201cfur\u201d is mislabeled as \u201cdog\u201d by this annotator, then a second \u201ccat\u201d image also containing \u201cfur\u201d will likely be mislabeled as \u201cdog\u201d with high probability by the same annotator. This leads us to understand that the noise transition matrices for the two images are similar when their causal variables have the same value.

Specifically, examples from the same class share the same data-generating process. The essence of learning the data-generating process lies in learning these shared parameters. When these parameters are shared across different examples, the total number of parameters does not increase as more examples are provided. Instead, these parameters are selected to fit the examples as well as possible.

This setup leads to identifiability when the number of equations exceeds the number of parameters, which enables a precise estimation of the parameters.

However, current label-noise learning methods often can only estimate the noise transition matrices of some instances. To leverage these estimated transition matrices to help estimate transition matrices of other instances. It is crucial to establish the connection among the noise transition matrices for different instances. Prior work tackled this issue by manually defining the similarities of noise transition matrices across different instances. Given only noisy data, the introduced similarity-based assumptions are hard to verify. If similarities are not truthful, the estimation error of the noise transition matrix could be large, leading to performance degeneration for label-noise learning algorithms. We propose an effective method to capture the connection among the noise transition matrices implicitly by modeling the latent causal structures in the generation of noisy data.

Methods in label-noise learning refer specifically to the methods that model the transition matrices. In this section, we briefly introduce other approaches in learning with noisy labels. Some algorithms [13, 29, 58, 34] select examples which likely to be correct for training. These selections are based on the memorization effect [60, 35, 3, 33, 59], which suggests deep neural networks initially memorize major patterns before progressively memorizing minor ones. In datasets containing noisy labels, correctly labeled examples often form the majority. This enables the networks to prioritize learning from these examples at the early stage of training. As a result, these examples can typically be identified by their low loss values early on. Co-Teaching [13] employs this principle to identify small-loss examples as probably clean examples. DivideMix [29] uses a Gaussian Mixture Model to separate training examples into labeled and unlabeled sets based on their training loss, with the labeled set assumed to contain correct labels and trains networks in a semi-supervised manner [4, 16]. Some methods design robust loss functions for learning with noisy labels. If a loss function $\\ell$ is symmetric, i.e., $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{i}\\ell(g_{Y}(\\pmb{X}),i)=c}\\end{array}$ , where $c$ is a constant, the loss function $\\ell$ is robust to label noise [11, 12]. By combating Cross Entropy and Reverse Cross Entropy, Symmetric Cross Entropy Learning is robust to label noise [48]. Some methods correct noisy labels in datasets [47, 61]. Tanaka et al. proposed a method that updates network parameters and class labels alternatively. Zheng et al. provided theoretical guarantees for data-re-calibrating methods and proposed a label-correction algorithm with a guaranteed success rate [61]. NPC [1] is a post-processing method that models the generation process of clean labels and then uses the model to calibrate the prediction of classifiers.

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
