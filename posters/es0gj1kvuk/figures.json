[{"figure_path": "ES0Gj1KVUk/figures/figures_32_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experimental results for two synthetic data sets with p = 1 (left), respectively p = 2 (right). Our method is presented in red and compared against uniform sampling, which is presented in blue. Solid lines indicate the median and shaded areas indicate \u00b12 standard errors around the median taken across 201 independent repetitions for each reduced size between 50 and 600 in equal increment steps of 50. For the blue shaded area below the blue solid line, only feasible repetitions were counted, while the blue shaded area above represents the unbounded standard error without this restriction. For some lower reduced sizes, even the median was infinite, which results in an interrupted blue solid line. This indicates that more than half of the repetitions gave infeasible results when using uniform sampling with low sample sizes, while our method never produced infeasible results.", "description": "The figure shows the results of an experiment comparing the performance of the proposed coreset construction method against uniform sampling for Poisson regression with ID-link and square root-link.  The y-axis represents the median approximation ratio, while the x-axis shows the reduced size of the dataset. The plots visualize the median approximation ratio and its standard error for both methods across various reduced dataset sizes. Notably, the uniform sampling method frequently produces infeasible results for smaller dataset sizes, while the proposed method consistently yields valid approximations.", "section": "G.3 Experimental illustration"}]
