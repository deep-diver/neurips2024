This leads to artifacts in surface reconstruction, especially in large-scale scenes.  Previous techniques mainly focus on improving the rotation parameter of 3D Gaussians, neglecting other geometric parameters and resulting in limited updates. This paper introduces VCR-GauS, a novel approach that incorporates a view-consistent depth-normal regularizer to enhance the reconstruction process.  The regularizer directly couples depth and normal information, fully optimizing geometric parameters. A confidence term mitigates inconsistencies in normal predictions, while a densification and splitting strategy enhances the accuracy and efficiency of surface modeling.  The proposed approach yields substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and speed.  Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that VCR-GauS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing Gaussian-based methods in terms of both reconstruction quality and rendering speed.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "axnjX20Ssl/podcast.wav"}
