Firstly, while AUTOPSV aims to reduce the need for manual intervention, there is still a risk of inaccurate annotations. The relative step-level confidence change used to produce process annotations is an estimation and may not always accurately represent the actual correctness of a reasoning step. This could compromise the quality of the annotations and, in turn, the effectiveness of the method. Secondly, the success of AUTOPSV is heavily dependent on the performance of the verifier. If the model is not accurate enough in its step-level scores, the quality of the process annotations generated by AUTOPSV could be compromised. Thirdly, AUTOPSV is specifically designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, its applicability may be limited to tasks that involve complex multi-step reasoning. It is unclear how well the method will scale or generalize to other tasks or domains that do not involve intensive reasoning.

Moreover, AUTOPSV combines the strengths of output supervision and process supervision to automatically annotate reasoning steps, significantly reducing the time, effort, and cost associated with manual annotation. This makes the process of training LLMs more efficient and accessible.

An alternative strategy involves using self-correcting LLMs, which rely on automated feedback to iteratively adapt and understand the consequences of their actions without heavy reliance on human intervention.
