The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability.

SSA-Seg, on the other hand, is a classifier whose semantic prototype is dynamic and can be offset towards the center of the semantic domain of the image. In addition, SSA-Seg can be combined with OCRNet as a classifier to enhance the performance of OCRNet, as shown in Table 1. Finally, SSA-Seg additionally introduces spatial prototype adaptation and online multi-domain distillation, which is significantly different from the work of OCRNet.

Therefore, our spatial domain center models the collection of information about neighboring segments belonging to the same object, rather than an absolute one point. In other words, it enables the model to indirectly take into account the semantic features of pixels at neighboring locations when classifying them. Second, many images in ADE20k and COCO-stuff have the same category scattered in different areas. Nevertheless, our SSA-Seg can still significantly improve the performance of the model on these datasets. This is because SPPA takes into account the spatial structure information.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
