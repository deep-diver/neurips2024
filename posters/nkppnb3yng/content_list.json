Many Deep Robust algorithms exist such as M2TD3 [18], M3DDPG [19], or RARL [20], which are all based on the two player zero-sum game presented in 2. We will compare our method against these algorithms, except [19] which is outperformed by [18] in general. We also compare our algorithm to Domain randomization (DR) [21] that learns a value function $V(s)=\\operatorname*{max}_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}_{p\\sim\\mathcal{U}(\\mathcal{P})}V_{p}^{\\pi}(s)$ which maximizes the expected return on average across a fixed (generally uniform) distribution on $\\mathcal{P}$ . As such, DR approaches do not optimize the worst-case performance but still have good performance on average. Nonetheless, DR has been used convincingly in applications [22, 23]. Finally, the zero-sum game formulation has lead to the introduction of action robustness [9] which is a specific case of rectangular MDPs, in scenarios where the adversary shares the same action space as the agent and interferes with the agent\u2019s actions. Several strategies based on this idea have been proposed. One approach, the Game-theoretic Response Approach for Adversarial Defense (GRAD) [24] builds on the Probabilistic Action Robust MDP (PR-MDP) [9]. This method introduces time-constrained perturbations in both the action and state spaces and employs a game-theoretic approach with a population of adversaries. In contrast to GRAD, where temporal disturbances affect the transition kernel around a nominal kernel, our method is part of a broader setting in which the transition kernel is included in a larger uncertainty set. Robustness via Adversary Populations (RAP) [25] introduces a population of adversaries. This approach ensures that the agent develops robustness against a wide range of potential perturbations, rather than just a single one, which helps prevent convergence to suboptimal stationary points. Similarly, State Adversarial MDPs [26, 27, 28, 24] address adversarial attacks on state observations, effectively creating a partially observable MDP.

To compare metrics across different environments, each method\u2019s score $v$ was standardized relative to the reference score of TD3. TD3 was trained on the environment using default transition function parameters, with its score denoted as $v_{T D3}$ . The M2TD3 score, $v_{M2T D3}$ , was used as the comparison target. The formula applied was $(v-v_{T D3})/(|v_{M2T D3}-v_{T D3}|)$ . This positioned $v_{T D3}$ as the minimal baseline and $v_{M2T D3}$ as the target score. This standardisation provides a metric that quantifies the improvement of each method over TD3 in relation to the improvement of M2TD3 over TD3. In each evaluation environment, agents trained with the time-constrained framework (indicated by TC in the method name) demonstrated significantly superior performance compared to those trained using alternative robust reinforcement learning approaches, including M2TD3 and RARL. Furthermore, they outperformed those trained through domain randomisation (DR). Notably, even without directly conditioning the policy with $\\psi$ , the time-constrained trained policies excelled against all baselines, achieving up to a 2.9-fold improvement. The non-normalized scores are reported in Appendix H. Additionally, when policies were directly conditioned by $\\psi$ and trained within the robust reinforcement learning framework, they tended to be overly conservative in the time-constrained framework. This is depicted in Table 1, comparing the performances of Oracle RARL, Oracle M2TD3, Oracle TC-RARL, and Oracle TC-M2TD3. Both policies also observe $\\psi$ . The only difference is that Oracle RARL and Oracle M2TD3 were trained in the robust reinforcement learning framework, while Oracle TC-RARL and Oracle TC-M2TD3 were trained in the time-constrained framework. The performance differences under worst-case time-coupled perturbation are as follows: for Oracle RARL (resp. M2TD3) and Oracle TC-RARL (resp. M2TD3), the values are $-0.86$ (1.39) vs. 2.54 (3.07). This observation highlights the need for a balance between robust training and flexibility in dynamic conditions. A natural question arises regarding the worst-case time-constrained perturbation. Was the adversary in the loop adequately trained, or might its suboptimal performance lead to overestimating the trained agent\u2019s reward against the worst-case perturbation? The adversary\u2019s performance was monitored during its training against all fixed-trained agents. The results in Appendix F show that our adversary converged.

These assumptions often result in overly conservative policies, which are not suitable for real-world applications where environmental disturbances are multifactorial, correlated, and time-constrained. In order to overcome these challenges, we proposed a new formulation, the Time-Constrained Robust Markov Decision Process (TC-RMDP). The TC-RMDP framework is capable of accurately capturing the dynamics of real-world environments, due to its consideration of the temporal continuity and correlation of disturbances. This approach resulted in the development of three algorithms: The three algorithms, Oracle-TC , Stacked-TC , vanilla TC which differ in the extent to which environmental information is incorporated into the decision-making process. A comprehensive evaluation of continuous control benchmarks using MuJoCo environments has demonstrated that the proposed TC-RMDP algorithms outperform traditional robust RL methods and domain randomization techniques. These algorithms achieved a superior balance between performance and robustness in both time-constrained and static settings. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the TC-RMDP framework in reducing the conservatism of policies while maintaining robustness. Moreover, we provided theoretical guaranties for Oracle-TC in Th. 2.1 and for Stacked-TC and vanilla TC in Th. 6.2. This study contributes to the field of robust reinforcement learning by introducing a time-constrained framework that more accurately reflects the dynamics observed in real-world settings. The proposed algorithms and theoretical contributions offer new avenues for the development of more effective and practical RL applications in environments with complex, time-constrained uncertainties.

This tests the agents\u2019 adaptability to unexpected changes. In contrast, the cosine fixed adversary introduces deterministic changes using a cosine function. The radius of $L=0.1$ scales the frequency of the cosine function, ensuring smooth and periodic variations. Additionally, a phase shift at the start of each episode ensures different starting points.

Furthermore, the exponential fixed adversary uses an exponential function. Parameters change exponentially from the initial value to either of a vertex of the uncertainty set $\\Psi$ over 1000 steps.
