Recently, learning-based methods [12, 13, 14, 15] have emerged to generate more realistic traffic trajectories by learning from real-world data. However, these methods usually face challenges with controllability, unable to fulflil specific requirements like instructing a vehicle to turn left, and they rely on past trajectories that are expensive and difficult to obtain. There is growing interest in controllable trajectory generation [4, 6, 16, 7], focusing on customizing trajectories to meet diverse user requirements. TrafficGen [4] generates a specific number of vehicles and their trajectories on a blank map. CTG [6] uses a loss function to guide trajectory generation according to user controls. influenced by LLMs, languagedriven traffic scenario generation is emerging. $\\mathrm{CTG++}$ [16] employs LLM to convert user queries into a loss function for realistic, controllable generation.
