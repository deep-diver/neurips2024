InteractTraj significantly improves trajectory realism.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed InteractTraj model against other state-of-the-art methods for traffic trajectory generation realism.  The evaluation is performed on two widely used datasets: Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and nuPlan. The metrics used to assess realism include mean average displacement error (mADE), minimum average displacement error (minADE), mean final displacement error (mFDE), minimum final displacement error (minFDE), scenario collision rate (SCR), and Hausdorff distance (HD). Lower values in these metrics generally indicate higher realism. The table shows that InteractTraj achieves significantly better results than the other methods, demonstrating its superior performance in generating realistic traffic trajectories.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "1u3qkG7BkQ/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Ablation study on proposed code and network designs evaluated on WOMD. All designs are beneficial.", "description": "This ablation study investigates the impact of different components of InteractTraj on its performance.  It evaluates the model's performance when removing specific parts of the interaction code (Interaction Codes (IC), Relative Distance (RD), Relative Position (RP)), or the relative distance loss (Lrd) from the training process. The results show that including all these components leads to the best performance, suggesting their importance for generating realistic interactive traffic trajectories.

The results demonstrate that using a gap of 15 meters and dividing the space into 6 areas (as in the original model) yields optimal results, balancing the model's ability to capture fine-grained interaction details without excessively increasing computational complexity.", "section": "5.
