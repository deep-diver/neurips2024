{"importance": "This paper is highly important for researchers working with large language models (LLMs) and AI agents.  It directly addresses the challenge of effectively guiding LLMs in unfamiliar domains, a critical limitation of current in-context learning methods. **AUTOGUIDE offers a novel, data-driven approach for generating and selecting context-aware guidelines that significantly enhances LLM agent performance.**  The findings pave the way for more robust and adaptable AI agents capable of handling complex tasks and dynamic environments. Its focus on concise, natural language guidelines offers a practical and easily transferable solution.  Furthermore, the evaluation using diverse benchmark domains and multi-modal websites establishes the broad applicability of AUTOGUIDE.", "summary": "AutoGuide: Automated generation of context-aware guidelines significantly improves LLM agent performance in unfamiliar domains.", "takeaways": ["AUTOGUIDE automatically generates context-aware guidelines from offline data, overcoming limitations of in-context learning.", "The generated guidelines are expressed in concise natural language, improving LLM agent understanding and decision-making.", "AUTOGUIDE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex benchmark domains, including real-world web navigation."], "tldr": "Current methods for guiding large language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, like web navigation, often struggle due to the models' limited knowledge in such domains. Demonstration-based in-context learning, while intuitive, proves insufficient when faced with diverse, dynamic environments and lengthy context limitations. This paper introduces AUTOGUIDE, a novel framework that addresses this challenge. \n\nAUTOGUIDE automatically extracts implicit knowledge from offline experiences to generate context-aware guidelines expressed in clear natural language.  These guidelines are specifically designed to be concise and relevant to the current situation. The effectiveness of AUTOGUIDE is demonstrated through rigorous evaluations across various benchmark domains, including real-world web navigation, showcasing a significant improvement over existing methods. This approach enhances LLM agents' adaptability and performance by supplying the pertinent information exactly when needed.", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "mRIQz8Zd6O/podcast.wav"}
