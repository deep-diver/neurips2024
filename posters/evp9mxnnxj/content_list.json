As large language models (LLMs) [9, 53, 53, 60, 52, 42, 65, 44, 10] rapidly advance, a growing fraction of the research community is focusing on integrating visual content into LLMs to build a powerful intelligent assistant with more interactive ways. Central to these large vision-language models (LVLMs) are the seminal works in modality alignment within the vision-language learning area [46, 21]. The foundation work CLIP [46] exemplifies the alignment of vision and language modalities through contrastive learning on extensive image-text pairs. Built upon the CLIP image encoder which is somewhat aligned with the language modality, current LVLMs typically utilize vast image-text pairs to connect the vision encoder and LLM, enabling LLM to receive and understand visual content [72, 33, 31, 12, 45, 2, 48, 6, 39, 19, 5, 20, 71, 73, 24, 59, 70]. For example, MiniGPT4 [72] and LLaVA [33] directly connect the vision encoder and LLM with QFormer [28] and MLP [50], showing proficiency in multi-modal dialogues. Subsequent works have further enhanced LVLMs by improving the multi-modal instruction data [31, 61, 5, 54, 67, 25] and designing novel modules [2, 30, 55, 36, 17, 13] for more sufficient modality alignment.

To address this issue, comprehensive multi-modal benchmarks have been constructed [33, 27, 64, 16, 34, 8, 56]. For example, SEED [27] and MMBench [34] cover 12 and 20 evaluation dimensions respectively, while MMMU [64] spans 30 collegelevel subjects, providing some competitive arenas for a comprehensive comparison of cutting-edge LVLMs. However, existing evaluations of LVLMs overlook some critical issues. On the one hand, they do not guarantee that all evaluation samples cannot be correctly answered without the visual content. On the other hand, current evaluations consistently adhere to the process of inferring on given benchmarks and calculating scores for LVLMs, overlooking the possibility of data leakage during multi-modal training.

For closed-source LVLMs, GPT4V demonstrates notable performance gains attributed to its multi-modal training, while GeminiProVision shows lesser data leakage during multi-modal training. This suggests that GPT4V may have utilized a broader range of multi-modal training data compared to GeminiPro-Vision. Among the open-source LVLMs, InternLM-XComposer2 achieves the highest average multi-modal gain of 28.1 across all benchmarks, whereas LLaVA-1.5-7B records the lowest at 14.8. This outcome is reasonable given that LLaVA-1.5-7B employed the least amount of multi-modal training data among these open-source LVLMs. Despite LLaVA-1.5-7B having the lowest average multi-modal gain, it exhibits minimal multi-modal leakage.

Conversely, MMMU exhibits the lowest average multi-modal gain at 5.8, suggesting a lesser degree of overlap between the domains of existing LVLMs\u2019 training corpora and those included in MMMU. Additionally, MMStar, as expected, has the lowest degree of multi-modal leakage at 1.9.

MMStar undergoes the manual review of each sample, covering 6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes for an in-depth evaluation of LVLMs\u2019 multimodal capabilities. In our evaluation of 16 diverse LVLMs on MMStar, even the best model scores under 60 on average. We also analyze the MG and ML metrics across 6 multimodal benchmarks and MMStar, providing valuable insights for the community on gathering multimodal training data and crafting new benchmarks. In the future, we plan to expand MMStar into a larger, online test set and explore dynamic evaluation methods to maintain sample visual dependency and reduce accidental data leakage into LLM\u2019s and LVLM\u2019s training corpora.

For evaluating LLMs on existing benchmarks, we employ both 0-shot and 2-shot strategies and will specify which is utilized when reporting results. For evaluating LLMs on MMStar, the 0-shot strategy yields poor scores, making comparisons difficult. Therefore, we exclusively utilize the 2-shot strategy to decrease the frequency of refusal to answer. Moreover, All LVLMs are evaluated utilizing the 0-shot strategy across all benchmarks to ensure a fair comparison. When evaluating LVLMs under the \u2018LVLM-text\u2019 setting (i.e. answer without the image), most LVLMs work well by simply removing the image tokens from their default input tokens. However, GeminiPro-Vision [51] and CogVLM-Chat [55] require the replacement of the original images with pure grey images to bypass image content input and operate correctly. Given that all questions are ensured to be converted into a multiple-choice format, we develop some heuristic matching rules to calculate accuracy, avoiding the cumbersome process of re-invoking GPT4 for answer extraction. Moreover, all experiments in this study are conducted within the same codebase modified from VLMEvalKit [11], and utilize NVIDIA A100 GPUs for non-API-based evaluation.
