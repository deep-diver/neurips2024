Existing 2PC approaches are slow and inefficient because of the heavy use of expensive homomorphic encryption and window encoding.  This significantly limits the practical deployment of secure AI in privacy-sensitive applications.\nThis paper presents Nimbus, a novel framework that addresses these limitations. Nimbus proposes a new client-side outer product protocol for linear layers and a distribution-aware polynomial approximation for non-linear activation functions.  These innovations result in considerable performance gains. Experiments show significant improvements in end-to-end performance, particularly a 2.7x to 4.7x speedup in BERT base inference compared to existing methods. The approach offers a substantial improvement for the privacy-preserving deployment of transformer-based AI models.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "G7QS68ICPJ/podcast.wav"}
