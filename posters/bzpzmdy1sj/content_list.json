Over the past decade, mainstream methods in the VPR area have been to use feature representation based on global aggregation, as exemplified by NetVLAD. These features are suitable for largescale VPR and robust against viewpoint changes. However, the VLAD-based aggregation methods usually learn a large number of (e.g., 64) clusters and their corresponding cluster centers, which directly leads to a high dimension of the yielded global features. More importantly, when there is a domain gap between the data in training and inference, the cluster centers determined on the training set are usually improper for inference, resulting in a performance drop. To this end, we first attempt to improve NetVLAD by removing the cluster center and setting only a small number of (e.g., only 4) clusters. The proposed method not only simplifies NetVLAD but also enhances the generalizability across different domains. We name this method SuperVLAD. In addition, by introducing ghost clusters that will not be retained in the final output, we further propose a very lowdimensional 1-Cluster VLAD descriptor, which has the same dimension as the output of GeM pooling but performs notably better. Experimental results suggest that, when paired with a transformer-based backbone, our SuperVLAD shows better domain generalization performance than NetVLAD with significantly fewer parameters.

On the other hand, multiple different places can show high similarity, which may lead to perceptual aliasing [36].

Although some hierarchical (i.e.two-stage) VPR methods improve robustness under challenging environments by cross-matching local features in the query and candidate images for re-ranking, they incur considerable additional computational latency and memory footprint. Taking a step back, the first stage of these hierarchical methods still requires the use of global features to retrieve candidates.

The former aggregates the feature maps extracted by neural networks with a trainable generalized VLAD layer. Its main difference from the vanilla VLAD [28] lies in its differentiable soft assignment and better performance. However, it still constructs the output vector by summing the residuals of descriptors assigned to each cluster (like VLAD), which is calculated by subtracting the learned cluster center from the local descriptors. When training data distributions differ, the learned cluster centers also vary. Even if we use a well-generalized backbone to extract the local features of two images, the differences in cluster centers can lead to completely different results in the similarity of the output global features (see Fig. 1). In other words, when there is a domain gap between the training and inference data, the cluster center learned on the training set is usually not suitable for inference, which can cause performance drops [5]. Besides, the global descriptor yielded by NetVLAD has a large dimension. Even with dimensionality reduction methods like PCA (or other learnable linear projections), the dimension often remains notably higher compared to the output of pooling methods. As a result, some VPR approaches requiring very low-dimensional features use GeM pooling to yield global descriptors at the cost of certain performance.

Instead, we directly perform a weighted summation of the local features assigned to each cluster to achieve the purpose of aggregating local features. This means SuperVLAD only needs to learn the assignment of local features to clusters, without needing to learn the cluster centers, which directly improves its domain generalization. Meanwhile, we set a small number of clusters (an order of magnitude lower than vanilla NetVLAD), resulting in more compact global descriptors.

These local descriptors were then aggregated into global features using algorithms such as Bag of Words [3], Fisher Vector [47], and VLAD [28, 53, 5, 32]. The resulting global feature vectors were subsequently used to perform a nearest neighbor search over the database to retrieve the most similar images. As deep learning techniques have advanced, the representation capability of deep features has been widely recognized in the VPR community [51, 4, 29, 11, 12, 44, 18, 20, 58, 60, 52, 33, 1, 2, 21, 7, 10]. Arandjelovic et al.[4] designed a pioneering architecture that combines deep neural networks with the proposed differentiable VLAD aggregation approach called NetVLAD. Likewise, other traditional aggregation algorithms were also transformed into differentiable modules as the aggregation layer of neural networks for end-to-end training [26, 45, 61]. Despite remarkable performance over global max (or average) pooling, NetVLAD-related methods [4, 29, 34, 21] tended to have high-dimensional feature representations, which can be a drawback in terms of real-time performance [9]. To address this, the Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling [48] was considered a simple alternative that obtains low-dimensional global features. This method simply extended global average pooling by using the $p$ -norm of local features instead of the average, where $p$ is also a trainable parameter.

CosPlace [7] and EigenPlaces [10] cast the training of VPR as a classification problem and trained the VPR model on the San Francisco eXtra Large (SF-XL) datasets. MixVPR [2] incorporated the deep features with the multi-layer perceptrons and trained the model with the Multi-Similarity loss [56] on the large-scale and appropriate supervised GSV-Cities [1] dataset.

SelaVPR [41] proposed a hybrid global-local adaptation method to adapt the DINOv2 model for two-stage VPR. CricaVPR [39] also adapted DINOv2 as the backbone and proposed a cross-image correlation-aware representation learning method to enhance the robustness of image features.

Besides, the number of parameters in SuperVLAD is about half less than that in NetVLAD. It is worth noting that Eq. 4 is different from applying the attention mechanism to local features.

Its parameters are no less than NetVLAD. These are different from our lightweight and low-computation SuperVLAD.

Experimental results on various transformer-based backbones validated the effectiveness of SuperVLAD, producing more robust features than NetVLAD with a lighter aggregation layer.

", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations & Future Work. While our study presents some improvements in VPR, particularly in enhancing domain generalization ability, reducing the dimensionality of global descriptors, and reducing the number of parameters for the aggregation layer, we acknowledge two limitations of our work: Firstly, the current success of SuperVLAD relies on the use of the transformer backbone. Although our experimental results provided in Appendix C demonstrate that SuperVLAD still has certain advantages over NetVLAD when using a CNN backbone with a small number of clusters, it is not as good as NetVLAD in more commonly used settings. This can be seen as a limitation of SuperVLAD. Secondly, our method uses the cross-image encoder to further enhance performance, similar to CricaVPR [39]. It is necessary to set the inference batch size to an appropriate value. Setting it to 1 directly renders the cross-image encoder ineffective during inference, resulting in a performance drop due to the gap between training and inference. Since we can only use a single-frame query in some practical applications, we compromise to treat the cross-image encoder as an optional module that is not used (during both training and inference) when multiple-frame inference is not feasible. Even without the cross-image encoder, our SuperVLAD can achieve good performance. Some additional discussion on the limitations of SuperVLAD is in Appendix B. In future work, we will try to address the above limitations, and further assess the long-term stability and potential performance changes of the model, which are important for practical deployments.

Especially when local features are assigned to fine-grained clusters (i.e., a large number of clusters), this strength of NetVLAD over SuperVLAD will gradually become apparent. Although the DINOv2-based NetVLAD model with a small number of clusters can achieve performance comparable to a large number of clusters when training on the large-scale dataset GSV-Cities, it still makes sense to set a large number of clusters for a simpler backbone and a smaller training dataset. Here we conduct complementary experiments using the CCT backbone and Pitts30k training dataset. The results are shown in Table 8. In this case, SuperVLAD has a clear advantage over NetVLAD with a small number of clusters, but this advantage gradually disappears with a large number of clusters. That is, NetVLAD shows a more pronounced improvement with a larger number of clusters. However, when using a large number of clusters, the memory occupied by the aggregation layer usually becomes significant in the training stage. The SuperVLAD can significantly reduce GPU memory usage because it has only half the trainable parameters of NetVLAD. Moreover, from another perspective, SuperVLAD experiences less performance degradation with fewer clusters, indicating its good ability to produce low-dimensional global features by directly reducing the number of clusters. Therefore, we do not consider this as a limitation of SuperVLAD but rather as one of its characteristics (i.e., more suitable for a small number of clusters than NetVLAD).
