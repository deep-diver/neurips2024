These issues hinder efficiency and real-world applicability, especially in resource-limited environments.  The high-dimensional feature vectors also demand considerable memory and computational resources.\nThis paper introduces SuperVLAD, which tackles these challenges head-on. By removing cluster centers and using a small number of clusters, SuperVLAD produces compact and robust image descriptors that generalize well across diverse domains.  Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods on various benchmark datasets, showcasing its significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.  The creation of a very low-dimensional 1-Cluster VLAD further enhances the method's practicality and impact.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Visual Place Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "bZpZMdY1sj/podcast.wav"}
