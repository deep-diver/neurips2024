In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Diffusion-based Representation with Random Distance matching (D2R2) for tabular few-shot learning. D2R2 leverages the powerful expression ability of diffusion models to extract essential semantic knowledge crucial for denoising process. This semantic knowledge proves beneficial in few-shot downstream tasks.

However, accurately classifying new data with a scantily labeled training set and an unlabeled training set poses a formidable challenge, as the effectiveness of statistical and modern deep learning systems in supervised learning heavily relies on the large size of the labeled set [36]. This underscores the need for research in few-shot learning in situations where labeled data is scarce. For example, in one-shot learning, each class of the training set contains only one labeled sample, and the goal is to classify new test samples. While few-shot learning has garnered considerable attention in computer vision (CV) [9, 21] and natural language processing (NLP) [30, 31], it remains relatively under-explored in the field of tabular data. Nevertheless, few-shot learning holds great importance in the context of tabular data, as limited labeled tabular data is inherently common in many real-world applications, such as fraud detection [7], disease diagnosis [40], and social science [27]. However, modeling with limited labeled tabular data presents three significant challenges. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "The first challenge is due to the scarcity of labeled training samples, which leads to a deficient understanding of the test class. In this case, semantic knowledge, encompassing general and lowfrequency information not tied to any particular task, can be highly beneficial in few-shot learning [39, 52, 56]. This is because representing a class with limited labeled samples inherently involves ambiguity, necessitating the use of semantic knowledge acquired from unlabeled ones to refine the class definition and address this ambiguity. Although for CV [21] and NLP [31], semantic knowledge can be effectively derived based on the learned spatial structure patterns between pixels or tokens, it is more challenging to extract semantic knowledge for tabular data, since they typically lack local relationships between columns. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second challenge arises from the diverse characteristics of tabular features. Tabular data comprises numerical and categorical features. Numerical features contain ordinal values but have multiple modes, while categorical features present distinct and incomparable values. Many existing statistical and deep neural network models struggle to effectively handle these mixed data types. This challenge underscores the importance of simultaneously modeling continuous and categorical features. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "The third challenge pertains to the utilization of prototype classification with tabular data. Numerous approaches suggest employing average embeddings of the labeled support set for classification [49, 11, 28]. However, the limited labeled support samples lead to large variance and imprecision of the prototypes, highlighting the need for more information from unlabeled samples. Additionally, embeddings from the same class may exhibit multimodal behavior (see Figure 3 for examples), which means that using the average embeddings of one class could result in inaccurate classification results. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In addressing the aforementioned challenges of few-shot learning, significant efforts have been made over the past decade. One approach employs a meta-learning scheme. A common method is to generate a pseudo-label for each unlabeled data and then train the model using pseudo-label [25, 43, 28]. Other approaches utilize self-generated tasks, such as CACTUs [19], UMTRA [22] and Meta-GMVAE [24]. However, despite the effectiveness of prior works on image datasets, we find that applying each method to the tabular domain is highly non-trivial. These methods often assume uniformity in feature types and rely on strong spatial and sequential relationships among features, which do not hold for tabular data. For instance, augmentation techniques are readily applicable to images, where spatial relationships between pixels can be leveraged, as shown by UMTRA [22]. However, such techniques are difficult to apply to tabular data, which lacks these structural patterns [4]. STUNT [28] is designed for tabular data using a proxy-based approach. However, this methods may struggle to acquire useful semantic knowledge due to the disparities between the constructed tasks and the target task, leading to diminished performance for testing. Moreover, it applies the same methods to both numerical and categorical features, neglecting the unique information in different types of data. This oversight hampers the model\u2019s effectiveness. Recent studies have showed that self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled datasets to acquire semantic knowledge and transferable representations of images [16] and languages [14]. However, these approaches heavily rely on augmentation schemes. For tabular data, the heterogeneous feature types pose challenges for augmentation, and only a few methods have been proposed for tabular data. State-of-the-art methods along this line include VIME [55], SCARF [4], SubTab [47].

Firstly, we modify the diffusion model to serve as a representation extractor. The powerful expressiveness of diffusion model enables the extraction of semantic knowledge crucial to denoising. And the information bottleneck induced by conditional information, obtains low-frequency information over details. This approach outperforms alternative representation learning and meta-learning methods, as demonstrated by our experiments. Moreover, the representations exhibit robustness due to the introduction of designed diffusion noise schedule and subsequent denoising process, which reinforces their stability against tabular column perturbations.

Hence, we introduce a random distance matching (RDM) loss during the training of the diffusion model to obtain the distance information. One intuition of applying RDM is that if the class structure can be characterized by certain distance information, the embeddings should preserve such distance structure. Another intuition is that if two samples belong to the same class in the ground truth, their embeddings should appear similar from any perspective. Random distance matching achieves these ideas by projecting data into diverse random spaces, which encompass class structure information. Consequently, if two data points are close in multiple random spaces, they are highly likely to belong to the same class. Besides, two distinct Random Distance matching are designed for continuous and discrete features based on their characteristics, respectively. In this way, we can simultaneously model numerical and categorical features within one model, addressing the second challenge mentioned earlier.

However, they are inadequate in few-shot learning because they are not intended to learn the semantic knowledge. Semi-supervised learning frameworks are designed to improve model generalization by creating a strong connection between limited labeled samples and unlabeled samples, including Mean Teacher (MT) [46], Interpolation Consistency Training (ICT) [48], and Meta Pseudo Labels (MPL) [33].

This can be accomplished by employing meta-learning techniques on related tasks, enabling the acquisition of prior knowledge that can be utilized to solve new tasks [50]. Existing deep few-shot methods can be divided into three main categories. First, optimizationbased meta-learning methods [5, 15, 26, 29] devise a proficient optimization strategy that adapts to downstream tasks effectively. Second, metric-based methods [13, 30, 34, 51] concentrate on latent space to derive meaningful feature embeddings, and then make predictions based on the similarity between support and query embeddings. Third, data generative strategies emphasize creating more varied samples to train a more precise classifier. Most research on few-shot meta-learning focuses on NLP and CV tasks, such as CACTUs [19] and UMTRA [22], while a small subset tackles tabular few-shot learning.

Our research addresses scenarios where an unlabeled training set and a small labeled support set $K$ -shot) are used to predict class labels for a test query set, as detailed in Section 3 of our paper. Self-supervised learning is particularly effective at developing robust representations from unlabeled data [8, 37]. These approaches focus on pre-training the representation by utilizing domain-specific inductive biases, like the spatial relationships in images. Notably, prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in few-shot scenarios relative to meta-learning techniques [12]. Chen et al. [10] added an autoencoder in the diffusion process and Yang et al.[53] introduces a latent Denoising Autoencoder architecture where the learned representations are used for Denoising Autoencoder, but the Autoencoder reconstruction process is less suitable for tabular data as discussed in STUNT [28]. Other works on self-supervised learning schemes rely on augmentation schemes. It is unclear how to extend such methods to the tabular domain due to the heterogeneous characteristics of tabular datasets. Moreover, for tabular data, multimodal and categorical features make augmentation difficult, and few effective methods have been proposed in tabular data setting. Recent state-of-the-art tabular learning augmentation techniques include masking cell: VIME [55], constructing subsets: SubTab [47], and contrastive learning: SCARF [4].

For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
