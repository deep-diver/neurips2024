Prior approaches for handling these \"constrained optimization\" problems with strong convex constraints (meaning the constraint functions themselves are strongly curved) achieved suboptimal convergence rates, taking longer than necessary to find a solution. This paper addresses the limitations of existing first-order methods.  The proposed method is based on advanced primal-dual algorithms which effectively leverage the strong convexity of constraint functions. This significantly speeds up the convergence process compared to existing methods. \nThe proposed \"APDPro\" algorithm and its restarted version, \"rAPDPro,\"  use novel techniques to progressively estimate the strong convexity of the problem, enabling more aggressive steps towards the solution and significantly faster convergence.   This is experimentally validated on Google's personalized PageRank problem. Moreover, the research introduces a new analysis showing that the restarted version can identify the optimal solution's sparsity structure within a finite number of steps. This additional feature is particularly valuable for applications where sparsity is important, such as feature selection in machine learning.", "affiliation": "Shanghai University of Finance and Economics", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "pG380vLYRU/podcast.wav"}
