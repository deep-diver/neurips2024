While model-agnostic methods efficiently achieve this through averaging over group actions, their complexity often hinders scalability for large groups.  Frame averaging (FA) addresses this by averaging over input-dependent subsets. However, existing FA methods lack a principled design framework for frames and efficient complexity characterization.\nThis paper introduces a canonicalization perspective, revealing an inherent connection between frames and canonical forms.  This allows researchers to design novel and more efficient frames guided by the properties of canonical forms. The proposed approach is demonstrated on eigenvector symmetries, resulting in theoretically and empirically superior frames compared to existing methods.  The canonicalization perspective also provides a unified understanding of existing FA methods and resolves open questions regarding the expressive power of invariant networks.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jjcY92FX4R/podcast.wav"}
