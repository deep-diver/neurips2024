[{"figure_path": "jjcY92FX4R/figures/figures_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: An example where the frame size exceeds the canonicalization by a factor of 480.", "description": "This figure shows a graph where each node has a unique ID and a color representing its feature.  If the frame is defined as all permutations that sort the node features in a specific order (grey, blue, green), the size of the frame would be 5! * 2! * 2! = 480. However, all these permutations would result in the same graph.  Therefore, the frame size is much larger than the size of the canonicalization (which is 1 because only one graph results from the node feature sorting).  This illustrates how the frame averaging approach can be inefficient for graphs with many symmetries.", "section": "A Advantages of the canonicalization perspective"}, {"figure_path": "jjcY92FX4R/figures/figures_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The training time and test MSE of models in the n-body problem. Results are averaged over 4 runs with different seeds.", "description": "This figure compares the training time and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for four different methods on the n-body problem across different dimensions. The methods are Frame Averaging (FA), a Sign-equivariant model, OAP-eig (Orthogonal Axis Projection for eigenvectors without permutation), and OAP-lap (Orthogonal Axis Projection for Laplacian eigenvectors with permutation).  The x-axis represents the dimensionality of the problem, and the y-axes show training time (in seconds per epoch) and MSE respectively. The results demonstrate that Frame Averaging's computational cost scales exponentially with the dimensionality,  while the other methods show better scalability.  The performance difference between these methods is relatively small.", "section": "D.2 Experiments on the n-body problem"}]
