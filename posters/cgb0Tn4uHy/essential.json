However, obtaining high-quality labels is often expensive and time-consuming. Noisy labels, or incorrectly labeled data, can severely affect model performance.  Existing methods for handling noisy labels, such as those based on transition matrices, often focus on class-dependent noise and lack applicability to more complex real-world scenarios. This limits their effectiveness in various applications. \nThis paper introduces an extended transition matrix model that tackles these limitations. The proposed model incorporates a sparse implicit regularization term, allowing it to adapt to a wider range of noise patterns. **Theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm's convergence and generalization capabilities under certain conditions.**  Experimental evaluations show **significant improvements in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art transition matrix methods** across various synthetic and real-world datasets.
