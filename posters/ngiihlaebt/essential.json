Previous studies demonstrated that these datasets can be easily classified by AI models, indicating inherent biases. However, the exact nature of these biases remained unclear, making it difficult to address the problem effectively.\nThis paper introduces a comprehensive framework to identify and analyze biases in visual datasets. The researchers employed various image transformations to isolate different visual attributes (semantic, structural, color, etc.) and assessed their contribution to dataset classification accuracy.  They further used object-level queries and natural language processing to gain detailed insights into the semantic characteristics of each dataset. The findings reveal the concrete forms of bias and provide actionable insights for creating more diverse and representative datasets.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "NGIIHlAEBt/podcast.wav"}
