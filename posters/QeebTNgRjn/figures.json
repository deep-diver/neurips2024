It shows how observed data is split into conditional data and target data.  The target data, along with initial noise, is used to generate intermediate samples via optimal transport and interpolation. A VAE model provides a potential function, which influences the calculation of target velocity.  The joint input (conditional data and intermediate samples) feeds into a flow model, where the flow matching loss is minimized during training. This process refines the model's ability to generate accurate time series data.", "section": "3 Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation"}, {"figure_path": "QeebTNgRjn/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visualization of the test imputation results on PM 2.5, green dots are the conditions, blue dots are the imputation results, and red dots are the ground truth.", "description": "This figure visualizes the time series imputation results for PM 2.5 dataset.  The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the value of the time series. Green dots show the observed (conditional) data points. Blue dots represent the values imputed by the proposed method, while red dots are the actual ground truth values that were missing in the original data.  The plot shows how well the model's imputations (blue) match the ground truth (red) across different time points, given the observed data (green).", "section": "4.4.1 Imputation Results"}]
