Existing adaptive depth networks that adjust model depth to match resource availability are often complex and time-consuming to train. This research addresses these issues by presenting a novel method for building adaptive-depth networks that drastically reduces the training time. The core of the method is dividing each residual stage of a network into two paths - a mandatory path for core feature learning and a skippable path for refinement. A self-distillation strategy is used to train these paths, where the skippable path is optimized to minimize performance degradation when skipped. This allows the network to efficiently select various depths at testing time without needing to retrain. \nThe approach achieves this by applying a self-distillation technique. The largest and smallest networks are used as teacher and student, respectively. Instead of retraining each sub-network, this strategy significantly reduces training time. At testing time, the network can select different depths by combinatorially selecting which sub-paths to use. This allows selection of sub-networks with various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs from a single model.  The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on several deep learning models, including CNNs and transformers, showing improved performance compared to traditional approaches. This work provides an architectural pattern and training strategy generally applicable to various network architectures. It also delivers a theoretical foundation explaining why this method can reduce errors and minimize the impact of skipping sub-paths.", "affiliation": "Incheon National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "NPu7Cdk2f9/podcast.wav"}
