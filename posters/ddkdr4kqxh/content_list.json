Overall, the evolution of extreme events such as agricultural droughts results from stochastic processes [2], conditions at ecosystem scales [3, 4], and the interaction between the Earth land and atmospheric variables as a part of a complex system of feedbacks [5]. However, the relative impacts of these factors differ depending on the event [2]. The time delays between extremes and their drivers vary seasonally [6\u20139], and the spatial response of these drivers is inhomogeneous [4]. A major challenge is therefore to model the spatio-temporal relations between extremes and their drivers during the development of these events [4]. The overarching goal of this modelling is to improve our understanding of the patterns and impacts of such events. This would improve our ability to project duration and intensity of extreme events and hence assisting in adaptation planning [10, 11].

In this way, the network is enforced to identify only drivers in the input variables that are spatio-temporally correlated with extreme events.

The identification of climatic changes and extreme weather has been a subject of many studies [12, 13]. Typical algorithms for extreme events detection are built upon domain knowledge in setting usually empirical thresholds for the physical variables through sensitivity experiments [6, 14]. Many works applied multivariate and statistical methods to detect extreme events such as droughts [6, 9, 15\u201317]. However, individual events are difficult to generalized across multiple events [2] and predefined indicators become less effective with changing climate [18]. Thus, machine and deep learning methods have been proposed as an alternative to classical methods, i.e., for supervised anomaly detection [19, 20] and for the detection of extremes in climate data [14, 21\u201324]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "While methods for forecasting vegetation indices [25\u201328] do not focus on extremes, future impacts of extremes like agricultural droughts can be derived from forecast vegetation indices like the vegetation health index (VHI). For instance, the work [28] uses a climate simulation as input and forecasts the vegetation health index. Since predicting VHI directly is difficult, the approach predicts the normalized difference vegetation index and the brightness temperature instead. Both indices are then normalized and used to estimate VHI. Although we obtain the impacts of extreme events in our study from vegetation indices, our approach is not limited to such extremes. Since we use a binary representation of extremes, our approach can also be applied to other extremes that cannot be derived from satellite products, but that are stored in a binary format in databases. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "While we aim to learn the relations between the impacts of extreme events and their relevant drivers from a data-driven perspective, spatio-temporal relations within the Earth system can also be inferred by causal inference and causal representation learning [29\u201336]. In contrast to statistical methods [37], data-driven methods do not require a prior hypothesis about drivers for extremes. Instead, they generate hypotheses that can be verified by statistical methods in a second step. We believe that this is an important direction since climate reanalysis provides huge amount of data and it is infeasible to test all combinations. This is also known as a curse of dimensionality in causal discovery problems [38] and data-driven approaches are therefore needed to generate potential candidates. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Anomaly detection algorithms. Since we focus on anomalies in land and meteorological data as drivers, we give an overview of approaches for anomaly detection and discuss their applicability to our task, which has not been previously addressed. One-class: The main stream in one-class anomaly detection is to model the distribution of the normal data during training and consider the deviation from the learned features as anomalies. This includes distance-based [39\u201341], patch-based [41\u201343], student-teacher [44\u201347], and embedding-based approaches [43, 48\u201351]. In general, the alignment between the anomaly type and the assumptions of the methods is the critical factor for their performance [52]. One of the limiting factors to apply these methods to climate data is that they assume priori knowledge about what is considered as normal. Furthermore, not all detected anomalies are drivers of an extreme event. Reconstruction-based: These methods assume that a trained model to reconstruct normal data will be unsuccessful in reconstructing anomalies, while it will reconstruct normal data well. Despite being widely applied for anomaly detection problems [53\u201364], these methods face the same problem as the one-class methods. In addition, many studies showed that anomalies can still be reconstructed by the trained model [65]. Self-supervised learning: These methods rely on the hypothesis that a model trained for a pretext task on normal data will be successful only on similar normal data during inference [66\u201369]. In addition to the above discussed limitations, finding a suitable pretext task for anomaly detection is challenging. For instance, common tasks such as solving a jigsaw puzzle [69] will fail in homogeneous regions. Pseudo-anomaly: The intuition in pseudo-based anomaly detection is to convert the problem of unsupervised learning into a supervised one by synthesizing abnormal data during training [70\u201377]. Since these methods depend partially on the degree to which the proxy anomalies correspond to the unknown true anomalies [44], applying these approaches to our task would require some knowledge about the coupling between the variables and extremes. Multivariate anomaly detection: Multivariate approaches detect anomalies simultaneously in multiple data streams [78\u201382]. The main difference to our task is that we aim to detect drivers across multiple data streams that do not necessary occur simultaneously. Multiple instance learning: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been proposed for weakly supervised anomaly detection [83\u201391]. In MIL-based algorithms, the model is provided with labeled positive and negative bags where each bag includes a set of instances. The model is then trained to classify the instances inside the bags giving only the high level supervision, i.e., label of the bag [92]. A weakly supervised approach has been also applied for hyperspectral anomaly detection [93]. Most algorithms such as [94\u201397] choose the top-k potentially anomalous snippets within each video. This makes it challenging to apply them since the abnormality ratio varies in real-world applications [98]. Furthermore, the MIL detector can be biased toward a specific class depending on the context [99].

For this, we assumed that there exist precursor drivers, primarily as anomalies in assimilated land surface and atmospheric data, for every observable impact of extremes. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach by measuring to which degree the identified drivers can be used to predict extreme agricultural droughts. Apart from experiments on two realworld datasets, we also presented a new framework to generate synthetic datasets that can be used for spatio-temporal anomaly detection and climate research. The results on the synthetic datasets show that the approach is not limited to droughts and can be applied to other extremes. While we have shown that our approach outperforms other approaches, the study has some limitations. First, evaluating ability to handle a very large number of climate variables in a unified model needs further examination. Similarly, performing an additional pre-processing of specific variables like accumulating precipitation over many weeks might also improve the results. Second, modelling the temporal relations is limited by the time window $T$ . Moreover, teleconnections of climatic anomalies can occur in distant regions on Earth, e.g., affects of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a variability on drought and flood [12]. Modelling and disentangle such large spatio-temporal relations across the globe is an open research problem. Third, it would be appealing to provide scores for drivers instead of a binary classification. This could be achieved by measuring the distance to the nearest code in the LFQ. Forth, the prediction of the model depends on the capacity of reanalysis data to accurately represent the local environmental factors and land\u2013atmospheric feedbacks. Most importantly, drawing conclusions on drivers from weak predictive models may lead to unreliable interpretations. Finally, our model does not identify causal relationships.

Meteorological drought is mainly related to the dryness and can be defined based on a deficiency in temperature or precipitation. Agricultural drought measures the impact of stress on vegetation and usually defined as soil water deficits. It is also widely conceived that drought originates and progresses from meteorological into agricultural drought [6, 17]. Hydrological drought is related to the water storage.

In practice, vegetation states can be estimated from land surface reflectances acquired from satellites. As a result, the reflectances on the ground can be employed as agricultural drought indicators and as proxies for vegetation health. To define extreme agricultural drought events, we processed satellite-based vegetation health dataset [104] from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/index.php [last access: 22 May 2024)]). This dataset consists of long-term remote sensing data acquired from a system of NOAA satellites: the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) which starts from 1981 until 2012 and the new system the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) from 2013 onwards. The dataset has a global coverage with $\\sim0.05^{\\circ}$ $(\\sim\\!4\\mathrm{km})$ spatial resolution. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [133] and brightness temperature (BT) [134] are the two key products of the dataset. The BT is an infrared (IR)-based calibrated spectrum radiation. While the NDVI is a combination of the near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) bands. To remove the effects of clouds, atmospheric disturbance, and other error sources, the data were aggregated temporally into a smoothed product on a weekly basis. The weekly temporal coverage is needed for outliers and discontinuities removal and is suitable to study the phenological phases of vegetation and consequently to define agricultural drought [104, 135]. Based on the long-term upper and lower bounds of the ecosystem (maximum and minimum values of the NDVI and BT), agricultural drought indicators such as vegetation condition index (VCI), thermal condition index (TCI), and vegetation health index (VHI) can be derived [134, 136]. VHI is a combination of VCI and TCI (Fig. 15) and it fluctuates between 0 (unfavourable condition) and 100 (favourable condition). Values outside the range are clipped. Based on this definition of vegetation health, extreme agricultural drought can be defined when $\\mathrm{VHI}<26\\$ . Please note that vegetation stress detected by VHI could not be necessarily caused by a drought event i.e., a change in the land cover can change the signal as well [15, 137].

For the mapping, we use the first-order conservative mapping using the software from Zhuang et. al [138]. To calculate the spatial averaged, we excluded coastal lines, invalid, and water body pixels. Furthermore, we combined the dataset with masks obtained from the quality assurance metadata for pixels over no vegetation and very cold areas. As mentioned in Sec. I.1, a temporal decomposition was conducted to remove some discontinuity and aggregate the data into a weekly product. However, some pixels will still be empty. To tackle this issue, we first checked if the pixel was covered by another satellite and averaged the measurements of the satellites.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
