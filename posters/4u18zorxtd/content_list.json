Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AVGS) model. To obtain an implicit material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion).

This thus inspires a recent surge of investigating novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) [4, 17, 5, 32]. By synthesizing binaural audio (two channels corresponding to the left and right ear) taking into account the factors like directionality, distance and relative elevation, this can create a spatial audio experience akin to real-life perception [23]. However, realistic binaural audio synthesis is challenging, since the wavelengths of sound waves are much longer, necessitating the modeling of wave diffraction and scattering. To illustrate, while blocking the sun with your thumb is easy, blocking thunder sounds with your thumb is difficult because sound waves wrap around obstacles. A sound wave propagating through a 3D space undergoes various sophisticated acoustic phenomena, like direct sound, early reflections, and late reverberations.

Due to the intrinsic discrepancy between vision and audio as discussed earlier, extending existing 3D Gaussian splatting-based (3DGS) [14] from visual scenes to 3D audio (i.e., spatial audio) is non-trivial. Optimizing towards scene visual reconstruction, points tend to over-populate along object edges and under-populate in textureless regions such as walls, doors etc. But, such point distribution is rhetoric when learning sound propagation since, major changes in sound paths (absorption and diversion) primarily happen around those texture-less regions. The key challenge lies in jointly modeling 3D geometry and implicit material characteristics of the visual scene objects to instigate direction and distance awareness for realistic binaural audios. To that end, we decouple the physical geometric prior from the 3DGS representation to learn an acoustic field network by introducing audio-guidance parameters. These audio-guidance parameters combined with their relative distance and direction from the listener and sound source, are projected on-the-fly to derive holistic scene-aware and implicit material-aware conditions for synthesizing binaural audios (see Figure 1). We hypothesize that converging AV-GS on binaural audio reconstruction loss, requires location and density adjustment of the Gaussian points relative to the \u201caudio-guidance\u201d provided by the individual point.

AV-NeRF extracts visual cues from the listener\u2019s view using a 256x256 RGB and depth image (rendered by a pre-trained NeRF) and processed by a frozen ResNet18 [11] model that is trained on ImageNet [7]. When the listener\u2019s view includes multiple objects or complex geometries (Fig. 3(a)), or meaningless information (Fig. 3(b)), it leads to sub-optimal visual cue extraction and poor binauralization. In contrast, our AV-GS uses learned representations (combining $\\alpha$ of points in $G_{a}$ w.r.t to the listener and speaker) to extract context at a more holistic level, remaining unaffected by these scenarios.

In Table 3, we compare the inference time for a single scene (House scene 1) from the RWAVS dataset. Although the original implementation of AV-NeRF proposed a single view in the direction of listener\u2019s viewing direction (used as the listener\u2019s context), we modify their implementation in which the V-NeRF renders 2 and 4 perspective views with a field of view of $90^{\\circ}$ for each receiver\u2019s position.
