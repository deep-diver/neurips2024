Existing video atmospheric turbulence mitigation (ATM) methods struggle to maintain temporal consistency across frames, resulting in visually incoherent results. This inconsistency stems from the stochastic nature of turbulence, varying across space and time.\n\nConVRT addresses this by introducing a novel neural video representation.  **This representation decouples spatial and temporal information**, enabling targeted regularization. **Leveraging the low-pass filtering properties of these regularized representations, ConVRT mitigates temporal frequency variations and promotes consistency.** It uses a hybrid training approach, combining supervised pre-training on synthetic data with self-supervised learning on real videos, significantly enhancing performance on diverse real-world scenarios.  **This leads to temporally consistent video restoration** even in complex, real-world atmospheric conditions.", "affiliation": "University of Maryland", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "yURca4wi2L/podcast.wav"}
