The right panels depict the distribution of optimal \u03b2 values across users, demonstrating how the algorithm adjusts \u03b2 based on user characteristics (average and standard deviation of relevance scores). The results across both settings highlight that Algorithm 1 achieves substantial gains in social welfare with personalized \u03b2 compared to fixed \u03b2, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to optimize the trade-off between user satisfaction and creator engagement.", "section": "7 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "IGAN7RldcF/figures/figures_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The left and the middle panel: the empirical distributions of content creation frequency x and each user\u2019s individual utility \u03c0.
