Specifically, we extend the principles of VaGraM [Voelcker et al., 2022] to a high-dimensional vision model by using explainability-related notions of salience and aggregating an otherwise noisy gradient-based salience signal within objects.

We extend this concept to high-dimensional image inputs, which previous work did not demonstrate.

We hypothesize that the set of signals informing action selection may be richer than those that inform value estimation, which might rely primarily on simple cues such as whether an agent has flipped over.

From model explainability literature, a known challenge with gradient-based weighting is its noisiness, which is likely caused by the presence of sharp but meaningless fluctuations in the derivative at small scales [Smilkov et al., 2017]. While this has been combated by more computationally demanding explainability approaches such as Integrated Gradients [Sundararajan et al., 2017] and SmoothGrad [Smilkov et al., 2017], we found these to be infeasible to run within the train loop, since this would require taking the derivative of the function with respect to multiple varying inputs for every example in the original input batch. Instead, to combat this problem we introduce a second novel contribution: object-based aggregation of an explainability signal using a segmentation model (SEG). In principle many models should work, but to ensure we had high quality segmentations, we used the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [Kirillov et al., 2023], a pre-trained and broadly applicable segmentation model. Nothing prevents a different model from being utilized, so long as it is of sufficient quality. This idea follows from the observation that the saliency map tends to show a broad, if noisy, correlation with relevant regions in the image (e.g. Figure 1). During data collection, we segment each image into object masks using the existing method laid out by the authors of SAM. We prompt the model with a grid of 256 points, filter the resulting masks with metrics for the SAM algorithm (Intersection-Over-Union and a \"stability score\"), followed by non-maximum suppression. We also include a mask to capture pixels that are not otherwise assigned to an object. Then, instead of weighting the image reconstruction loss with the raw gradient-based salience, we use a salience score that is aggregated within each segmentation mask.

SAM2-tiny is less successful at segmenting the platform, which is problematic for learning a good policy.

One deficiency of current MBRL algorithms is a susceptibility of the world model to become overwhelmed by easily predictable distractors, in part due to mismatch between the objectives of the policy (maximizing reward) and the world model (accurately predicting future states) [Lambert et al., 2020].

Denoised MDPs extends TIA\u2019s factorization to include notions of controllability [Wang et al., 2022]. Clavera et al. [2018] use meta-learning and an ensemble of dynamics models.

VaGraM uses value gradients to reweight state reconstruction loss [Voelcker et al., 2022], building on Lambert et al.

Goal-Aware Prediction learns a joint representation of the dynamics and a goal, by predicting a goal-state residual, although they describe this approach as likely still susceptible to distractions [Nair et al., 2020]. Seo et al. [2023] decouples visual representations and dynamics via an autoencoder, improving the performance of Dreamer on tasks involving small objects. Value-equivalent agents [Grimm et al., 2020], such as MuZero [Schrittwieser et al., 2020] or Value Prediction Networks [Oh et al., 2017], construct a world model that only aims to represent dynamics relevant to predicting the value function, in contrast to methods such as Dreamer that aim to learn the broader dynamics of the environment. MuZero is very effective in settings with discrete actions such as Atari, Go, and chess. Adaptation to domains with complex action spaces such as Deepmind Control Suite [Hubert et al., 2021] have shown some success, however Dreamerbased agents that include image reconstruction for world model learning can still exhibit superior performance, and the image-related signals have been shown to be essential to their performance [Hafner et al., 2020].

Although our work focuses on a solution to MBRL\u2019s distraction-sensitivity, it is worth noting analogous deficiencies can exist in MFRL and there are a number of works addressing these.

Third, wasteful encoding of the preceding action (which is known and does not need to be predicted) in the image embedding is removed using an adversarial prediction head. Together, these allow an agent to construct a world model that best informs its policy, and in doing so, use the policy to shape what information is prioritized by its world model. The outcome of this process is an agent that is selective about what parts of the world it models, and that becomes resilient against enticingly learnable, but ultimately empty, distractions.

Some gradient-based attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients, can be computationally expensive due to the need to approximate an integral over the input space. Future work may investigate incorporation of more advanced explainability methods such as these into PSP, and the concept of an agent \u2018interpreting itself\u2019 may exhibit broader utility.

Finally, it is not yet clear how well PSP will adapt in environments where the reward structure or salient features change across time.

Substantial work likely remains to improve the speed of this technique and find extensions that allow it to reliably work for harder problems, such as applied robotics. The adversarial action prediction head\u2019s inspiration from the biological concept of efference copies also suggests there is still space in MBRL to consider biological metaphors as helpful design principles for learning algorithms.
