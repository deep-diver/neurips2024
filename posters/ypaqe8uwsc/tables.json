The average of the performance metric is computed across expert and medium clients participating in a given round of federation.", "description": "This figure analyzes the performance of clients (with expert and medium quality data) during the federated learning process.  It shows how the average performance metric changes over communication rounds, highlighting the contribution of different client data qualities to the overall federated learning process. The plots visualize the performance of clients with expert and medium datasets in various environments (HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d). The analysis covers both client ratios (the proportion of expert and medium clients participating) and client decay (how the influence of local data decreases over time), illustrating the impact of various factors on individual client performance and their overall contribution to the federated model.", "section": "B.4 Analysis of Client Performance"}]
