It shows how the monotonicity assumption in cognitive diagnosis is integrated with data augmentation to address the data sparsity issue.  The framework takes student response data as input and generates augmented data based on two hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2) derived from the monotonicity assumption. These hypotheses ensure that the generated data maintains the monotonic relationship between student proficiency and their responses. The augmented data, along with the original data, is fed into a Cognitive Diagnosis Model (CDM) to learn student proficiency levels.  Two regularization terms (\u03a9\u2081 and \u03a9\u2082) are incorporated to enforce the monotonicity constraints during the training process. The final loss function (\u2112) combines the original loss and the regularization terms to achieve accurate and fair cognitive diagnosis results.", "section": "5 The Proposed Framework"}, {"figure_path": "B4k2TecKT2/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: The number of instances violating our hypotheses during the optimization process.", "description": "This figure shows the number of times the monotonicity assumption is violated during the optimization process for different CD models (IRT, MIRT, NCDM) on two datasets (Math and ASSIST).
