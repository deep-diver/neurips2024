Existing methods either produce poor geometry, inconsistent results, or are computationally expensive.  Many methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) are slow and produce inconsistent results.  Other approaches, which finetune multi-view diffusion models or train fast feed-forward models, lack intricate textures and complex geometry. \nUnique3D tackles these limitations by using a novel framework that combines a multi-view diffusion model and a normal diffusion model to generate multi-view images with their normal maps. This is followed by a multi-level upscale process to improve resolution.  Finally, an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm (ISOMER) integrates color and geometric priors into the final mesh.  The results demonstrate that Unique3D significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric and textural details, achieving high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in single image to 3D mesh generation.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "UO7Mvch1Z5/podcast.wav"}
