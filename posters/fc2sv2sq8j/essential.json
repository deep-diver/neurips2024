This is a significant problem in real-world applications like autonomous driving, where immediate decisions are essential even with limited data.  The lack of robust methods for handling these situations leads to inaccurate predictions and potentially dangerous outcomes. \nThe research introduces a new framework called LaKD (Length-agnostic Knowledge Distillation) that solves this problem. LaKD uses a novel dynamic knowledge distillation mechanism, transferring information between trajectories of different lengths to improve performance. It also incorporates a dynamic soft-masking technique to prevent conflicts when using a single model as both teacher and student.  Experiments show LaKD significantly outperforms existing methods on various benchmark datasets. **This demonstrates LaKD's effectiveness and potential for significant impact in autonomous driving and related fields.**", "affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "fC2SV2sQ8J/podcast.wav"}
