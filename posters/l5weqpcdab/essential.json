This work **opens new avenues for developing more reliable and efficient IRL algorithms**, impacting various applications such as robotics and autonomous driving where reward transferability is essential.", "summary": "This paper proposes a novel solution to the transferability problem in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) using principal angles to measure the similarity between transition laws.  It provides sufficient conditions for transferable rewards from multiple experts.", "takeaways": ["Principal angles provide a refined measure of transition law similarity, improving upon binary rank conditions.", "Sufficient conditions for reward transferability are established, considering multiple experts and local changes.", "A probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm with end-to-end guarantees for learning transferable rewards is presented."], "tldr": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to learn rewards from expert demonstrations, but ensuring the learned reward generalizes to new situations (transferability) is challenging. Previous work made strong assumptions, like having full access to expert policies. This often doesn't hold in practice.  A key issue is that a reward that perfectly explains one expert's behavior isn't unique; many rewards can work.\nThis paper tackles the transferability challenge head-on. Instead of relying on restrictive binary conditions, it proposes using principal angles\u2014a more nuanced measure of similarity between different environments\u2014to determine transferability. The authors establish sufficient conditions for learning transferable rewards even with limited access to expert demonstrations. They introduce a new probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm with end-to-end guarantees.  **This significantly advances IRL's practical applicability.**", "affiliation": "SYCAMORE, EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "l5wEQPcDab/podcast.wav"}
