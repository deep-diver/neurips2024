Existing methods often fail to generalize across subjects, hindering real-world applications. This is mainly because existing methods struggle to capture universal seizure patterns while mitigating the significant domain shift of iEEG signals across subjects and time intervals. \nDMNet, a novel subject-independent ASD model, is proposed to address these issues.  It leverages a self-comparison mechanism that effectively aligns iEEG signals by comparing target segments with contextual and channel-level references.  A simple yet effective difference matrix encodes universal seizure patterns, improving accuracy.  Extensive experiments show that DMNet significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.  **The visualization results demonstrate that the generated difference matrix can effectively capture the seizure activity changes throughout the seizure evolution process.**", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "mlmTxJwVsb/podcast.wav"}
