Machine learning offers an alternative, but existing methods often suffer from issues like poor interpretability, weak generalizability, and high dependence on large labeled datasets. This paper introduces a new approach to address these limitations. \nThe proposed model, P2C2Net, uses a physics-encoded approach, combining a trainable PDE block with a neural network correction module. The PDE block updates the solution based on a high-order scheme, while the neural network block corrects for errors introduced by the coarse grid. The model employs a learnable symmetric convolutional filter for accurate derivative estimation.  Experiments show that P2C2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across various datasets, even with limited training data, significantly outperforming existing methods.", "affiliation": "Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "motImXq3B1/podcast.wav"}
