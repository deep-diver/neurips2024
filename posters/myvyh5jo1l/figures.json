It shows the relationship between the true target function (f* o h*), the weak model's prediction (fw o hw), and the strong model's prediction (fsw o hs). The green ellipse represents the convex set Vs of functions attainable by the strong model, and the point f* o h* lies within this set. The point fsw o hs is the projection of fw o hw onto the set Vs, and the distances A, B, C between these points represent the error terms involved in the theorem. The Pythagorean-like relationship between A, B, and C visually demonstrates that the error of the strong model trained with weak supervision is less than or equal to the error of the weak model minus the improvement the strong model makes.", "section": "Main Proof Technique"}, {"figure_path": "MyVyH5Jo1l/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: (a),(b), (c) Experiments on synthetic data.
