Here OPT = arg ming\u2208Rd F(0; X(n)) denotes the optimal loss and w is the matrix-multiplication exponent. The highlighted part is the runtime of the warm-up phase which is the same for LocDPSGD and LocDPCuttingPlane. We also assume that maxi\u2208 [n] |X(n) \u2229 Ba(xi,r)| < 3n/4. (See Section 3.1, Section 3.2, and Section 4 for the general results without this restriction.) For readability, we omit logarithmic factors that depend on n and d.", "description": "This table summarizes the performance of different algorithms for approximating the geometric median under differential privacy.  It compares algorithms in terms of their approximation quality (utility), privacy guarantees, runtime, and sample complexity requirements. The algorithms include our proposed LocDPSGD and LocDPCuttingPlane methods, as well as an inefficient algorithm based on inverse sensitivity and the baseline DP-SGD approach.  The table highlights the efficiency improvements of the proposed algorithms.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
