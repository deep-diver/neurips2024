Current methods often struggle with efficiency and the dynamic nature of real-world settings.  They frequently rely on repeated interactions to collect environmental knowledge, which is inefficient and can lead to outdated information.\nThe proposed ExRAP framework addresses these issues by **integrating environment exploration into LLM-based planning**.  It employs memory to store environmental context and uses an information-based exploration strategy to efficiently gather new information.  This approach leads to a better balance between exploration and exploitation, resulting in improved task success rates and execution efficiency.  ExRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various simulated environments, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "LpXV29Ggl3/podcast.wav"}
