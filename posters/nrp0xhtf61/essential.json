Previous attempts to enhance high-resolution understanding have been limited in their resolution range and scope.  \nThis research introduces InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD, a groundbreaking model that addresses these issues. It uses a novel 'dynamic resolution with automatic patch configuration' approach,  allowing it to process a much wider range of resolutions (336 pixels to 4K HD).  The model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models on several benchmarks, showcasing its improved ability to handle high-resolution images and achieve state-of-the-art results.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "nRp0XhTf61/podcast.wav"}
