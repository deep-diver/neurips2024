It highlights the blurring artifacts produced by existing methods (Percentile [27], DBDC+Pac [41]) compared to the sharp, detailed reconstruction of the proposed method (Ours) and the full-precision (FP) model. The ground truth high-resolution image (HR) is also shown for reference.  This demonstrates that the authors' approach significantly improves the visual quality of SR, particularly in terms of artifact reduction.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "ADJASE9uQ2/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overall pipeline of our proposed 2DQuant method. The whole pipeline contains two stages, optimizing the clipping bound from coarse to fine. In stage 1, we design DOBI to efficiently obtain the coarse bound. In stage 2, DQC is performed to finetune clipping bounds and guarantee the quantized model learns the full-precision (FP) model's feature and output information.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two-stage process of the 2DQuant method for post-training quantization.  The first stage, Distribution-Oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI), uses two strategies to efficiently find a coarse clipping bound for weight and activation quantization. The second stage, Distillation Quantization Calibration (DQC), further refines these bounds by training the quantized model to mimic the behavior of its full-precision counterpart, ensuring that both intermediate features and final outputs closely match. This two-step approach aims to balance speed and accuracy in low-bit quantization.", "section": "Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "ADJASE9uQ2/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Quantization scheme for SwinIR Transformer blocks.

The process involves applying fake quantization and integer arithmetic to computationally intensive operations such as linear layers and batch matrix multiplications.
