In Figure 6, we can clearly observe incorrect depth predictions for the sky (cloud) and the human head. Such failures can be expected as our synthetic training sets do not include diverse sky patterns or humans.

Early works [18, 19, 5] focus on the in-domain metric depth estimation, where training and test images must share the same domain [70, 24]. Due to their restricted application scenarios, recently there has been increasing attention on zero-shot relative monocular depth estimation. Among them, some works address this task through better modeling manners, e.g., using Stable Diffusion [59] as a depth denoiser [31, 25, 20]. Other works [94, 96, 89] focus on the data-driven perspective. For example, MiDaS [56, 55, 7] and Metric3D [95] collect 2M and 8M labeled images respectively. Aware of the difficulty of scaling up labeled images, Depth Anything V1 [89] leverages 62M unlabeled images to enhance the model\u2019s robustness. In this work, differently, we point out multiple limitations in widely used labeled real images. We thus especially highlight the necessity of resorting to synthetic images to ensure depth preciseness. Meantime, to tackle the generalization issue caused by synthetic images, we adopt both data-driven (large-scale pseudo-labeled real images) and model-driven (scaling up the teacher model) strategies. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Learning from unlabeled real images. How to learn informative representations from unlabeled images is widely studied in the field of semi-supervised learning [36, 86, 71, 90]. However, they focus on academic benchmarks [34] which only allow usage of small-scale labeled and unlabeled images. In comparison, we study a real-world application scenario, i.e., how to further boost the baseline of $0.6\\mathrm{M}$ labeled images with 62M unlabeled images. Moreover, distinguished from Depth Anything V1 [89], we exhibit the indispensable role of unlabeled real images especially when we replace all labeled real images with synthetic images [22, 23, 61].

But we are also fundamentally different in that we perform distillation at the prediction level through extra unlabeled real images, while KD [2, 73, 100] typically studies better distillation strategies at the feature or logit level through labeled images. We aim to reveal the importance of large-scale unlabeled data and larger teacher model, rather than delicate loss designs [43, 69] or distillation pipelines [10]. Moreover, it is indeed non-trivial and risky to directly distill feature representations between two models with a tremendous scale gap [48].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
