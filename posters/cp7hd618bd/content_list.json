These approaches, however, assume a batch setting that is not efficient for sequential inference. Inference can be made more efficient in sequential settings by considering online variational inference with fixed update costs [10] or various forms of variational particle filtering [37, 42, 52]. However, overly restrictive distributional assumptions (e.g. exponential family) can hinder performance when working with complex feature spaces such as neural network representations.

Several works have considered amortized inference over Dirichlet priors [21, 34, 43], Gaussian process priors [11], and nested Chinese Restaurant Process priors [26]. Similar to the classic approaches mentioned above, these methods belong to the family of batch inference solutions.

We do so by using metalearning to incorporate the inductive bias of a nonparametric Bayesian model into the learned network rather explicitly instantiating such a model. This is reminiscent of previous metalearning approaches that train with \u201cepisodes\u201d [63] to learn a general prior distribution over weight initializations [24, 27], languages [39], or supervised regression and classification problems [41]. Similarly, our method can be viewed as learning an implicit application of Bayes\u2019 rule in a sequential setting [5] where meta-learning defines Bayesian updates over complicated distributional assumptions [45]. We use sequences of observations and labels that can also be viewed as a kind of episode, but our goal is different: we aim to perform sequential inference over an unbounded number of classes. Compared to the previously mentioned approaches using variational inference or amortized inference, we leverage metalearning to directly learn a distribution over class labels rather than jointly learning encoder and decoder networks to maximize a variational lower bound on the log likelihood of the observations. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Related to our aims, the goal of open set recognition (OSR) is, broadly speaking, to detect previously unseen classes while accurately predicting known classes [54]. Several early approaches to OSR focus solely on detecting previously unseen classes, either using traditional machine learning methods [12, 13, 32, 55, 68] and, more recently, creating neural networks with open-set capabilities [7, 17, 57]. Bendale and Boult [6] first treated OSR as an incremental learning problem by using extracted image features to perform metric learning over known classes initially, and performing incremental class learning thereafter. This method employs thresholded distances from the nearest class mean as its decision function. Rudd et al. [50] advanced this approach by introducing distributional information into the thresholding process. Both methods rely on large datasets of known classes. [36] introduced a metalearning formulation of OSR based on thresholding prototypical embeddings [58] to address this limitation. Similarly, Willes et al. [67] proposed a method called FLOWR that combines prototypical embeddings with Bayesian nonparametric class priors. These methods operate in the sequential observation setting, observing the true class label after every prediction, and explicitly learn a metric space end-to-end instead of performing inference over arbitrary input features (including possibly representations extracted from a pretrained network) as we do. The particle filter baselines [23] we compare against closely resemble a variant of FLOWR modified for our setting.

The process of meta-learning \u2013 learning the model itself from data \u2013 brings about different challenges. Care should be taken when deploying the model in scenarios where the diversity in labels differs greatly from metalearning.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
