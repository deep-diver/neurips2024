These models naturally handle open-ended classes and long-tailed distributions, but standard inference algorithms are computationally expensive and not designed for sequential inference, hindering their adoption in complex tasks. This paper addresses these challenges by using a recurrent neural network to learn the inductive bias inherent to the Bayesian model.\nThe proposed solution involves training a recurrent neural network (RNN) using data generated from a nonparametric Bayesian prior (Dirichlet Process Mixture Model). This \"neural circuit\" learns to perform Bayesian inference over an open set of classes. The method's efficiency stems from the discriminative nature of RNNs, allowing it to make predictions in constant time for a sequence of observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the metalearned neural circuit achieves comparable or better performance than traditional approaches like particle filters, while requiring significantly less computation and being simpler to implement.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Cp7HD618bd/podcast.wav"}
