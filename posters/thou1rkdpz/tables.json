The models were trained and tested on linear regression tasks with a shared signal, comparing their performance across two different settings: one where the mean of the task parameter (\u03b2*) is zero and another where \u03b2* is a vector of tens. The table shows the losses achieved by each model in each scenario, highlighting the performance differences between models with and without MLP layers when dealing with a non-zero mean in task parameters.", "section": "Experiments on GPT2"}]
