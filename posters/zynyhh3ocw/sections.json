[{"heading_title": "DNAS Rethinking", "details": {"summary": "Rethinking DNAS for logic synthesis reveals crucial limitations.  Existing methods struggle with **precise circuit generation**, especially for larger circuits, and show **high sensitivity to hyperparameters**. This stems from three key issues:  **overreliance on skip connections**, which limits network efficiency; a **structure mismatch** between the network and circuit architectures, leading to inefficient search; and **imbalanced learning**, where some input-output examples are significantly harder to learn than others. Addressing these issues requires novel approaches that incorporate circuit structural biases, regularization techniques to curb excessive skip connections, and strategies to mitigate imbalanced learning.  **A focus on scalable and accurate circuit generation** is essential for future advancements in this field."}}, {"heading_title": "T-Net Framework", "details": {"summary": "The T-Net framework, a novel approach for logic synthesis, tackles the limitations of existing Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) methods.
