While existing text-to-image generative models often generate images that do not closely match human preferences, thus alignment in the context of diffusion has garnered increasing attention [28, 10, 5, 17, 28]. There are two main types of text-toimage generative models alignment algorithms: (i) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). For example, reward weighted method [13] first explores using human feedback to align text-to-image models with human preference. ReFL [34] trains a reward model, ImageReward, using human preferences and subsequently utilizes it for fine-tuning. (i) Direct Policy Optimization $(D P O)$ . DPOK [7] fine-tunes text-to-image diffusion models by using policy gradient to maximize the feedback-trained reward. ZO-RankSGD [28] optimizes diffusion in an online fashion with human ranking feedback. RAFT [5] and AlignProp [17] tune the generative model to directly increase the reward of generated images. Several manually annotated preference datasets are proposed to support above algorithms [32, 34, 10]. Their overall statistics are shown in Table 1. These manually annotated data have two drawbacks.

As described in Section 3, during the construction of VisionPrefer, we encourage GPT-4 V to directly output scores for various aspects (e.g., aesthetic) of each image (denoted as score feedback). Another straightforward prompting manner (denoted as rank feedback) is encourage GPT-4 V to directly provide a ranking of images ( $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ ) in a certain aspect (i.e., $\\alpha\\succ\\beta,\\beta\\succ\\alpha$ , or $\\alpha\\,=\\,\\beta$ ). It is interesting to explore which prompting manner is best suit for AI Annotators. We randomly sampled 1,000 samples from ImageRewardDB and 500 samples from HPD, and utilized the two aforementioned prompt manners to ascertain GPT-4 V\u2019s annotations. The results are presented at Figure 10 (c), we observe that in both datasets, the accuracy achieved using score feedback is higher than that achieved using rank feedback.

We investigate the influence of the variation in $\\tau$ on both the accuracy of annotation and annotation consistency (where the same input yields identical annotation results). The results are shown in Figure 10 (d), we observe a decrease in accuracy as $\\tau$ increases, indicating that lower values of $\\tau$ should be set when conducting preference annotations. Furthermore, as $\\tau$ increases, annotation consistency continues to decline, which is sensible because more randomness in the results leads to different preference outcomes for identical inputs over time.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
