In this paper, we empirically show that for each node, aggregating the non-conformity scores of nodes with the same label can improve the efficiency of conformal prediction sets while maintaining valid marginal coverage.

Many conformal prediction (CP) methods have been developed to provide valid uncertainty estimates for model predictions in machine learning classification tasks (Romano et al., 2020; Angelopoulos et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024; Wei and Huang, 2024). Although several CP methods for GNNs have been studied, the use of CP in graph-structured data is still largely underexplored. ICP (Wijegunawardana et al., 2020) is the first to apply CP framework on graphs, designs a margin conformity score for labels of nodes without considering the relation between nodes. NAPS (Clarkson, 2023) use the non-exchangeable technique from (Barber et al., 2023) for inductive node classification, not applicable for the transductive setting, while we focus on the transductive setting where exchangeability property holds. Our method is essentially an enhanced version of the DAPS (Zargarbashi et al., 2023) method, which proposes a diffusion-based method that incorporates neighborhood information by leveraging the network homophily. Similar to DAPS, CF-GNN (Huang et al., 2023b) introduces a topology-aware output correction model, akin to GCN, which employs a conformal-aware inefficiency loss to refine predictions and improve the efficiency of post-hoc CP. Other recent efforts in CP for graphs include (Lunde, 2023; Marandon, 2023; Zargarbashi and Bojchevski, 2023; Sanchez-Martin et al., 2024) which focus on distinct problem settings.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
