Conformal prediction offers a solution, but its prediction sets are often large and inefficient.  This poses a significant challenge in high-stakes applications where misclassifications are costly.  Existing methods like Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) try to address this, but they have limitations.\n\nThis paper introduces Similarity-Navigated Adaptive Prediction Sets (SNAPS), a novel algorithm designed to improve conformal prediction for GNNs.  **SNAPS leverages feature similarity and structural neighborhood information to intelligently aggregate non-conformity scores, resulting in smaller, more efficient prediction sets.** The method is rigorously evaluated on various datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing techniques while maintaining the desired level of coverage.  **Theoretical guarantees of SNAPS's validity are also provided.**", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "iBZSOh027z/podcast.wav"}
