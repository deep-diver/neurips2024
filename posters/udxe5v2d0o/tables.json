The table compares the performance of several methods, including the Stable Diffusion baseline (SD 1.4v), ESD, UCE, SPM, and DUO with different beta values (500 and 250).  It shows that DUO achieves comparable image quality to other methods, while offering varying degrees of success in removing nudity.", "section": "4.2 Red teaming results"}, {"figure_path": "UdXE5V2d0O/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: FID and CLIP score (CS) for violence.", "description": "This table presents the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP similarity (CS) scores for violence removal experiments using different methods. Lower FID indicates better image quality, while higher CS represents better semantic similarity.  The results show the FID and CS scores for the original Stable Diffusion 1.4v model (SD 1.4v) and for models trained using the ESD, UCE, SPM, and DUO methods (with \u03b2= 1000 and \u03b2 = 500).

It shows the mean and standard deviation of the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) scores, calculated between 128 images generated by the unlearned models and the pre-trained model. The lower LPIPS scores indicate less impact on the generation of visually similar but safe concepts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving the model's ability to generate safe content even after unlearning of unsafe concepts.", "section": "4.3 Ablation study"}, {"figure_path": "UdXE5V2d0O/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: FID for SD3 unlearned nudity.", "description": "This table presents the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores for Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) models trained with and without the proposed Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO) method.
