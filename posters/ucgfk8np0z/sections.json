However, calculating Shapley values is computationally expensive, particularly for large datasets. This paper proposes a novel approximation method, **DU-Shapley**, which leverages the structure of the dataset valuation problem to achieve significantly greater computational efficiency than standard methods while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees.  The core idea is to approximate the Shapley value by sampling datasets uniformly, avoiding costly marginal contribution calculations. The results demonstrate that DU-Shapley excels in approximating Shapley values and accurately performs dataset valuation tasks, even under real-world conditions where strict theoretical assumptions are not met.  This makes DU-Shapley a practical and **effective tool for various dataset valuation applications**, such as data marketplaces and collaborative data sharing initiatives."}}, {"heading_title": "Future Works", "details": {"summary": "The 'Future Works' section of a research paper on dataset valuation using the Shapley value proxy could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the DU-Shapley method to handle more complex utility functions** beyond those considered (non-parametric regression, homogeneous cases, and locally differentially private linear regression) is crucial for broader applicability.  **Investigating the impact of dataset heterogeneity and non-uniform data distributions** on the accuracy and efficiency of the DU-Shapley approximation is important for real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, **developing more robust theoretical guarantees**\u2014especially non-asymptotic bounds\u2014for the convergence of DU-Shapley under diverse conditions would strengthen its reliability.  **Exploring alternative sampling strategies** to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo methods for Shapley value estimation, while retaining theoretical guarantees, is a potential research direction. Finally, **applying DU-Shapley to other multi-agent ML problems**, such as feature selection, model interpretation, or federated learning, and demonstrating its benefits over existing methods, could showcase its versatility and impact."}}]
