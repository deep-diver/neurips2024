These data often exist but are commonly spread across many parties, impairing their usage in a direct and simple way. Real world examples range from the advertising industry, where different retailers hold sets of observations with either similar or complementary features from consented data about browsing and shopping habits of individual users; to the medical sector where hospitals may improve their diagnostics accuracy by sharing their data. By collaborating with each other and pooling their individual datasets together, these dataset owners could learn better ML models for their applications. Naturally, many questions raise from such collaborations. Federated learning [8, 9], for example, addresses the issues related to the practical ways that dataset owners can share their data. We consider a complementary problem to the one in federated learning: measuring the additional value each party would obtain by participating in the joint ML effort. In order to compute or estimate compensating rewards allowing to incentivize parties to share their data, a first stage that is commonly considered in the literature is to perform so-called dataset valuation [1, 42, 44].

[44] considered a cooperative environment where agents can jointly train a generative model, from which synthetic data are drawn and distributed to the parties according to their Shapley values. Sim et al. [42] rewarded parties based on the Shapley value and information gain on model parameters. The critical challenge when using the Shapley value is its well-known computational intractability. To cope with it, [1, 44] considered Monte Carlo (MC) approximations, while [42] worked with a small set of three players. This approximation methods, however, remain expensive whenever computing the marginal contributions involve retraining.

To assess the performance of the aforementioned Shapley value estimators, we used the mean square error (MSE) averaged over all players.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
