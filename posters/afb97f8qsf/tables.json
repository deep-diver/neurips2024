Consistency refers to the approximation ratio achieved when predictions are accurate, while robustness indicates the approximation ratio when predictions are inaccurate. The table considers various prediction types (ordering predictions, arbitrary predictions) and prediction space sizes (3 log m + 1 space, O(log m/\u03b5) space) for both the two-agent (n=2) and general (n>2) cases.
