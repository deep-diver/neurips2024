{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in fair allocation and mechanism design.  It **bridges the gap between theoretical results with public information and incentive-compatible algorithms with private information**,  opening avenues for designing truthful mechanisms using predictions in various application scenarios. The **learning-augmented framework** presented offers a new paradigm for tackling the inherent difficulties in achieving both fairness and truthfulness simultaneously.", "summary": "Learning-augmented mechanisms for fair allocation achieve constant-factor approximation with accurate predictions and near-optimal approximation even with inaccurate ones.", "takeaways": ["A novel Plant-and-Steal framework is introduced for devising learning-augmented truthful mechanisms to approximate MMS values.", "The framework achieves constant consistency (accurate predictions) and near-optimal robustness (inaccurate predictions) for two agents.", "Results are extended to the general case of n \u2265 2 agents with 2-consistency and relaxed robustness guarantees."], "tldr": "Fairly allocating indivisible goods among self-interested agents is a long-standing challenge.  Existing truthful mechanisms offer poor approximations, especially when dealing with private valuations. The Maximin Share (MMS) value, representing the minimum value an agent can guarantee themselves, serves as a fairness benchmark. However, achieving both truthfulness and good MMS approximation is computationally hard, especially with private valuations.\nThis paper introduces the Plant-and-Steal framework, a learning-augmented approach that uses predictions to improve truthful MMS allocation.  For two agents, this method provides a 2-approximation with accurate predictions and a near-optimal approximation even with errors. The framework's performance gracefully degrades with prediction errors, interpolating between the best-case and worst-case scenarios. The approach also extends to multiple agents, achieving a 2-approximation under accurate predictions while guaranteeing relaxed fallback robustness.", "affiliation": "Bar-Ilan University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "aFB97F8QSF/podcast.wav"}
