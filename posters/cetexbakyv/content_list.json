However, given the cumulative nature of quantization errors in quantized diffusion models, overall performance may still decline even with efforts to minimize quantization error at each sampling step. Recent studies have proposed several methods to address accumulated quantization error, yet these solutions often suffer from limited applicability due to their underlying assumptions or only partially resolve the issue due to an incomplete understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective by conceptualizing quantization error as a \"stepback\" in the denoising process. We investigate how the accumulation of quantization error can distort the sampling trajectory, resulting in a notable decrease in model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce StepbaQ, a method that calibrates the sampling trajectory and counteracts the adverse effects of accumulated quantization error through a sampling step correction mechanism. Notably, StepbaQ relies solely on statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset, highlighting its strong applicability. Our experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique to enhance the performance of diffusion models quantized by off-the-shelf tools without modifying the quantization settings. For example, StepbaQ significantly improves the performance of the quantized SD v1.5 model by 7.30 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the common W8A8 setting, and it enhances the performance of the quantized SDXL-Turbo model by 17.31 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the challenging W4A8 setting.

In contrast to GAN [18] and VAE [30], which are prone to issues such as mode and posterior collapse, diffusion models consistently produce diverse, high-quality samples, thus emerging as the predominant technique in the field of image generation. However, the deployment of diffusion models on computationally constrained devices, such as smartphones, is impeded by their extensive computational demands, which stem from the complex network structures and the multitude of denoising steps required during the sampling phase. To enhance the computational efficiency of diffusion models, a body of research has concentrated on reducing the number of sampling steps [49, 39, 41, 46]. Concurrently, another strand of investigation has pursued model compression strategies, such as quantization [47, 33, 48, 19, 57, 24, 20, 52] and pruning [14], to diminish the computational resources necessitated. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of model quantization. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Model quantization [31, 16] stands as one of the most popular model compression techniques. This technique transits model parameters and activations from a high bit-width floating-point format to a more compact low bit-width representation, thereby facilitating a substantial acceleration of model inference with a tolerable drop in performance. However, quantizing diffusion models leads to greater performance degradation compared to standard deep learning models due to two challenges: i) Activation range varies across timesteps. Diffusion models generate samples from a normal distribution through a multi-step denoising process, wherein noise levels are gradually reduced following a predefined schedule. This mechanism results in a significant disparity in the activation range across different timesteps, as noted in studies by Shang et al. [47] and Li et al. [33]. Such variability poses a challenge in establishing an appropriate quantization range. Opting for a broader interval may mitigate clipping errors at the expense of increased rounding errors and vice versa. Prior research by Shang et al. [47] and Li et al. [33] have proposed sampling strategies to select representative calibration samples over multiple timesteps. To further reduce quantization errors, So et al. [48], He et al. [19], and Yang et al. [57] relax the quantization constraints, adopting techniques such as timestep-specific quantization parameters and mixed precision quantization. However, since these methods do not consider the accumulation of quantization errors, they only achieve mediocre performance. ii) Quantization error accumulates over time. The iterative nature of the denoising process in diffusion models means that quantization errors from each step can accumulate. Although errors at individual sampling steps may appear negligible, the cumulative effect can significantly impair the final sample quality. To mitigate this error propagation, Huang et al. [24] have underscored the significance of temporal features and introduced a temporal information-aware reconstruction method to prevent deviations from the intended sampling trajectory caused by temporal information mismatch. Conversely, He et al. [20] have presented PTQD, which employs variance schedule calibration to integrate the quantization error at each step into the Gaussian diffusion noise of stochastic samplers, thereby addressing the accumulation issue. However, the approach proposed by Huang et al. [24] only resolves the disturbance of temporal features without considering the distribution shift in the latent space. On the other hand, the strategy of error absorption introduced by He et al. [20] is limited to stochastic samplers, thereby excluding its application to deterministic samplers, such as DDIM [49].

It can be divided into two categories: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) [13, 17, 27, 26], which mitigates performance drop after quantization through model finetuning at the expense of substantial computational cost, and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) [42, 34, 25, 55, 15, 43, 10], which requires only a small calibration dataset and therefore is ideal for large models like diffusion models. While prior works have achieved considerable progress, directly applying conventional quantization methods on diffusion models does not yield good results due to challenges such as varying activation range across steps and error accumulation. Shang et al. [47] and Li et al. [33] propose sampling strategies for selecting representative calibration samples across steps to alleviate the issue of varying activation ranges. Some methods relax the quantization constraints and use finer granularity to enhance quantization results. For example, Yang et al. [57] leverage SQNR as a metric to find sensitive blocks and quantize them with higher precision. Li et al. [35], So et al. [48], and He et al. [19] employ distinct sets of quantization parameters at various timesteps to address the drastic changes in activation ranges. While effective, these strategies incur additional computational overhead, which reduces their practicality. Moreover, even when efforts are made to minimize quantization error at each sampling step, the overall performance still suffers due to error accumulation. To address the issue of error accumulation, Huang et al. [24] propose temporal information aware reconstruction, which alleviates temporal feature disturbance, to prevent deviation from the original sampling trajectory. On the other hand, Tang et al. [50] introduces a progressive calibration strategy to minimize accumulation error. Aside from the approaches above, the method PTQD, proposed by He et al. [20], is closely related to our work. Both methods utilize the statistics of quantization error to enhance the performance of quantized diffusion models. They can be considered complementary techniques integrated with existing quantization approaches. PTQD decomposes the quantization error into correlated and uncorrelated parts. The correlated part is eliminated by simple division, while the uncorrelated part is absorbed into the scheduled Gaussian noise. Though this strategy is effective, its practicality is restricted. The design of the error absorption mechanism is only compatible with stochastic samplers, such as DDPM [23], which narrows its applicability. In contrast, our proposed StepbaQ, utilizing a sampling step correction technique, is applicable to both deterministic and stochastic samplers.

Notably, as our objective is to minimize the performance discrepancy between the floating-point model and the quantized model, we follow the setting in [50] and utilize the images produced by the floating-point model as the reference for FID evaluation. This approach offers a more precise indication of the performance gap resulting from quantization. In addition, to evaluate the alignment between text and generated images, we also present the CLIP score [21], employing ViT-L/14 [12] as the backbone.

This underscores StepbaQ\u2019s effectiveness in seamlessly enhancing model performance within current quantization frameworks. Considering that PTQD depends solely on the statistics of quantization error, similar to our approach, we also include a comparison with PTQD. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Quantization Settings. Following previous works, we focus on quantizing the noise prediction network since it is the primary computation workload. Other parts of the diffusion pipelines remain at a floating-point precision. Notation $\\mathrm{W}x\\mathrm{A}y$ indicates the weights are quantized to $x$ -bit while the activations are quantized to $y$ -bit. We test two bit-width settings, W8A8 and W4A8, using the default symmetric/asymmetric settings for weights and activations, respectively. The calibration set comprises 270 samples, which are uniformly selected from each step. NeuroPilot facilitates quantization of most operators within the noise prediction network, e.g., convolution, linear layer, batch matrix multiplication, addition, multiplication, softmax, and SiLU. This scenario presents a more difficult challenge than the one adopted by Q-Diffusion, which only accounts for the quantization of selected operators such as convolution and linear layer. Hence, our setting more rigorously tests StepbaQ\u2019s robustness under comprehensive and demanding conditions. Note that for SDXL-Turbo, due to its wide activation value ranges, the input prompt embedding is quantized to 16-bit instead to prevent loss of conceptual information. The consuming linear layers take 16-bit prompt embedding and output 8-bit activations; the weights are still quantized to 4-bit/8-bit as described.

We opt for DDIM over the default PNDM[38] sampler as our empirical findings suggest that DDIM yields better results in a 20-step sampling setting. The results are provided in Table 1, which indicate that our proposed correction technique enhances performance in terms of FID and CLIP-score compared to simple post-training quantization. Specifically, for the W8A8 setting, StepbaQ markedly improves FID by 4.35 on the MS-COCO dataset and 7.30 on the SDprompts dataset. Meanwhile, PTQD, constrained by its limited applicability, achieves only modest improvements of 0.33 and 0.16 in FID on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. For the W4A8 setting, the impact of quantization error is profoundly detrimental, as evidenced by the significant deterioration in both FID and CLIP-score. In this scenario, StepbaQ dramatically reduces the FID by 26.08 and 33.60 on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. These results underscore the efficacy of StepbaQ, demonstrating its capability to substantially mitigate the adverse effects of quantization error, even under challenging scenarios.

To explore whether StepbaQ is compatible with few-step approaches, we conduct experiments on SDXL-Turbo with 4 sampling steps, employing the default EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler (Euler-a) [1] (See Appendix C for implementation details). Experimental results are presented in Table 1. Interestingly, SDXL-Turbo exhibits greater resilience to quantization errors than SD v1.5. As Euler-a is a stochastic sampler, the error absorption strategy proposed by PTQD is applicable in this setting. The results show that both PTQD and StepbaQ significantly improve the quality of the generated images under the challenging W4A8 condition, with StepbaQ outperforming PTQD. StepbaQ\u2019s improvements, which reduce the FID from 44.76 to 23.92 and from 45.45 to 28.14, effectively eliminate the visual artifacts associated with quantization errors, as shown in Fig. 7.

To assess the contribution of each component of StepbaQ, we perform an ablation study on Stable-Diffusion v1.5 under the W8A8 setting. Table 2 details the results of the ablation study, examining individual components such as Temporal Information Alignment (TIA), Latent Adjustment (LA), Step Size Adaptation (SSA), and Error Accumulation (ACC). The results indicate that mere adjustments to the temporal embedding yield only marginal improvements. In contrast, simultaneous corrections to both temporal embedding and latent variables lead to more substantial enhancements. The result also underscores the critical role of the step size adaptation. Correcting the step size results in significant FID improvements of 2.27 and 2.99 on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. Finally, accounting for error accumulation enables the model to achieve further FID reductions of 1.20 and 3.22 on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. This highlights the value of considering error accumulation in improving model performance. Fig. 3 shows the magnitude of stepback for SD v1.5 on the SDprompts dataset under the W8A8 setting. Without considering error accumulation, steps with minor quantization errors are ignored, and therefore, corrections are not applied until the final six sampling steps. In contrast, StepbaQ, accounting for the error accumulation across multiple steps, corrects the sampling steps more frequently. Notably, both configurations exhibit a greater magnitude of stepback during the final stages of the process.

Further examination revealed that the performance drop is attributable to their strategy of correlated noise elimination, which depends on the correlation between the model\u2019s output and the quantization error. However, the observed $R^{2}$ values are relatively low, indicating a weak correlation. Consequently, the estimated $k$ value utilized for correlated noise elimination is unreliable and may inadvertently compromise the model\u2019s performance.

To address this issue, we propose StepbaQ, which corrects the sampling steps to calibrate the sampling trajectory and alleviate quantization error accumulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique, enhancing the performance of a given quantized diffusion model without modifying its quantization settings. The comparative result also demonstrates the superiority of StepbaQ over existing methods. Notably, StepbaQ requires only statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset and can be applied to both stochastic and deterministic samplers, demonstrating its applicability. However, due to the design of the stepback mechanism, StepbaQ does not apply to single-step scenarios, such as 1-step SDXL-Turbo.
