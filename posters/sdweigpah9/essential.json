", "summary": "Typicalness-Aware Learning (TAL) improves failure detection by dynamically adjusting prediction confidence based on sample typicality, mitigating overconfidence and achieving significant performance gains.", "takeaways": ["TAL addresses overconfidence in deep neural networks by focusing on the reliability of prediction direction rather than magnitude.", "A new metric quantifies sample typicalness, enabling dynamic adjustment of logit magnitudes during training.", "TAL shows significant improvements in failure detection performance across various benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."], "tldr": "Deep neural networks often suffer from overconfidence, making incorrect predictions with high confidence scores. This is particularly problematic in high-risk applications where reliable predictions are crucial. Existing methods, such as calibrating confidence scores, often fail to adequately address the root cause of this overconfidence issue.  \nThe paper introduces a novel approach called Typicalness-Aware Learning (TAL) to tackle this problem. TAL identifies and handles atypical samples (those that differ significantly from typical samples in their semantic features) differently during training. By adjusting the magnitude of prediction logits based on sample typicalness, TAL reduces overconfidence while preserving reliable prediction directions. Extensive experiments across several datasets show that TAL achieves significant improvements in failure detection performance compared to existing methods, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.
