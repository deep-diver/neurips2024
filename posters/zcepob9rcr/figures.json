Algorithm 1 outlines the training process when only initial and target states are available, while Algorithm 2 extends this to incorporate trajectory data, improving the accuracy and detail of the geometric state evolution modeling. Both algorithms leverage a parameterized model, v\u03b8, to estimate the score of a diffusion process, aiming to accurately capture the dynamics and dependencies between states. The objective function in both algorithms aims to minimize the difference between the estimated score and the true score of the transition density.", "section": "3.3 Practical Implementation"}, {"figure_path": "zcEPOB9rCR/figures/figures_31_1.jpg", "caption": "Algorithm 1 Training", "description": "This algorithm describes the training process of the Geometric Diffusion Bridge model. It involves iteratively sampling initial and target geometric states from the data distribution, sampling intermediate states using a Brownian bridge-like process, and updating the model parameters via gradient descent to minimize the difference between the predicted score and the ground truth score.", "section": "3.3 Practical Implementation"}, {"figure_path": "zcEPOB9rCR/figures/figures_31_2.jpg", "caption": "Algorithm 2 Training with trajectory guidance", "description": "This algorithm details the training process of the Geometric Diffusion Bridge model when trajectory data is available.  It leverages the chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, iteratively refining the model's ability to predict future geometric states by incorporating information from intermediate states along the trajectory. The algorithm samples from the trajectory distribution, constructs bridges between consecutive states using a modified Doob's h-transform, estimates the score function, and updates model parameters via gradient descent.", "section": "3.2 Chain of Equivariant Diffusion Bridges for Leveraging Trajectory Guidance"}]
