Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data and high outlier ratios, while learning-based methods lack generalizability.  This leads to a need for more robust inlier identification techniques.\nThe paper introduces a novel algorithm that reformulates point cloud registration as an alignment error lo-minimization problem. It uses a two-stage decoupling strategy to efficiently solve this problem. First, the alignment error is separated into rotation and translation components. Then, null-space matrices decouple inlier identification from the parameter estimation. A Bayesian approach further enhances robustness. Experiments on KITTI, 3DMatch, and 3DLoMatch datasets show state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods under various conditions.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "BJrBaLoDRJ/podcast.wav"}
