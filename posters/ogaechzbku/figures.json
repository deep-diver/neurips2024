(a) shows the relationship between the false positive rate (FPR) and the alpha (\u03b1) parameter, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework in controlling FPRs.  (b) shows how the average AUROC improves as the training sample size increases for both MS-COCO and DB-Diffusion datasets. (c) and (d) illustrate the tradeoff between watermark robustness and image quality (measured by FID) by varying the watermark strength parameters c1 and c2. The results indicate a balance can be achieved between strong watermark detection and preserving image quality.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "ogaeChzbKu/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The overall flow of the proposed RAW framework.", "description": "This figure demonstrates the overall flow of the proposed RAW framework and its differences from encoder-decoder based methods. In RAW, watermarks are directly introduced and injected into images and are jointly trained with the watermark classifier.  The top panel (a) shows RAW, where frequency and spatial watermarks are added to the image, and a classifier is used to determine if the image is watermarked or not. The bottom panel (b) shows the traditional encoder-decoder method, where a watermark is encoded into the image by the encoder, and the decoder is used to extract it for comparison.

The left chart compares the training loss and test accuracy when using only a model versus a model with a watermark. The right chart shows the effects of using only frequency domain watermarks versus using both frequency and spatial domain watermarks.
