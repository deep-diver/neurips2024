STDP could solve all the aforementioned limitations of BP, making it more suitable for on-chip training on neuromorphic hardware [11, 12]. STDP is particularly effective with first-spike coding [13, 14], where neurons can fire at most once per sample. Using one spike per neuron presents several advantages, including energy efficiency [15, 16], fast information transfer [17], and high information capacity [18]. While primarily used for unsupervised feature learning [19, 20, 21], STDP can be extented to supervised learning [22, 23, 24].

While WTA competition is widely adopted in unsupervised learning [30, 19, 31, 20], its application to supervised learning is limited. Prior work [32, 44, 45] implemented WTA competition at the classification layer but only with one neuron per class, making it impossible to learn various classspecific patterns. Conversely, reward-based approaches [22, 35], such as R-STDP, are the only methods that implement WTA with multiple neurons per class. Through lateral inhibition, neurons compete for weight updates, both within the same class (intra-class WTA) and across different classes (inter-class WTA). Intra-class WTA enables neurons to learn patterns from distinct samples. However, inter-class WTA prevents accurate control over the time difference between the spikes of target and non-target neurons (i.e. neurons mapped or not to the class), as only one neuron is updated per sample. In [29], solely intra-class WTA and two neurons per class were employed to promote specialization toward target and non-target samples.

Yet, this solution is not optimal due to its stochastic nature. Other regulation mechanisms involve threshold adaptation [32, 20, 34], by increasing or reducing thresholds to promote or discourage firing.

We divide the training set into $K$ subsets and train $K$ models, each using a different subset for validation while the remaining $K-1$ subsets are used for training. Each model is trained with a different seed. Then, we evaluate the trained models on the test set and we compute the mean test accuracy and standard deviation (1-sigma).

Our proposed NCG architecture consistently improves the performance of SSTDP and S2-STDP across all datasets and feature extractors. The accuracy improvement tends to scale with the complexity of the dataset. With S2-STDP and the STDP-CSNN feature extractor, we measure an increase of 1.18 pp on MNIST, 2.83 pp on Fashion-MNIST, 5.33 pp on CIFAR-10, and 6.51 pp on CIFAR-100. S2-STDP always outperforms SSTDP and enables higher accuracy improvement when paired with NCG as it leverages neuron labeling. While S2-STDP surpasses R-STDP when the input features are well-captured, it falls behind in scenarios involving lower-quality features (CIFAR-10 with STDP-CSNN, CIFAR-100), as R-STDP can learn various patterns per class. S2- $\\mathrm{STDP+NCG}$ effectively bridges this gap, outperforming R-STDP on both simpler and harder tasks while requiring four times fewer neurons per class. When R-STDP is used with the same number of neurons as $\\mathrm{S}2{-}\\mathrm{STDP}{+}\\mathrm{NCG}.$ , the accuracy gap is even larger. These results highlight that WTA-based competitive learning in a supervised context can be achieved without inter-class WTA.

Results on both Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that each component of our methods (cf. M-5, CR-2, $L$ ) brings an individual and significant accuracy gain. Competition regulation tends to be crucial for benefiting from improved class separation, especially with STDP-CSNN. The accuracy gain gets lower with SoftHebb-CNN as the extracted features exhibit higher class separability. Neuron labeling enhances the performance of our models through neuron specialization. Our competition regulation mechanism based on twocompartment thresholds (cf. CR-2) outperforms the existing threshold adaptation with one threshold (cf. CR-1), as well as dropout (cf. Drop). In a first-spike-based decision-making context, we find that learning thresholds (cf. CR-1) is not mandatory for successfully learning various patterns. Instead, it is more important to ensure fair decision-making with fixed thresholds and use threshold adaptation as a competition regulation mechanism only.

The spread of their clusters suggests that they have learned various class-specific patterns. The weights of the non-target neurons form a single cluster at the center since their weights are very similar.

We performed preliminary experiments with S4NN [57], a gradient-based rule, and observed that the addition of NCGs led to accuracy improvements consistent with our previous results (see Section 3.6 of Supplementary Material).

First, they increase the costs in terms of parameters, computation, and hardware. The computational overhead of NCGs scales linearly with the number of neurons. In hardware design, they introduce another overhead due to the additional connections, both to the previous layer and within the layer. Second, increasing the number of neurons strengthens specialization on the training set, especially when faced with a higher number of input features (cf. SoftHebb-CNN). This behavior limits the generalization capabilities of our models and requires additional research to fully exploit their potential in these scenarios. Third, the NCG architecture applies only to the output layer of a network. Nevertheless, this work is the first to introduce WTA and competition regulation mechanisms specifically designed for classification. It establishes the relevance of such mechanisms in this context, laying the foundations for future research on WTA-based supervised competitive learning in multi-layer networks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
