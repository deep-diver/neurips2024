In this layer, each class is mapped to an NCG and the prediction is based on the first spike. An NCG is a group of M neurons connected with lateral inhibition to enable intra-class WTA competition: the first neuron to fire inhibits the other ones and undergoes a weight update based on a temporal error (which depends on the learning rule considered). The sign and amplitude of the error pushes neurons to fire earlier (positive sign) or later (negative sign). Competition regulation occurs only within the NCG mapped to the class of the input sample to ensure balanced competition among neurons on samples of their class. NCGs improve the classification capabilities of a layer by promoting the learning of various patterns per class.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of a spiking classification layer using Neuronal Competition Groups (NCGs). Each class has its own NCG, a group of neurons that compete for activation using intra-class Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition.  Lateral inhibition ensures that only the first neuron to spike in the group wins and receives a weight update, based on a temporal error signal. A competition regulation mechanism, based on adaptive thresholds, ensures fair competition among neurons within each NCG. This method allows for learning of multiple class-specific patterns per class.", "section": "4 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "GeE5qF6ICg/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Number of weight updates per epoch received by the neurons of class 0 trained with S2-STDP+NCG, with and without competition regulation, on CIFAR-10. n\u2081 to n\u2084 are labeled as target neurons and n\u2085 is labeled as non-target.
