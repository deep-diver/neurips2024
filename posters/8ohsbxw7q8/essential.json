Existing methods struggle with this because they either approximate reward signals or rely on earlier graph generative models. This limitation hinders progress in various domains that heavily rely on graphs such as drug discovery.\n\nThe researchers introduce GDPO to address these challenges. GDPO uses reinforcement learning and a specially designed \"eager policy gradient\" to optimize graph diffusion models directly. Experiments show GDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance and high sample efficiency on various tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods. This work makes significant contributions by bridging the gap between graph diffusion models and reinforcement learning, opening exciting possibilities for optimizing graph generation in diverse application areas.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "8ohsbxw7q8/podcast.wav"}
