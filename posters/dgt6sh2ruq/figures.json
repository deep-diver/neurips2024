The shaded region represents an initial period of \u0398(log T) rounds where the access frequency is not guaranteed. After this initial period, a constant probability of accessing the external factor is established, leading to an overall \u03a9(1) frequency of access for the remainder of the time horizon.", "section": "4 Partial Information Feedback"}, {"figure_path": "Dgt6sh2ruQ/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Regret of Algorithm 1 under different number of total rounds T = 2000 \\cdot 2^k for integer 0 \u2264 k \u2264 5.", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between the regret and the number of total rounds (T) under four different settings: (1) degenerate optimal solution with full information feedback, (2) unique non-degenerate optimal solution with full information feedback, (3) degenerate optimal solution with partial information feedback, and (4) unique non-degenerate optimal solution with partial information feedback.  The x-axis represents the total number of rounds (T), while the y-axis represents the regret. Each line represents the average regret across multiple trials, while the shaded area represents the 99% confidence interval. The figure visually demonstrates how the regret scales differently depending on the degeneracy of the optimal solution and the type of information feedback.", "section": "Numerical Validations"}]
