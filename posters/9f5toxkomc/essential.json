Existing data point selection (DPS) methods, often based on computationally expensive bi-level optimization, struggle with efficiency and theoretical shortcomings.  This limitation hinders the training of large models, particularly in resource-intensive domains like language processing.\nThis paper proposes BADS (Bayesian Approach to Data Selection), a novel Bayesian method for DPS.  BADS frames DPS as a posterior inference problem within a Bayesian model. It uses stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for efficient parameter and weight inference, exhibiting convergence even with minibatches. Experimental results across vision and language tasks, including large language models, demonstrate BADS' superior efficiency and scalability compared to existing BLO methods.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "9f5tOXKoMC/podcast.wav"}
