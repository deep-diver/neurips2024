The circuit consists of three input gates, an addition gate, and a multiplication gate. The C-GNN has the same structure as the circuit, with each gate in the circuit represented by a node in the C-GNN. The feature vectors of the nodes in the C-GNN represent the values of the gates in the circuit. The computation of the C-GNN simulates the computation of the circuit, with the values of the gates in the circuit being calculated by the nodes in the C-GNN.  This illustrates the equivalence shown in Theorem 3.11 between C-GNNs and arithmetic circuits of constant depth.", "section": "Simulating C-GNNs with arithmetic circuits"}, {"figure_path": "0ZeONp33f0/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Example illustrating the proof of Theorem 3.11: The values of the feature vectors during the computation of the C-GNN.", "description": "This figure illustrates how a C-GNN simulates an arithmetic circuit.  Panel (a) shows the arithmetic circuit with its gates labeled by their operations and unique numbers. Panel (b) displays the corresponding labeled graph used as input to the C-GNN. The initial feature vectors of the input nodes in the C-GNN correspond to the inputs of the arithmetic circuit. Each node in the C-GNN corresponds to a gate in the circuit. The values of the feature vectors during the computation of the C-GNN are given in Table 1.  The final feature vector of the output node in the C-GNN represents the output of the arithmetic circuit. This example shows how the C-GNN simulates layer by layer the computations of the circuit.", "section": "3.2 Simulating C-GNNs with arithmetic circuits"}]
