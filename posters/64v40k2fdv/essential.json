Traditional methods struggle with large and complex molecules.  Recent advances in pretraining models for other domains (NLP, CV) have shown impressive results with scaling up model and dataset size. However, research into scaling laws in MRL is limited.\nUni-Mol2 addresses this gap by systematically investigating the scaling laws in MRL. The model leverages a two-track transformer architecture to integrate atomic, graph, and geometric features.  The study uses a massive dataset (800 million conformations) and scales Uni-Mol2 to 1.1 billion parameters, surpassing existing methods.  Results show consistent performance gains across various downstream tasks as the model size grows, highlighting the effectiveness of scaling in MRL.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "64V40K2fDv/podcast.wav"}
