Traditional PAC-Bayes bounds often rely on restrictive assumptions and/or involve a free parameter that is difficult to optimize, leading to suboptimal results.  This limits their applicability and effectiveness.\nThis paper introduces a novel PAC-Bayes oracle bound that overcomes these limitations.  By leveraging the properties of Cram\u00e9r-Chernoff bounds, the new method enables exact optimization of the free parameter, thus enhancing accuracy.  Furthermore, it allows for more informative assumptions, generating potentially tighter and more useful bounds. The framework is also flexible enough to encompass a range of existing regularization techniques.", "affiliation": "Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM)", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Generalization"}, "podcast_path": "CyzZeND3LB/podcast.wav"}
