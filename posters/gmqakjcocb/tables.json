[{"figure_path": "gMqaKJCOCB/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Chosen hyperparameter values and the achieved test set MSE for ridge and 1, 2-step SD.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved by three different regression models on three real-world datasets: Air Quality, Airfoil, and AEP.  The models compared are the standard Ridge regression, 1-step Self-Distillation (SD), and 2-step SD. For each model and dataset, the optimal hyperparameters (lambda and the imitation parameters, xi) that minimize the MSE on a validation set are reported, along with the resulting MSE on a held-out test set.  The table shows that 2-step SD can sometimes outperform both Ridge regression and 1-step SD, achieving lower test MSE. ", "section": "5.3 Real-world regression experiments"}]
