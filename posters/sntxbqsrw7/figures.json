We fix the low intrinsic dimension k = 8, and let the ambient dimension d grow from 10 to 1000.", "description": "This figure shows the KL divergence and total variation distance between the output distribution of the reverse process (q1) and the target data distribution (p1) for different ambient dimensions (d) and numbers of steps (T) in the DDPM sampler. The intrinsic dimension (k) is fixed at 8.  The results demonstrate that with the proposed coefficient design (red lines), the error remains relatively constant as the ambient dimension increases, while the error significantly increases with the previously used coefficient design (black dashed lines). This highlights the adaptivity of the DDPM sampler with the new coefficient design to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution.", "section": "5 Simulation study"}]
