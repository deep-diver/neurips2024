Comparison with other acceleration approaches.", "description": "This table compares the proposed Hyper-SD model with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) acceleration approaches for diffusion models.  It shows the number of steps required for inference, the architecture used (SD15 or SDXL), whether classifier-free guidance (CFG) is supported, and whether the acceleration is achieved using a one-step UNet or LoRA. The table highlights that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance with support for CFG, one-step UNet and one-step LoRA, demonstrating its efficiency and flexibility.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "O5XbOoi0x3/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2.

The comparison uses SD15-Base and SDXL-Base as baselines, and includes other acceleration methods such as LCM, TCD, PerFlow, and Lightning. Evaluation metrics include CLIP Score, Aes Score, ImageReward score, and Pick Score across different numbers of inference steps (1, 4, and 25).  The table highlights the best performance achieved by each method for each metric and step, showing Hyper-SD's improved performance, especially at lower step counts.", "section": "4.2 Main Results"}, {"figure_path": "O5XbOoi0x3/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3.
