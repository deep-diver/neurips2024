[{"figure_path": "wvQHQgnpGN/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Performance illustration of SDEPO and OFTRL for solving the random generated Markov game.", "description": "The figure shows the convergence speed of three algorithms: SDEPO with random features, SDEPO with Nystr\u00f6m features, and OFTRL.  The y-axis represents the duality gap (V** - V\u03c0,\u03c0), which measures the distance from the current policy's value to the optimal Nash equilibrium. The x-axis represents the number of iterations.  The graph demonstrates that SDEPO converges faster than OFTRL for solving this specific random Markov game, highlighting the benefit of the proposed algorithm.", "section": "6 Numerical verification"}]
