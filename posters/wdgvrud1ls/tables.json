It includes supervised methods (Vanilla, EEGNet, EEG-Conformer, Deep4, CSP-RLDA), self-supervised methods (Barlow Twins, SimCLR, VicReg), and the proposed EEG-EMG dependence learning methods (FMCA-LD and FMCA-T).  The results show that FMCA-T, using the trace cost, achieves the highest accuracy in most cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of using EEG eigenfunctions for classification without the need for EMG data during testing.", "section": "3 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "wdGvRud1LS/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of classification accuracies: supervised, self-supervised, and our EEG-EMG dependence learning.

The key finding is that FMCA-T significantly outperforms other methods, especially in cross-subject settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of using learned EEG eigenfunctions as feature projectors for classification.  Importantly, the EMG data is only needed during training, not testing, highlighting the efficiency and potential of this approach.", "section": "3.2 Main results"}, {"figure_path": "wdGvRud1LS/tables/tables_21_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Architecture of Temporal Network.", "description": "This table details the architecture of the temporal network used in the proposed method.
