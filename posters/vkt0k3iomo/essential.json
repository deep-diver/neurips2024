Spiking GNNs, inspired by the brain's energy efficiency, offer a promising alternative, but existing models primarily focus on Euclidean spaces and face challenges with high latency during training. This paper addresses these limitations by developing a novel Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG) that operates on Riemannian manifolds, thereby capturing the inherent geometric properties of graph data. \nThe MSG utilizes a newly designed spiking neuron which incorporates structural information into spike trains through graph convolution.  Unlike prior approaches, MSG employs 'Differentiation via Manifold', an alternative training method that avoids the limitations of backpropagation. This method replaces the traditional back-propagation-through-time (BPTT) with a novel technique that is recurrence-free and computationally efficient. Theoretical analysis shows that MSG approximates a solver of manifold ordinary differential equations, providing a strong theoretical foundation. Experimental results demonstrate MSG's superior performance and energy efficiency compared to existing spiking GNNs and traditional GNNs on various datasets.", "affiliation": "North China Electric Power University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "VKt0K3iOmO/podcast.wav"}
