Existing methods lack systematic guidance on optimizing model parameters and training strategies to balance performance and resource usage. This often leads to suboptimal models and wasted resources. \n\nThis paper introduces an algorithm that determines the best combination of model size, training data, and fine-tuning techniques for any given computational budget.  Through extensive experimentation, it identifies specific fine-tuning methods that are optimal at different budget levels and provides scaling laws to predict optimal performance for various model configurations.  This makes the design process easier for practitioners and ensures they get the best possible embedding models without exceeding resource limits.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "kVL5rvkqGG/podcast.wav"}
