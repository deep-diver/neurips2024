A major reason behind this issue is the so-called \"implicit bias\" of optimization algorithms, which may inadvertently constrain the model's capacity and limit its ability to generalize well.  This is particularly problematic when optimization methods are misaligned with the threat models used to evaluate robustness.\nThis paper delves into the issue of implicit bias in robust empirical risk minimization (ERM). It explores how optimization algorithms and model architectures can cause this \"price of implicit bias\", leading to poor generalization. The researchers investigate this through theoretical analysis of linear models, identifying conditions where specific regularizers are optimal for robust generalization. They further demonstrate the effects of implicit bias through simulation with synthetic data and experiments with neural networks, showing how different optimization algorithms lead to varied levels of model robustness.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "h1grUs6CjN/podcast.wav"}
