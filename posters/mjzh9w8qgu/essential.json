This limitation hinders the application of IRL in dynamic environments needing continuous adaptation.  The inability to update the reward and policy model incrementally from partial data also restricts the method's use in applications where obtaining complete trajectories is difficult or impossible. \nTo overcome these challenges, the paper introduces MERIT-IRL, a novel algorithm that learns a reward function and policy incrementally from an ongoing trajectory.  **MERIT-IRL formulates the problem as an online bi-level optimization problem**, dynamically updating the reward based on new state-action pairs and using a meta-regularization term to prevent overfitting. The algorithm is theoretically proven to achieve sub-linear regret. Experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various domains, including robotics and finance.", "affiliation": "Pennsylvania State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "mJZH9w8qgu/podcast.wav"}
