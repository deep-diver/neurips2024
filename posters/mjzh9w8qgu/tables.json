The mean and standard deviation are calculated from 10 test tasks.", "description": "This table presents the quantitative results of four different in-trajectory inverse reinforcement learning algorithms (MERIT-IRL, IT-IRL, Naive MERIT-IRL, Naive IT-IRL) and two baselines (Hindsight and Expert) across four different tasks (HalfCheetah, Walker, Hopper, and Stock Market).  For each task and algorithm, the mean and standard deviation of a performance metric (likely cumulative reward) are reported, calculated across 10 test runs. This allows for a comparison of the performance of each algorithm in various situations. ", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
