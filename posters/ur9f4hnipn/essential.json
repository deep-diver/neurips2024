High-order ODE solvers can improve accuracy but face challenges in training stability and efficiency.  Previous work using gated fusion for coefficient learning in higher-order methods showed limited improvement when scaled to large datasets or models.  This led to the need for improved Transformer architecture design and efficient learning techniques.\nThe paper introduces PCformer, a novel architecture that employs a predictor-corrector paradigm to minimize truncation errors.  A key innovation is the use of exponential moving average (EMA) based coefficient learning, which enhances the higher-order predictor's performance and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PCformer's superiority over existing methods on various NLP tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and showcasing better parameter efficiency.  The EMA method also shows adaptability to different ODE solver orders, facilitating future exploration of even more advanced numerical methods.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Machine Translation"}, "podcast_path": "Ur9f4hNIpN/podcast.wav"}
