However, traditional NMS methods are computationally expensive, becoming a bottleneck in modern high-speed object detection models.  This research addresses this issue by presenting a novel approach to NMS using graph theory, which provides insights into its structural properties. \nThe proposed algorithms, QSI-NMS and BOE-NMS, leverage the graph-theoretic perspective. QSI-NMS is a fast recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm, while BOE-NMS focuses on the locality of suppression. These algorithms are significantly faster than traditional methods, providing speedups of up to 10.7x with only a marginal decrease in accuracy. To facilitate evaluation, the researchers also introduce NMS-Bench, a benchmark for comprehensive assessment of NMS methods.  This contribution promises to accelerate research and development in object detection.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, MOEKLINNS Lab, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "0lau89u4oE/podcast.wav"}
