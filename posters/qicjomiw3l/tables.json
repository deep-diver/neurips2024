It compares various configurations, systematically varying the encoder (Mamba or Vision Transformer), fusion method (Mamba or Vision Transformer), and the inclusion of causality in the model. The performance metrics used for comparison are Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Difference (MAD), for both intensity and depth components of the reconstruction.
