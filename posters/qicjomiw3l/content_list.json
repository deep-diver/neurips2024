By analyzing these reflections, NLOS can reveal critical properties like albedo and surface normal of the hidden objects, unlocking valuable insights. A typical active NLOS imaging setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. The pulsed laser emits periodic pulses directed towards a relay wall, serving the dual purpose of illumination and synchronization for the imaging system. The Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) captures photons reflected from the relay wall, while the Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting sensor (TCSPC) records their arrival times within each pulse period. The temporal distribution of each scanning point accumulates over successive pulse periods, termed exposure time.

These methods can significantly accelerate data acquisition by orders of magnitude. Recent research [4] has further demonstrated that employing a low-density scanning grid can balance reconstruction quality and total acquisition time, without sacrificing too much information. The sparse scanning points and rapid exposure time offer the potential for dynamic NLOS imaging, a field yet to be fully explored. However, the pursuit of dynamic NLOS reconstruction faces two primary challenges: 1) Insufficient information fusion across adjacent transient frames: Existing methods, whether traditional or deep-based, typically concentrate on individual transient frames, overlooking the temporal consistency between them. 2) Lack of NLOS video datasets, including synthetic data for training and real-world data for evaluation: The rapid exposure time results in a diminished signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of transient measurement, highlighting the critical need for simulation datasets that accurately emulate real-world conditions.

Specifically, in the first stage, after extracting the features from the input, we introduce the elaborate spatial-temporal Mamba (ST-Mamba) to sequentially exploit the causality in transient measurement and dig into the inherent long-ranging features along the spatial and temporal dimensions.

The total acquisition time for a transient measurement is proportional to the exposure time per scanning point and the density of the scanning grid, typically ranging from minutes to hours. Different from confocal systems, the detector in non-confocal systems [5, 6, 7, 8] is in array form, such as $16\\!\\times\\!1$ or $32\\!\\times\\!32$ . The laser illuminates a fixed point on the relay wall and the spad array captures the indirect photon simultaneously. The non-confocal system has the potential for real-time imaging but still faces the following challenges. Accuracy is still traded for speed [7, 8, 9]. Due to the unsatisfactory parameters (low quantum efficiency and flil factor, high dark count and cross-talk effect), non-confocal systems also require relatively long exposure times to achieve reconstruction, e.g., 0.3 FPS in [6], 5 FPS in [8, 9], 20 FPS in [7]. More importantly, the price of the SPAD array is quite expensive. There are also some special imaging setups using dynamic cues, e.g., key-hole imaging [10] and light field tomography [11].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
