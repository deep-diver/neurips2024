One-shot reconstruction of 3D humans is a challenging and longstanding problem due to the limited information from a single input image. To alleviate this limitation, previous works leveraged parametric models [20, 1] as coarse geometry prior. Traditional methods [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] utilized UV maps for human appearance representation. To complete the unseen texture from the single image, some approaches [25, 24] inpainted missing textures via pre-trained diffusion models. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [26] have also been explored for reconstruction from sparse views [27, 15, 14, 28] or a single view [29, 16, 13, 18]. KeypointNeRF [15] encoded spatial information using 3D skeleton keypoints. SHERF [16] created 3D human avatars from a single image with hierarchical features for informative encoding. VANeRF [13] leveraged visibility in both feature fusion and adversarial learning for single-view interacting-hand image synthesis. These methods greatly enhance the NeRF one-shot reconstruction performance. Nonetheless, generalizable NeRF [27, 30, 31, 14, 15] fails to achieve satisfactory results when the input image information is not sufficient for novel view prediction due to the under-utilization of hand priors. To overcome this issue, the pioneering research in [18] enabled one-shot single-hand avatar creation by learning data-driven hand priors which are further utilized with inversion and ftiting.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
