The comparison is performed on the Interhand2.6M dataset and uses two metrics to evaluate the performance: novel view synthesis and novel pose synthesis.  For each metric, the table shows the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) scores. Higher PSNR and SSIM scores indicate better image quality, while a lower LPIPS score suggests better perceptual similarity to the ground truth.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "BxPa7Sn5Zq/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: One-shot synthesis comparison with state-of-the-art methods on Interhand2.6M.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed method against several state-of-the-art methods for one-shot hand avatar synthesis.  The comparison is done on the Interhand2.6M dataset, and the metrics used are PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, evaluated for both novel view and novel pose synthesis scenarios.  Higher PSNR and SSIM values, along with lower LPIPS values, indicate better performance. The table shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods across all metrics and both scenarios.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "BxPa7Sn5Zq/tables/tables_12_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: One-shot synthesis comparison with state-of-the-art methods on Interhand2.6M.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed method against four state-of-the-art methods for one-shot hand avatar synthesis.
