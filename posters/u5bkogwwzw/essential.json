This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on the interpretability of parameters within various models such as clustering, time-series, and classification. The challenge lies in the difficulty of interpreting high-dimensional and often uninterpretable model parameters.  Current methods often fail to provide meaningful explanations of the underlying data patterns.\nThe researchers propose a novel framework that uses natural language predicates to parameterize these models.  This approach allows for the optimization of continuous relaxations of predicate parameters and subsequent discretization using language models.  The resulting framework is highly versatile, easily adaptable to various data types (text and images) and model types, offering improved interpretability and effectiveness. The efficacy is demonstrated across multiple datasets and tasks showing improved performance compared to existing methods for text clustering.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "u5BkOgWWZW/podcast.wav"}
