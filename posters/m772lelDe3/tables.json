The model is identified as equation (7) in the paper.  Each simulation involves three distinct time delays (\u03c4\u2081, \u03c4\u2082, \u03c4\u2083) applied to different subsets of edges in the network.  Simulation 1 uses smaller delays (0.05, 0.10, 0.15) while Simulation 2 uses larger delays (0.05, 0.10, 0.20). The purpose of the table is to specify the exact time delay values used for comparison and analysis.", "section": "A.5.1 Matrix-weighted consensus models with time delays"}, {"figure_path": "m772lelDe3/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Simulation parameters of the matrix-weighted consensus model (7).", "description": "This table shows the parameters used in two simulations of the matrix-weighted consensus model with heterogeneous delays.
