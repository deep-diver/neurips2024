This phenomenon can be attributed to two main reasons. Firstly, tasks randomly sampled in source domain often come from one or several fixed patterns, and thus the continual switching of episodes training may cause the model to over-fti on some task-specific priors. For instance, in tasks involving the discrimination between tigers and giraffes, meta-learning methods may compel the model to emphasize appearance outlines, while in tasks focused on fine-grained bird identification, models tend to prioritize local discriminative textures. Yet, these task-specific priors prove challenging to transfer across different tasks Lyu et al. [2021], Zhou et al. [2023]. Secondly, the iterative episodic training in the source domain can result in the model over-ftiting to semantic prior properties specific to that domain. For example, source domains comprised of natural scene images often exhibit obvious semantic priors, whereas specialized target domains like medical image analysis or remote sensing may lack clear semantic concepts. This overall domain bias also hampers the model\u2019s cross-domain generalization. For all these challenges, the underlying evil lies in the absence of cross-domain invariant priors to guide meta-learning in the source domain.

Inspired by classical image transform theories (Fourier Nussbaumer and Nussbaumer [1982] or wavelet Zhang and Zhang [2019]), where each image can be decomposed into low-frequency content details and high-frequency structural characteristics, despite which domain it belongs to, we attempt to cast such a cross-domain invariant image property into appropriate frequency priors and utilize them to guide the meta-learning in source domain. Following this idea, we decompose each query image into a high-frequency and a low-frequency parts, and feed each into the feature embedding network for final category prediction, mirroring the process applied to the original query image. These allows for the independent feature learning in both spatial and frequency domains. In addition, the low-frequency and high-frequency branch will separately exploit the complementary image content and structures for feature enhancement, which are often concealed in the spatial domain of original query image. More importantly, we further develop two frequency priors, namely a feature reconstruction prior and a prediction consistency prior, which separately forces the original query image and its decomposed frequency components to produce the consistent intermediate feature representation as well as the final category prediction. In a specific, the feature reconstruction prior requires to reconstruct the feature of original image through fusing the features of both decomposed frequency parts using a deep projection network. The prediction consistency prior aims to minimize the separate Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prediction scores produced by the original query image and its each frequency component. By doing these, meta-learning in the source domain can be appropriately regularized and produce the exceptional cross-domain generalizable feature embeddings. Moreover, such frequency priors only perform in the meta-learning phase without introducing any extra computational cost in inference.

Early investigations into model generalization with limited data primarily focused on few-shot learning (FSL), giving rise to a series of seminal meta-learning methods Vinyals et al.

Notably, ProtoNet Snell et al. [2017] and MatchingNet Vinyals et al. [2016] construct the base-learner using a non-parametric distance measure, while Meta-opt Lee et al.

Initially, they optimize the base-learner based on a limited set of labeled data, followed by optimizing the meta-learner to minimize empirical risk on unlabeled data.

Moreover, acquiring data for extreme target domains, such as medical images Tschandl et al. [2018], Wang et al. [2017], or annotating remote sensing scene images Helber et al.

[2022] employ style augmentation during model training as a strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects on generalization caused by style variations in the target domain. Building upon the ideas presented in their earlier work Fu et al. [2022], Fu et al. Fu et al. [2023] extend their approach by incorporating adversarial training. This additional step aims to assist the model in adapting to domain shifts, enhancing its robustness across different domains. Li et al. Li et al. [2022] utilize target task information to perform distance calibration on the embedding of the source domain model to promote generalization. Wang et al. Wang and Deng [2021] and Hu et al. Hu and Ma [2022] design adversarial training methods to simulate domain changes from the task-level and feature-level respectively. In this way, the model can obtain domain-invariant representations. Guo et al. Guo et al. [2020] propose a cross-domain fine-tuning baseline, which fine-tunes the feature extraction model for each target domain task. Liang et al. Liang et al. [2021] further design a self-supervised reconstruction loss to fine-tune the model, which can help the model learn more comprehensive representations. Although fine-tuning based methods Guo et al. [2020], Liang et al. [2021] achieve good performance, they require a large number of iterative training for each target domain task. This paradigm brings additional computational and storage overhead.

In the realm of classical image processing, researchers historically devised effective pattern extractors based on diverse image priors such as texture Guo et al.

[2023] have employed shape priors to mitigate texture bias and enhance model generalization. For instance, Jain et al.Jain et al.

As discussed in Sec. A, previous works Stojanov et al. [2021], Padmanabhan et al. [2023], Heo et al. [2023], Yin et al. [2019], Chen and Wang [2021], Zhao et al. [2022], Cheng et al. [2023] have explored the integration of various priors, including texture, shape, and frequency, among others. To highlight the advantages of our proposed method, we conducted comparative experiments with different variants. To ensure a fair comparison, we replaced different priors in our framework while maintaining other settings constant. Specifically, we adopted the approach of Jain et al. [2022] to model the texture prior. For the shape prior, similar to Stojanov et al. [2021], Padmanabhan et al. [2023], we employed the Canny operator Ding and Goshtasby [2001] to extract the shape prior. For high-frequency or low-frequency priors, we retained only the high-frequency branch or the low-frequency branch in our framework. The results are presented in Table 4. Overall, our method outperforms the variants with different priors. The reasons behind this superiority are as follows. Firstly, the texture prior compels the model to excessively focus on local discriminative regions, leading to texture bias and impairing generalization. Secondly, the shape prior directs the model\u2019s attention to global shapes, which may cause the model to exhibit shape bias and overlook semantic information. Thirdly, compared to texture or shape priors, the frequency prior provides more original information, expanding the model\u2019s search space and enabling a higher generalization upper bound. Fourthly, our method couples high-frequency and low-frequency information within a unified framework, presenting an elegant solution to the persistent challenges of cross-domain few-shot learning. This approach allows for the simultaneous consideration of both types of information, harnessing their complementary aspects for improved generalization.

In this study, we subscribe the limited generalization capacity of exiting methods in cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) to their over-fitting onto source domain. Since during the meta-training procedure, only tasks randomly sampled from source domain are utilized for model update, when the target domain shows obvious distribution discrepancy from the source domain, these existing methods are prone to over-fitting, in other words, fail to generalize well in the new target domain. Why can our work alleviate overfitting? To solve overftiting, a direct solution is to introduce appropriate prior (e.g., regularization) during training on source domain. Inspired by this, we attempt to comprehensively exploit the cross-domain transferable image frequency prior that each image can be decomposed into complementary low-frequency content details and high-frequency robust structural characteristics. Following this idea, we first utilizes Fast Fourier Transform to explicitly decouple the high-frequency and low-frequency components of the image. Then, we feed each component and the query image into a three-branch feature embedding network for category prediction. More importantly, we further establish a feature reconstruction prior and a prediction consistency prior to collectively guiding the network\u2019s meta-learning process. The feature reconstruction prior requires to reconstruct the feature of original image through fusing the features of both decomposed frequency parts using a deep projection network, while the prediction consistency prior aims to minimize the separate Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prediction scores produced by the original query image and its each frequency component. By doing these, both priors encourage to exploit a deep feature space where no matter full-frequency band (original image), high-frequency component or low-frequency component can lead to the unique and correct classification prediction, i.e., the idea semantic feature space which is transferable cross-domain. Therefore, the proposed method is able to mitigate the over-fitting problems in CD-FSL. Our stateof-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets as well as the ablation study also support this conclusion. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whether this work is equivalent to data augmentation or self-supervised learning? In this work, our core idea is to utilize cross-domain invariant frequency priors to alleviate the over-fitting problem of classical meta-learning in cross-domain few-shot learning tasks. To this end, we propose two key components: the Image Decomposition Module (IDM) and the Prior Regularization MetaNetwork (PRM-Net). Among them, IDM aims to use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly decompose each image from few-shot task into its low- and high-frequency components Nussbaumer and Nussbaumer [1982]. PRM-Net is a key component responsible for introducing a prediction consistency prior and a feature reconstruction prior. It is important to note that our method is fundamentally different from simple data augmentation methods and self-supervised learning methods. The insight behind our method is divide and conquer, that is, explicit decomposition and implicit coupling. First of all, the IDM is to explicitly obtain the frequency priors of the image rather than to simply perform data augmentation. IDM provides frequency prior for the subsequent PRM-Net, and its role is \"divide\". In addition, PRM-Net designs regular terms with the help of frequency priors, rather than simple self-supervised learning, and its role is \"conquer\". More importantly, this divide-and-conquer strategy enables IDM and PRM-Net to collaborate to provide a powerful meta-learning framework, aiming to enhance cross-domain generalization by explicitly considering image decomposition and introducing effective regularization during the meta-learning process. We design some experiments to compare the proposed method with other data augmentation methods and self-supervised learning methods. For the data augmentation method, we use random rotation to augment the image, and design the angular self-supervised loss as the regularization term Gidaris et al. [2018]. For self-supervised learning methods, we choose the most representative SimCLR Chen et al. [2020] and BYOL Grill et al. [2020].

This is because only the parameters in the main branch (e.g., query image branch) are learnable, and the parameters of the high-frequency branch and low-frequency branch are updated through the exponential moving average of the main branch parameters. Moreover, after training, we only keep the main branch for prediction in the test phase, since the prediction consistency prior have forced these three branches to produce the same prediction results when the training procedure converged. Therefore, our method does not introduce any additional inference costs compared with our baseline. We also supplemented experiments to answer whether the performance gain comes from additional parameters.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
