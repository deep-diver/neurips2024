This happens because the source and target tasks have different data distributions. To overcome this issue, many meta-learning methods focus on learning task-specific priors, which are difficult to transfer across different domains. This paper introduces a novel method to address this challenge. \nThe proposed method, Meta-Exploiting Frequency Prior, uses a new frequency-based framework. It decomposes each image into high and low-frequency components.  These components, alongside the original image, are fed into a meta-learning network. The key is that it uses feature reconstruction and prediction consistency priors to enhance the network's ability to learn features that generalize well to unseen tasks.  This method significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of meta-learning in cross-domain scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. **This method doesn't add extra computational cost during inference.**", "affiliation": "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2nisrxMMQR/podcast.wav"}
