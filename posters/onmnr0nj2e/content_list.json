Understanding how and why data distillation methods work is vital not only for improving these methods but also for revealing fundamental characteristics of \u201cgood\u201d training data. However, a major challenge in achieving this goal is the observation that distillation approaches, which rely on sophisticated but mostly disparate methods to generate synthetic data, have little in common with each other. In this work, we highlight a largely overlooked aspect common to most of these methods: the use of soft (probabilistic) labels. Through a series of ablation experiments, we study the role of soft labels in depth. Our results reveal that the main factor explaining the performance of state-of-the-art distillation methods is not the specific techniques used to generate synthetic data but rather the use of soft labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that not all soft labels are created equal; they must contain structured information to be beneficial. We also provide empirical scaling laws that characterize the effectiveness of soft labels as a function of images-per-class in the distilled dataset and establish an empirical Pareto frontier for data-efficient learning. Combined, our findings challenge conventional wisdom in dataset distillation, underscore the importance of soft labels in learning, and suggest new directions for improving distillation methods.

In other words, when trained on high-quality data, small models can rival the performance of their much larger counterparts. Despite its obvious importance, there is no clear answer to what characteristics define \u201cgood data.\" Data distillation offers one approach to answering this question. First introduced by Wang et al. [29], the goal of dataset distillation is to condense a dataset into a smaller (synthetic) counterpart, such that training on this distilled dataset achieves performance comparable to training on the original dataset. By studying the distillation process, we can thus investigate what information is preserved in the data (features, symmetries, and information), which in turn may shed light on fundamental characteristics that make for \u201cgood\u201d training data.

Our first key observation is that, despite very different generation strategies resulting in perceptually distinct synthetic images, virtually all leading methods, especially those able to scale to large datasets such as ImageNet-1K (or its downsized version) ([6, 9, 33, 39]), use soft (i.e., probabilistic) labels for the datasets they distill.

Data distillation methods have been primarily developed for image classification tasks. Existing methods can be organized into three main categories: (1) meta-model matching, (2) distribution matching, and (3) trajectory matching [23]. Meta-model matching methods approach the problem by solving the original bi-level optimization formulation of Wang et al. [29]. To tackle the computation challenge, various methods have been proposed to either approximate the objective [20] or improve the optimization process [9, 15, 39]. Distribution Matching (DM) seeks to minimize the statistical distance in the output (logit) space between original and distilled dataset samples [36]. Further refinements to the method include [16, 28, 35, 37, 39]. Yin et al. [33] propose to match network statistics (batchnorm) along with logits and then assigning soft labels to synthetic images. Follow-up works [12, 32] brings further improvements to the soft label assignment strategy. Matching training trajectories (MTT) was proposed by Cazenavette et al. [5], suggesting that matching long-range training dynamics can serve as a proxy objective to the expensive bi-level formulation. Further improvements and variations include [6, 8]. In this work, we aim to uncover common factors responsible for the success of these methods (i.e., the use of soft labels).

For example, in this work we only considered the setting where images are randomly selected from the training data, but future work may explore simultaneous image/label synthesis methods to improve distillation performance. Future research may also investigate whether data distillation can be achieved without using expert knowledge, either implicitly or explicitly, in a model-agnostic or even task-agnostic way.

For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
