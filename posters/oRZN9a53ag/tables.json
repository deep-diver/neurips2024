The rows represent conditions like linear or non-linear additive noise models, the presence of latent variables, and the type of output (e.g., directed acyclic graph (DAG), mixed graph). Each column corresponds to a specific causal discovery algorithm (CAM-UV, RCD, NoGAM, DirectLiNGAM, and AdaScore), showing whether they satisfy each condition with a checkmark (\u2714) or cross (X). This table helps readers to understand the assumptions that each algorithm makes and provides a way to compare the applicability of the algorithms.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "oRZN9a53ag/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Experiments causal discovery algorithms.
