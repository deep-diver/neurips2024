Traditional approaches struggle with hidden variables and complex relationships, leading to incomplete or inaccurate causal inferences. Addressing these challenges requires robust methods that can handle various model complexities and data limitations.\nThis research proposes a novel approach called AdaScore, a flexible algorithm that uses score matching to identify causal effects.  AdaScore overcomes limitations of existing methods by organically demonstrating different levels of identifiability based on modeling hypotheses, always using the score function.  It provides theoretical guarantees for identifiability of direct causal effects even in the presence of hidden variables, generalizing existing results and expanding the range of causal models that can be analyzed effectively. Empirical validation shows its robust performance across various settings.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "oRZN9a53ag/podcast.wav"}
