The input is a function f, a noise distribution Q, a scale \u03b3, and public data D<sub>x</sub> = {Z<sub>1</sub>, ..., Z<sub>m</sub>}.  The algorithm samples noise from Q and then uses an empirical risk minimization (ERM) oracle to find a function f that minimizes the distance between f and f - \u03b3 \u00b7 \u03b6, where \u03b6 is the sampled noise vector.", "section": "Algorithms for Differentially Private Learning"}]
