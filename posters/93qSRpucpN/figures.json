It shows a 2D representation of the negative Rosenbrock function, highlighting a high-performance region. Pink points indicate initial points, blue points represent samples generated using proxy-free diffusion, and red points are samples generated using proxy-enhanced sampling. The figure visually illustrates how the inclusion of explicit proxy guidance (proxy-enhanced sampling) improves the ability of the diffusion model to guide samples towards the high-performance region.  Proxy-free diffusion alone struggles to reach this region.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "93qSRpucpN/figures/figures_1_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overall of RGD.", "description": "This figure illustrates the overall architecture of the Robust Guided Diffusion (RGD) model. Panel (a) shows the proxy-enhanced sampling module, which integrates explicit guidance from a trained proxy into proxy-free diffusion to improve sampling control. It optimizes a strength parameter (\u03c9) to balance condition and diversity at each diffusion step. Panel (b) details the diffusion-based proxy refinement module, which refines the proxy using insights from proxy-free diffusion.  This module uses the probability flow ODE to generate a diffusion distribution on adversarial samples and integrates it into the proxy for refinement, improving robustness.", "section": "Method"}, {"figure_path": "93qSRpucpN/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Dynamics of strength ratio w/wo.", "description": "This figure visualizes the strength ratio w/wo (where w represents the initial strength) across diffusion steps t for two specific tasks: Ant and TF10.  It shows a pattern of initial decrease followed by an increase in w, indicating that initially, a lower weight (w) allows for more diverse sample generation and exploration. As the process proceeds, the strength increases, pulling the sampling towards the high-performance regions identified by the proxy. The different patterns for Ant and TF10 tasks showcase the variation in the sampling process dynamics for different problems.", "section": "4.5 Ablation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "93qSRpucpN/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: Proxy vs. diffusion distribution.", "description": "The figure compares the proxy distribution and the diffusion distribution, visualizing how the proxy distribution overestimates the ground truth while the diffusion distribution aligns more closely.

The goal is to guide initial points (pink) toward a high-performance region (yellow) by maximizing a negative Rosenbrock function.  Proxy-free diffusion (blue) struggles to reach this region due to a lack of explicit guidance.  Proxy-enhanced sampling (red), however, effectively guides the samples closer to and within the high-performance area by incorporating explicit guidance from a trained proxy.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
