See Appendix F.3 for details.", "description": "The figure illustrates the induction-head task, a sequence modeling task where the model must identify and copy a specific subsequence from the input sequence. The input sequence consists of a prefix, a copy token (c), a subsequence X (of length h), more tokens, another copy token (c), and a repeated subsequence X (but not the full length). The output sequence is the subsequence X, shifted to the end of the sequence.", "section": "F Implementation Details"}]
