Right: normalized error of function value versus number of iterations.", "description": "This figure displays the results of a simulation to validate the global optimality of the proposed proximal gradient algorithm (PGA). The left panel shows the normalized error of the iterative sequence (||v<sup>(k)</sup>-v*||<sub>2</sub>/||v*||<sub>2</sub>) against the iteration number. The right panel shows the normalized error of the function value (|f(v<sup>(k)</sup>)-f(v*)|/|f(v*)|) against the iteration number.  Both plots demonstrate the convergence of the PGA to the global optimum.", "section": "A.8 Validation of PGA's Global Optimality Through Simulation Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "p54CYwdjVP/figures/figures_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Final cumulative wealths of portfolio optimization methods w.r.t. transaction cost rate v on 6 benchmark data sets.", "description": "This figure shows the final cumulative wealths of eleven different portfolio optimization methods across six benchmark datasets (FF25, FF25EU, FF32, FF49, FF100, FF100MEINV) as the transaction cost rate (v) varies from 0% to 0.5%.  The methods compared include 1/N, SPOLC, SSPO, S1, S2, S3, SSMP, MAXER, IPSRM-D, PLCT, and the proposed mSSRM-PGA (with different sparsity levels m=10, 15, 20).  The graph illustrates how the cumulative wealth generated by each method changes with increasing transaction costs, allowing for a comparison of their robustness and performance under realistic market conditions.", "section": "4 Experimental results"}]
