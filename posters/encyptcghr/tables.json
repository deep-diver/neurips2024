Subfigures (a), (b), and (c) show convergence and gradient error, convergence analysis with varying gradient inexactness, and computation cost per gradient step with varying problem sizes, respectively.  The experiments were conducted using a toy example (Problem L.1) with specific parameter settings (dx=100, dy=200, const=dy/5, a=0.1).", "section": "6 Experiments"}]
