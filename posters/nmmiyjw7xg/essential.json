Newton methods are faster but computationally expensive due to dense Hessian matrices.  Sparsified Hessian-based methods improve speed but lack convergence guarantees and may encounter singularity issues.\nThis paper introduces the Safe and Sparse Newton method (SSNS) to overcome these challenges.  SSNS uses a novel Hessian sparsification scheme with guaranteed positive definiteness, leading to a robust and efficient algorithm.  The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, demonstrating global and quadratic local convergence, and offer a practical implementation without extensive hyperparameter tuning.  Numerical experiments showcase SSNS's effectiveness on large-scale OT problems.", "affiliation": "Shanghai University of Finance and Economics", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Nmmiyjw7Xg/podcast.wav"}
