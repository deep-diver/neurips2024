Existing UDA frameworks often rely on discrepancy measures based on f-divergence, but these can have limitations in theoretical guarantees and practical performance.  Prior works suffered from issues such as overestimating target error, failing to bridge theoretical gap, and achieving slow convergence rates. \nThis paper presents an enhanced UDA framework. It refines the f-divergence-based discrepancy and introduces a new measure, f-domain discrepancy (f-DD). By removing the absolute value function and adding a scaling parameter, f-DD achieves improved target error and sample complexity bounds. The authors utilize localization techniques to further refine convergence rates, resulting in superior empirical performance on UDA benchmarks.  The framework unifies previous KL-based results and demonstrates a clear link between theoretical analysis and algorithmic design.", "affiliation": "Tongji University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "xSU27DgWEr/podcast.wav"}
