{"importance": "This paper is crucial because it tackles the limitations of existing reinforcement learning algorithms in handling partially observable environments.  **By introducing periodic policies**, it offers a novel approach to enhance performance, **particularly in scenarios where the agent's internal state doesn't fully capture the environment's dynamics**. The findings provide a new direction for researchers and open up avenues for developing improved RL methods and a deeper understanding of non-stationary policies in real-world applications.", "summary": "PASQL, a novel periodic agent-state Q-learning algorithm, significantly improves reinforcement learning in partially observable environments by leveraging non-stationary periodic policies to overcome the Markov property limitation of agent states.", "takeaways": ["Periodic policies can outperform stationary policies in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), especially when the agent's state is not fully informative.", "PASQL, a new algorithm, is developed for learning periodic policies in POMDPs, and its convergence to a cyclic limit is rigorously established.", "The sub-optimality gap of periodic policies is quantified, providing insights for designing more efficient RL algorithms in POMDPs."], "tldr": "Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles in partially observable environments (POMDPs) due to the difficulty of modeling the belief state.  A common workaround is using an agent state that summarizes past observations and actions. However, traditional RL algorithms assume a stationary policy, which is suboptimal since agent states generally don't follow the Markov property. This is an important issue because many real-world scenarios are partially observable.  This paper addresses these challenges.\nThe proposed solution, PASQL (Periodic Agent-state based Q-learning), learns **periodic policies** instead of stationary ones.  This is theoretically justified by combining Markov chain theory with stochastic approximation.  PASQL is shown to converge to a periodic policy and its sub-optimality gap is analyzed.  Numerical experiments showcase PASQL's superior performance compared to standard agent-state based Q-learning in a non-trivial POMDP.
