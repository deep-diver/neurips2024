The optimal performance J*L for each period L is shown.  The performance was obtained by conducting a brute-force search over all deterministic periodic policies with a period up to 10 in a specific example POMDP. It highlights how the performance of periodic policies can outperform stationary policies in certain partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and illustrates the relationship between period length and performance.", "section": "Comparison of converged policies"}, {"figure_path": "HmMSBhMAw4/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Performance of converged periodic policies.", "description": "This table presents the performance of periodic policies obtained by using three different behavioral policies (\u00b51, \u00b52, \u00b53) in PASQL.
