These projections are compared with the input image and the one with the minimum error is used. (ii) An auto-decoding stage where pose parameters in axis-angle representation are stored for all images. The same volume decoder is used to obtain projections, and the reconstruction loss is computed for a single projection.", "description": "The figure illustrates the two-stage cryoSPIN architecture. Stage 1 (auto-encoding) uses a multi-head encoder to map an input image to multiple pose candidates.  Projections are generated from these poses using a Fourier volume decoder, and the best pose is selected based on minimum reconstruction error. Stage 2 (auto-decoding) refines the selected pose using stochastic gradient descent and direct pose optimization, focusing on a single projection to reduce computational cost.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "1MCseWaFZb/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Qualitative and quantitative comparison of reconstructions obtained by our proposed semi-amortized method, cryoSPIN, with cryoAI [10], cryoDRGN [7] and cryoSPARC [8].
