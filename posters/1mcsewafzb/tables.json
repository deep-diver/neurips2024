CryoSPIN demonstrates significantly lower errors than the other two methods across all datasets, indicating improved accuracy in pose estimation.", "section": "5.1 Results"}, {"figure_path": "1MCseWaFZb/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: The reconstruction time per epoch, GPU memory, and number of parameters for different methods averaged across three runs. GPU memory is recorded separately for the encoding and decoding modules. Also, two numbers provided for semi-amortized method corresponds to auto-encoding and auto-decoding stages, respectively. In CryoAI-explicit, the implicit decoder of CryoAI is replaced with an explicit one as in our method. Since we store rotations in 3D representation during direct optimization, the number of parameters of pose module is N \u00d7 3 with N denoting number of images in millions.", "description": "This table compares the computational efficiency of different methods for cryo-EM reconstruction.  It shows the time per epoch, GPU memory usage (broken down by encoding and decoding stages), and the number of parameters for four different models: Semi-Amortized (the proposed method, with results given for the two stages), Fully-Amortized, CryoAI-explicit (a variation of CryoAI), and CryoAI. The number of parameters for the pose module is explicitly linked to the number of images (N).", "section": "5.1 Results"}]
