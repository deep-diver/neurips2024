This paper shows that instead of directly transferring policies, transferring *exploratory* policies from simulation drastically improves real-world RL performance.", "takeaways": ["Transferring exploratory policies from simulation to real-world drastically improves RL performance.", "Naive sim2real transfer and naive exploration are provably inefficient for real-world RL.", "The proposed method offers provable efficiency gains in low-rank MDP settings."], "tldr": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise, but its high sample complexity makes real-world applications challenging.  A common approach is to train in a simulator, then transfer the policy to the real world (sim2real). However, this direct sim2real transfer often fails due to inconsistencies between simulated and real environments. This paper addresses this critical limitation.\nThis research introduces a novel approach: instead of directly transferring a policy that solves a task in simulation, it proposes transferring a set of *exploratory* policies trained in the simulator to guide exploration in the real world. Coupled with practical methods like least-squares regression and random exploration, this approach achieves provably efficient learning in the real world, significantly outperforming direct sim2real transfer and learning without a simulator.  Experiments on robotic simulators and a real-world robotic task validate the theoretical findings, showcasing significant practical improvements.", "affiliation": "University of California, Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "JjQl8hXJAS/podcast.wav"}
