The analysis covers popular adaptive algorithms like Adagrad, RMSProp, and AMSGrad, offering valuable insights for improving training in deep learning and related fields.", "takeaways": ["Proves convergence of biased adaptive SGD to critical points for non-convex smooth functions.", "Provides non-asymptotic convergence rates for Adagrad, RMSProp, and AMSGrad with biased gradients.", "Applies theoretical results to biased gradient scenarios in deep learning, including variational autoencoders, bilevel, and conditional stochastic optimization."], "tldr": "Many deep learning applications rely on adaptive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms, but existing theoretical analyses often assume unbiased gradient estimators\u2014an unrealistic assumption in several modern applications using Monte Carlo methods.  This creates a crucial gap in our theoretical understanding of these widely-used algorithms' behavior. The lack of theoretical guarantees for biased estimators limits the development of more robust and efficient deep learning models and hinders a more complete understanding of their behavior in real-world applications.\nThis paper fills this gap by providing a comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of adaptive SGD with biased gradients.  The researchers establish convergence to critical points for smooth non-convex functions under weak assumptions. Importantly, **they demonstrate that popular adaptive methods (Adagrad, RMSProp, AMSGrad) maintain similar convergence rates even with biased gradients**. The study provides non-asymptotic convergence rate bounds and illustrates the results through several applications with biased gradients, like variational autoencoders.  The research also gives insights into how to reduce bias by tuning hyperparameters, making it a significant contribution to both the theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning optimization.", "affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "TzxSrNJE0T/podcast.wav"}
