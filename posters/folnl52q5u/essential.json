Existing methods use intricate fusion modules, limiting performance. The inherent difficulty lies in insufficient downstream data to fully learn multi-modal feature interactions, especially with diverse textual input.  This leads to suboptimal performance and computational cost. \nSimVG tackles these issues by **decoupling visual-linguistic feature fusion** from downstream tasks.  It leverages pre-trained models and introduces object tokens for better integration. A dynamic weight-balance distillation method is incorporated to improve the simpler branch's representation. This unique approach significantly simplifies the architecture and achieves **faster inference speeds**.  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate SimVG's **superior performance and efficiency**, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "fOLNl52Q5U/podcast.wav"}
