This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently gathering human feedback using optimal designs, a methodology for computing optimal information-gathering policies, generalized to handle questions with multiple answers.  The current methods have limitations in their efficiency and effectiveness, especially when dealing with complex scenarios involving multiple choices and ranking tasks. \n\nThis research proposes novel algorithms called \"Dope\" that effectively address this challenge.  Dope uses optimal designs to select the most informative lists of items, thereby maximizing the information gained from each human interaction.  The algorithms are designed for both \"absolute\" (noisy reward for each item) and \"ranking\" (human-provided ranking of items) feedback models.  The paper provides theoretical guarantees on the performance of the algorithms and demonstrates their practical efficacy through experiments on question-answering problems, showcasing significant improvement in ranking loss compared to existing baselines.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cCGWj61Ael/podcast.wav"}
