Calibration data comprises images from multiple sources, namely, the Kvasir data set [Jha et al., 2020] and the ETIS-LaribPolypDB data set [Silva et al., 2014]. Both ARC and L-ARC achieve worst-case deterministic long-term risk control in terms of false negative rate (FNR). However, ARC does so by prioritizing Kvasir samples at the detriment of the Larib data source, for which the model has poor FNR performance. In contrast, L-ARC can yield uniformly satisfactory performance for both data subpopulations.", "description": "This figure shows the calibration of a tumor segmentation model using both ARC and L-ARC methods.
