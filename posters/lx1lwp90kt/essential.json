Highly expressive nonlinear models are hard to interpret, while simpler linear models lack the capacity to capture complex dynamics.  This creates a need for methods that can capture the nuances of neural activity without sacrificing interpretability. Recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) offer a compromise but suffer from artifacts such as oscillations near state boundaries and a lack of uncertainty estimates.\nThis paper introduces the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS), a new model which addresses these issues. **gpSLDS uses a Gaussian process (GP) to model the nonlinear dynamics, but incorporates a novel kernel function that ensures smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics**, similar to rSLDS. This approach retains interpretability while allowing for flexible and smooth dynamics. The model is fit using a modified learning objective that improves the estimation accuracy. Results on synthetic and real neural data show that gpSLDS outperforms rSLDS and other state-of-the-art models.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "LX1lwP90kt/podcast.wav"}
