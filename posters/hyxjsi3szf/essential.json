Existing solutions often suffer from high communication overhead, hindering scalability. This necessitates efficient protocols that minimize communication while maintaining near-optimal prediction accuracy. \nThis research introduces novel communication-efficient protocols that achieve near-optimal regret even against strong adversaries.  The protocols are validated both theoretically, with a conditional lower bound, and empirically, showcasing significant communication savings on real-world benchmarks (HPO-B). This contribution offers a practical and theoretically sound approach to solving the distributed experts problem, thereby enhancing the scalability and efficiency of online learning in large-scale systems.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "HyxjSi3SzF/podcast.wav"}
