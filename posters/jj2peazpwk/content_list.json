Weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation methods aim to provide reliable additional supervision with sparse annotations. Four paradigms have been successively proposed in recent years, i.e., perturbation consistency, contrastive learning, self-training, and similarity metric. Perturbation consistency methods are based on the assumption of perturbation invariance of network features, imposing diverse perturbations (such affine transforms with point jitter [59, 54], downsampling [56], masking [35], etc.) to construct pairs of point clouds. Several methods [31, 34] introduce contrastive learning in weak supervision to encourage the discriminability of hidden layer features. Additionally, pre-training methods [55, 17] with contrastive learning similarly demonstrate the ability to bias induction in the face of downstream semantic segmentation tasks with sparse annotations. Self-training methods generate reliable dynamic pseudo-labels based on previous stage predictions for subsequent training stages. Via CAMs [62], MPRM [51] and J2D3D [25] dynamically generate point-wise pseudo-labels from subcloud-level annotations and image-level annotations, respectively. Recently, REAL [24] integrate SAM [23] to self-training. Similarity metric methods measure the similarity between labeled and unlabeled points to propagate supervision information, in which the similarity is elaborated on low-level features [49, 52], network embedding [36, 18, 40] or category prototypes [58, 46].

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
