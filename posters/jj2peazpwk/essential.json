Existing methods rely on heuristic constraints, often neglecting the inherent distribution of network embeddings. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on how to mathematically characterize the feature space and enhance this intrinsic distribution under weak supervision.\nThe proposed Distribution Guidance Network (DGNet) uses a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions to guide the alignment of weakly supervised embeddings.  **DGNet comprises two branches: a weakly supervised learning branch and a distribution alignment branch**. Through an iterative optimization process, DGNet ensures that the network embeddings align with the defined latent space, leading to significant performance improvements over existing methods across various datasets and weakly supervised settings.  **This approach provides a mathematically sound foundation** for improving weakly supervised point cloud segmentation.
