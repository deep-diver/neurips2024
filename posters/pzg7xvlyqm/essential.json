Existing methods often face computational challenges, particularly with large datasets,  making private model selection difficult to achieve in practice.  The lack of efficient, private algorithms also limits the application of such methods in real-world scenarios. \nThis research presents a new differentially private best subset selection method using the exponential mechanism and an efficient Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  This approach not only offers strong statistical utility, ensuring accurate model identification, but also guarantees polynomial mixing time, overcoming the computational hurdles of earlier methods. The researchers rigorously prove the algorithm's approximate differential privacy and illustrate its effectiveness through simulated data experiments, demonstrating significant practical value in high-dimensional private model selection.", "affiliation": "University of Michigan", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "PzG7xVlYqm/podcast.wav"}
