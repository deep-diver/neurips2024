Existing methods often struggle with quality, consistency, and the ability to control the generation process.  They also lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how the models are created and why they look the way they do. These limitations hinder the application of these models in various fields. \nMIDGARD, a new framework, tackles these challenges by employing a modular approach. It separates the generation process into two stages: structure generation (defining the object's parts and joints) and shape generation (creating the 3D mesh for each part). This allows for better control and interpretability.  The use of diffusion models and a novel graph representation further enhances quality and consistency.  Experiments demonstrate MIDGARD's superiority over existing methods, showing improved quality, consistency, and controllability in generated assets, which are also fully simulatable.
