Existing methods often fall short in addressing these limitations.  This research introduces a novel Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding (HDSE) method to overcome this challenge.\n\nHDSE leverages graph hierarchy distances to effectively encode multi-level hierarchical structures within graphs.  The method is seamlessly integrated into the attention mechanism of existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous use with other positional encodings. **Extensive experiments demonstrate HDSE's superiority across multiple graph-level datasets, significantly improving performance compared to state-of-the-art models.**  Furthermore, a high-level HDSE adaptation effectively addresses scalability issues for large graphs.", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "U4KldRgoph/podcast.wav"}
