The GNN models we often use are GCN, GIN, PNA, etc; SNNs include LSTM, RNN, TCN, etc. Therefore, spatio-temporal graph learning models have been widely studied in recent years [50, 46, 45, 41, 43, 42]. Based on varying interpretations of the correlation between temporal and spatial information, the current works are undertaken along two research lines. One claim is to study temporal and spatial information in a decoupled manner, which is potentially present in most current works [3, 19, 61]. Due to the intricate temporal and spatial relationships in reality, they often fail to offer sufficient interpretability and generalizability. The other one argues that spatial context is influenced by the temporal information [65, 53]. These methods depict spatiotemporal scenes that align more closely with the complexities of the real world. Moreover, this also presents a feasible approach to tackle the distribution shift issue arising from the changes of temporal environment.

", "page_idx": 25}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
