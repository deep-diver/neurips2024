These models often fail to accurately infer and utilize environmental information, leading to poor performance on unseen data. This paper tackles this challenge by focusing on both environment inference and utilization. \nThe proposed model, Environment-prompted Dynamic Graph Learning (EpoD), uses a novel self-prompted learning mechanism to infer unseen environment factors. Instead of relying on predefined environment scales, it learns environment representations directly from the data.  EpoD also incorporates a structural causal model with dynamic subgraphs, which act as mediating variables. These subgraphs effectively capture the impact of environment shifts on data correlations. Extensive experiments show that EpoD outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling temporal OOD generalization.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Smart Cities"}, "podcast_path": "RJG8ar4wHA/podcast.wav"}
