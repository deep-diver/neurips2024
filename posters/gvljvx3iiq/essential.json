Existing methods often assume uniformity which is unrealistic in practical settings, where some clients may have complete data from all views while others only have partial views.  This heterogeneity leads to problems of model misalignment and biased clustering results. \nTo tackle these issues, the authors present FMCSC.  This new framework uses a combination of cross-client consensus pre-training, local-synergistic contrastive learning, and global-specific weighting aggregation. **Cross-client pre-training aligns local models**, addressing initial misalignment. **Local-synergistic contrastive learning bridges the gap between single and multi-view clients** by encouraging consistent feature learning. Finally, **global-specific weighting aggregation handles the view gap** by ensuring the global model appropriately weights information from different views.  Experimental results on various datasets show FMCSC outperforms current state-of-the-art FedMVC methods.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GVlJVX3iiq/podcast.wav"}
