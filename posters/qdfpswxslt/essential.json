This paper introduces Spec-Gaussian, a novel approach that leverages anisotropic spherical Gaussians (ASGs) instead of spherical harmonics to represent the view-dependent appearance of 3D Gaussians.  This allows for a more accurate representation of complex surface properties, leading to higher quality rendering. \nSpec-Gaussian also introduces a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve learning efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by overfitting in real-world scenes.  Experimental results demonstrate that Spec-Gaussian outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, especially for scenes with specular and anisotropic components. **The use of ASGs significantly improves 3D-GS's ability to model these complex visual effects without requiring a significant increase in the number of Gaussians**; This enhancement expands the applicability of 3D-GS to more intricate and realistic scenarios.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "qDfPSWXSLt/podcast.wav"}
