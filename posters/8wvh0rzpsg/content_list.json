To guarantee the construction of valid test statistics that accurately capture the distorted distribution resulting from the selection process, we leverage a holdout labeled set to closely emulate the selective distribution. Our approach involves adaptively picking labeled data to create a calibration set based on the stability of the selection rule.

Implementing with the famous Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, it effectively controls the FDR over the selected subset. To handle the randomness of the selected subset and the dependence among the constructed p-values, we establish a unified theoretical framework.

Building upon this work, selective conformal inference with FCR control has been further extended to accommodate more general selection rules [23, 28] or the online setting [4].

However, their approach focuses on selecting an informative set with FCR control under specific selection assumptions, limiting its applicability in more general scenarios such as those with data-dependent selection. The problem we tackle presents additional complexities, due to the intricate dependence on the selection procedure and final decision procedure, requiring a more intricate and delicate analysis.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
