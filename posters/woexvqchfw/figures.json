The Pareto Front represents the set of optimal solutions in a multi-objective optimization problem, where it's impossible to improve one objective without worsening another. The figure shows eight points (Pareto objectives) that uniformly cover the curved PF, with circles representing the distance each point covers (covering radius).  A small covering radius indicates that the set of points effectively represents the entire Pareto Front, which is desirable in multi-objective optimization.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "WoEXVQcHFw/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Result comparison on ZDT1.", "description": "The figure shows the result comparison on ZDT1 of eight different multi-objective optimization methods, including LMPFE, DEAGNG, Subset selection, SMS-EMOA, NSGA3, MOEA/D, MOEA/D-AWA, and UMOD.
