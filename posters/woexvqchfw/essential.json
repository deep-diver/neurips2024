Existing methods often lack formal definitions of representability and uniformity, hindering the generation of high-quality solution sets.  Furthermore, directly optimizing for minimal fill distance (a measure of solution representativeness) is computationally intractable. \nThis paper introduces UMOD, a novel method that addresses these issues. **UMOD uses a surrogate objective function, maximizing the minimal pairwise distances among solutions, which provides a good approximation of the optimal design that minimizes fill distance.** The method employs a bi-level optimization framework with neural network approximation for efficient computation. Extensive empirical results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that UMOD efficiently produces high-quality, representative solutions and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "WoEXVQcHFw/podcast.wav"}
