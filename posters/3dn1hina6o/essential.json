Model-based methods address this by creating synthetic data through model rollouts. However, a common practice of truncating rollouts to prevent error accumulation creates 'edge-of-reach' states, where value estimations are bootstrapped from the void, leading to value overestimation and performance collapse. This is the central problem that the paper addresses. \nThe paper introduces Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), a novel method directly tackling the edge-of-reach problem by identifying and preventing value overestimation in these critical states.  Unlike existing methods, RAVL maintains high performance even when given perfect dynamics models, making it more reliable and robust than previously proposed methods.  This is achieved by applying a simple value pessimism technique that mitigates the impact of edge-of-reach states.  The results demonstrate that RAVL significantly outperforms existing methods on standard offline RL benchmarks.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "3dn1hINA6o/podcast.wav"}
