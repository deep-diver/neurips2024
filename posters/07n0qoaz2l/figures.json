[{"figure_path": "07N0qoaZ2L/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experimental comparisons of our AOGS with ETGS, ML-ETC and Phased ETC in one-to-one decentralized markets with N = 3 players and K = 10 arms.", "description": "This figure shows the results of experiments comparing the performance of the proposed AOGS algorithm with three other algorithms (ETGS, ML-ETC, and PhasedETC) in decentralized one-to-one matching markets.  The experiment settings involved 3 players and 10 arms, and the results are averaged over 50 independent runs.  The figure consists of two sub-figures. Subfigure (a) plots the maximum cumulative player-optimal stable regret, showing how much reward each algorithm missed compared to the optimal stable matching.  Subfigure (b) plots the maximum cumulative player-optimal unstability, representing how frequently each algorithm failed to reach the player-optimal stable matching. The error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.", "section": "5 Experiments"}]
