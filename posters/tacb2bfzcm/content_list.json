The head module is tasked with converting the input low-resolution RGB image into a high-dimensional feature space. The FEA module, the key role in the whole architecture, is composed of multiple $(N)$ Swin Transformer layers (STLs). Each STL has two main objectives: (i) extracting image features and (ii) modeling similarities using a learnable projection space. The former focuses on capturing essential image features, while the latter employs window-based self-attention to facilitate spatially adaptive aggregation. Notably, similarity modeling optimizes a projection space to obtain pixel-wise correlations, which is achieved by projecting image features into the learnable projection space and calculating similarity scores.

Differing from the conventional similarity calculation paradigm (Matrix dot product $^+$ SoftMax), we incorporate the Cosine distance followed by a ReLU activation for similarity computation. Here, to assess the effectiveness of our choice, we train different models that utilize various combinations of distance metrics (Matrix dot and Cosine) and activation functions (SoftMax and ReLU). The results, as displayed in the left Fig. 6, indicate that our design (Cosine $^+$ ReLU) achieves the best performance among all the competing strategies.
