{"importance": "This paper is crucial because it tackles the challenge of efficiently selecting the best vision-language model for a given task, a problem faced by many researchers.  **The proposed method, SWAB, offers a novel approach to this problem, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of VLM selection.** This work is particularly timely due to the explosion of available pre-trained VLMs, making effective selection increasingly important.", "summary": "SWAB bridges modality and capability gaps in Vision-Language Model selection using optimal transport, enabling accurate prediction of VLM performance without images.", "takeaways": ["SWAB effectively addresses the 'Modality Gap' and 'Capability Gap' in Language-Only VLM Selection.", "Optimal transport is leveraged to transfer knowledge from open-source datasets, improving prediction accuracy.", "Experiments demonstrate SWAB's superior performance compared to existing methods."], "tldr": "Current methods for selecting vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with two main issues. First, the 'Modality Gap' makes it difficult to use text data alone to represent images. Second, the 'Capability Gap' makes it hard to predict a model's performance on a specific task based only on its general performance. This paper introduces SWAB, a new method that effectively addresses both issues. SWAB uses a technique called optimal transport to bridge the gap between text data and images. It also leverages open-source data to get a better understanding of each VLM's strengths and weaknesses. By bridging these gaps, SWAB accurately predicts which VLMs will perform best on a given task, even without access to actual images from the target dataset. This improves the efficiency and accuracy of VLM selection and allows researchers to easily find the best model for their needs.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "01qa1ZJs65/podcast.wav"}
