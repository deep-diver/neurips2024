These interactions cause changes in data distributions that learning models rely upon, a phenomenon called endogenous distribution shifts. This effect is particularly challenging to study in decentralized settings where each player only has a limited view of the overall system. This paper tackles the problem by introducing a novel framework which formulates this problem as a decentralized noncooperative game with coupled decision-dependent distributions. \nThe authors propose a novel decentralized algorithm to efficiently find the solution to the game, proving it converges to the solution at a sublinear rate.  They also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the proposed solution and upper bounds on the difference between two equilibrium concepts, providing useful insights on the game's dynamics. The simulation results on networked Cournot and ride-share market scenarios confirm the theoretical findings.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "KqgSzXbufw/podcast.wav"}
