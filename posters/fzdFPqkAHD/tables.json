ATS is the only method that builds a complete 4D reconstruction of both the agents and the environment. Different from prior work that focus on specific domains, ATS can be applied to capture interactive behavior of both animals and humans from casual RGBD videos (e.g. captured by a smartphone).", "description": "This table compares different methods for capturing and modeling behavior data, highlighting the unique aspects of Agent-to-Sim (ATS).  It shows that unlike other methods which rely on specific domains, manual annotation, or specialized sensors, ATS uses casual RGBD video and a novel 4D reconstruction technique to capture interactive behavior of both animals and humans.", "section": "2 Related Works"}, {"figure_path": "fzdFPqkAHD/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Evaluation of interactive behavior prediction. We separately evaluate goal, path, and full body motion prediction. Metrics are displacement errors (DE) in meters and the lower the better. FaF [33] is re-purposed and re-trained with our data.", "description": "This table presents the quantitative results of interactive behavior prediction using different methods.  It compares the proposed Agent-to-Sim (ATS) framework against two baseline methods: Location prior [76] and FaF [33].  The evaluation metrics are displacement errors (DE) and minimum displacement errors (minDE) for goal, path, and body motion prediction. Lower values indicate better performance.  Additional rows show ablation studies, removing components of the ATS model (observer, scene, egocentric representation) to analyze their individual contributions to performance.", "section": "4.2 Interactive Behavior Prediction"}]
