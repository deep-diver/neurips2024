These parameters model various aspects of noise commonly encountered in scRNA-seq data, including outlier genes, library size effects, and dropouts.  The values provided are used to generate realistic noise patterns in the simulated data for the experiments described in the paper.", "section": "B.2 Simulation Parameters"}, {"figure_path": "7AXY27kdNH/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Hyperparameters used for training in CAASL.", "description": "This table lists the hyperparameters used for training the Causal Amortized Active Structure Learning (CAASL) model.  It shows the hyperparameter search space explored and the final values selected for both synthetic and SERGIO (single-cell gene expression simulator) environments. The hyperparameters cover various aspects of the model architecture, including the number of attention layers and heads in the transformer, dropout rate, pooling strategies, hidden layer sizes, activation functions, REDQ/SAC training parameters (buffer size, learning rates, discount factor), and the number of Q-function networks and gradient updates.  The table facilitates understanding of the experimental setup and aids reproducibility.", "section": "D Training Details"}]
