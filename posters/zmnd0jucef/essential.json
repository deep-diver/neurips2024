Existing safety measures like alignment training and various defenses have proven vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where malicious prompts trick the model into generating harmful content.  Many existing attacks require many examples to successfully jailbreak the system, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. \nThis paper introduces improved few-shot jailbreaking techniques.  **By cleverly injecting special tokens and utilizing a demo-level random search, the researchers significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of few-shot attacks.**  This methodology achieves impressively high success rates against various LLMs, including those with advanced defenses, demonstrating the limitations of current safety measures and the urgent need for enhanced defense strategies.", "affiliation": "Sea AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "zMNd0JuceF/podcast.wav"}
