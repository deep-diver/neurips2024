As a result, there has been an increasing excitement in their potential to help humans solve a variety of open-ended, complex tasks across many application domains such as coding [2], healthcare [3] and scientific discovery [4], to name a few. However, evaluating and comparing the performance of different LLMs has become very challenging [5]. The main reason is that, in contrast to traditional machine learning models, LLMs can solve a large number of different tasks and, in many of these tasks, there is not a unique, structured solution. As a consequence, there has been a paradigm shift towards evaluating their performance according to their level of alignment with human preferences\u2014a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans [6\u201310].

Under this paradigm, each pairwise comparison comprises the outputs of two different models picked uniformly at random to an input sampled from a given distribution of inputs. Moreover, the pairwise comparisons are used to rank the models with a variety of methods such as the Elo rating [18\u201322], the Bradley-Terry model [10, 17, 23] or the win-rate [12, 17, 23]. While it is widely agreed that, given a sufficiently large set of pairwise comparisons, higher (lower) ranking under this paradigm corresponds to better (worse) human alignment, there have also been increasing concerns that this paradigm is too costly and timeconsuming to be practical, especially given the pace at which models are updated and new models are developed.

The rationale is that, if a model strongly aligns with human preferences, then, the distributions of pairwise comparisons by the model and by the human should in principle match [24, 27, 34]. Worryingly, there are multiple lines of evidence, including our experimental findings in Figure 3, showing that the rankings constructed using pairwise comparisons made by a strong LLM are sometimes different to those constructed using pairwise comparisons by humans [12, 14\u201316, 19, 35, 36], questioning the rationale above. In this work, we introduce a statistical framework to measure the uncertainty in the rankings constructed using pairwise comparisons made by a model, which may be introduced by a mismatch between human and model preferences or by the fact that we use a finite number of pairwise comparisons. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our contributions. Our framework measures uncertainty using rank-sets\u2014sets of possible ranking positions that each model can take. If the rank-set of a model is large (small), it means that there is high (low) uncertainty in the ranking position of the model. To construct the rank-sets, our framework first leverages a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a strong LLM to create a confidence ellipsoid. By using prediction-powered inference [37\u201339], this confidence ellipsoid is guaranteed to contain the vector of (true) probabilities that each model is preferred over others by humans\u2014the win-rates\u2014with a user-specified coverage probability $1-\\alpha$ . Then, it uses the distance between this ellipsoid and the hyperplanes under which pairs of models have the same probability values of being preferred over others to efficiently construct the rank-sets. Importantly, we can show that, with probability greater than or equal to $1\\mathrm{~-~}\\alpha$ , the constructed rank-sets are guaranteed to cover the ranking consistent with the (true) probability that each model is preferred over others by humans asymptotically. Moreover, our framework does not make any assumptions on the distribution of human preferences nor about the degree of alignment between pairwise preferences of humans and the strong LLM. Experiments on pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform [28] and pairwise comparisons made by three strong LLMs, namely GPT 3.5, Claude 3 and GPT 4, empirically demonstrate that the rank-sets constructed using our framework are more likely to cover the true ranking consistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences than the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons made by the strong LLMs. An open-source implementation of our methodology as well as the data on pairwise preferences of strong LLMs used in our experiments are available at https://github.com/Networks-Learning/prediction-powered-ranking.

However, our work is the first to use prediction-powered inference (as a subroutine) to construct rank-sets with coverage guarantees. In this context, it is worth acknowledging that a very recent work by Saad-Falcon et al. [40] has used prediction-powered inference to construct (single) rankings, rather than rank-sets. However, their rankings do not enjoy coverage guarantees with respect to the true ranking consistent with (the distribution of) the human preferences. Moreover, an independent, concurrent work by Boyeau et al. [23] has also used prediction-powered inference to construct (single) rankings based on the estimated coefficients of a Bradley-Terry model. However, the estimated coefficients come with large, overlapping confidence intervals, which would have led to uninformative rank-sets, had the authors used them to construct rank-sets.

Only recently, a paucity of work has focused on joint measures of uncertainty for rankings [48\u201351]. Similarly as in our work, this line of work also seeks to construct rank-sets with coverage guarantees. However, in contrast to our work, it estimates the quality metric (in our work, the probability that an LLM is preferred over others) and the confidence intervals separately for each of the items (in our work, LLMs) using independent samples. As a consequence, it needs to perform multiple comparison correction to create the rank-sets. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "In recent years, there has also been a flurry of work on ranking LLMs using benchmark datasets with manually hand-crafted inputs and ground-truth outputs [52\u201358].

Within the literature on ranking LLMs from pairwise comparisons, most studies use the Elo rating system [18\u201322], originally introduced for chess tournaments [59]. However, Elo-based rankings are sensitive to the order of pairwise comparisons, as newer comparisons have more weight than older ones, which leads to unstable rankings [15]. To address this limitation, several studies have instead used the Bradley-Terry model [10, 17, 23], which weighs pairwise comparisons equally regardless of their order. Nevertheless, both the Elo rating system and the Bradley-Terry model have faced criticism, as pairwise comparisons often fail to satisfy the fundamental axiom of transitivity, upon which both approaches rely [15, 60], Recently, several studies have used the win-rate [12, 17, 23], which weighs comparisons equally regardless of their order and does not require the transitivity assumption, but requires humans to make pairwise comparisons between every pair of models. In our work, we build upon the win-rate and lift the above requirement by using pairwise comparisons made by a strong LLM.

Then, we gather pairwise comparisons made by three strong LLMs, namely GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 (GPT3.5), GPT-4-0125-preview (GPT4) and Claude-3-Opus-20240229 (CL3), about all the (pre-processed) instances from the Chatbot Arena dataset.
