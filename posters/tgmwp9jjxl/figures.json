It starts with choosing a molecular system, running biased simulations with suboptimal collective variables, characterizing the system using descriptors, learning a representation using those descriptors, regressing the infinitesimal generator using the learned representation, and finally computing its eigenpairs to obtain timescales and identify metastable states. The key steps are highlighted with blocks, with arrows indicating the flow.
