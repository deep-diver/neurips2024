[{"figure_path": "iChQIJtjHB/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of S-SOS and MCPO solution extraction accuracy. We present the Mahalanobis distance \u03b4M (Equation (8)) of the the true sensor positions X* to the extracted distribution N(E[x], Var[x]) over solutions recovered from S-SOS for varying SNL problem types. l is the spatial dimension, r is the sensing radius used to cutoff terms in the potential f(x, w), e is the noise scale, NH is the number of hard equality constraints used (sensors fixed at known locations), Nc is the number of clusters used (see Appendix A.7.4), and N is the number of sensors used. Each SNL problem instance has K = l + 1 anchors used in the potential (if NH = 0). The MCPO values are estimated with T = 50 Monte Carlo iterates. Each entry is \u00fb \u00b1 \u00f4 where \u00fb is the median and robust standard-deviation (034%) estimated over 20 runs of the same problem type with varying random initializations of the sensor positions. The entries with the lowest median & are bolded. We also compare the number of elements in the full basis af, the cluster basis ac, and the reduction multiple when using the cluster basis af/ac. When passing to the cluster basis, af/ac is how much the semidefinite matrix shrinks by.", "description": "This table compares the performance of the S-SOS and MCPO methods on sensor network localization problems with varying parameters.  The Mahalanobis distance is used to measure the accuracy of sensor position recovery. The table shows that S-SOS generally outperforms MCPO, especially for larger problems.", "section": "3.2 Results"}]
