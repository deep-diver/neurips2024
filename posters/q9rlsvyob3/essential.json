Existing methods struggle with the flexible constraints of 3D ICs and often rely on heuristics, limiting their effectiveness and solution space.  Furthermore, accurately aligning cross-die modules is vital but difficult to achieve with current techniques, leading to potential data transfer issues. \nFlexPlanner tackles these problems by employing deep reinforcement learning. It uses a novel hybrid action space and multi-modality representation (vision, graph, and sequence) to directly optimize the position, aspect ratio, and alignment of blocks simultaneously.  The results on public benchmarks show that FlexPlanner significantly improves alignment scores and reduces wirelength compared to state-of-the-art methods.  Importantly, it also exhibits zero-shot transferability, effectively handling unseen circuit designs without retraining. This flexibility and performance improvement demonstrate a significant advancement in 3D floorplanning.", "affiliation": "Dept. of CSE & School of AI & MoE Key Lab of AI, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "q9RLsvYOB3/podcast.wav"}
