The 'dual' loss function often has a piecewise-decomposable structure \u2013 well-behaved except for sharp transitions \u2013 making efficient learning difficult.  Prior work primarily focused on sample efficiency, leaving computational efficiency largely unaddressed.\nThis paper tackles the computational efficiency challenge by proposing output-sensitive techniques.  It uses computational geometry to efficiently enumerate pieces of the dual loss function, drastically reducing computation compared to worst-case bounds. This approach, combined with execution graphs visualizing algorithm states, leads to significant speedups in learning algorithm parameters for clustering, sequence alignment, and pricing problems, demonstrating the practical benefits of output-sensitive ERM.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "yW3tlSwusb/podcast.wav"}
