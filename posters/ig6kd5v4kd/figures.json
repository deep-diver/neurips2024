Two subfigures are presented, one for ReLU experts and one for linear experts.  Each subfigure displays the Voronoi loss (y-axis) plotted against the sample size (x-axis) on a log-log scale.  Sigmoid gating shows faster convergence to zero loss for both ReLU and linear expert types, indicating higher sample efficiency compared to softmax gating.", "section": "4 Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "IG6kd5V4kd/figures/figures_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Logarithmic plots of empirical convergence rates. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate the empirical averages of the corresponding Voronoi losses under the Regime 1 and the Regime 2, respectively.
