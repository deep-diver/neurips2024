Despite its widespread use in practice, the softmax gating may lead to unnecessary competition among experts, potentially causing the undesirable phenomenon of representation collapse due to its inherent structure. In response, the sigmoid gating function has been recently proposed as an alternative and has been demonstrated empirically to achieve superior performance. However, a rigorous examination of the sigmoid gating function is lacking in current literature. In this paper, we verify theoretically that the sigmoid gating, in fact, enjoys a higher sample efficiency than the softmax gating for the statistical task of expert estimation. Towards that goal, we consider a regression framework in which the unknown regression function is modeled as a mixture of experts, and study the rates of convergence of the least squares estimator under the over-specified case in which the number of fitted experts is larger than the true value. We show that two gating regimes naturally arise and, in each of them, we formulate an identifiability condition for the expert functions and derive the corresponding convergence rates. In both cases, we find that experts formulated as feed-forward networks with commonly used activation such as ReLU and GELU enjoy faster convergence rates under the sigmoid gating than those under softmax gating. Furthermore, given the same choice of experts, we demonstrate that the sigmoid gating function requires a smaller sample size than its softmax counterpart to attain the same error of expert estimation and, therefore, is more sample efficient.

In particular, it aggregates multiple sub-models called experts based on a gating network. Here, experts can be formulated as neural networks, and they specialize in different aspects of the data. For instance, in large language models [16, 31, 19, 40, 7, 5, 30], one expert might focus on syntax, another on semantics, whereas the others concentrate on context. Meanwhile, the gating network takes the input data and calculates a set of weights that determine the contribution of each expert. This gating mechanism guarantees that the most relevant experts are assigned more weight for a given input. In addition to language modeling, MoE has also been leveraged in several other applications, including computer vision [32, 20, 33], multi-task learning [12, 10], multi-modal learning [11], speech recognition [38, 9, 29] and reinforcement learning [3, 28]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the above applications of MoE, practitioners frequently utilize the softmax gating function to compute the mixture weights. However, the use of softmax function might introduce an unexpected competition among experts, which leads to the representation collapse issue [2, 30, 18, 24]: when the weight of one expert increases, those of the others decrease accordingly. As a consequence, some experts will dominate the decision-making process, and overshadow the contributions of others. Therefore, the ability of MoE models to incorporate the diversity of expert specialization is partially limited. To this end, Csord\u00e1s et al. [4] propose using the sigmoid function in place of the softmax to remove the unnecessary expert competition, and empirically demonstrate that it is indeed a better choice of gating function. On the other hand, the theoretical guarantee for that claim has remained missing in the literature. The main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the sigmoid gating function from the perspective of the expert estimation problem. In particular, we will show that sigmoid gating delivers superior sample efficiency for estimating the model parameters and allows for more general expert functions than softmax gating. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Related works. A very recent line of research has focused on analyzing the convergence rates for expert estimation in Gaussian MoE models under a variety of assumptions and choices of gating functions. Assuming that data from an input-free gating Gaussian MoE, Ho et al. [14] demonstrated that the expert estimation rates for the maximum likelihood estimator vary with the algebraic independence among expert functions. Under the same setting but using instead softmax gating, Nguyen et al. [27] discovered that the expert estimation rates depend on the solvability of a system of polynomial equations resulting from an intrinsic interaction among gating and expert parameters. Subsequently, a Gaussian MoE with Top-K sparse softmax gate, designed to activate only a fraction of experts per input, was studied in [25]. The convergence analysis in that work revealed that activating exactly one expert for each input would eliminate the previous parameter interaction, thus boosting the expert estimation rates. Despite many important insights provided in this line of works, the mixture setting of Gaussian MoE is still far from practical. To that effect, Nguyen et al. [26] introduced a more realistic regression framework in which, conditionally on the features, the response variables are sampled from noisy realization of an unknown and deterministic softmax gating MoE-type regression function. They found that experts formulated as feed-forward networks with sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent activation functions enjoy faster estimation rates than those equipped with a polynomial activation. In this paper, we adopt the same regression setting and carry out an analogous analysis by considering instead sigmoid gating for the underlying regression function, as opposed to the more popular softmax gating considered in [26]. As we will see, the choice of gating function turns out to be critical, requiring a different type of analysis and leading to markedly different conclusions.

", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "(I.2) The sigmoid gate is compatible with a broader class of experts than the softmax gate. It follows from the expert characterization for Regime 1 (resp. Regime 2) in Definition 1 (resp. Definition 2) that formulating expert functions as feed-forward networks [36] with commonly used activation functions such as ReLU and GELU or even a polynomial activation will lead to faster expert estimation rates, and thus, require a smaller sample size to reach the same tolerance of estimating experts compared to the softmax gate. Thus, our theories indicate that the sigmoid gating is compatible with a broader class of experts than the softmax gating. This implication is particularly useful when people employ a mixture of fine-grained (shallow) expert networks [13]. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations and future directions. There are two main limitations of our current analysis: ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "1. We assume implicitly that the ground-truth parameters are independent of the sample size. Therefore, the expert estimation rates established in the paper are point-wise rather than the desirable uniform rates. A potential approach to cope with this problem is using the techniques for deriving the uniform parameter estimation rates in mixture models [6] and in MoE models [37]. However, those techniques are only valid for input-independent gating MoE, and we believe that further technical tools should be developed to adapt such framework to the sigmoid gating MoE. Thus, we leave it for future development. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "2. The assumption that the true regression function belongs to the parametric class of MoE models under sigmoid gating is, of course, quite restrictive, and likely to be violated in real-world settings. This issue can be alleviated by assuming the data are sampled from a regression framework with an arbitrary regression function $g$ , which is not necessarily formulated as a mixture of experts. Under that setting, the least squares estimatorGn converges toG \u2208arg minG\u2208Gk(\u0398) \u2225fG \u2212g\u2225L2(\u00b5). Nevertheless, it requires the comprehensive k n owledge of the  u niversal approximation power of the sigmoid function, which has been slightly explored in [1], to determine the expert estimation rate. Therefore, we leave this potential direction for future work.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
