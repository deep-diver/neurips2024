First, grounding is not simply one-to-one between objects and classes, but a many-to-many mapping between objects and phrases [20, 34].

For example, in a cooking scenario, an agent must recognize multiple ingredients and tools simultaneously to be effective. We also present a case study on autonomous driving (see Figure ?? and Figure ?? in the appendix), demonstrating how common associations between cars, pedestrians and traffic lights could lead to potential hallucinations.

This observation allows prompting LVLMs by editing images directly in the pixel space, e.g., by adding visual marks or visual text [27]. Starting from Set-of-Marks (SoM) prompting [58], several training-free methods have been introduced [24, 59, 52]. Recent work further enhances visual prompt understanding by additional visual instruction tuning with diverse visual prompts overlaid on the images [6], or explicitly represent visual pointer tokens in the models [21, 63, 71].

To quantify progress on mitigating them, various benchmarks have been developed and have revealed the prevalence of object hallucination, even in images that are seen during instruction tuning [68, 29].

[75] have shown that object hallucinations are more likely when the decoded object tokens have a higher log perplexity. In our work, we define object token entropy as the entropy of the logits of the first token in the generated word. Given s as the softmax logits of the generated word\u2019s first token, we calculate the entropy using the following formula: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\tilde{H(\\mathbf{s})}=-\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\log(\\mathbf{s}_{i})}\\end{array}$ . Simply put, higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty in the model\u2019s prediction for the first token, which can lead to more frequent object hallucinations. \u2022 Visual Modality Contribution: We hypothesize that LVLMs pay less attention to the visual modality during object hallucinations. Motivated by the modality importance score [7], we define Visual Modality Contribution (VMC) as the proportion of attention allocated to visual tokens compared to textual tokens. To quantify this, we analyze the attention weights of the last generated token across all heads and layers. The VMC is computed as follows: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\nabla\\bar{\\bf M}\\mathbf{C}=\\sum_{i\\in V\\alpha_{i j}}\\bar{\\big/}\\big(\\sum_{i\\in V}\\alpha_{i j}+}\\end{array}$ $\\textstyle\\sum_{k\\in T}\\alpha_{k j})$ , where $\\alpha_{i j}$ represents the attention weight assigned to visual token $i$ at head $j$ , and $\\alpha_{k j}$ represents the attention weight assigned to textual token $k$ at head $j$ . The sets $V$ and $T$ denote the visual and textual tokens, respectively. By examining the VMC, we can determine how much attention is given to visual inputs in comparison to textual inputs. A lower VMC may indicate a higher likelihood of object hallucinations due to insufficient attention to visual cues.

We observed that specific data factors, such as query and object homogeneity, significantly influence model performance, with increased hallucination occurring when models process images featuring multiple object classes or a variety of objects. For positional factors, the position of object tokens seems to have minimal impact and the object centrality has only a slight influence as LVLMs tend to hallucinate objects more frequently when they are positioned away from the center. This tendency may stem from a reporting bias, as objects mentioned in captions are typically foreground objects that distribute toward the centers of images.

We note that semantic salience significantly affects the model\u2019s performance, as it is more prone to hallucinate an object class that is less salient within the image.

This implies that LVLMs may rely more on the presence of co-occurring objects of the same class to predict the labels of queried objects, rather than solely on the presence or salience of the objects themselves. Additionally, training salience plays a crucial role as models are less likely to hallucinate object classes that frequently appear in training.

Our analysis also shows that models are more likely to hallucinate object classes that are prevalent in the training data, but the reverse is not necessarily true.

In this study, we study the problem of multi-object hallucination, examining how LVLMs may misperceive when tasked to focus on multiple objects concurrently, and which factors cause the hallucinations. we introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol designed to account for the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and to use visual referring prompts to reduce ambiguity. Our research provides key insights for the development and application of LVLMs. Since models tend to experience more hallucinations with multiple objects than with single ones, it may be advantageous to probe objects individually in visual prompts to enhance performance. The likelihood of a model\u2019s hallucinatory output is linked to various data factors and model behaviors. Particularly in situations involving heterogeneous data and low certainty from the model, there is an increased risk of hallucinations, and users should be vigilant. Moreover, our analysis indicates that merely adopting (grounded) instruction tuning and scaling the base language model may not be enough to fully address the issue of object hallucination. There is a need for more balanced object distributions, annotations of objects away from image centers, and an increase in diversity. Introducing instructions that require multiple visual pointers and complex multi-object reasoning is also crucial.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
