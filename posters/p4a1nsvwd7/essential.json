These limitations hinder their application to large-scale datasets and noisy data, necessitating improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. \nThe proposed Scalable TMSC framework with Triple Information Enhancement (STONE) tackles these issues.  It uses an enhanced anchor dictionary learning mechanism to reduce complexity and improve robustness. Further, it incorporates an anchor hypergraph Laplacian regularizer to accurately capture data geometry and employs an improved hyperbolic tangent function to precisely approximate tensor rank, effectively distinguishing significant variations in singular values.  Extensive experiments demonstrate STONE's superior performance in both effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Hebei Normal University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Clustering"}, "podcast_path": "p4a1nSvwD7/podcast.wav"}
