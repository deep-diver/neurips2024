In practical scenarios, objects are frequently characterized by a multitude of properties or data originating from various sources [6\u20139]. For instance, in medical analysis, imaging data from modalities such as X-ray, CT, and MRI play a crucial role in diagnosis and disease monitoring. These diverse features, representing various aspects of the same object, collectively constitute multi-view data. Multi-view clustering (MVC), which endeavors to harness the abundant information inherent in multi-view data to enhance the quality of clustering, has emerged as a highly esteemed research avenue [10\u201312]. Existing MVC methods can be broadly categorized into four groups based on the underlying learning mechanisms: matrix factorization-based approaches [13\u201315], subspace-based approaches [16\u201318], graph-based approaches [19\u201321], and kernel-based approaches [22\u201324]. Among these, subspace approaches are highly regarded for their straightforward implementation and excellent results. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Multi-view subspace clustering is oriented towards the incorporation of diverse constraints within subspace representations to acquire a consensus one that is conducive to clustering [25\u201331]. For instance, Cao et al. [26] and Li et al. [30] proposed the utilization of the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion as a dependency measure, aiming to capture diversity and consistency from multi-view data, respectively. Pan and Kang [28] integrated a contrastive loss regularization into the consensus subspace representation, encouraging the proximity of similar samples and the separation of dissimilar ones. In addition, Huang et al. [32] facilitated the extraction of valuable consensus representation by assuming cross-view sparsity of inconsistent components in multi-view data. Nevertheless, these methods are confined to investigating only the linear affinity relationships between data pairs within individual views and do not capitalize on the higher-order correlations among data points across multiple views. This limitation results in suboptimal clustering performance. As a result, tensor-based multi-view subspace clustering methods (TMSC) have remained the focus of sustained attention in recent years. Typically, these TMSC methods consolidate various subspace representations into a 3D tensor, subsequently applying global structural constraints to uncover the complex, nonlinear relationships among data points across different views [33\u201339]. For example, Xie et al. [34] advanced cross view consistency exploration by employing Tensor Nuclear Norm (TNN) on the rotated tensor. Jia et al. [36] characterized the intra-view and inter-view relationships of data points by applying symmetric low-rank constraints to the frontal slices and structured sparse low-rank constraints to the horizontal slices. Furthermore, Guo et al. [38] and Sun et al. [39] introduced the logarithmic Schatten- $\\cdot p$ norm and the arctan rank norm as compact surrogates for tensor rank, aimed at capturing distinctive information from tensor singular values.

First, many existing methods exhibit quadratic or even cubic time and space complexities, which restricts their scalability for large-scale datasets. Second, previous techniques have utilized the given feature matrix as the dictionary for subspace recovery. However, this method requires that the feature representations to include a sufficient number of uncontaminated sampled points; otherwise, the resulting subspace representation may not accurately capture the affinity relationships among the data points. Third, traditional approaches often emphasize the low-rank structure of tensor representations to investigate high-order nonlinear correlations among data points across various views, while frequently neglecting the intricate local geometric correlations within individual view. Finally, many methods impose equal penalties on the singular values of tensor data, which may lead to excessive penalization of larger singular values while under-penalizing smaller ones, resulting in suboptimal tensor representations. This issue arises from the differing significance of singular values in tensor data, where larger singular values indicate valuable features and smaller ones are often associated with noise.

For instance, unlike MVSC-TLRR, $\\mathrm{TLS}_{p}\\mathrm{NM}$ -MSC, SSG-TAR and NOODLE, our STONE model differs by enhancing computational efficiency through the construction of anchor subspace representations rather than relying on traditional subspace representations. Moreover, unlike the ASR-ETR, which lowers computational complexity through anchor dictionary representation, our STONE model builds on this by using the EAD strategy to address challenges related to insufficient data sampling. Additionally, STONE employs anchor hypergraph Laplacian regularization rather than anchor Laplacian regularization in ASR-ETR, which further enhances the accuracy of subspace representations. In contrast to the EDISON, designed for incomplete multi-view data, our approach not only has differences in dictionary representations due to variations in data completeness, but also employs distinct non-convex functions to regularize the singular values of tensor data during the recovery of compact tensor representations.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
