It compares the convergence rates under local and central label DP models, considering both bounded and unbounded label noise. The table also includes the non-private baseline rates for comparison, showing the impact of label DP on sample complexity and convergence rate. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 represent smoothness and margin conditions, respectively.", "section": "Classification"}]
