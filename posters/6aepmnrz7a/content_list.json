In addition, current implementations of SNNs typically consider the firing rate or average membrane potential of the last layer as the output, lacking exploration of other possibilities. In this paper, we identify that the limited spike patterns of spiking neurons stem from the initial membrane potential (IMP), which is set to 0. By adjusting the IMP, the spiking neurons can generate additional firing patterns and pattern mappings. Furthermore, we find that in static tasks, the accuracy of SNNs at each time step increases as the membrane potential evolves from zero. This observation inspires us to propose a learnable IMP, which can accelerate the evolution of membrane potential and enables higher performance within a limited number of time steps.

However, as we all known, its high training and inference costs have become a major obstacle to restrict its further widespread applications. To overcome these challenges, a new generation of neural network architectures named Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) [6] have been developed, which may be a feasible path to refer to the efficient dynamics mechanism of biological nervous systems [7]. SNNs leverage the dynamic mechanisms of membrane potential integration and fire from biological neural networks, which can process time-varying input data by using a single model [8] as biological neurons, maintaining linearly increasing computational complexity. Therefore, the advantages of energy efficiency and biologically plausible dynamical mechanisms [7, 9, 10] make them a bridge between the fields of brain science and artificial intelligence, which is widely regarded as the next generation of ANNs [6]. In addition, it is worth mentioning that SNNs can cleverly avoid multiplication operations on neuromorphic chips [11, 12, 13] by spike-based computing, achieving synaptic computation and membrane potential accumulation solely through addition operations, which can significantly enhance their computational efficiency.

The conversion method of ANNs to SNNs (ANN2SNN) [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] has proved to be an effective approach for obtaining high-performance SNNs. However, these methods mainly incorporate knowledge from the ANN\u2019s learning of static inputs into the converted SNNs, which motivates us to concern about the biological plausibility of these SNNs as they do not require the acquisition of spatiotemporal information. Another alternative is to leverage surrogate gradient [19, 20, 21] and backpropagation [22] through time to train high-performing SNNs. This method only requires four time steps to achieve an accuracy surpassing that of conversion methods requiring hundreds of time steps, making it the most promising training approach for currently available energy-efficient SNNs. Therefore, due to the development of direct training methods, SNNs have been extended to various tasks, including image classification[23, 24, 25], image reconstruction [26, 27, 28], object detection [29], natural language processing [30, 31], etc, and have demonstrated significant energy efficiency advantages in these fields.

Furthermore, we find that in static tasks, the variation of the output accuracy at each time step for SNNs is directly related to the membrane potential, as it is the only time-varying term. Then we can explain why the convergence speed of temporal efficient training (TET) [34] in static tasks is significantly lower than standard direct training (SDT) [20]. To address this problem, we propose a method called last time steps (LTS) to achieve faster convergence in static tasks.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
