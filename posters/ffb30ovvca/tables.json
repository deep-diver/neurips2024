Both models generate images at a resolution of 2048x2048 pixels.  The comparison uses four metrics: FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), KID (Kernel Inception Distance), IS (Inception Score), and CLIP score.  Lower FID and KID scores indicate better image quality. Higher IS and CLIP scores indicate better image quality. The results show that Pixelsmith outperforms the super-resolution model on all metrics, even without any fine-tuning (zero-shot).", "section": "5.2 Comparison"}]
