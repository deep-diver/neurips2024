This limitation hinders accurate dimension reduction in applications dealing with complex data like graph networks or those arising from physics models, where non-Euclidean geometries are common.  Previous attempts to improve upon classical MDS haven't fully addressed these core issues, resulting in suboptimal solutions and a 'dimensionality paradox' where increasing dimensions can worsen results.\nThis research introduces Non-Euclidean MDS (Neuc-MDS), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations.  Neuc-MDS cleverly generalizes the inner product to symmetric bilinear forms, effectively utilizing both positive and negative eigenvalues of the dissimilarity Gram matrix.  Through rigorous error analysis and optimal algorithms, Neuc-MDS significantly reduces STRESS (sum of squared error) and avoids the dimensionality paradox. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements over classical MDS and other state-of-the-art techniques.", "affiliation": "Rutgers University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Dimensionality Reduction"}, "podcast_path": "8W5ADJOKcv/podcast.wav"}
