It visually demonstrates how different scaling bounds affect the range of values each coefficient can capture and highlights the advantages of the proposed Rearrangement Correlation (r#), which expands the capture range beyond linear relationships to include arbitrary monotone relationships. The figure also shows that the Rearrangement Correlation reverts to Pearson's r in the case of linear dependence.", "section": "2.4 The proposed Rearrangement Correlation"}, {"figure_path": "8Dkz60yGfj/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Covariance inequality series, correlation coefficients and their capture ranges", "description": "This figure illustrates the relationships between different correlation coefficients and their respective capture ranges.  It shows how the choice of scaling bounds for the covariance (denominator in the correlation formula) affects the range of values the coefficient can capture.  The figure demonstrates that looser bounds lead to narrower capture ranges (only capturing linear or additive relationships, or identical relationships), while tighter bounds expand the range (to include nonlinear monotone relationships). The figure highlights the relationships between the classic Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, looser bounds used in other correlation coefficients (such as r+ and r=), and the new, tighter bound introduced in the paper which is used to define the Rearrangement Correlation (r#).", "section": "2.4 The proposed Rearrangement Correlation"}, {"figure_path": "8Dkz60yGfj/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Performance of Different Measures in 5 Real-life Scenarios", "description": "This figure compares the performance of nine different dependence measures (Pearson's r, Spearman's \u03c1, Kendall's \u03c4, dHSIC, dCor, MIC, Chatterjee's \u03be, r+, and r#) across five real-life datasets.  For each dataset, the measures' values are plotted as bars, with error bars representing the variability. The true dependence strength (R), verified by NIST, is indicated above each dataset.
