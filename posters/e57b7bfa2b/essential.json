Existing transformer-based diffusion models suffer from high computational costs and limitations in handling varying resolutions and aspect ratios.  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer a more efficient alternative, but their ability to handle diverse resolutions needs improvement. \nThis paper introduces FlowDCN, a purely convolutional generative model designed for fast and efficient image generation at arbitrary resolutions.  FlowDCN utilizes a novel group-wise multiscale deformable convolution block to enhance flexibility and resolution handling capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that FlowDCN achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming transformer-based methods in both speed and visual quality. Furthermore, FlowDCN shows comparable performance in handling unseen resolutions.  **The work provides a promising solution for scalable and flexible image synthesis**.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "e57B7BfA2B/podcast.wav"}
