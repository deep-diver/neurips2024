This often forces downsampling of input images, leading to accuracy loss.  The existing hardware optimizations in these accelerators, while improving performance, also cause underutilization of processors and memory, especially in the initial layers.\n\nThe paper introduces Data Channel Extension (DEX), a novel approach addressing these issues. DEX leverages underutilized processors and memory to extend the input channels by incorporating additional spatial information.  **DEX utilizes a two-step process: patch-wise even sampling to capture diverse pixel information from the original image and channel-wise stacking to extend this information across channels.**  Experimental results on multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DEX improves average accuracy by 3.5 percentage points without increasing latency, showcasing its efficiency and practicality.", "affiliation": "Nokia Bell Labs", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "ftqjwZQz10/podcast.wav"}
