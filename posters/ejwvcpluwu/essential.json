Existing explanation methods primarily focus on classification tasks, leaving a significant gap for understanding GNN behaviors in regression.  This research highlights the challenges posed by distribution shifts, which occur when applying models trained on the full graph to explain sub-graphs, and continuously ordered decision boundaries in regression. These issues hinder the application of existing explanation methods designed for classification to the regression setting. \nTo address these challenges, the authors propose RegExplainer, a novel explanation method based on the Graph Information Bottleneck theory (GIB) and a mix-up framework. RegExplainer maximizes the mutual information between the explanation and the label, while minimizing the size of the explanation.  Crucially, a self-supervised learning strategy is introduced to handle the distribution shift problem.  Evaluated on three benchmark datasets and a new real-world dataset, RegExplainer demonstrates significantly improved effectiveness in interpreting GNN models in regression, showcasing its ability to generate accurate and concise explanations.", "affiliation": "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "ejWvCpLuwu/podcast.wav"}
