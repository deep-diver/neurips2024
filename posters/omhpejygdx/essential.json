This limits their real-world applicability. Malicious actors could easily bypass these defenses by using slightly different prompts. This poses a significant risk, especially for personal photos or artistic works. \nThis paper introduces Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP), a new defense method that addresses this limitation. PAP models the distribution of possible prompts and generates perturbations that are effective against a wider range of prompts. The results of extensive experiments show that PAP significantly outperforms existing methods in protecting against image manipulation. This robust and generalizable approach is a significant advancement in the field of image security and generative AI.", "affiliation": "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "oMHpejyGdx/podcast.wav"}
