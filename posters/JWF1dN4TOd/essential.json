Existing optimization techniques become computationally expensive and inefficient as the market size grows.  The challenge lies in the high computational cost associated with optimizing allocation for numerous buyers and goods.\nThis paper introduces MarketFCNet, a deep learning model addressing this issue. Using neural networks to parameterize allocation based on buyer and good contexts, and an efficient loss function estimation, MarketFCNet achieves unbiased optimization.  Experiments demonstrate its superior performance and significantly reduced computation time compared to traditional methods, especially as market scale increases.  The paper also proposes a new metric, Nash Gap, to measure how well the approximated solution matches the actual market equilibrium.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "JWF1dN4TOd/podcast.wav"}
