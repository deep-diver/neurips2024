The KL loss suffers from asymmetry in optimization and biases from individual data samples, limiting its effectiveness in adversarial training and knowledge distillation. The authors identify these shortcomings and propose a novel solution called the Improved Kullback-Leibler (IKL) loss.\nThe IKL loss is designed to address the issues of the KL loss. It does so by breaking the asymmetric optimization property inherent in the KL loss and by incorporating class-wise global information. This modification ensures that the wMSE component remains effective throughout training and reduces biases from individual samples, leading to improved performance. The researchers experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the IKL loss and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in both adversarial training and knowledge distillation tasks.", "affiliation": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "bnZZedw9CM/podcast.wav"}
