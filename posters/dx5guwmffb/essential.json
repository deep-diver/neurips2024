These methods struggle when limited to small replay buffers or during incremental learning. This paper highlights the issues of instability and high variance in incremental learning stemming from large and noisy gradients and proposes a new method to address those challenges.\nThe paper introduces a novel incremental deep policy gradient method called Action Value Gradient (AVG) along with normalization and scaling techniques to address these issues.  AVG is shown to be significantly more effective than existing incremental methods and achieves comparable performance to batch methods on robotic simulation benchmarks.  Moreover, the researchers demonstrate, for the first time, the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning with real robots using only incremental updates, showcasing the advancement of the field and its potential for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "University of Alberta", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "DX5GUwMFFb/podcast.wav"}
