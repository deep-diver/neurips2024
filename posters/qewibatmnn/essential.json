This limits robots' ability to perform human-like grasping tasks based on natural instructions.  The creation of such datasets is expensive, involving extensive annotation efforts.\nTo address these challenges, the paper introduces \"Dexterous Grasp as You Say\" (DexGYS), a novel task that aims to enable robots to perform dexterous grasping based on human language instructions.  They developed DexGYSNet, a large-scale dataset constructed efficiently using a hand-object interaction retargeting strategy and an LLM-assisted annotation system.  They also introduce DexGYSGrasp, a framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and intent-aligned grasps that decomposes complex learning into two progressive objectives, overcoming challenges from traditional penetration loss functions. **The experiments validate the effectiveness of both the dataset and the framework, showcasing advancements in natural human-robot interaction.**", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "QeWibaTmnn/podcast.wav"}
