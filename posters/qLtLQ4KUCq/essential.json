These issues lead to inaccurate outlier identification and limited scalability.  This paper introduces a novel approach to outlier detection that directly tackles these issues.\nThe proposed method, Generative Subspace Adversarial Active Learning (GSAAL), uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) with multiple adversaries, each focused on a different subspace. This allows GSAAL to model the inlier distribution effectively across multiple views while being robust to inlier assumptions and high dimensionality.  Extensive experiments show GSAAL's superiority and scalability compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qLtLQ4KUCq/podcast.wav"}
