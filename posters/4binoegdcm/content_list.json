In contrast, ViCo achieves the best identity preservation but ranks lowest in text alignment, indicative of its tendency to overfit the new concept. Besides these two extreme cases, our approach exhibits superior performance in both identity preservation and text alignment. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fast Version of Our Method. The average training time using our method is about 20 minutes. To reduce the training time, we developed a fast version of our method by increasing the learning rate while simultaneously decreasing both the training steps and the batch size for the third training stage. Originally, this stage involves performing 500 steps with a learning rate of $2\\times10^{-6}$ and a batch size of 8. The fast version now completes training in just 200 steps with a learning rate of $1\\times10^{-5}$ and a batch size of 4. These adjustments significantly reduce the training time from 20 minutes to an average of 6 minutes. Interestingly, this fast version maintains performance comparable to our original model, likely because the first two stages provide a convenient starting point, allowing for a higher learning rate in the third stage. Notably, the fast version performs similarly to the original model on short prompts, as shown in Table 1, but it shows slight degradation on complex prompts, as depicted in Figure 10.

Specifically, we conduct an ablation study by separately removing each training stage or the attention map regularization term. Figure 8 presents a visual comparison of personalized images generated by each variant. The results indicate that all sub-modules are crucial for achieving identity-preserved and textaligned personalized generations. Specifically, the model without optimizing the textual embedding (w/o Stage 1) tends to neglect the learned concept or generate it with significant distortions due to insufficient learning of the embedding alignment. Models without fine-tuning the cross-attention layers (w/o Stage 2) or without the regularization term (w/o Reg) suffer from degraded text alignment or identity preservation. The model without fine-tuning the U-Net (w/o Stage 3) leads to significant degradation in identity preservation. Additional ablation study results are provided in Appendix F.

This limitation might be addressed by adopting adaptive training strategies, which we leave for future work. A second limitation is that our three-stage training method requires approximately 20 minutes on average to learn a concept, as it involves fine-tuning all parameters in the U-Net for 500 steps. To mitigate this, we introduced a fast version that reduces the training time to approximately 6 minutes while still maintaining performance comparable to the original model.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
