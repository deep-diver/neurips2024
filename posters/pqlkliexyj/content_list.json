Unlike existing localization algorithms, LoD-Loc does not rely on complex 3D representations and can estimate the pose of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using a Level-of-Detail (LoD) 3D map. LoD-Loc mainly achieves this goal by aligning the wireframe derived from the LoD projected model with that predicted by the neural network. Specifically, given a coarse pose provided by the UAV sensor, LoD-Loc hierarchically builds a cost volume for uniformly sampled pose hypotheses to describe pose probability distribution and select a pose with maximum probability. Each cost within this volume measures the degree of line alignment between projected and predicted wireframes. LoD-Loc also devises a 6-DoF pose optimization algorithm to refine the previous result with a differentiable GaussianNewton method. As no public dataset exists for the studied problem, we collect two datasets with map levels of LoD3.0 and LoD2.0, along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. We benchmark our method and demonstrate that LoD-Loc achieves excellent performance, even surpassing current state-of-the-art methods that use textured 3D models for localization.

Subsequently, a Perspective-n-Point $(\\mathsf{P n P})$ RANSAC [32, 37, 14, 23, 27, 24] technique is commonly used to calculate the camera pose. However, building high-quality 3D maps using photogrammetry [12, 28, 64, 58, 33] is expensive on a global scale and requires frequent updates to account for temporal changes in visual appearance.

Many commercial companies, such as Google Maps [8] and Baidu Maps [7], have already integrated LoD 3D models into their MAP Applications. 2) Light-weight map size: LoD maps are extremely compact, up to $10^{4}$ times smaller in size than textured 3D maps, enabling on-device localization over large areas. 3) Privacy preservation and policy-friendly: As LoD city models only reveal the basic 3D outlines of buildings in a highly abstracted and simplified manner, they raise fewer concerns about the disclosure of privacy and land resource secrets.

This deficiency makes it nearly impossible to establish local feature-based 2D-to-3D correspondences. Inspired by the idea that, when the pose is correctly solved, the network-predicted building wireframes can align with those projected from the LoD 3D model, as shown in Figure 1, we introduce LoD-Loc, a novel approach tailored for visual localization in LoD 3D city maps. Our method takes a query image and its real sensor data (i.e., GPS, gravity, and compass) as input, and estimates the 6-DoF pose of a drone in filght. Specifically, we initially fix the 2- DoF gravity direction and generate pose hypotheses by sampling 4-DoF (comprising position and yaw angle) around the sensor pose, given that the gravity direction provided by the inertial unit exhibits minor error. Following the generation of pose hypotheses, LoD building wireframes are projected onto the query image plane. Each pose hypothesis is then scored based on the alignment between the projected and predicted wireframes, thereby forming a 4D pose cost volume. By applying a softmax operation, we derive a probability density over the pose, which can be used for pose selection through classification. Moreover, after the pose selection stage, a differentiable Gauss-Newton method, with an optimization objective to maximize the wireframe alignment, is employed to refine the overall 6-DoF pose. The pose selection and optimization processes are fully differentiable w.r.t. the network output, which enables the use of ground-truth poses as supervision for training feature extraction and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner.

First, compared to the SOTA texture-based approach, the LoD-Loc employs distinct cues for localization. The texture-based method determines the pose by optimizing the re-projection error of corresponding 2D-3D points. Conversely, the LoD-Loc aligns the 3D wireframe projection to solve the pose. Second, 3D-model-based methods typically employ a two-stage scheme, which involves building 2D-3D matches and then solving the pose with PnP RANSAC. The LoD-Loc method directly solves the pose in an end-to-end manner, potentially leading to better pose accuracy. Third, the LoD-Loc includes several important modules to improve performance, such as coarse-to-fine pose cost volume reconstruction, uncertainty-based sampling range estimation, and differential Gauss-Newton refinement. These factors contribute to the superior performance of our method.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
