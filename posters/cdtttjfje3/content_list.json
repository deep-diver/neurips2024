In this paper, we revisit the task of AI-generated text detection. We argue that the key to accomplishing this task lies in distinguishing writing styles of different authors, rather than simply classifying the text into human-written or AI-generated text. To this end, we propose DeTeCtive, a multi-task auxiliary, multi-level contrastive learning framework.

Existing methods for AI-generated text detection generally fall into the following three categories: (i) Watermarking methods: watermarking methods, which include rule based [5, 30, 59] and deep learning based [17, 62] methods, involve embedding specific markers into AI-generated content, which can later be used to verify its source. The soft watermarking method [32] is an inference-time framework that involves grouping the vocabulary and decoding the next token preferentially. [23] proposes a method of adding watermarks by embedding backdoors triggered by special inputs into the model. UPV [41] is an unforgeable and publicly verifiable algorithm ensuring security against forgery and unauthorized detection attempts. (ii) Statistical methods: applying statistical metrics like entropy as thresholds to distinguish AI-generated text from human-written text. HowkGPT [63] identifies text origins by comparing perplexity scores of human-written and ChatGPT [6, 69] generated text. DetectGPT [47] utilizes the structural properties of the LLM\u2019s probability density for zero-shot detection of AI-generated text. Similarly, DetectLLM [56] employs normalized perturbation log-ranks for identification, exhibiting less sensitivity to perturbations. (iii) Supervised learning methods: GPT-Sentinel [11] incorporates a binary classifier into RoBERTa [43] and T5 [51], which are directly trained on specific datasets. RADAR [27] employs an adversarial learning approach. By continually iterating to improve the detector and generator (both of which are LLMs), RADAR performs well in detecting both original and paraphrased AI-generated text.

As shown in Table 6, all models improve on their baselines, confirming our method\u2019s effectiveness with diverse text encoders in AI-generated text detection.

These include the M4 [68] dataset (M4-monolingual and M4-multilingual), TuringBench [61], and the Cross-domains & Crossmodels subset of Deepfake which is the largest and most challenging subset in the In-distribution scenarios of Deepfake. The results are shown in Table 1. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Using the AvgRec metric for illustration, our method surpasses the second-best method by $6.52\\%$ in the M4-monolingual setting and by $7.15\\%$ in the M4-multilingual setting. Despite the comparatively lower difficulty of the earlier released TuringBench dataset, where all comparative methods perform well, our model still outperforms the second-best by $0.15\\%$ . Furthermore, in the Cross-domains & Cross-models subset of Deepfake, our method exceeds the runner-up by $2.66\\%$ . Indicated by the aforementioned experimental results, our method performs commendably across multiple datasets, demonstrating that the framework we propose is robust against diverse data distributions and scenarios. ", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "To verify the capability of our method in terms of domain adaptation and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, we conduct experiments on all six scenarios proposed in the Deepfake dataset. The dataset is strictly divided into different subsets to ensure that the testing data used for any given scenario is not used as training data for other settings. In In-distribution detection, comparison methods are trained separately on each specific subset and then averaged to get the final results. Conversely, we only train on the Cross-domains & Cross-models subset. During testing, we solely employ each scenario\u2019s training data as the database, skipping additional training on these data and progressing directly to inference. Our method outperforms other methods in every setting. The precise experimental results of AvgRec are presented in the first row of Table 2. For the Out-of-distribution detection, it is further divided into two cases: Unseen Models and Unseen Domains. The testing set includes data from the above two scenarios, which has not appeared in the training set. The AvgRec results are as shown in the second row of Table 2, where our method surpasses the next by $5.58\\%$ and $14.2\\%$ respectively in terms of AvgRec. The results demonstrate the good generalization performance of our method, considerably outperforming existing methods. Finally, we devise a set of experiments where we incorporate corresponding OOD data from training sets of the Cross-domains & Cross-models subset into the database to aid detection. There is a substantial performance improvement in the Unseen Domains scenario, with an additional $7.03\\%$ increase in AvgRec. For the Unseen Models, only a slight improvement is observed, which can be attributed to the existing capability of identifying similar models. This also highlights the effectiveness of the multi-level contrastive learning within our method from another perspective.

From the experimental results, it can be seen that our method achieves the best results under all three settings, and the performance of our method does not decline much after being attacked, whereas the performance of other methods declines significantly. The analysis is as follows, we believe that our usage of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for classification offers our approach with a level of fault tolerance.
