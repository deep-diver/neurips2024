However, obtaining labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming, leading to challenges in efficiently training accurate models. Existing active learning approaches often focus on online settings, requiring immediate feedback from human annotators, which can be impractical in real-world scenarios. Additionally, these methods rarely consider the presence of noise in node-level information and network structure.\nThis paper presents a novel offline active learning method that addresses these issues. **The method incorporates information from both the network structure and node covariates to select informative and representative nodes for labeling**. It utilizes a two-stage biased sampling strategy that balances informativeness and representativeness, considering the trade-off between these two factors. The researchers have established a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the number of selected nodes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, especially when dealing with noisy data.", "affiliation": "Pennsylvania State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MDsl1ifiNS/podcast.wav"}
