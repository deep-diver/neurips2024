While NeRFs can adapt using per-image embedding vectors, 3DGS faces challenges due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. This necessitates efficient and robust methods for handling such complexities.\nWildGaussians introduces a novel approach that leverages robust DINO features and integrates an appearance modeling module within 3DGS. This allows for handling occlusions and appearance changes effectively. The method jointly optimizes a DINO-based uncertainty predictor, enhancing robustness to occlusions.  Experimental results demonstrate that WildGaussians achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS, outperforming both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "NU3tE3lIqf/podcast.wav"}
