A key aspect of learning is synaptic plasticity\u2014the ability of connections between neurons to change their strength.  Inferring the precise rules governing this change has been incredibly difficult due to the complexity of neural systems and limitations in recording techniques. This is further complicated by the fact that **synaptic dynamics are not directly observable, and it remains a major challenge to infer synaptic plasticity rules from experimental data.**\n\nThis paper introduces a novel computational method to overcome these challenges. The authors developed a model-based inference approach that approximates plasticity rules using parameterized functions, optimizing these parameters to accurately match observed neural activity or behavioral data.  This method is validated by successfully recovering established rules, as well as more intricate plasticity rules involving reward modulation and long-term dependencies. Importantly, **the application of this technique to real-world behavioral data from Drosophila revealed an active forgetting component in a reward-learning task, which was missed by previous models, improving predictive accuracy.** This finding underscores the importance of incorporating active forgetting into our models.", "affiliation": "Janelia Research Campus", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "rI80PHlnFm/podcast.wav"}
