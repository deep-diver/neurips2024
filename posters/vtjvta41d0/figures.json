The left side shows a schematic of the forward and reverse diffusion processes.  The forward process (red arrow) maps the high-quality image (x\u2080) to the low-quality observation (y) through the operator A. The reverse process (brown arrow) aims to recover x\u2080 from y.  The dotted oval represents the basin of attraction around the true high-quality image (x\u2080). The right-hand side provides a visual interpretation in a three-dimensional space. Each curve represents the probability distribution at a different time step. As the reverse process progresses (indicated by the red arrows), the distribution shifts from being spread out around y to being concentrated around the actual image (x\u2080).  The success of the reverse process depends on whether it starts in the basin of attraction (as shown). Starting far outside the basin of attraction can lead to the diffusion process converging to a point other than x\u2080.
