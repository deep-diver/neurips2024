The algorithms compared include SUB-UCB (the authors' proposed algorithm with different greedy stop levels),  ETCG (explore-then-commit greedy), and a standard UCB algorithm applied to all possible sets of size k. The y-axis represents the total regret, and the x-axis represents the time horizon T. The plot shows that SUB-UCB consistently outperforms ETCG and the standard UCB approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.  The results highlight the adaptive nature of SUB-UCB, which adjusts to different time horizons. For smaller time horizons, SUB-UCB and ETCG outperform the standard UCB approach, while for larger time horizons the advantage of SUB-UCB remains apparent. ", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
