The results are based on images of 23 celebrities evaluated using DreamBench compositional prompts.  The '-Comp' row shows the performance of AdaFace without the composition distillation stage, highlighting the impact of this component on the overall performance.", "section": "3.3 Quantitative Evaluations"}]
