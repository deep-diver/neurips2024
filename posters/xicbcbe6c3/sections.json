The core idea involves partitioning a pre-trained model into smaller, self-contained submodules. Each submodule approximates the full model's capabilities, allowing for early exits during inference, based on a confidence measure, thus significantly reducing computational costs. **Early exits are crucial for efficiency, as samples with high confidence can be predicted quickly by early submodules, whereas those with low confidence or significant distribution shifts require further processing through subsequent submodules.** This approach intelligently balances efficiency and accuracy, dynamically adapting to varying levels of distribution shift and memory constraints. **The self-ensemble structure is key to managing memory limitations since it avoids the substantial memory overhead associated with conventional TTA methods that involve backpropagation through the entire network.**  By cleverly grouping similar layers into submodules, the technique also addresses the challenge of limited memory often found on resource-constrained edge devices.  This method therefore provides a promising path for deploying adaptable and computationally efficient deep learning models in real-world, resource-scarce scenarios."}}, {"heading_title": "Early-exit Strategy", "details": {"summary": "The early-exit strategy, a crucial component of TinyTTA, addresses the inherent memory limitations of edge devices by enabling efficient test-time adaptation (TTA).  **Instead of processing each sample through the entire pre-trained network**, TinyTTA partitions the network into submodules and allows samples to exit early from specific submodules based on predicted confidence.  This significantly reduces computational overhead.  **Samples easily classified with high confidence exit early**, bypassing subsequent layers.  Those requiring more processing continue until a reliable prediction is achieved.  This design not only enhances efficiency but also accommodates mixed distribution shifts, adapting dynamically to varying levels of data shift. **Early-exit and self-ensembling combined** enable continuous adaptation with smaller batch sizes, further reducing memory consumption and improving latency on constrained hardware.  The confidence level, a hyperparameter determined via entropy calculation, guides the early-exit decision, ensuring that only necessary processing occurs.  **This adaptive approach improves accuracy and efficiency** while remaining practical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices."}}, {"heading_title": "WS-based Normalization", "details": {"summary": "The paper introduces a novel normalization technique called **Weight Standardization (WS)**, designed to address the limitations of traditional normalization layers within the context of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) on memory-constrained edge devices.  Unlike Batch Normalization (BN) or Group Normalization (GN), which normalize activations, WS normalizes weights. This offers several key advantages.  First, **it eliminates the need for storing and updating batch statistics**, which is crucial for memory-limited settings like microcontrollers (MCUs). Second, **WS is inherently batch-agnostic**, meaning its performance is unaffected by batch size, unlike BN and GN, which often suffer accuracy degradation with small batch sizes.  Third, **WS avoids the need for explicit normalization layers** commonly fused with convolutional layers in MCU implementations, simplifying the deployment process and reducing complexity. By directly standardizing weights, WS effectively mimics the effect of normalization layers without the memory overhead, making it a particularly suitable choice for efficient TTA on resource-constrained edge devices."}}, {"heading_title": "MCU Deployment", "details": {"summary": "The successful deployment of TinyTTA on MCUs represents a significant advancement in the field of edge AI.  **The STM32H747 MCU, with its limited 512KB SRAM, posed a considerable challenge**, necessitating careful optimization strategies.
