It shows the accuracy achieved, the SRAM and Flash memory usage, the latency, and the energy consumption for both models.

The table shows the overhead for each of the three early exits added to each model. For example, for MobileNet on CIFAR10C, the first early exit adds 0.01 MB of memory and 2.70 KB of parameters, while the third early exit adds 0.07 MB of memory and 17.29 KB of parameters.  The table highlights the relatively low memory overhead and parameter increase introduced by the early exit branches, even for larger and more complex models like EfficientNet and RegNet.", "section": "5.3 TinyTTA on MCUs"}]
