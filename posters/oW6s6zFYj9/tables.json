The methods compared include several state-of-the-art ANN-SNN conversion techniques and directly trained SNNs. The table highlights the performance of the proposed SWS method in terms of its accuracy and the time it takes to perform inference, in comparison to existing methods.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "oW6s6zFYj9/tables/tables_11_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performance on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.", "description": "This table compares the performance of different methods (including the proposed SWS method) on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets.
