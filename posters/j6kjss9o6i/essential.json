This often manifests as brainless trial-and-error and hallucinatory actions. This paper tackles this by drawing inspiration from human mental models that provide global prior knowledge and maintain local dynamic knowledge during task execution.\n\nTo address these issues, the researchers propose a parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM). WKM is trained using both expert and sampled trajectories and leverages prior knowledge for global planning and dynamic state knowledge for local planning. Experiments using three complex datasets and various LLMs demonstrate that this approach is superior to several strong baselines.  Further analysis confirms that WKM effectively alleviates the limitations of LLMs in planning while highlighting its instance-level task knowledge and 'weak-guide-strong' capabilities.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "j6kJSS9O6I/podcast.wav"}
