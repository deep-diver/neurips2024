For fine-tuning-based baselines, both NAT and ETO fall behind our method, implying that just integrating world knowledge for agent models is worth more than further fussy SFT or DPO on negative examples. Our method also performs better than KNOWAGENT which brings human-designed fixed action knowledge and long action paths into trajectories. This suggests the effectiveness of our WKM which is responsible for generating instance-level task knowledge and maintaining implicit action constraints.

In a macro view, removing each module results in a clear drop in the agent\u2019s performance, which validates the power of our world knowledge. Furthermore, the improvement through task knowledge $(w/$ task) is more pronounced than that through state knowledge (w/ state), suggesting the necessity of global prior knowledge for agent planning. A more micro observation reveals that the impact of state knowledge is more significant on seen tasks compared to unseen tasks, while the influence of task knowledge is sustainable across seen and unseen tasks. This may be attributed that although our real-time state knowledge is generated by WKM, the state knowledge base is built on the training set, which may weaken generalization to some extent. Additionally, to validate our motivation of allowing the agent to learn task knowledge from both expert and generated trajectories, we exclude the rejected trajectories during the synthesis of task knowledge, instructing the agent model to synthesize knowledge solely based on the chosen trajectories. The results (w/o rejected) demonstrate that learning from the contrast between chosen and rejected trajectories is more effective than learning from chosen examples alone. This procedure is a little similar to DPO, but we achieve it through knowledge augmentation rather than directly converting it into a loss calculation between chosen and rejected trajectories. Additional results can further evident that training a WKM separately performs better than training one single model together with the agent model as well as using few-shot prompts to replace WKM for providing knowledge.

Taking a further perspective from an average standpoint in Table 2, it can be observed that WKM exhibits lower average planning steps compared to other baselines. As ALFWorld can respond to invalid actions, in Table 3, we count the percentage of hallucinatory actions that occurred in trajectories from ALFWorld for each method. The results confirm the effectiveness of our world knowledge model to decrease hallucinatory actions. Furthermore, it is worth noting that most baselines show a prominent increase in the average number of steps and percentage of invalid actions when transitioning from seen tasks to unseen tasks, but WKM can still maintain a relatively low level.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
