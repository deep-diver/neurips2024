Successfully integrating and utilizing such data is critical, yet challenging.  Existing methods either fail to incorporate such irregularities or struggle with scalability when handling a diverse range of modalities. \nThe proposed FuseMoE framework utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach with a novel Laplace gating function to effectively integrate diverse modalities.  This design addresses the limitations of existing methods by efficiently managing missing data and irregular temporal patterns.  FuseMoE's unique gating function theoretically enhances convergence speed and practically yields superior performance in numerous downstream prediction tasks.  Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the framework in real-world scenarios.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science\nJohns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "jfE7XCE89y/podcast.wav"}
