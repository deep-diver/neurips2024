Existing approaches to convex reformulation faced scalability issues, limiting their applicability to small datasets. \n\nThe paper introduces CRONOS, a novel algorithm for training two-layer convex neural networks that addresses scalability issues. By leveraging operator splitting and Nystr\u00f6m preconditioning, CRONOS efficiently solves the resulting convex program.  CRONOS-AM extends this approach to multi-layer networks using alternating minimization.  Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate CRONOS-AM's effectiveness, achieving comparable or better performance than standard deep learning optimizers.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "YfLzYczAo3/podcast.wav"}
