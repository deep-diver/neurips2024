This is because the model's confidence in its predictions doesn't always match its accuracy. Existing solutions involve complex methods that require substantial computational resources. \nThis paper introduces Anchored Confidence (AnCon), a novel method that leverages **temporal consistency** to address this issue.  AnCon uses a simple, uncertainty-aware ensemble to create smoothed pseudo-labels, improving the selection of reliable pseudo-labels and reducing the impact of noisy ones.  The method is shown to be **asymptotically correct** and empirically achieves substantial performance gains across various distribution shift scenarios, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods without the computational burden.", "affiliation": "Northwestern University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Semi-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "a17biETKyI/podcast.wav"}
