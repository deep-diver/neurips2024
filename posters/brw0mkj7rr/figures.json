The left panel shows the PDFs of the policy's return distribution (\u03b7\u03c0(t,x)) and the h-dependent action-conditioned return distribution (\u03b6(t,x,a)). The right panel shows two candidate CDRs of  \u03b7\u03c0(t,x) and \u03b6(t,x,a).  One CDR is the superiority distribution (\u03c8(t,x,a)) and the other CDR is from Example 4.2. The figure illustrates that the superiority distribution captures more of the individual features of both return distributions than other such CDRs.", "section": "4 Distributional Superiority"}, {"figure_path": "BRW0MKJ7Rr/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5.1: Monte-Carlo estimates of \u03c8;q, for q = 0, 1, 1/2, and \u03c5\u03c0;1/2 as a function of \u03c9 = 1/h.", "description": "This figure shows Monte-Carlo estimates of four different rescaled superiority distributions (\u03c8;q) with q = 0, 1, 1/2 and the advantage-shifted 1/2-rescaled superiority distribution (\u03c5\u03c0;1/2) as a function of the decision frequency (\u03c9 = 1/h).  The plots illustrate how the distributions change as the decision frequency increases (h decreases).  The x-axis represents the value of the distributions, and the y-axis is the probability density. This figure supports Theorems 3.6/4.5 and 3.7/4.6 from the paper by demonstrating the collapse of the superiority distribution when no rescaling is applied, and its behavior under different rescaling approaches (q=1, q=1/2) at high frequencies. The advantage-shifted version (\u03c5\u03c0;1/2) is also presented to show its effectiveness in high frequency setting.", "section": "5.1 The Rescaled Superiority Distribution Revisited"}, {"figure_path": "BRW0MKJ7Rr/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5.2: Risk-neutral algorithms on high-frequency option-trading as a function of \u03c9.", "description": "This box plot shows the discounted returns of different algorithms (QR-DQN, DAU, DSUP(1), DAU+DSUP(1/2), and DSUP(1/2)) across various decision frequencies (1Hz, 5Hz, 10Hz, 15Hz, 20Hz, 25Hz, 30Hz, and 35Hz).
