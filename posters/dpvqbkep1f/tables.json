The first HNN is a vanilla model without any explicit symmetry constraints. The second HNN incorporates the authors' symmetry learning method. The third HNN uses the known correct U(3) symmetry as a fixed reference. The table shows that the symmetry learning method achieves comparable performance to the reference model, and significantly outperforms the vanilla model in terms of both ELBO (a measure of model fit) and test MSE (mean squared error on test data). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed symmetry learning approach in improving both model fit and generalization.", "section": "5.3 n-Harmonic Oscillators"}, {"figure_path": "dpvqBkEp1f/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Learning Hamiltonian dynamics of 2d 3-body system with variational Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN).
