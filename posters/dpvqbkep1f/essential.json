Recent advancements model physical dynamics through Hamiltonian mechanics, guaranteeing energy conservation.  However, manually embedding such constraints can be challenging.  This work addresses this challenge by using Noether's theorem to link symmetries with conserved quantities which can be learned. \nThis paper proposes \"Noether's Razor,\" a novel method that jointly learns the Hamiltonian and conserved quantities.  It uses approximate Bayesian model selection, avoiding the need for manual regularization to prevent trivial solutions.  This end-to-end training procedure leverages the Occam's razor effect to find the simplest representation. Experiments on harmonic oscillators and n-body systems demonstrate the efficacy of Noether's Razor in accurately identifying conserved quantities and symmetries, leading to improved predictive accuracy.", "affiliation": "Imperial College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dpvqBkEp1f/podcast.wav"}
