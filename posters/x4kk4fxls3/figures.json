The top part shows how the autoregressive method decomposes the joint probability distribution of a graph into a series of conditional distributions, one for each block of nodes. The bottom part shows how a shared discrete diffusion model is used to model each of these conditional distributions. The diffusion model injects noise into the graph, and then a denoising network is used to reconstruct the original graph from the noisy version. The process is repeated until the original graph is reconstructed.", "section": "3.4 PARD: Autoregressive Denoising Diffusion"}, {"figure_path": "x4Kk4FxLs3/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: PARD integrates the autoregressive method with diffusion modeling.

The top part shows how the model generates a graph block by block, adding new nodes and edges in each step.

The fact that these are 'non-curated' suggests they are raw outputs of the model, without any post-processing or filtering for chemical validity or plausibility.
