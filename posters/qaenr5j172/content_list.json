Generative models can produce impressively vivid human images, however still lacking in controllability and editability. This paper studies photorealism enhancement of rendered images, leveraging generative power from diffusion models on the controlled basis of rendering. We introduce a novel framework to translate rendered images into their realistic counterparts, which consists of two stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG).

As can be seen from the figures, both the CUT and SANTA methods exhibit some degree of image degradation and fail to effectively learn the concept of image realism from data across rendered and real domains, thus enable to generate realistic images. The diffusion based style transfer method VCT maintains image quality but fails to extract realistic image features from the guidance image, also resulting in the loss of image details. Compared to previous methods, the UNSB method achieves better consistency in terms of content, but like CUT and SANTA, it performs poorly in maintaining color fidelity and the realism effect is not good. The proposed method effectively enhances the overall realism of the image, particularly in capturing the facial and hand features of models, as well as the texture and wrinkle details of the garment.

In this work, we simply use DDIM inversion to extract texture-related attention features. However, the inversion process slows down the generation, requiring approximately one minute to translate an image with a resolution of $768\\times1024$ . This could potentially be accelerated by recent inversion-free methods. We test the inference time and resource consumption for a 512x512 image on an RTX 3090, as shown in Tab. 4. Note that comparing to VCT, which is also based on diffusion, our method takes much less memory and time during testing as we do not need to perform additional optimization for each testing image. Our method cannot handle real-time applications for now, but has potential for improvement with future integration with SD Turbo or SD Lightning. Additionally, for different images, finding the optimal balance between the TAC ratio and denoising strength may require more empirical refinements to achieve the best result. Due to limitations on computational resources, experiments were not conducted on more advanced models such as SDXL [75]. Given that our method is based on SD1.5 and for human-related content generation, potential negative societal impacts of exploiting this method could be violation of portrait rights, racial bias, or inappropriate content in generation when the denoising strength is high. Relative solutions can include but are not limited to using authorized, diverse and balanced training data and training detection models to prevent inappropriate content generation.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
