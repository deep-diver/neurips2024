[31] leverage a latent variable model and linear relations between the interventional variable and the latent variable to handle extrapolation.

In the latent-variable model literature, one often assumes latent variables ${\\bf z}$ generate the observed data $\\mathbf{x}$ (e.g., images, text) through a generating function. However, the nonlinearity of deep learning models requires the generating function to be nonlinear, which has posed major technical difficulty in recovering the original latent variable [32]. To overcome this setback, a line of work [33\u201336] assumes the availability of an auxiliary label u for each sample $\\mathbf{x}$ and under different u values, each component $z_{i}$ of $\\mathbf{z}$ experiences sufficiently large shift in its distribution. Since this framework assumes all latent components\u2019 distributions vary over distributions indexed by $\\mathbf{u}$ , it does not assume the existence of some shared, invariant information across distributions, which is often the case for transfer learning tasks. To address this issue, recent work [18, 19] introduce a partition of ${\\bf z}$ into an invariable variable c and an changing variable s (i.e., $\\mathbf{z}:=\\left[\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{s}\\right])$ such that c\u2019s distribution remains constant over distributions. They show both c and s can be identified and one can directly utilize the invariant variable c for domain adaptation. However, their techniques crucially rely on the variability of the changing variable s, mandating the availability of multiple sufficiently disparate distributions (including the target) and their overlapping supports. These constraints make them unsuitable for the extrapolation problem. In comparison, our theoretical results give identification of the invariant variable c (the on-support variable in the extrapolation context) with only one source distribution $p_{\\mathrm{src}}(\\mathbf{x})$ and as few as one out-off support target sample $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$ through mild assumptions on the generating function, directly tackling the extrapolation problem.

While this assumption is typically valid, it can be extended to encompass continuous dimensions in the invariant variable $\\bar{\\mathbf{c}}:=[\\bar{\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{c}}},\\bar{\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{d}}}]$ where $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $\\mathbf{c_{d}}$ stand for the continuous and discrete dimensions, respectively. In such cases, we can group the continuous dimensions $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ with the changing variable s and the same proof would give rise to the identification of the discrete part $\\mathbf{c_{d}}$ , which suffices for classification tasks. The off-support distance condition involves the smoothness of the generating function $g$ , where a smoother generating function allows more leeway for the target changing variable $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$ to deviate. When s controls the camera angle, one may be able to recognize a slightly sided view of cats after seeing front views in the source until the s deviates too far and all images become back views, potentially leading to confusion with other animals (Figure 1b).

Unlike our work, the bulk of the work is devoted to generalizing to target distributions on the same support as the source distribution [22, 23, 8]. Recent work [24\u201327] investigates extrapolation in the form of compositional generalization by resorting to structured generating functions (e.g., additive, slot-wise). Another line of work [28\u201330] studies extrapolation in regression problems and does not consider the latent representation. Saengkyongam et al. [31] leverage a latent variable model and assumes a linear relation between the intervention variable and the latent variable to handle extrapolation. In this work, we formulate extrapolation as a latent variable identification problem. Unlike the semi-parametric conditions in prior work, our conditions do not constrain the form of the generating function and are more compatible with deep learning models and tasks. We demonstrate that our conditions naturally lead to implications benefiting practical deep-learning algorithms. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Latent-variable identification for transfer learning. Identifying latent variables in a causal model has become one canonical paradigm to formalize and understand representation learning in the deep learning regime. Typically, one would assume some latent variables ${\\bf z}$ generate the observed data $\\mathbf{x}$ (e.g., images, text) through a generating function. However, the nonlinearity of deep learning models requires the generating function to be nonlinear, which has posed major technical difficulty in recovering the original latent variable [32]. To overcome this setback, a line of work [33\u201336] assumes the availability of an auxiliary label $\\mathbf{u}$ for each sample $\\mathbf{x}$ and under different $\\mathbf{u}$ values, each component $z_{i}$ of $\\mathbf{z}$ experiences sufficiently large shift in its distribution. This condition leads to componentwise identification of ${\\bf z}$ , i.e., each estimate $\\hat{z}_{i}$ is equivalent to $z_{\\pi(i)}$ up to an invertible mapping for a permutation function $\\pi:[d_{z}]\\rightarrow[d_{z}]$ . Since this framework assumes all latent components\u2019 distributions vary over distributions indexed by $\\mathbf{u}$ , it doesn\u2019t assume the existence of some shared, invariant information across distributions, which is often the case for transfer learning tasks. To address this issue, recent work [18, 19] introduce a partition of ${\\bf z}$ into an invariable variable c and an changing variable s (i.e., $\\mathbf{z}:=[\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{s}])$ such that c\u2019s distribution remains constant over distributions. They show both c and s can be identified and one can directly utilize the invariant variable c for domain adaptation. However, their techniques crucially rely on the variability of the changing variable s, mandating the availability of multiple sufficiently disparate distributions (including the target) and their overlapping supports. These constraints make them unsuitable for the extrapolation problem. In comparison, our theoretical results give identification of the invariant variable c (the on-support variable in the extrapolation context) with only one source distribution $p_{\\mathrm{src}}(\\mathbf{x})$ and as few as one out-off support target sample $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$ through mild assumptions on the generating function, which directly tackles the extrapolation problem. ", "page_idx": 16}, {"type": "text", "text": "Test-time adaptation. Test-time Adaptation (TTA) aims at adapting models trained on a source domain to align with the target domain during testing [49\u201355]. It is broadly classified based on whether the training objective is modified. Test-time Training (TTT) methods [13, 14, 44, 56, 57], including TTT [13] and $\\mathrm{TT}\\mathrm{T}++$ [14], proficiently adjust models to target domains by implementing similar self-supervised learning strategies on both training and testing data. In contrast, Sequential Test-Time Adaptation [15, 54, 55, 58\u201363] (sTTA) garners significant interest due to its practicality, notably its one-pass sequential inference and no training objective access. Research in sTTA primarily concentrates on two facets: the selection of model parameters for adaptation and the refinement of pseudo-labeling techniques for enhanced efficiency. For instance, TENT [15] fine-tunes the Batch Normalization (BN) layers by minimizing entropy, SHOT [16] adjusts the backbone network while maintaining a static classifier, and T3A [64] updates the classifier prototype. Moreover, a burgeoning line of research [65, 21, 44, 50, 15, 16] focuses on deriving more robust self-training signals through improved pseudo labeling strategies. For example, TTAC [44] employs clustering techniques to extract more accurate pseudo labels. Despite the prominent recent development, these algorithms tend to be brittle and sensitive to hyper-parameter tuning [66] and limited in theoretical understanding [17]. Our work offers formalization and understanding to fill in this gap. We show that insights inferred from our theory can indeed benefit existing TTA algorithms, which hopefully will serve as the first step to bridge the theory and practice for TTA algorithms.

In this stage, only the encoder is updated. 2) Stage Two: We input full images (32 in a batch) and optimize the model with the entropy minimization loss following SHOT [43].
