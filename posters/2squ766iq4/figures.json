Panel (a) shows the extrapolation problem: a target sample lies outside the source support region, making classification ambiguous. Panel (b) shows the 'dense shift' scenario, where the changing variable affects all image features (e.g., camera angle). Here, extrapolation is possible with moderate shifts, but fails with extreme ones due to ambiguity. Panel (c) shows the 'sparse shift' scenario, where changes are confined to a limited subset of features (e.g., background).  Extrapolation is robust to severe changes in this case. The figure visually explains Theorems 4.2 and 4.4, linking shift properties to extrapolation success.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "2squ766Iq4/figures/figures_1_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Illustration of extrapolation and our theoretical conditions.

The latent variable  `c` represents invariant information shared between the source and target distributions. The latent variable `s` represents the changing factor that distinguishes the source and target data.  The variable x is the observed data, and y is the label. The arrows represent causal relationships, indicating that `c` causally influences both `x` and `y`, while `s` only influences `x`.

The x-axis represents the size of the corrupted region (block size), and the y-axis represents the classification error. Each line represents a different noise level, ranging from Level 1 (least severe) to Level 10 (most severe).  The results demonstrate that the error rate increases with both increasing noise level and increasing block size.  In particular, for larger block sizes (dense shifts), the error rate significantly increases with severity, while for smaller block sizes (sparse shifts), the error rate remains relatively constant across severity levels.  This illustrates the trade-off between the shift scope and severity as described in the paper.", "section": "6.3 Shift Scope and Severity"}]
