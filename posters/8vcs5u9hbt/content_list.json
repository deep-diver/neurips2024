Multi-task architecture design can be roughly categorized into either a hard-parameter sharing design [46, 47] or a soft-parameter sharing design [6, 48, 49]. The hard-parameter sharing design generally contains a shared encoder and several task-specific decoders. Branching points between the shared encoder and decoders are determined in an ad-hoc way [1, 50], resulting in a suboptimal solution. Some work [47, 51, 52] automatically learns where to share or branch with a network. The soft-parameter sharing design considers all parameters task-specific and instead learns feature-sharing mechanisms to handle the cross-task interactions [48, 53]. Some work [54, 55] are probabilistic multi-task learning methods, which introduce latent variables to encode task-specific information and enable knowledge sharing in the latent spaces. Soft-parameter sharing methods usually struggle with model scalability as the model size grows linearly with the number of tasks. GO4Align focuses on the optimization of multi-task learning, which adopts a simple hard-parameter sharing architecture as the backbone and subsequently reduces task interference in the gradient space of the shared encoder or the loss space.
