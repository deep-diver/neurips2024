On the other hand, smaller mini-batch size $b$ requires fewer unlearning epochs $K$ as shown in Figure 3d, since more unlearning iterations are performed per epoch. Nevertheless, we remark that choosing $b$ too small may lead to degradation of model utility or instability. Decreasing the mini-batch size $b$ from 32 to 1 reduces the average accuracy of training from scratch from 0.87 to 0.64 and 0.97 to 0.81 on MNIST and CIFAR10 respectively for $\\sigma=0.03$ . In practice, one should choose a moderate mini-batch size $b$ to ensure both good model utility and unlearning complexity. Finally, we also note that PNSGD achieves a similar utility while much better complexity compared to retraining from scratch, where PNSGD requires at most $1,5$ unlearning epochs per unlearning request for $b=32$ , 512 respectively.
