It shows how different types of noise in various hypothesis spaces (such as sparse decision trees and linear models) affect model complexity and regularization.  For each combination of hypothesis space, loss function, and noise type, the table provides the effective regularization that is implicitly added by the presence of noise. This allows for a better understanding of the extent of model simplification that can be expected under different noise levels, offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for practitioners and policymakers.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "b172ac0R4L/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of paper contributions and answers to the key question.", "description": "This table summarizes the main theoretical results of the paper.  For various combinations of hypothesis spaces (complex models optimized on regularized 0-1 loss, linear models), loss functions (0-1 loss, exponential loss), and noise types (random label noise, additive attribute noise), the table shows how the addition of noise acts as an implicit regularizer, making the optimization problem equivalent to optimizing the clean data with stronger regularization.  The table provides a concise overview of the main theoretical contributions which are later supported empirically.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "b172ac0R4L/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Summary of paper contributions and answers to the key question.", "description": "This table summarizes the main findings of the paper by showing how different types of noise affect model simplicity for various combinations of hypothesis spaces and loss functions.
