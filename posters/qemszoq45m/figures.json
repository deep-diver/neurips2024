[{"figure_path": "QEmsZoQ45M/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: In Locally Linearizable MDPs, we have that, as shown in (a), the space Z is partitioned into several regions, which do not need to be convex nor connected. On each of these regions, as shown in (b), the result of the Bellman optimality operator can be well approximated by a Q function that is linear in the feature map, with a parameter \u03b8 that may depend on the region itself.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of Locally Linearizable MDPs.  Panel (a) shows how the state-action space Z is divided into multiple regions. These regions don't need to be geometrically regular; they can be arbitrarily shaped. Panel (b) illustrates that within each region, the Bellman operator (which updates the value function) can be approximated by a linear function of a feature map.  The linear parameters (\u03b8) can vary between regions, allowing for flexibility in modeling non-linear environments.", "section": "3 Locally Linearizable MDPs"}, {"figure_path": "QEmsZoQ45M/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Relation between the setting described in this paper and the other settings proposed for reinforcement learning in continuous state-action spaces. The dashed line means that inclusion holds, but passing to the larger family brings a exp(H) lower bound on the regret. As we can see, the Mildly smooth MDP is the largest known setting for which regret of order poly(H) is possible. Note that the Strongly Smooth family also contains known families like LQRs and Linear MDPs with smooth feature map [25].", "description": "This figure illustrates the relationships between different families of continuous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) discussed in the paper.  It shows how the newly proposed Mildly Smooth MDPs encompass several other known families of MDPs (Lipschitz MDPs, Strongly Smooth MDPs, and Kernelized MDPs), and how these are related to the broader but less tractable family of Weakly Smooth MDPs.  The dashed lines indicate that a larger family contains a smaller one; however, using the assumptions of the larger family may result in an exponential lower bound on the regret. The figure highlights that Mildly Smooth MDPs represent the largest known MDP family for which a polynomial regret bound is achievable, indicating the significant contribution of the proposed work.", "section": "4 From local linearity to Mildly Smooth MDPs"}]
