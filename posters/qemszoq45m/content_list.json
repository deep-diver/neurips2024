Existing solutions either work under very specific assumptions or achieve bounds that are vacuous in some regimes. Furthermore, many structural assumptions are known to suffer from a provably unavoidable exponential dependence on the time horizon $H$ in the regret, which makes any possible solution unfeasible in practice. In this paper, we identify local linearity as the feature that makes Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) both learnable (sublinear regret) and feasible (regret that is polynomial in $H$ ). We define a novel MDP representation class, namely Locally Linearizable $M D P s$ , generalizing other representation classes like Linear MDPs and MDPS with low inherent Belmman error. Then, i) we introduce CINDERELLA, a no-regret algorithm for this general representation class, and ii) we show that all known learnable and feasible MDP families are representable in this class. We first show that all known feasible MDPs belong to a family that we call Mildly Smooth MDPs. Then, we show how any mildly smooth MDP can be represented as a Locally Linearizable MDP by an appropriate choice of representation.

By interacting with the environment, an RL algorithm tries to make the agent play actions leading to the highest possible expected reward; RL theory is the field that designs algorithms to be provably efficient, i.e., to work with probability close to one. This idea is formalized in a performance metric called the (cumulative) regret, which measures the cumulative difference between actions played by the algorithm and the optimal ones in terms of expected reward.

This regret is minimax-optimal in the sense that no algorithm can achieve smaller regret for every arbitrary tabular MDP. This result is not useful in many real-world scenarios, where $\\boldsymbol{S}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}$ are huge, or even continuous [20, 19, 15]. In fact, all applications of RL to the physical world, like robotics [20] and autonomous driving [19], have to deal with continuous state spaces. Furthermore, the most common benchmarks used to evaluate practical RL algorithms [36, 7] have continuous state spaces.

LQR is a model where the state of the system evolves according to linear dynamics, and the reward is quadratic. Regret guarantees of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{K})$ for this problem were obtained by [2] (with a computationally inefficient algorithm) and, then,  by [12, 9]. Still, this parametric model of the environment is very restrictive and does not capture the vast majority of continuous MDPs. A much wider and non-parametric family is given by Lipschitz MDPs [31], which assume that bounded differences in the state-action pair $(s,a)$ correspond to bounded differences in the reward $r(s,a)$ and in the transition function $p(\\cdot|s,a)$ (e.g., in Wasserstein metric). Lipschitz MDPs have been applied to several scenarios, like policy gradient methods [29, 3, 28], RL with delayed feedback [22], configurable RL [27], and auxiliary tasks for imitation learning [11, 26]. While this model is very general, its regret guarantees are weak, both in terms of dependence on $K$ and on $H$ . In fact, very recently, [25] showed a regret lower bound of order $\\Omega(2^{H}K^{\\frac{d+1}{d+2}})$ , where $d$ is the dimension of the state-action space, which makes this family of problems statistically unfeasible. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another part of the literature has focused instead on representation classes of MDPs. In this paper, we call \"representation class\" a family of problems that depend both on an MDP and on an exogenous element, usually a feature map. One example can be found in the popular class of Linear $M D P s$ [40, 18], which assumes that both the transition and the reward function can be factorized as a scalar product of a known feature map $\\phi$ of dimension $d_{\\phi}$ and some unknown vectors. Regret bounds of order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2}d_{\\phi}^{3/2}\\sqrt{K})$ are possible [18], which succeed in moving the complexity of the problem into the dimension $d_{\\phi}$ of the feature map. Unfortunately, this representation class is very restrictive: i) linearity is assumed on both the $p_{h}$ and $r_{h}$ functions; ii) the same linear factorization must be constant along the state-action space ${\\mathcal{S}}\\times{\\mathcal{A}}$ , which goes in the opposite direction w.r.t. the locality principle introduced by Lipschitz MDPs. The first issue is solved by [42], which significantly extends this class of process by assuming linearity on the Bellman optimality operator, which turns out to be much weaker. This representation class is known as MDPs with low inherent Bellman error, a generalization of linear MDPs that further allows for a small approximation error $\\mathcal{T}$ . ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Very recently, different kinds of assumptions for continuous spaces were introduced. In Kernelized MDPs [41], both the reward function and the transition function belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) induced by a known kernel coming from the Mat\u00e9rn covariance function with parameter $\\nu>0$ . The higher the value of $\\nu$ , the more stringent the assumption, as the corresponding RHKS contains fewer functions. This kind of assumption enforces the smoothness of the process, which is stronger for higher values of $\\nu$ . A generalization of this family can be found in Strongly smooth $M D P s$ [25], which require the transition and reward functions to be $\\nu$ \u2212times continuously differentiable. Although it is a wide, non-parametric family of processes, enforcing the smoothness of the transition function is rather demanding as it implies that the state $s^{\\prime}$ is affected by a smooth noise. For this reason, [25, 24] also defines the larger family of Weakly smooth $M D P s$ , which only requires the smoothness of the Bellman optimality operator. This model is extremely general, as it can also capture Lipschitz MDPs. Still, for the same reason, it is affected by an exponential lower bound in $H$ . Lastly, note that for the last three kinds of MDPs, Kernelized, Strongly and Weakly Smooth, the best-known regret bounds are linear in $K$ for some values of $d$ and $\\nu$ . As the regret is trivially bounded by $K$ , these bounds are vacuous, not guaranteeing convergence to the performance of the optimal policy.

In the second part of the paper, we have introduced a family called Mildly Smooth MDPs (Section 4), which generalizes all the known continuous MDP families where no-regret learning is feasible. Through an argument based on local Taylor polynomial approximation, we have proved that this family is a special instance of the Locally Linearizable MDPs, with a specific partition and feature map. Therefore, we were able to achieve, in Theorem 4, a regret bound for CINDERELLA in the family of Mildly Smooth MDPs, which constitutes the main result of this paper. Not only this bound surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of generality for feasible settings, but is also able to achieve improved regret bounds for Strongly Smooth MDPs and Kernelized MDPs. Crucially, our work proves the first regret bound that is non-vacuous in any regime for these two families.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.   \n(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).   \n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
