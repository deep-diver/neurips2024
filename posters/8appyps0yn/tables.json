The methods include standard GNNs with different node individualization schemes (none, relational pooling (RP), and Tinhofer) and a novel architecture called EGONN with varying individualization schemes. The goal is to assess the performance of these methods in detecting the presence of specific subgraphs (3-cycle, 4-cycle, 5-cycle, and complete bipartite graph K2,3) within the larger graphs.", "section": "5.3 Substructure identification"}, {"figure_path": "8APPypS0yN/tables/tables_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Covering numbers and classification accuracies on real-world datasets.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the performance of different GNN models (with and without individualization schemes) on four real-world datasets: NCI1, Mutagenicity, IMDB-b, and COLLAB-b.  For each dataset and model, it shows the covering number (N), the test accuracy (Test), and the difference between test and train accuracy (Diff).  The covering number serves as a proxy for sample complexity.  The results illustrate the impact of different node individualization schemes on generalization performance.", "section": "5.4 Covering numbers"}, {"figure_path": "8APPypS0yN/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Overview of real-world and synthetic graph dataset properties. Datasets marked (*) are composed of subsets of the original datasets. The column \u201cWL number\u201d denotes the minimum number of WL iterations necessary to distinguish all graphs.

For each dataset, it lists the number of graphs, the number of classes, the average number of nodes and edges per graph, whether the graphs have node labels (+ indicates presence, - indicates absence), and the minimum number of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) iterations needed to distinguish all graphs in the dataset.  A '-' indicates that WL iterations cannot distinguish all graphs in the dataset.", "section": "E.2 Datasets"}]
