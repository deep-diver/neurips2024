The Mamba model, a state-space model, has demonstrated impressive efficiency and accuracy in handling high-resolution images across various vision tasks.  However, the factors behind Mamba's success have remained unclear. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the similarities and differences between the effective Mamba model and subpar linear attention Transformer models. The researchers reformulate both models using a unified framework, revealing that Mamba is essentially a variant of linear attention Transformer with six key distinctions.\nThis paper meticulously analyzes each of the six distinctions: input gate, forget gate, shortcut, lack of attention normalization, single-head design, and modified block design. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation using vision tasks like image classification and high-resolution dense prediction, the study identifies the forget gate and block design as the core contributors to Mamba's success. Building upon these findings, the researchers propose a new model, Mamba-Inspired Linear Attention (MILA), by incorporating these key design elements into linear attention.  MILA demonstrates superior performance across various vision tasks while also exhibiting parallelizable computation and fast inference speeds, thus showcasing the potential of linear attention for advanced visual processing.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "LvJ1R88KAk/podcast.wav"}
