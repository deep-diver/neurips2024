By exploring the similarities and disparities between the effective Mamba and subpar linear attention Transformer, we provide comprehensive analyses to demystify the key factors behind Mamba\u2019s success.

Hence, the forget gate $\\widetilde{A}_{i}$ plays an important role in selective SSM. ", "page_idx": 4}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite its effectiveness, incorporating the forget gate also poses significant challenges. Firstly, it forces the model to adopt the recurrent formulation during both training and inference. Previous state space models typically use global convolution for efficient parallelizable training, which is incompatible with selective SSM due to the input-dependency of $\\widetilde{A}_{i}$ . As a remedy, Mamba [14] proposes a hardware-aware algorithm to speed up computation by performing parallel scan in recurrent mode (see the abstract of [14]). Although effective, such recurrent calculation unavoidably reduces model throughput and is still slower than parallel linear attention (eq. (2)). Secondly, the forget gate inherently functions in causal mode, which may not be very suitable for non-autoregressive vision models. Using the forget gate $\\widetilde{A}_{i}$ in vision tasks requires transforming the image into a 1D sequence and conducting recurrent co mputation, which limits the receptive field of each image token to its preceding sequence and incurs extra latency. Therefore, we believe that the forget gate is ideally suited for modeling causal data, which naturally needs auto-regressive training and recurrent calculation. However, it may not be as suitable for non-causal data like images. We further speculate that a suitable positional encoding can substitute for the forget gate, since certain positional encodings, such as LePE [9] and RoPE [41], can also provide local bias and positional information.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
