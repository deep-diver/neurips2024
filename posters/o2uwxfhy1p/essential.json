However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding comparing single- and multi-modal approaches has been lacking. This paper tackles this challenge by providing a theoretical analysis and experimental validation comparing the optimization and generalization performance of multi-modal and single-modal contrastive learning.  The research highlights the importance of understanding feature learning dynamics to guide model design and training.\nThe study introduces a novel theoretical framework using a data generation model with signal and noise to analyze feature learning. By applying a trajectory-based optimization analysis and characterizing the generalization capabilities on downstream tasks, the authors show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the critical factor determining generalization performance.  **Multi-modal learning excels due to the cooperation between modalities, leading to better feature learning and enhanced performance compared to single-modal methods.**  The empirical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets support their theoretical findings.", "affiliation": "RIKEN AIP", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "O2UwxfhY1P/podcast.wav"}
