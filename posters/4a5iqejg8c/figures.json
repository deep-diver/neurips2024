[{"figure_path": "4A5IQEjG8c/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: (a) HMVC input hypergraph: a 3-uniform hypergraph with 4 vertices and 3 hyperedges. (b) SNN for QUBO (9) derived from (a). Both the variables zi and introduced slack variables are NEBM neurons. The edge weights are omitted for brevity. (c) The SNN from our method for input (a). NEBM and FB neurons are in orange and green resp. Dashed circles indicate self-connections.", "description": "This figure compares three different Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). (a) shows a 3-uniform hypergraph representing the Hypergraph Minimum Vertex Cover (HMVC) problem. (b) illustrates a QUBO-based SNN for solving the HMVC problem using the QUBO formulation, which incorporates slack variables.  (c) presents the Slack-Free (SF) HMVC SNN proposed by the authors. This novel architecture doesn't use the QUBO formulation and incorporates custom feedback neurons for constraint checking and correction.", "section": "4 Slack-free SNN formulation for HMVC"}]
