The methods compared are: Direct sampling (directly sampling 128 frames from short video models), Sliding window (applying temporal sliding windows to short video models), FreeNoise [19] (a method that introduces repeat input noise to maintain temporal coherence), and the proposed FreeLong method. The comparison is based on six metrics: Subject consistency (Sub), Background consistency (Back), Motion smoothness (Motion), Temporal Flickering (Flicker), Imaging quality (Imaging), and Inference time. Higher scores indicate better performance for the first five metrics, while lower scores indicate better performance for inference time.", "section": "5.1 Implementation Details"}, {"figure_path": "X9Fga52OOv/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative Comparison. \u201cDirect sampling\u201d and \u201cSliding window\u201d indicate directly sampling 128 frames and applying temporal sliding windows based on short video generation models, respectively. Compared to these methods, our FreeLong achieves consistent long video generation with high fidelity.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different methods for generating long videos, including direct sampling, sliding window, FreeNoise, and the proposed FreeLong method.  The comparison is based on several metrics evaluating aspects of video consistency (Subject and Background consistency) and fidelity (Motion smoothness, Flicker, and Imaging quality). Inference time is also included for evaluating the efficiency of each method.  The results show that FreeLong outperforms other methods in generating high-fidelity and consistent long videos.", "section": "5.1 Implementation Details"}]
