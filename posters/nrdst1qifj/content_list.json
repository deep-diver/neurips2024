In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix.

Although at the training stage, substantial efforts [38, 4] have been invested to align the outputs of LLMs with human values, recent studies reveal that LLMs may still output inappropriate content when facing well-designed adversarial prompts [43, 27].

With the rapid advancement of LLMs, however, \u201cjailbreaking\u201d has found a new application: manipulating prompts to make these models generate prohibited or unauthorized content. Initial jailbreak attacks in LLMs were mainly manually crafted, such as role-play [9, 13], prompt injection [5, 68, 36], rewriting in rare languages [15, 28, 25] or Base64 coding [52]. Zou et al. [70] first investigate how to craft jailbreak prompts automatically and propose the GCG attack. However, the application of GCG makes it vulnerable to perplexity filters. Therefore, future work such as AutoDAN [69] and COLD [18] propose an additional loss term and controllable text generation techniques to increase the interpretability, respectively. In addition, for closed-source LLMs, the inaccessibility of their parameters makes it unavailable to perform the GCG attack directly on those models. Advancements in recent works have well addressed this issue: ICA attack in [54, 23] take advantage of In-Context Learning [16] and jailbreak the models with a few malicious demonstrations. Additionally, PAIR [12] and TAP [33] craft the jailbreak prompts with a red-teaming LLM which makes it capable of jailbreaking LLMs in twenty queries. Due to the significant threat of the aforementioned methods, it is still an unsolved problem to develop effective defenses to protect LLMs from those attacks.

In response to the threat, several defense strategies have emerged, mainly divided into training-based and test-based approaches. Training-based defenses focus on finetuning the parameters of LLMs for jailbreak immunity. In [22, 8], they first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by blending the harmful prompts with the harmless prompts, though this approach lacks robustness against the automatic attacks. Therefore, follow-up works address this limitation by augmenting the attack prompts [14], gradient ascent with affirmative responses [7] or unlearning the harmful knowledge [20, 65]. Compared to training-based defense, test-based defense aims to defend against jailbreak attacks efficiently. For instance, from the input perspective, in [22, 2], they introduce perplexity filtering to detect unreadable adversarial strings, such as the GCG attack. In addition, jailbreak prompts are demonstrated more sensitive to random perturbation [26], safety-aware decoding [59], self-correction [37, 47], in-context learning [54] or a secure system prompt [58]. However, all of them need human heuristics, which limits their performances when meeting LLMs training in different distributions.

For example, on Vicuna-7B, the defense control crafted on Llama-3-8B reduced the ASR of GCG attack from $92\\%$ to $2\\%$ . Additionally, the lowest ASR is achieved when the surrogate and target models are the same, likely because directly optimizing on the protected model better fits its training domains. Comparing the ASR when the source and target models are different, we find that PAT shows better transferability between Llama-2-7B and Llama-3-8B. We conjecture that it is because they might share high similarity in architectures and training data.

Here, we conduct experiments on GPT-3.5 [57] and GPT4 [1], the two most outstanding star products of OpenAI. Following Section 4.2, the performances of PAT are evaluated against five attacks. For GCG, the adversarial suffix is crafted with the ensemble of Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B [67] as proposed in their original paper [70]. For AutoDAN, we transfer the suffix crafted on Vicuna-7B to attack GPTs. The settings of other attacks are the same as those in the grey-box setting. To enhance PAT\u2019s transferability, we optimize the defense control with min-max formulations with the combination of Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B models. We compare its performances with ICD [54], SmoothLLM [39] and Self-reminder [58]. We do not compare with DRO and SafeDecoding because both of them can be applied only for open-source models.

In [52], they first study the design principles of those attacks and classify them into two partitions, i.e. competing objectives (CO) and mismatched generalizations (MG). The first one appears when the requirements of users conflict with the safety goal, including Always Intelligent and Machiavellian attack (AIM), Prefix Injection attack (PI) and Refusal Suppression attack (RS).

To measure the benign utility of the model, we take MMLU as the metric for evaluation. For the settings of other configurations, we keep the same as those in Section 4.1. As shown in Figure 4 (a), with the increase of $\\lvert\\mathcal{Z}_{d e f}\\rvert$ , we see that the ASR of attacks will decrease to near zero. This is because more defense tokens will strengthen the defense effect of PAT, making it more resistant to current attacks. However, an excessively large $\\lvert\\mathcal{Z}_{d e f}\\rvert$ might potentially bring a negative impact on the benign utility of models. We conjecture this is because a longer prompt will introduce more redundant information, which is not always helpful for benign conversations. As for the trade-off coefficient $\\alpha$ , the results in Figure 4 (b) indicate that smaller $\\alpha$ means better robustness to existing attacks. But it also means worse benign utility.

The results demonstrate that, compared to the unprotected setting, the application of our defense (PAT) significantly enhances the model\u2019s resistance to various adaptive attacks, reducing the ASR across different attack methods. For instance, without protection, Vicuna-7B shows an ASR of $92\\%$ against the GCG attack, which decreases to $23\\%$ when the protection is applied. Similarly, for Llama-2-7B, the ASR against the GCG attack drops from $36\\%$ to $12\\%$ after applying PAT.

More specifically, inspired by the logic of adversarial training, we designed a framework for iteratively updating the attack and defense controls. During the inference stage, the defense control is added before the user\u2019s prompt. Due to its short length, it will bring a negligible burden to the model\u2019s operational efficiency. Experiments show that PAT not only demonstrates great defense performance under the grey-box setting but also processes excellent transferability across open-source and closed-source models. In addition to automatic attacks, our further studies reveal that PAT can also successfully resist attacks crafted by ordinary persons or adaptive attackers, making it a realistic defense deployed in real life. We hope our work not only explores a novel defense method against Jailbreak attacks but also serves as a cornerstone for building trustworthy large language models.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
