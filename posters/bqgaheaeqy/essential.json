Existing methods often rely on simplifying assumptions or require lengthy optimization, limiting their real-world applicability. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing a novel approach that directly processes 2D point tracks extracted from videos. The main difficulty lies in the ill-posed nature of inferring 3D information from 2D data.  This is an inherently ambiguous problem. \nThe proposed approach, called TRACKSTO4D, leverages a deep neural network to learn the mapping from 2D point tracks to 3D structure and camera poses. This learning-based approach avoids the need for time-consuming optimization.  The method cleverly integrates a low-rank movement assumption to address the ill-posed nature of the problem and incorporates the symmetries present in 2D point tracks data.  TRACKSTO4D demonstrates substantial improvements in inference speed and accuracy, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods while generalizing exceptionally well to unseen data.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "bqGAheAeQY/podcast.wav"}
