This paper addresses this gap by analyzing compressed vectors derived from transformers, which represent functions learned by ICL.  Current methods struggle with the efficiency and robustness of these vectors, especially when dealing with numerous examples. \n\nThe researchers propose inner and momentum optimization methods to progressively refine the 'state vector' (a representation of the ICL function) at test time.  They also introduce a divide-and-conquer aggregation technique to efficiently manage many examples. Experiments show that these methods effectively enhance state vectors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks.  The contributions advance understanding of ICL's workings and enable more effective use of LLMs in various applications.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "gnnmB7y0Xx/podcast.wav"}
