For each task, it reports the percentage of initial states for which safety is verified over a given horizon (Verified-K), the maximum horizon for which safety is verified for all initial states (Verified-Max), the percentage of initial states for which safety is empirically achieved over given horizons (Emp-K), and the average reward achieved.  The results illustrate the superior performance of the VSRL approach in terms of both verified and empirical safety, while also maintaining high reward in most scenarios.", "section": "4.2 Results"}, {"figure_path": "tGDUDKirAy/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Results for verified safety, empirical safety and average reward.
