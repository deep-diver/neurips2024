Existing approaches often struggle to scale to longer safety horizons or complex dynamics.  This is due to limitations in verification techniques and the difficulty of learning a single universal controller that works across all possible initial states. \nThe proposed method, VSRL, addresses these limitations by introducing three key innovations:  a novel curriculum learning scheme to gradually increase the verification horizon; incremental verification to reuse information from previous steps, and learning multiple controllers customized for different initial states.  VSRL demonstrates significant improvements in verified safety over existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an order of magnitude longer safety horizons while maintaining high reward.  Experiments on multiple complex control problems confirm this improvement, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "affiliation": "Washington University in St. Louis", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "tGDUDKirAy/podcast.wav"}
