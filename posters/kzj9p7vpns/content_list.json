Improvements that have been proposed require either an empirical preset pruning ratio or importance score threshold to prune the point cloud. Such hyperparameters require multiple rounds of training to optimize and achieve the maximum pruning ratio while maintaining the rendering quality for each scene.

NeRF has gained considerable attention in the NVS community due to its simple implementation and excellent performance. However, in order to obtain a point in the space, NeRF needs to perform an MLP inference. Each pixel rendered requires processing a ray and there are many sample points along each ray. Consequently, rendering an image requires a large amount of MLP inference operations. Thus, rendering speed becomes a major drawback of the NeRF method.

[2023]) achieves both good quality and high rendering speed, making it a hot topic in the community. 3DGS uses 3D Gaussian models with color parameters to fit the scene and develops a training framework to optimize the model parameters.

These methods follow a similar pruning approach through defining an importance score for each Gaussian point and prune the points with such importance score below a preset empirical threshold. However, a major drawback of these methods is that the preset threshold must be manually tuned through multiple rounds of training process to identify the favorable pruning ratio to minimize the number of Gaussian points while keeping the rendering quality. To make matters worse, such number of points may vary depending on different scenes, which requires manual pruning ratio searching for each scene. For example, the blue and red lines in Figure 1 show the rendering quality of Kitchen and Room scenes, respectively, in MipNeRF360 scenes (Barron et al.

It is clearly seen that a smaller pruning ratio will not hamper the rendering quality, and the rendering quality will start to decrease with much more aggressive pruning ratios.

This approach achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed while maintaining relatively short training time. A series of methods have been introduced to improve the rendering quality through using regularization for better optimization, including depth map (Chung et al. [2023], Li et al.

Recent research has focused on compression methods to enhance the efficiency of this representation. Notably, several studies (Fan et al. [2023], Fang and Wang [2024], Niemeyer et al. [2024]) have proposed using predefined scores as pruning criteria to keep Gaussians that significantly contribute to rendering quality. Compact3D (Lee et al.

These approaches present two main challenges: first, whether the criteria accurately reflect the importance of the Gaussians, and second, the need for a manually selected pruning threshold to decide the level of pruning. In this work, we address these issues by introducing a trainable mask activated by a Gumbel-sigmoid function, applied to the scores derived from prior methods or directly to the scale and opacity of each Gaussian for more flexibility.
