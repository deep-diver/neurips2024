The process is divided into two stages: densification and learning-to-prune. In the densification stage, the adaptive density control strategy is used to adjust the number of Gaussian points. Subsequently, in the learning-to-prune stage, a trainable mask is applied to the importance score to automatically find a favorable pruning ratio. The figure shows the flow of data and operations between different components in each stage, including initialization, densification, score calculation, element-wise multiplication of the score with the mask, and Gaussian point adjustment.", "section": "3.3 Learning-to-Prune 3DGS"}, {"figure_path": "kzJ9P7VPnS/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Comparison between Sigmoid and Gumbel-Sigmoid.

The Gumbel-Sigmoid function is designed to produce outputs that are closer to either 0 or 1, making it a better approximation of a binary mask than the standard Sigmoid function.

The Sigmoid function produces a smooth curve with values spread across the entire range (0, 1). Conversely, the Gumbel-Sigmoid function concentrates the output around the values 0 and 1, resulting in a distribution much closer to a binary distribution.  This demonstrates that the Gumbel-Sigmoid function is a better approximation for a binary mask which is necessary because the hard threshold function used for pruning in the traditional approach is not differentiable.", "section": "3.3 Learning-to-Prune 3DGS"}, {"figure_path": "kzJ9P7VPnS/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The performance changes with the pruning ratio of RadSplat on the MipNeRF360 dataset.
