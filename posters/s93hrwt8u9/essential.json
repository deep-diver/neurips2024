Backpropagation, a crucial step in training, is particularly memory-intensive because it requires storing large activation maps.  Existing memory-saving techniques often compromise model accuracy. \nThis research tackles the memory bottleneck by using tensor decomposition (Singular Value Decomposition and High-Order SVD) to compress activation maps.  **The approach preserves key information for learning while significantly reducing memory usage.**  Experiments on various architectures and datasets show that this method outperforms existing techniques in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and memory consumption, offering a potential breakthrough for on-device deep learning.", "affiliation": "Telecom Paris", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "S93hrwT8u9/podcast.wav"}
