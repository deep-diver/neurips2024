Current methods for handling approximate symmetries are often limited in applicability. Neural Processes (NPs), being a popular meta-learning model, are greatly impacted by this issue as many real-world datasets which NPs are often used for only have approximate symmetries.\nThis paper tackles this challenge by developing a general framework for building approximately equivariant architectures.  The key idea is to approximate non-equivariant mappings using equivariant ones with additional fixed inputs, effectively relaxing strict equivariance constraints in a data-driven manner. This method is shown to significantly improve the performance of NPs on synthetic and real-world regression tasks, outperforming both strictly equivariant and non-equivariant counterparts.", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "dqT9MC5NQl/podcast.wav"}
