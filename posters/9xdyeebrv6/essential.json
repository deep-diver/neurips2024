Existing coded computing methods, while improving reliability, often rely on algebraic coding theory and struggle with machine learning workloads. They may not be suitable for all computation types and can be numerically unstable. \nThis paper introduces LeTCC, a novel framework that integrates learning theory with coded computing.  It defines the loss function as the mean squared error and derives optimal encoding/decoding functions in the second-order Sobolev space, minimizing this error.  LeTCC significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy and convergence rate across various machine learning models and settings, effectively addressing the challenges of stragglers and noisy computations.", "affiliation": "University of Minnesota", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "9XDYEEBRV6/podcast.wav"}
