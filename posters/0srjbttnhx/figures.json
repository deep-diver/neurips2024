Vanilla Mixup, shown in (a), mixes nodes from different classes, resulting in noisy labels and incorrect message passing.

It starts with an input graph containing sparsely labeled nodes. A label generator assigns low-quality labels to the unlabeled nodes using pseudo-labeling.  Then, Intra-Class Mixup generates high-quality labeled nodes by mixing low-quality labeled nodes of the same class. The method proceeds to identify and connect high-confidence nodes of the same class as neighbors for the newly generated nodes.  Finally, a label detector further refines labels for increased accuracy. This process enriches both the accuracy of node labels and the information content within the graph's neighborhood structure.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "0SRJBtTNhX/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: a) Experimental results using different proportions of unlabeled nodes show that performance improves as more unlabeled nodes are utilized. b) Sensitivity analysis of \u03bb indicates that the best performance is achieved when \u03bb = 0.5. c) Analysis with low-quality pseudo-labels.
