{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in graph neural networks (GNNs) as it directly addresses the critical issues of **data scarcity and limited neighborhood information** that hinder GNN performance.  By introducing IntraMix, a novel data augmentation method, the paper offers a **practical solution** for enhancing GNN accuracy and generalizability. The proposed method is theoretically grounded, easily implementable, and demonstrates significant improvement across diverse GNNs and datasets. This work paves the way for future research exploring the use of IntraMix in various applications and its potential to tackle the over-smoothing problem often associated with deeper GNNs.

Existing augmentation methods usually address only one of these issues, often with added training costs or simplified approaches that limit generalization. This research introduces IntraMix, a novel method to simultaneously tackle both issues. \nIntraMix uses Intra-Class Mixup to generate high-quality labeled data at low cost by blending inaccurate data of the same class. It then strategically selects highly confident nodes within the same class as new neighbors, enriching graph neighborhoods.  Extensive experiments on various GNNs and datasets show that IntraMix significantly boosts accuracy and generalizes effectively, thereby challenging the limitations of vanilla Mixup in node classification.
