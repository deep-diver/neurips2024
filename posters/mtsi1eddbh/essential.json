However, existing L2D methods are limited to single objectives, neglecting crucial constraints like fairness and expert time. This research identifies a significant gap in developing L2D systems under multiple constraints and explores the limitations of existing methods.\nThis paper introduces a novel post-processing framework using a generalized Neyman-Pearson lemma (d-GNP) that achieves a Bayes-optimal solution for multi-objective L2D problems under constraints. The method involves creating embedding functions to represent constraints and then using d-GNP to estimate the optimal classifier and rejection function. Experiments demonstrate improvements in constraint violation compared to baselines across various datasets.  This work shows significant promise for handling complex decision-making problems by allowing for the optimization of multiple objectives while considering various real-world constraints.", "affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Fairness"}, "podcast_path": "Mtsi1eDdbH/podcast.wav"}
