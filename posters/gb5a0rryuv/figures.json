It starts with fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using a small amount of annotated data. Then, knowledge extraction is performed, integrating Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Resolution (ER) tasks.  The extracted concepts are organized into a well-defined ontology. Finally, the knowledge graph is completed through node similarity algorithms, enhancing its accuracy and predictive power. The three main tasks in the pipeline are Ontology Design, Knowledge Extraction, and Entity Resolution, each broken down into sub-tasks to show the methodology's complexity.", "section": "2 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "GB5a0RRYuv/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: This schematic represents the (a) MKG schema and (b) an example of path in MKG between the \"Name\" node \"Copper Indium Gallium Selenide\" and \"Application\" node \"Thin Films\".", "description": "This figure illustrates the schema of the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG) and a sample path within the graph.
