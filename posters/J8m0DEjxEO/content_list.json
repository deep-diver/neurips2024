Nevertheless, to ensure these sophisticated systems remain safe and   \n21 ethical, preventing them from generating harmful responses, LLMs typically undergo comprehensive   \n22 safety training [23, 16, 6]. This critical training process enables models to refuse inappropriate   \n23 requests and produce responses that are socially acceptable and contextually suitable, which aims at   \n24 significantly enhancing their functional utility in real-world NLP applications [23, 16, 6].   \n25 However, despite these established safety protocols, aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial   \n26 attacks that can provoke toxic responses [9], particularly those that employ optimization-based   \n27 approaches. These attacks typically exploit the model\u2019s inherent security flaw by optimizing for   \n28 malicious adversarial input, including optimization-based gradient-searching methods [35, 34, 13],   \n29 approaches that adapt genetic algorithms [17, 19] and LLM-aided jailbreakings [10, 21], collectively   \n30 highlighting the ongoing security \u2018bugs\u2019 of advanced LLMs.   \n31 In this paper, we focus on the optimization-based attack, whose target is to maximize the probability   \n32 of generating harmful textual content. We notice two limitations with existing optimization-based   \n33 attacks. First, these methods heavily rely on the likelihood of generating target tokens as an indicator   \n34 of a successful jailbreak. Although many techniques are developed for maximizing this targeted   \n35 probability [35, 34, 13, 5, 17, 19], the recent study points out that a high probability of harmful tokens   \n36 does not necessarily equate to a successful jailbreak [18]. For example, as shown in figure 1, the   \n37 adversarial prompt crafted by the popular Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) [35] may initially cause   \n38 the LLM to generate the target tokens, but subsequently, the model could reject the request, rendering   \n39 the jailbreak unsuccessful. Second, existing attack frameworks predominantly operate at the output   \n40 layer of LLMs, evaluating performance based on metrics like the probability of target tokens [35,   \n41 34, 13, 5, 17, 19] or using scores from auxiliary evaluation models [10]. These approaches neglect   \n42 the internal workings of LLMs, resulting in a lack of interpretability. Without this understanding, it   \n43 would be challenging to grasp why some attacks succeed while others fail, limiting the development   \n44 of more effective attack strategies.   \n45 To mitigate these issues, we advocate for a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that   \n46 contribute to the success of LLM jailbreaks. Our key insight is the crucial role of the attention score,   \n47 which reveals where the model focuses during token generation, in achieving successful jailbreaking.   \n48 Specifically, in aligned LLMs, the input typically consists of two parts: a system prompt (though,   \n49 for some LLMs, defaulted to be empty) and a user prompt, assuming a zero-shot scenario. In the   \n50 jailbreaking context, the user prompt can be further segmented into the goal prompt, representing   \n51 the user\u2019s intent, and the adversarial suffix, which our method targets for optimization to facilitate   \n52 jailbreak. In Figure 2, we illustrate the distribution of the model\u2019s attention score across these   \n53 three input components during the jailbreak process. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the   \n54 model\u2019s attention score on the adversarial suffix could serve as a strong indicator of the jailbreaking   \n55 performance, e.g., a successful jailbreak typically corresponds with a high attention score on the   \n56 adversarial suffix. The rationale behind this is that as the attention score on the adversarial suffix   \n57 increases, the model\u2019s focus on the system prompt and the input goal would decrease, thereby   \n58 diminishing their effectiveness in safeguarding the system and giving the adversarial suffix a higher   \n59 chance to circumvent the model\u2019s safety protocols.   \n60 Building upon this key observation, we introduce AttnGCG. AttnGCG leverages the attention score   \n61 as an additional optimization target, creating adversarial suffixes that are more challenging for LLMs   \n62 to defend against. Specifically, we augment the traditional GCG objective with an auxiliary attention   \n63 loss function, which gradually increases the importance of the suffix during adversarial training.   \n64 By pivoting the optimization focus from solely targeting token probabilities to also manipulating   \n65 models\u2019 attention scores, we concentrate the model\u2019s attention more effectively on the adversarial   \n66 suffix, thereby enhancing jailbreak success, resulting in an increase in attack success rate from an   \n67 average of $64.3\\%$ to $70.6\\%$ over 7 aligned LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of   \n68 our method by adding it to other existing jailbreaking techniques, which register an average of $5.3\\%$   \n69 ASR increases over the vanilla GCG. Additionally, AttnGCG exhibits stronger transferability to   \n70 closed-source LLMs, achieving an average improvement of $2.8\\%$ over the GCG baseline. Qualitative   \n71 visualizations are also provided to showcase that the the attention scores of the model to adversarial   \n72 suffixes can serve as an interpretable indicator of jailbreaking performance, providing new insights   \n73 for evaluating and enhancing the quality of an adversarial prompt.

PGD [13]   \n212 revisit Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) on the continuously relaxed input prompt for creating   \n213 adversarial prompts. Genetic-based methods [17, 19] leverage the genetic algorithm to produce   \n214 universal and transferrable prompts to attack black-box LLMs. [5] propose to first manually design an   \n215 adversarial template, then use random search to maximize the target probability for jailbreaking black   \n216 box LLMs. Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) [10] use an attacker LLM to generate   \n217 jailbreaks for the targeted LLM with iterative queries for the target LLM to update and refine a   \n218 candidate jailbreak. Building upon PAIR, [21] propose a refined version for adversarial prompt   \n219 searching, which employ a tree-based search method. Our AttnGCG belongs to the optimization  \n220 based category and employ the attention score as an additional objective for enhanced jailbreaking.   \n221 Optimization-free Jailbreaking Optimization-free jailbreakings generally attack models by twitch  \n222 ing the input prompts. Early attack strategies are tested on ChatGPT since its initial release, users   \n223 realized that by \u201cdelicately\u201d design the input prompts, the aligned ChatGPT always chooses to answer   \n224 malicious questions without refusal [11, 4, 8]. Since this kind of attack method only requires adjust   \n225 the model input, it has drawn huge attention from role play [28] to semi-subversion of the safety train  \n226 ing objective [29]. A main trend for producing the malicious textual prompt is by leveraging another   \n227 LLM. Shah et al. [25] employ an LLM that is guided by persona modulation to generate jailbreaking   \n228 prompts. GPTFuzzer [31] demonstrate an iterative jailbreaking enhancement over human-written   \n229 templates with LLMs. Zeng et al. [33] and Takemoto [26] chose to refine the input adversarial   \n230 examples using stronger LLMs (e.g., fintuned GPT-3.5) and high-quality prompts. Deng et al. [12]   \n231 propose a novel attacking using reverse engineering and an LLM as the automatic prompt generator.   \n232 Besides, by interpolating rare linguistic knowledge, Yuan et al. [32] discover the intriguing fact that   \n233 conducting chats in cipher can bypass the LLM safety alignment.

Based on this insight, we   \n239 proposed a novel method termed AttnGCG that directly manipulates the model\u2019s attention score to   \n240 optimize for a enhanced jailbreaking suffix. Our experiments have shown an impressive improvement   \n241 in both white box attacks and transfer attacks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by visualizing   \n242 the model\u2019s attention score, we can provide a clear insight on how jailbreaking is achieved by   \n243 manipulating the attention distributions. We believe our work can inspire future works on the attack   \n244 and defense of LLMs.   \n245 Limitations The transfer attack performance of AttnGCG is unsatisfactory on the latest models,   \n246 including Gemini-1.5-Pro-latest, Gemini-1.5-Flash, and GPT-4o, necessitating further research to   \n247 address this issue.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

Papers cannot be rejected simply for not   \n617 including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source   \n618 benchmark).   \n619 \u2022 The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to   \n620 reproduce the results.

Experiment Statistical Significance   \n645 Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate   \n646 information about the statistical significance of the experiments?   \n647 Answer: [Yes]   \n648 Justification: The results presented in our experiments are all averages, including both   \n649 model-level averages and behavior-level averages (see Table 1). Additionally, we have   \n650 disabled the randomness of the relevant models, and all hyperparameters are fixed (see the   \n651 Appendix A.4). Therefore, the experimental results have statistical significance and can   \n652 support our core conclusions.   \n653 Guidelines:   \n654 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n655 \u2022 The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi  \n656 dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support   \n657 the main claims of the paper.   \n658 \u2022 The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for   \n659 example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall   \n660 run with given experimental conditions).   \n661 \u2022 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,   \n662 call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)   \n663 \u2022 The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).   \n664 \u2022 It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error   \n665 of the mean.   \n666 \u2022 It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should   \n667 preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a $96\\%$ CI, if the hypothesis   \n668 of Normality of errors is not verified.   \n669 \u2022 For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or   \n670 figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative   \n671 error rates).   \n672 \u2022 If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how   \n673 they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.   \n674 8. Experiments Compute Resources   \n675 Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com  \n676 puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce   \n677 the experiments?   \n678 Answer: [Yes]   \n679 Justification: We report the memory of our computer resources and time of execution in our   \n680 experiments in the Appendix A.5.   \n681 Guidelines:   \n682 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.   \n683 \u2022 The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,   \n684 or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.   \n685 \u2022 The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual   \n686 experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.   \n687 \u2022 The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute   \n688 than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that   \n689 didn\u2019t make it into the paper).   \n690 9. Code Of Ethics   \n691 Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the   \n692 NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?   \n693 Answer: [Yes]   \n694 Justification: Since the work in this paper involves jailbreaking LLMs, which carries security   \n695 risks, we will not open-source our code to the public until the security disclosure process is   \n696 completed. Before this, only vetted private requests will be allowed. We consider the ethical   \n697 implications of this work in Section 6 and disclose essential elements for reproducibility in   \n698 Section 3.1 and the Appendix A.4, in alignment with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.   \n699 Guidelines:   \n700 \u2022 The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.   \n701 \u2022 If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a   \n702 deviation from the Code of Ethics.   \n703 \u2022 The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid  \n704 eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

", "page_idx": 20}, {"type": "text", "text": "09 Justification: We discuss this in Section 6. 710 Guidelines: 711 \u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. 712 \u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal 713 impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. 714 \u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses 715 (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations 716 (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific 717 groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. 718 \u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied 719 to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to   \n720 any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate   \n721 to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to   \n722 generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out   \n723 that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train   \n724 models that generate Deepfakes faster. 725 \u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is   \n726 being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the   \n727 technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following   \n728 from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n729 \u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation 730 strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,   \n731 mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from 32 feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).   \n733 11. Safeguards   \n734 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible   \n735 release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,   \n736 image generators, or scraped datasets)?   \n737 Answer: [Yes] 738 Justification: For safety concerns, we will not open-source our code to the public until the 739 security disclosure process is completed. And the existing prompts generated by our method 740 will not be released with our code. Only vetted private requests, such as those for related 741 research purposes, will be permitted. 742 Guidelines: 743 \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. 744 \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with 745 necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring 746 that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing 747 safety filters. 748 \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors 749 should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. 750 \u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do   \n751 not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best 752 faith effort. 753 12. Licenses for existing assets 754 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in 55 the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and   \n756 properly respected?   \n757 Answer: [Yes]   \n758 Justification: In the Section 2, we clearly state the citation of the existing AdvBench dataset   \n759 and GCG algorithm, including the relevant license in the code. 760 Guidelines:   \n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.   \n\u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.   \n\u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.   \n\u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.   \n\u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.   \n\u2022 If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.   \n\u2022 For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.   \n\u2022 If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset\u2019s creators.
