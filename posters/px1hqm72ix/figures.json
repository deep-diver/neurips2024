It starts with pre-training to obtain pre-trained item embeddings.  The core of the system is GPR4DUR, which takes a user's observed points (movie interactions) and their corresponding observed values (ratings) as input, utilizing a GPR model to generate predicted scores for all items.  Uncertainty is visualized in the predicted scores, representing higher uncertainty for items with fewer interactions. Finally, a retrieval list generation step uses methods like UCB or Thompson sampling to select top-N items based on the predicted scores and associated uncertainties, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation.", "section": "4 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "Px1hQM72iX/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The t-SNE visualization of the prediction score between a picked user to all items in the MovieLens dataset.
