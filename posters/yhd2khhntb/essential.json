Existing methods struggle in non-stationary environments where influence relationships between variables change over time. Moreover, they often ignore the costs associated with decision actions.\nThis paper introduces AUF-MICNS, a novel sequential method designed to tackle the AUF problem in non-stationary settings.  **AUF-MICNS dynamically updates estimates of changing influence relations**, leveraging an online-ensemble approach to handle unknown degrees of non-stationarity.  **It also incorporates action costs into its decision-making process**, formulating the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program solvable in polynomial time.  Empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "yhd2kHHNtB/podcast.wav"}
