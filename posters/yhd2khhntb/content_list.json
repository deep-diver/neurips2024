In many real-world scenarios, rather than solely predicting an outcome using an ML model, the crucial concern is how to make decisions to prevent the occurrence of undesired outcomes, known as the avoiding undesired future $(A U F)$ problem. To this end, a new framework called rehearsal learning has been proposed recently, which works effectively in stationary environments by leveraging the influence relations among variables. In real tasks, however, the environments are usually non-stationary, where the influence relations may be dynamic, leading to the failure of AUF by the existing method. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential methodology that effectively updates the estimates of dynamic influence relations, which are crucial for rehearsal learning to prevent undesired outcomes in nonstationary environments. Meanwhile, we take the cost of decision actions into account and provide the formulation of AUF problem with minimal action cost under non-stationarity. We prove that in linear Gaussian cases, the problem can be transformed into the well-studied convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). In this way, we establish the first polynomial-time rehearsal-based approach for addressing the AUF problem.

Suppose at the beginning of a month, $\\mathbf{Y}$ is predicted to be undesired, i.e., the predicted sales of the month are lower than expected. In this case, the manager usually wants to take action by altering some intermediate variables $\\mathbf{Z}$ during the month to avoid this undesired outcome happening, e.g., modifying the discount to attract more customers. The problem of how to find effective actions in such situations is known as avoiding undesired future (AUF) [63].

For instance, in the aforementioned example, the factory manager can only adjust the selling strategy once per month. Therefore, decision-making algorithms that depend on numerous interactions, such as conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods [4], are not well-suited for the AUF problem [40]. Additionally, fundamentally vital decisions need to be made with human judgment, and therefore, it is desired to enable human decision-makers to understand why and how some actions can change the outcome. Due to these challenges, the structural relations among variables, which contain fine-grained information and are usually interpretable, are worth being considered to make decisions [36, 40].

Besides, causation should not be viewed as a prerequisite for decision-making problems, as humans can usually make good decisions without a thorough causal understanding [63]. Recognizing that correlation used in prediction is inadequate for decision-making whereas causation is too luxurious to be relied on, Zhou [63] emphasized the necessity of an intermediate relation that is stronger than correlation but less demanding than causation; this relation was subsequently called influence relation [64].

For example, modifying the discount into different levels results in different expenses, and the quantitative influence relation between pricing and sales can change seasonally for products such as the coat.

To this end, we present a sequential approach to maintain dynamic influence relations in non-stationary environments, and further propose an online-ensemble-based [60] sequential algorithm to deal with the unknown degree of non-stationarity. In addition, we design a cost function to quantify the costs of different decision actions. The cost function takes into account not only (a) different unit costs associated with different variables, but also (b) the distinct costs involved in altering a single variable to varying extents. Further, we expect that the suggested decisions can efficiently avoid undesired outcomes with a relatively high probability. Rather than using the sampling-based method that cannot be solved with any polynomial-time algorithm [40], we reveal that finding decision suggestions for AUF with minimal action cost can be modeled as a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which is solvable in polynomial time $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathbf{V}|^{3})$ with respect to the number of variables $|\\mathbf{V}|$ .

While hybrid online and offline RL methods have been introduced [48, 37], they overlook fine-grained structural information as well and require large offline datasets in practice. Moreover, it is worth noting that a fundamental limitation of applying RL to the AUF problem is that RL methods require a substantial number of interactions, which may be too luxurious or simply not tolerated in many real-world applications. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Causality. Identifying causal systems from observational and interventional data has been extensively studied [44, 50, 7, 58, 9], but these methods typically do not actively select interventions. Furthermore, significant research has focused on identifying causal structures or effects in interactive environments [18, 22, 53, 55, 39, 54, 57, 41], which predominantly aim to identify causal structures or effects. To incorporate additional utilities for decision-making, causal bandits and causal RL methods have been proposed to determine where to intervene [5, 24, 46, 26, 59, 12, 31]. The aforementioned methods generally rely on causal modeling, which may be luxurious or restrictive in some real-world decision-making cases [63, 40]. As identifying causations rely on some strong restrictions or assumptions, it is possible that we cannot find a feasible alteration. Conversely, correlation, which underpins most ML models, falls short of providing a solid foundation for making decisions. As a middle ground between causation and correlation, the influence relations form a more practical basis for decision-making [63]. Building on this concept, we employ the SRM developed by Qin et al. [40], which can adapt to dynamically evolving decision systems.

When Thirsty Thelma produces a small quantity of lemonade, her workforce is limited, and much of her equipment remains idle. The ease of utilizing these unused resources results in a substantial marginal product for an additional worker and a corresponding small marginal cost for producing an extra glass of lemonade. In contrast, as she increases lemonade production, her shop becomes crowded with workers, and most of her equipment is fully utilized. While additional workers can contribute to increased production, they must operate in crowded conditions and may face delays in equipment usage. Consequently, when the quantity of lemonade produced is already high, the marginal product of an extra worker diminishes, leading to a significant increase in the marginal cost of producing an extra glass of lemonade.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
