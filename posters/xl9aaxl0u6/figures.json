(b) Graph recovery vs. score MSE, d = 15", "description": "Figure 1 presents numerical evaluations of the theoretical analyses provided in Section 5. (a) shows the variation of model constants (\u03b7*, \u03b3*, \u03b2, \u03b2min) with respect to the latent dimension n. These constants determine the sample complexity bounds. (b) shows the variation of graph recovery rates with respect to the mean squared error of score estimations. Each data point corresponds to a different sample size N and different latent dimensions n. The graph recovery rate decays linearly with respect to log(MSE) in low MSE regime and it plateaus as the MSE increases. This behavior is due to the sensitivity of the proposed algorithms to the errors in estimating the approximate matrix ranks.", "section": "Experiments"}]
