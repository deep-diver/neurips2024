This oversight limits the models' ability to accurately represent and predict molecular properties which are highly dependent on the intricate relationships between atoms within these substructures. This paper tackles this critical limitation by proposing a novel approach. \nThe proposed model, SubgDiff, directly addresses this issue by incorporating substructural information into a diffusion model framework.  It does this using three key techniques: subgraph prediction, expectation state, and k-step same subgraph diffusion.  These techniques improve the model's ability to understand and utilize the relationships between atoms within substructures, ultimately resulting in **superior performance** on various downstream tasks such as molecular force prediction.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "iSMTo0toDO/podcast.wav"}
