It consists of four main stages: 1. Model-agnostic clustering groups similar data points together using embeddings from sentence transformers.  2. A proxy-based Shapley calculator then efficiently approximates the Shapley values (importance scores) for the representative data points within each cluster, focusing on task-specific objectives. 3. Optimization-aware sampling is then used to select data from the clusters based on their calculated Shapley values, considering both quality and diversity. 4. Finally, the selected dataset, a smaller subset of the original dataset, is formed, which is expected to achieve comparable performance to the original, larger dataset when used to fine-tune LLMs.", "section": "3 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "Gqou8PRgWq/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Performance of subsets with varying numbers of clusters in SHED.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of datasets curated by SHED using different numbers of clusters.  The left panel displays the accuracy on the MMLU test set, with the middle panel showing accuracy on the ARC-challenge test set.  Both panels compare the Quality-Ordered Cluster Sampling (QOCS) and Quality-Weighted Cluster Sampling (QWCS) methods across a range of cluster counts.  The right panel illustrates the computational time (in hours) required for the Shapley value calculation for datasets curated from MMLU and WizardLM, again demonstrating the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost as the number of clusters increases. The plots reveal the effect of increasing the number of clusters on the performance of different sampling strategies used in SHED.  The results show that increasing the number of clusters beyond a certain point does not significantly increase the accuracy and increases the computation time.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Gqou8PRgWq/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Performance of subsets with varying numbers of clusters in SHED.", "description": "This figure shows the performance of SHED's curated datasets with varying numbers of clusters used in the model-agnostic clustering step.  The left panel displays results using the MMLU dataset, while the right shows results using the WizardLM dataset.  Both panels show accuracy on the MMLU (left) and ARC-Challenge (right) test sets for both QOCS (Quality-Ordered Cluster Sampling) and QWCS (Quality-Weighted Cluster Sampling) methods.  The x-axis represents the number of clusters, and the y-axis represents accuracy.  The plot demonstrates how performance changes as the number of clusters increases, helping to determine the optimal number of clusters for SHED. The results show that there's an optimal range for the number of clusters where both QOCS and QWCS achieve high accuracy, before performance plateaus or decreases.
