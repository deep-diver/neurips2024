Existing methods often rely on numerical approximations, which can be computationally expensive and lack accuracy. This necessitates the development of efficient and accurate analytical solutions.\nThis research tackles this challenge head-on. The authors present analytical PID calculations for various distributions, including those commonly used in neuroscience.  Their approach leverages a novel link between PID and the fields of data thinning and fission, enabling the derivation of analytical results for a broader class of distributions. They further enhance the practical applicability of PID by providing an analytical upper bound for approximating PID computations, confirmed to be remarkably precise through rigorous simulation testing.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "7CUUtpDeqN/podcast.wav"}
