Moreover, Kolumbus and Nisan (2022b) show that for a setting where rational agents are using learning algorithms to bid, then it is no longer optimal to truthfully submit their value as the input to the learning algorithm.

This assumption is motivated by online ad auctions, where multiple auctions are taking place every second, and the valuations of the advertisers remain stable for certain time scales, e.g., a day or a week. Thus, there is typically a very large sequence of auctions where the valuations of the participating agents are persistent. Bidders use mean-based no-regret learning algorithms (Braverman et al., 2018) and receive full feedback on which they base their updates. (Many of our results extend immediately to multiple bidders.

The main challenges to proving this set of results arise from our study of general deterministic auctions, which have less structure than second-price auctions. Indeed, small differences in the learning rates can affect the landscape qualitatively, as is manifested from our results. Moreover, while the auctions are deterministic, the learning algorithms are randomized and highly correlated. Hence our approach is to break down the interaction into several epochs and establish some qualitative properties which hold, with high probability, at the end of each epoch.

The results in Section 3 show that since the low valuation bidder tends to underbid, an auctioneer using SPA with reserve makes strictly less revenue than that predicted by the model with rational agents. Motivated by this, we consider a special class of randomized auctions called strictly-IC auctions. These are randomized truthful auctions where for each bidder, it is strictly better to bid their true valuation compared to any other bid. We show that any strictly-IC auction is asymptotically truthful: that is, the limit point of the bidder\u2019s bid converges to their true value. Furthermore, we provide a black-box transformation from any truthful auction $A$ (deterministic or not) to a randomized auction $A^{\\prime}$ that has the following two properties: (i) the bidders converge towards truthful bidding, and (ii) the difference between the allocation and payment rules of the original auction $A$ and its strictly-IC counterpart $A^{\\prime}$ are negligible for any bid profile. Hence, such an auction $A^{\\prime}$ behaves similarly to $A$ , but, crucially, it conveys information to the low bidder to help it converge to truthful bidding. As a corollary of this result, we get that SPA with reserve is not revenue-maximizing in this setting, and that randomization can get strictly more revenue than SPA with reserve.

But if not, and if the ranking of the bidders does not change much due to the lack of inherent randomness, our results show that injecting external randomness into the auction induces the desired learning behavior and hence improves the revenue. Having persistent valuations is just one case of the ranking of the bidders remaining stable over time: studying this case allows us to showcase our main ideas, but a central message of our work is that the presence or absence of stability in the rankings of the bidders is the main factor that dictates convergence to truthful bidding.

Here we consider the prior-free setting, meaning that the valuations of the bidders could be drawn from potentially different distributions that are unknown to the auctioneer. In order to evaluate its revenue performance when bidders are learning agents, we introduce the notion of auctioneer regret for an auction, which measures the difference between the revenue achieved over $T$ rounds of implementing a given auction with learning bidders and the revenue achieved by implementing the optimal auction with rational bidders (i.e., SPA with a reserve price). Proposition 5.2 shows that if the auctioneer is constrained to use the same auction rule for all $T$ rounds, then no truthful auction \u2014 deterministic or randomized \u2014 can achieve an auctioneer-regret better than $\\widetilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ in the setting of adversarial valuations.

Now an auctioneer using the same auction throughout the interaction faces a trade-off: they can speed up the learning process to reduce the revenue loss from the first epoch, but this loses revenue in the second epoch due to the fact that the auction now differs significantly from SPA. Our result optimizes this trade-off to show that an $\\Omega(T^{3/4})$ revenue loss is unavoidable. This naturally suggests decomposing the interaction into two epochs: in the first one, the auctioneer uses a truthful auction to facilitate the convergence to truthful bidding, and in the second one it uses SPA. We then design an auction that guarantees the fastest convergence to truthful bidding for mean-based learners in the prior-free setting, and we show that an improved revenue loss of at most $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ can be achieved with this approach. (Importantly, to maintain truthfulness, the decisions of the auctioneers are fixed before the beginning of the interaction and are not affected by the bids.)

(2021); Deng et al. (2022); Kolumbus and Nisan (2022a); Banchio and Skrzypacz (2022); Rawat (2023). All these works study the longterm behavior of bidding algorithms that participate in repeated auctions, focusing on first-price and second-price auctions, but they give qualitatively different results. This is because they make different assumptions across two important axes: the type of learning algorithms that the bidders use and whether their valuation is persistent across the interaction or it is freshly drawn in each round. Feng et al. (2021) studied the convergence of no-regret learning algorithms that bid repeatedly in second-price and first-price auctions, where all agents have i.i.d. valuation that are redrawn in every round from a discrete distribution that has non-negligible mass on each point. They show that in this setting the bidders exhibit the same-long term behavior in both second-price and first-price auctions that classical theory predicts, i.e., the bids in second-price auctions are truthful and the bids in first-price auctions form Bayes-Nash equilibria. Kolumbus and Nisan (2022a) studied the same setting with the crucial difference that agents\u2019 valuations are persistent across the execution and they are not resampled from some distribution at every iteration. Interestingly, they showed that in the case of two bidders with in second-price auctions, the agent that has the highest valuation will end up bidding between the low valuation and its valuation, whereas the agent with the low type will end up bidding strictly below its valuation. Intuitively, in their setting the high type bidder quickly learns to bid above the valuation of the low type bidder and always win the auction, and thus the low type does not get enough signal to push its bid distribution up to its valuation. On the other hand, when the valuations are redrawn as in Feng et al. (2021), the competition that the agents face varies. In the long run, this gives enough information to the algorithms to realize that bidding truthfully is the optimal strategy. In the case of first-price auctions where the agents have persistent valuations, both Kolumbus and Nisan (2022a); Deng et al. (2022) provide convergence guarantees of no-regret learning algorithms.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
