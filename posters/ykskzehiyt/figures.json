A transition can happen at any time in [0, T].", "description": "This figure illustrates the forward and reverse diffusion processes in the DISCO model.  The forward diffusion process starts at time t=0 with a graph, and it is gradually corrupted (edges and nodes become grayer) until it reaches a noisy state at time t=T.  The reverse process then takes this noisy graph at time t=T and iteratively refines it (edges and nodes become less gray) to reconstruct a clean graph that resembles the original graph.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "YkSKZEhIYt/figures/figures_28_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: A taxonomy of graph diffusion models.", "description": "This figure presents a taxonomy of graph diffusion models, categorizing them based on whether they use discrete or continuous state and time spaces.
