Existing methods struggle with this task, especially when dealing with daily life activities and sparse viewpoints.  They either require many input views or oversimplify the problem.\nThis paper introduces Exo2Ego-V, a novel approach that tackles this challenge using diffusion-based video generation. Exo2Ego-V employs a multi-view exocentric encoder to extract rich features from multiple exocentric cameras, a view translation prior to provide spatially aligned egocentric features, and temporal attention layers to improve temporal consistency.  **Experimental results show that Exo2Ego-V significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a challenging benchmark**, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality, realistic egocentric videos.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "UHDCbIrCFL/podcast.wav"}
