Contrastive Divergence (CD) is a popular approximation method that uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the gradient. However, existing analysis mostly focused on asymptotic convergence rates, lacking precise non-asymptotic guarantees. This paper addresses this gap.\nThe authors perform a non-asymptotic analysis of CD, showing that under certain regularity conditions, CD can converge at the optimal parametric rate (O(n\u207b\u00b9\u2044\u00b2)). They analyze both online and offline settings with various data batching schemes.  Furthermore, they show that averaging the CD iterates yields a near-optimal estimator with asymptotic variance close to the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound.  This work significantly advances our theoretical understanding of CD and provides practical guidance for algorithm design and performance evaluation.", "affiliation": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Q74JVgKCP6/podcast.wav"}
