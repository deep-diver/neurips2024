The relaxation simplifies the original, more complex program by removing strict inequality constraints, making it easier to solve.  While a relaxation, the optimal objective value of this relaxed LP still provides an upper bound for the sender's optimal robust utility.  Importantly, this relaxed LP's solution also helps precisely characterize the optimal robust signaling scheme.", "section": "LP formulation, and efficient algorithm with small action spaces"}, {"figure_path": "9B0iOkn3UP/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 4: LP for checking the feasibility of (A, \u1fb6) \u2208 \u03a3.

A tuple is considered feasible if there exists a posterior distribution \u03bc that satisfies specific conditions: the best response action is \u1fb6, and the set of \u03b4-optimal responses is A. The LP's objective is to maximize a variable \u03b5, subject to constraints that model these conditions. The constraints involve receiver utilities (r),  a robustness parameter (\u03b4),  and the posterior distribution (\u03bc). A feasible tuple indicates that the signal corresponding to (A, \u1fb6) is meaningful in the persuasion game.", "section": "3. LP formulation and algorithm with small action spaces"}]
