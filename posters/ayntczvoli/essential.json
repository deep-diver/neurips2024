This paper tackles this issue by introducing a novel Causal Context Adjustment loss (CCA-loss).  This loss function allows the neural network to learn and adjust the causal context, leading to a more effective autoregressive entropy model and consequently improved compression performance.  The problem is exacerbated by the computational burden of existing transformer based methods.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach with an unevenly channel-wise grouped strategy for high efficiency, reducing the computational cost.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of rate-distortion performance and compression latency, achieving a significant improvement.", "affiliation": "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Compression"}, "podcast_path": "AYntCZvoLI/podcast.wav"}
