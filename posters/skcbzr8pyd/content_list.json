Then we explore leveraging preference optimization to bridge the distribution gap. We introduce SpeechAlign, an iterative self-improvement strategy that aligns speech language models to human preferences. SpeechAlign involves constructing a preference codec dataset contrasting golden codec tokens against synthetic tokens, followed by preference optimization to improve the codec language model. This cycle of improvement is carried out iteratively to steadily convert weak models to strong ones. Through both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that SpeechAlign can bridge the distribution gap and facilitating continuous selfimprovement of the speech language model.

The field of speech language modeling has seen significant progress (Wang et al., 2023; Borsos et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a), particularly with the adoption of discrete speech representations (Hsu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023b) like audio codecs (D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022; Zeghidour et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023d). However, current speech language models primarily focus on the SFT stage associated with empowering the LLM\u2019s instructionfollowing capabilities, neglecting the integration of human feedback to align speech outputs to human preferences regarding quality, naturalness, and expressiveness. Fortunately, preference optimization has emerged as a powerful solution for aligning LLM output distribution with human expectation (Stiennon et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). The most successful approach, RLHF, achieves this by integrating rewarding modeling and a reinforcement learning phase.

Neural Codec Language Models, leveraging audio codecs, have demonstrated their effectiveness in speech generation tasks (Yang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). It primarily utilizes a hierarchical approach that consists of a pipeline of autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models, as illustrated in Figure 2 (a). AR model generates semantic tokens (Borsos et al., 2022) or the first layer of codec tokens (Wang et al., 2023), referred to as AR tokens. These AR tokens serve as input for NAR model to generate acoustic tokens (Borsos et al., 2022) or subsequent layers of codec tokens (Wang et al., 2023), termed as NAR tokens. However, this pipeline system introduces a discrepancy between the training and inference phases for the codec language model. In training, NAR model is fed with golden AR tokens derived from real speech, but the model receives synthetic AR tokens generated by the AR model during inference. As demonstrated in Section 2.3, there is a distribution gap between these two types of AR tokens, which adversely impacts the performance of the NAR model.

Collecting a large, high-quality preference dataset for codec language models is challenging. First, codec tokens are often represented in numerical form, which is not directly understandable by humans, making it impossible to collect human preferences for these tokens directly. Furthermore, collecting human preferences on speech to gather feedback on codec tokens poses multiple challenges, including inconsistency across various human annotators and the difficulty of scaling up the dataset size.

After obtaining the preference dataset, we explore different preference optimization strategies to improve codec language models. Following a complete cycle, we iteratively perform preference dataset collection and preference-aware optimization to convert weak codec language models to stronger ones continually. Experimental results show that SpeechAlign can continually improve the speech generation performance of speech language models.

The output of SpeechTokenizer comprises $Q=8$ hierarchical RVQ tokens $(q_{1},\\ldots,q_{Q})$ .
