This is particularly problematic in scenarios with limited training views, hindering real-world applications.  The inherent noise in raw images significantly degrades the quality and speed of 3DGS.  The presence of noise causes 3DGS to produce numerous thin and elongated Gaussian shapes, impacting visual quality and inference speed.\nTo tackle this, the authors introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework. This framework integrates a noise extractor and employs a robust reconstruction loss function that leverages a noise distribution prior.  Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality and inference speed, particularly when training with limited views.  The superior performance stems from the joint denoising and reconstruction approach, which effectively separates noise from the raw image data before 3DGS reconstruction, improving quality and speed across a broad range of training views.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technology University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "lWHe7pmk7C/podcast.wav"}
