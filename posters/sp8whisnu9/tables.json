It compares performance metrics such as pass@1 (the percentage of problems for which at least one of the generated samples passes all the test cases), pass@5, diversity score, and average KL divergence across different methods, including single adaptation, random partitioning, lexical overlap, and influence function. The results show that SPA with influence function achieves the best diversity while maintaining high quality.", "section": "5.2 Code Generation Results"}]
