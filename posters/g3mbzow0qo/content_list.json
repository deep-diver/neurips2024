Two seemingly confilcting phenomena of specificity and transfer have been widely observed in perceptual learning. Here, we propose a dual-learning model to reconcile these two phenomena. The model consists of two learning processes. One is task-based learning, which is fast and enables the brain to adapt to a task rapidly by using existing feature representations. The other is feature-based learning, which is slow and enables the brain to improve feature representations to match the statistical change of the environment. Associated with different training paradigms, the interactions between these two learning processes induce the rich phenomena of perceptual learning. Specifically, in the training paradigm where the same stimulus condition is presented excessively, feature-based learning is triggered, which incurs specificity, while in the paradigm where the stimulus condition varies during the training, task-based learning dominates to induce the transfer effect. As the number of training sessions under the same stimulus condition increases, a transition from transfer to specificity occurs. We demonstrate that the dual-learning model can account for both the specificity and transfer phenomena observed in classical psychophysical experiments.

Perceptual learning has been widely used as a research paradigm to ascertain the learning strategies in the brain. Over the years, two seemingly contradictory phenomena have been widely found in perceptual learning. One is specificity, referring to that after learning, the improved performance of participants is restricted to the trained location or the trained feature of the stimulus [2, 3]. The other is transfer, referring to that after learning, the improved performance is transferable to untrained locations or untrained features of the stimulus [4, ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "5, 6]. In early experiments in which participants were typically trained excessively under the same stimulus condition (e.g., either at the same retinal location or presenting the same stimulus feature), specificity was predominantly found, and stimulus features used in experiments include contrast [7, 8], orientation [9, 10, 11, 12], spatial frequency [13, 11, 12, 14], motion direction [15, 16, 17], and retinal location [18, 19, 20, 14]. Thus, once in a while, specificity was regarded as a hallmark distinguishing perceptual learning from other learning types [3]. Later on, enriched training paradigms were used, and it was found that perceptual learning can also exhibit the dominating transfer effect. For instances, by manipulating the task difficulty [21, 22, 23, 24], the training intensity [25, 26, 27], or the training protocol [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], the originally observed specificity-dominating effect become transfer-dominating. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Related works. A large volume of computational models has been proposed in the literature to unveil the mechanism of perceptual learning. Since specificity was predominantly reported in early experiments, early computational models mainly focused on exploring the neural mechanism underlying specificity. For instance, Poggio et al. proposed the hyper basis function model (HyperBF) [37], which considers that the enhanced perception performance comes from the changes of basis functions or connection weights of neurons; Teich and Qian proposed a model which considers that the enhanced performance comes from the changes of tuning curves of low-level neurons [38]; Petrov et al. proposed the reweighting model, which considers that the enhanced performance comes from the read-out weights from feature representations to decision neurons [39, 40]. All these models implicitly assume that perceptual learning only incurs local changes in the network, and hence, the learning effect is localized and not transferable to other parts of the neural system needed for processing untrained conditions. Later on, motivated by the observation of transfer, new computational models focusing on the transfer mechanism were proposed. For examples, Dosher et al. refined their reweighting model by including an extra layer with network-wide connections to implement translation-invariant feature representation, which achieves a certain level of transfer effect [41]; Solgi et al. introduced an extra off-line learning procedure which generalizes the local learning result to untrained locations/features, making the learning performance transferable [42]; Li et al. employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to simulate perceptual learning [43], utilizing that the CNN implements translation-invariant feature extraction, and hence their model can explain some transfer phenomena. While these models may solve the transfer problem, they fail to account for specificity, which was also vividly observed in experiments. Overall, perceptual learning still lacks a unified computational model accounting for both specificity and transfer that have been observed in different experiments. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this study, we propose a novel computational model to reconcile the seemingly conflicting phenomena of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. Our model is based on the fact that in the experiments observing specificity, participants were often excessively trained under the same stimulus condition (either at the same retinal location or presenting the same stimulus feature); while in the experiments observing transfer, the stimulus condition was varied during the training (either the location or the stimulus feature). This indicates that excessive training of the same stimulus condition is critical to induce specificity. To account for both specificity and transfer arising from different training paradigms, we propose a dual-learning framework for perceptual learning in the brain. The framework consists of two intertwined learning processes: one is task-based, and the other is feature-based. Specifically, task-based learning aims to quickly adapt to a new task by utilizing existing neural representations of the external world. It enables the brain to master new skills quickly and is transferable to untrained conditions. On the other hand, feature-based learning aims to refine neuronal representations to reflect the statistical changes of the external world. It enables the brain to represent the external world faithfully and it only takes effect when the external environment is substantially changed. We argue that in the experiments exhibiting transfer, task-based learning dominates; while in the experiments exhibiting specificity, feature-based learning dominates, and the latter is triggered by the neural system being excessively exposed to the same stimulus condition, triggering feature-based learning to catch up the statistical change of the external environment. Since featured-based learning leads to localized changes in feature representations adhered to the trained condition, its effect is not transferable to untrained conditions.

We set the rate of feature-based learning to be much smaller than that of task-based learning, such that task-based learning will dominate initially in training, and feature-based learning will take effect after the same stimulus condition is presented excessively.

In contrast, training with varied conditions allows task-based learning to dominate, enhancing transfer. This difference enables a transition from transfer to specificity as stimulus repetitions increase. Although not exclusively from the Vernier discrimination task, the observed changes in specificity and transfer are influenced by training paradigms rather than the tasks themselves. The simplicity of the Vernier discrimination task, requiring only a single stimulus presentation per trial, underscores its utility in illustrating these principles without the need for complex processing, making it ideal for our model demonstrations.

Intuitively, if the agent does not need to account for the feature distribution in the external world, it can quickly adapt by reusing existing feature representations to complete tasks efficiently and at low cost. However, when the agent identifies meaningful statistical patterns in the environment, it can refine its feature representations to enhance precision and effectiveness. Although beneficial, this adaptation is both resource-intensive and slow, as the agent must first distinguish between genuine environmental changes and random fluctuations. In essence, to learn or not to learn, is a generic question faced by all learning agents. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "In this work, starting from the goal of reconciling the confilcting phenomena of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning, we present a solution of the brain, i.e., the dual-learning framework. This framework consists of two learning processes: a task-based one and a feature-based one. Specifically, task-based learning is fast, which enables the agent to learn to accomplish a task rapidly by using existing feature representations; while feature-based learning is slow, which enables the agent to improve feature representations to reflect the statistical change of the external environment. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our dual-learning model successfully replicates and elucidates classical experimental findings related to specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. It reveals that the interaction between the slowchanging, specific feature learning at the early visual pathway and the flexible, transferable task learning at the higher visual pathway governs the adaptability of perceptual learning. Typically, learning tends to adjust the readout of neural representations (i.e., task-based learning) rather than altering the representations themselves (i.e., feature-based learning), unless there is a significant change in the statistical properties of external information. Thus, the default state of learning favors transfer. However, in traditional experimental paradigms, the frequent repetition of stimuli leads to the dominance of feature-based learning, thereby exhibiting significant specificity; by limiting the repetition of stimuli, task-based learning can dominate, thereby enhancing transfer. As such, perceptual learning can display a transition from transfer to specificity as the number of stimulus repetitions increases. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Our dual-learning model can be regarded as a computational modeling implementation of the twostage model theory [44]. While the two-stage model theory aims to address the contradictions between task-related and task-unrelated perceptual learning, it posits the existence of feature-based and task-based plasticity within perceptual learning. Thus, our model is a practical realization of this theory. Furthermore, the dual-learning framework aligns with the reverse hierarchy theory [45], which suggests that learning processes invert the sequence of visual information processing from top-down. As tasks become more difficult and specific, lower levels of the neural hierarchy are increasingly engaged, aligning learning outcomes with enhanced task specificity. This alignment illustrates how the dual-learning model not only accommodates but also substantiates theoretical perspectives on perceptual learning\u2019s hierarchical nature, providing a robust framework for exploring how different learning mechanisms interact within the brain\u2019s architecture.

In this study, as a first step to elucidate the notion of dual-learning, we have built a very simple network model without including many biological details of the visual pathway. In future work, we will extend the current model to include more biological details and apply the model to explain more cognitive functions of the brain. In essence, the dual-learning framework reflects that the brain employs a learning strategy to balance the accomplishment of a new task and the consumption of learning effort, that is, if the statistics of the environment are unchanged, low-cost task-based learning is applied; otherwise, high-cost feature-based learning is triggered. The same balance requirement is faced by other learning agents. We, therefore, expect that the dual-learning framework has the potential to be applied in AI applications, and we will explore this issue in future work.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
