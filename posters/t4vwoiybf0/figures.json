The experiment uses four expert demonstrations across five different MuJoCo environments.  The x-axis shows the number of gradient steps (in millions), and the y-axis indicates the normalized return, with 1 representing the expert policy's performance and 0 representing a random policy.  The results are averaged over five different random seeds to show the stability and convergence speed of the methods. C-GAIL-DAC demonstrates faster convergence and reduced oscillation compared to the standard GAIL-DAC, indicating improved training stability.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "t4VwoIYBf0/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: State Wasserstein distance (lower is better) between expert and learned policies, over number of gradient step updates.

The x-axis represents the number of gradient steps (updates) during training. The y-axis represents the Wasserstein distance between the state distributions of the expert and the learned policy. A lower Wasserstein distance indicates a closer match between the two distributions.
