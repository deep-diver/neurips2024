This significantly restricts the model's ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies crucial for understanding complex actions and events in longer videos.  This necessitates the development of methods to efficiently handle longer video sequences and effectively learn temporal dynamics.  \n\nThis work introduces Long-video masked autoencoders (LVMAE). **LVMAE addresses these limitations by employing an adaptive decoder masking strategy**. This strategy leverages a jointly trained tokenizer to prioritize important tokens for reconstruction, allowing training on significantly longer video sequences (128 frames). The results demonstrate that LVMAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks, highlighting the importance of long-range temporal context in video understanding.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "bFrNPlWchg/podcast.wav"}
