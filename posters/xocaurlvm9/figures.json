Given 3D objects of unseen categories, our method takes several part features and generates the assembly embedding isomorphically for each object.

It begins with a query set and target set of 3D objects, each composed of multiple parts. The framework then performs isomorphic assembly embedding to create a unified representation from the parts, and finally, it uses structured fuzzy reconstruction to handle unseen categories and generate fuzzy embeddings suitable for retrieval. The process is designed to address the challenges posed by the lack of object-level labels and the presence of unseen categories in open-set scenarios.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "xOCAURlVM9/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: An overview of the Hypergraph-Based Assembly Fuzzy Representation (HAFR) framework for assembly-based open-set 3D object retrieval.
