A linear warmup schedule was later introduced in [13]. The intuition given was that to scale the minibatch size in SGD by a factor of $k$ , it is natural to also scale the learning rate by a factor of $k$ , provided the model is not changing too rapidly and successive gradients are roughly aligned. However at the beginning of training, the model is changing rapidly, so it is natural to start with a lower learning rate and gradually increase it to the target value after the network has stabilized.

It has also been suggested that the key benefti of warmup arises for adaptive optimizers, such as Adam: [23] argues that the variance of the adaptive learning rate is large during early training because the network has seen too few training samples; it is asserted that this large variance is harmful, and that warmup acts as a variance reduction method by allowing the network to collect accurate statistics of the gradient moments before using larger learning rates.

Such instabilities, which may be retained in Adam\u2019s memory, can result in performance degradation and even training failures. Warmup mitigates such instabilities by gradually pushing down the preconditioned sharpness, enhancing performance, and preventing training failures.

Yet, similar performance is observed for different warmup durations, suggesting that the primary gain comes from the target learning rate, rather than the duration itself. The second case arises for flat initializations, which can already train at large learning rates, and resultantly the optimal performance is already achieved without warmup. While increasing warmup duration facilitates training at even higher learning rates, it does not enhance performance. Nevertheless, it does broaden the range of optimal learning rates, reducing the need for precise tuning of the target learning rate, and making training more practical and robust. We conclude that warmup can serve two key purposes: (i) it can significantly improve model performance in large initialization cases, and (ii) extend the range of optimal target learning rates for small initializations, making it easier to tune the target learning rate.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
