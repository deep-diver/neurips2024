Existing model-based RL methods struggle to generalize learned world models to unseen state transitions, hindering accurate real-world dynamic modeling. This limits the ability of agents to explore effectively and learn policies capable of generalizing to new goals.\n\nThe paper introduces MUN, a novel goal-directed exploration algorithm to tackle these challenges.  MUN leverages a bidirectional replay buffer and a subgoal discovery strategy (DAD) to enhance world model learning.  The algorithm's ability to model state transitions between arbitrary subgoal states leads to significantly improved policy generalization and exploration capabilities across various robotic tasks.  Experimental results highlight MUN's superior efficiency and generalization compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "Rutgers University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "aYqTwcDlCG/podcast.wav"}
