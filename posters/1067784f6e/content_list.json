For example, data vendors in markets like Datarade and Snowflake, financial data streams [46, 52], information security data [22]) offer a preview in the form of a sample dataset to prospective buyers [4, 11]. Similarly, enterprises selling access to generative models may offer a limited preview of the output distributions to prospective buyers [53]. Buyers use these sample datasets to decide whether to pay for a full dataset or data stream\u2014i.e., access to the data distribution.

Such distributional heterogeneity can arise from natural variations in data [12] or adversarial data corruption [27, 65]. The buyer\u2019s goal is to select the vendor whose data distribution is closest in some sense (to be defined) to a reference distribution $P^{*}$ , which is fixed but unknown. Our goal is to provide both a precise definition for the value of the vendor distribution $P_{i}$ with respect to $P^{*}$ , as well as a corresponding valuation for the sample dataset $D_{i}\\sim P_{i}$ .

To address this, some works consider alternatives (to $P^{*}$ ) based on the vendors\u2019 distributions $P_{i}$ \u2019s such as their union [60] or a certain combination [66], but without theoretical analysis or justifications for their specific choices.

While the Huber model does not capture all kinds of statistical heterogeneity, mixture models both are a reasonable model for data heterogeneity in practice [9, 54] and have deeper roots in robust statistics [20, 40].

Several existing methods require a given reference in the form of a validation set (e.g., [24, 39]) or a baseline dataset [2].

Class-wise Shapley [55] evaluates the effects of a dataset on the in-class and out-of-class validation accuracies. Both LAVA [33] and DAVINZ [67] use a proxy for the validation performance of the training data as their value, instead of the actual validation performance, to be independent of the choice of downstream task ML model [33] or to remove the need for model training [67]. Differently, [2] assume that the buyer provides a baseline dataset as the reference to calculate a relevance score used to evaluate the vendor\u2019s data.

Specifically, the reference is the aggregate of all vendors excluding the vendor $i$ itself. It is unclear how heterogeneity can be formalized in their theoretical analysis, which assumes the vendors are collecting data from the same (ground truth) data distribution.
