To extract global topological information, the persistent homology is computed on an a/VR-filtration. The most significant topological features F across all specified dimensions are selected. Step 2. k-homology generators associated to all features fi,k \u2208 F are computed. For every feature, a simplicial complex is built at a step of the filtration where fi,k is alive. Step 3. The homology generators are projected to the harmonic space of the simplices. Step 4. The vectors are normalised to obtain vectors e indexed over the k-simplices. For every point x and feature f \u2208 F, we compute the mean of the entries of e corresponding to simplices containing x. The output is a |X| \u00d7 |F| matrix which can be used for downstream ML tasks. Optional. We weigh the simplicial complexes resulting in a topologically more faithful harmonic representative in Step 3.", "description": "This figure shows the schematic of the TOPF pipeline.
