[{"figure_path": "jwE1dgOox1/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative performance comparison of clustering with TOPF and other features/clustering algorithms. Four 2D and three 3D data sets of the topological clustering benchmark suite (Appendix C, cf. Figure 6 for ground truth labels and Figure 7 for clustering results of TOPF). We ran each algorithm 20 times and list the mean adjusted rand index (ARI) with standard deviation \u03c3 and mean running time. We omit \u03c3 for algorithms with \u03c3 = 0 on every dataset. TOPF consistently outperforms or almost matches the other algorithms while having significantly better run time than the second best performing algorithm TPCC. Spectral Clustering (SC), DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering (AgC) are standard clustering algorithms, ToMATo is a topological clustering algorithm [11], Geo clusters using 12-dimensional point geometric features extracted by pgeof and the normal point coordinates, whereas node2vec [25] produces node embeddings on a k-nearest neighbour graph built upon an affinity matrix. We highlight all ARI scores within \u00b10.05 of the best ARI score.", "description": "This table compares the performance of TOPF against other clustering algorithms and feature extraction methods on a benchmark suite of 2D and 3D datasets.  The comparison is based on the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and running time.  The results demonstrate TOPF's superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.", "section": "Experiments"}]
