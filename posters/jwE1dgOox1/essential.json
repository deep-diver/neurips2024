Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides tools to describe this global shape, but they lack the point-level information needed for many machine learning tasks. This creates a significant challenge in fields like computer vision and biology where point cloud data is prevalent.  Current methods either focus on global properties or local features without effectively combining both.\nThis work introduces a novel method called TOPF (Topological Point Features) to address this limitation. TOPF cleverly integrates concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry to extract point-level topological features that reflect the global shape. The effectiveness of TOPF is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. Results show that TOPF outperforms existing methods in clustering tasks while demonstrating robustness to noise. Furthermore, a new benchmark suite is presented for evaluating topological clustering methods.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "jwE1dgOox1/podcast.wav"}
