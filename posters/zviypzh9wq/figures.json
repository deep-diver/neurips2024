Specifically, it shows the difference between using fixed masks versus weighted masks in two regions: the fusion region and the rectangulating region. In the fusion region, the weighted mask smoothly transitions between preserved and inpainted areas, resulting in a more natural-looking fusion of the images.  Conversely, in the rectangulating region, a fixed mask is used because that area lacks semantic information; the weighted mask produced blurry noise in this section.
