ATAC-Diff is a versatile informative diffusion model of scATAC-seq data analysis and generation. It leverages the auxiliary model to yield low-dimensional meaningful semantic variables as the conditional information to help generate high-quality data while the reserved potential biological information could be applied for downstream tasks like cell type identification.", "description": "The figure illustrates the ATAC-Diff framework, a versatile informative diffusion model for single-cell ATAC-seq data generation and analysis. It shows how the model uses an auxiliary module to encode input scATAC-seq data into a low-dimensional semantic representation, which is then used to condition a diffusion model for data generation and analysis.  The process involves a latent generator (VAE), an auxiliary encoder, a conditional latent diffusion model (LDM), and an auxiliary decoder.  Mutual information maximization and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) are also used to improve the model's performance.  The output includes high-quality synthetic scATAC-seq data and cell type identification.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "S6YLeBMoWF/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: UMAP visualization of the highly variable peak values and extracted features from PCA, cisTopic, SCALE, PeakVI, and ATAC-Diff on Forebrain and Hematopiesis datasets.
