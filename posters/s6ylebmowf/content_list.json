Consequently, there is a significant demand for the generation of high-quality scATAC-seq data in silico. Furthermore, current methodologies are typically task-specific, lacking a versatile framework capable of handling multiple tasks within a single model. In this work, we propose ATAC-Diff, a versatile framework, which is based on a latent diffusion model conditioned on the latent auxiliary variables to adapt for various tasks. ATAC-Diff is the first diffusion model for the scATAC-seq data generation and analysis, composed of auxiliary modules encoding the latent high-level variables to enable the model to learn the semantic information to sample high-quality data. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the latent prior and auxiliary decoder, the yield variables reserve the refined genomic information beneficial for downstream analyses. Another innovation is the incorporation of mutual information between observed and hidden variables as a regularization term to prevent the model from decoupling from latent variables.

Nevertheless, the latent variables of these diffusion models lack semantic meaning and are not interpretable since they aim to learn the diffused noise, which is not suitable for scATAC-seq data representation learning to uncover the underlying biological patterns (i.e., cellular heterogeneity within a tissue or organism). Since single-cell sequencing data is typically represented as bag-of-words, where there is no upper limit to the value of peak calling per cell and the order of peaks does not affect the cell, the diffusion model, which is designed for continuous data, is less suited for processing discrete data. To address this, we can employ a latent diffusion model[13] that utilizes a pretrained autoencoder to transform scATAC-seq samples into a continuous latent space. This transformation facilitates the effective training of the diffusion model. Additionally, it provides access to an efficient and compact latent space where high-frequency and imperceptible details are abstracted away, allowing the model to focus more on the important and variable genomic fragments.

Our work is inspired by the recent success of Diffusion Autoencoders[19], but learning latent variables for the sparse scATAC-seq data is however challenging.

Furthermore, visualizing the synthetic data generated can enhance researchers\u2019 comprehension of the distribution patterns and fundamental structure of scATAC-seq data. In this case, we anticipate that ATAC-Diff will be able to generate cells that possess the specific subpopulation features associated with the provided conditional information. Since we are the first to generate scATAC-seq data from scratch, there are no baseline models for comparison. Therefore, we have made modifications to SCALE and PeakVI, which are VAE-based models, to enable unconditional generation by utilizing random noise as inputs. For conditional generation, we have replaced the VAE module of SCALE with a conditional VAE module4. For the unconditional generation, we average all single cells as the ground truth. For the conditional generation, we average all single cells of the same biological cell type as the ground truth. To address the requirement of ATAC-Diff for latent variables as auxiliary information, we employ a vanilla VAE to sample the latent variables.

Following previous work[8], we mitigate this challenge to average all single cells within the same cell type, resulting in a meta-cell that serves as a good approximation of those individual cells. For scATAC-seq data imputation, previous works chose to create a corrupted matrix by randomly dropping out some non-zero entries.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
