Existing methods suffer from significant overheads, particularly during data pruning steps which further slows down the training process.  This is due to the heavy computational costs involved in evaluating importance scores and carrying out sorting operations on encrypted data.  Also, simply pruning data samples is not enough to reduce computation costs since a single ciphertext can contain multiple samples, leaving large empty slots.\nHEPrune addresses these issues by introducing an encrypted data pruning framework that utilizes three main techniques to improve both speed and efficiency. **First**, a homomorphic encryption-friendly score (HEFS) is proposed to efficiently compute data sample importance scores, avoiding complex non-linear operations. **Second**, client-aided masking (CAM) is utilized to efficiently identify less important samples without requiring heavy encrypted sorting.  **Third**, ciphertext-wise pruning (CWP) is used to reduce the number of ciphertexts processed, thereby significantly improving performance.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HEPrune, achieving a 16x speedup with only a 0.6% accuracy loss compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "University of Central Florida", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "y2fAmldTIf/podcast.wav"}
