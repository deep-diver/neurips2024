Each set contains four skills, each represented by a unique symbol.  The left panel (Z1) shows each skill visiting only one state. The right panel (Z2) shows each skill visiting two states.  Gray squares represent unreachable states. The figure is used to demonstrate how the mutual information between states and skills might not capture the concept of exploration sufficiently well, as both Z1 and Z2 have the same mutual information, while Z2 is more exploratory.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "oyiBLfNJvY/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Skill visualisation for each algorithm.

The left panel shows a PCA projection of the explored states in the state space, where each color represents a different skill, highlighting how LEADS discovers skills with distinct state occupancies. The right panels illustrate the state occupancy measure (SSR) and uncertainty measure (ut) during training. The SSR, shown in the top right panel (a), indicates the probability of visiting a given state when using a specific skill. The bottom right panel (b) shows the uncertainty measure (ut), which is used to guide exploration by targeting states that are both uncertain (less frequently visited by other skills) and contribute to skill diversity. The combination of diverse skills and targeted exploration drives effective coverage of the state space.", "section": "4.1 Evaluation benchmarks"}, {"figure_path": "oyiBLfNJvY/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 5: Relative coverage evolution across six tasks.
