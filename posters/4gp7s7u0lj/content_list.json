To start with, we conduct a comprehensive study of collective outliers, exploring their hard-to-learn property and concluding that ground truth inconsistency is one of the main causes. Motivated by this, we design a novel active learning algorithm that takes three complementary aspects, namely learnability, diversity, and uncertainty, into account. Ideally, learnability is reflected by ground truth consistency. Under the active learning scenario where ground truths are not available until human involvement, we measure the consistency on estimated ground truths, where predictions from off-the-shelf models are utilized as approximations to ground truths. These predictions are further used to estimate sample frequency and reliability, evincing the diversity and uncertainty respectively. With the help of our novel caption-wise active learning protocol, our algorithm is capable of leveraging knowledge from humans in a more effective yet intellectual manner. Results on publicly available video captioning datasets with diverse video captioning models demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms SOTA active learning methods by a large margin,e.g.we achieve about $\\bar{103\\%}$ of full performance on CIDEr with $25\\%$ of human annotations on MSR-VTT.

Such an amount will further aggravate the learning process due to their hard-to-learn nature, thus worth exploring. We observe that inconsistency in human annotations is one of the main causes of collective outliers, which can be divided into the abstraction and granularity inconsistency (refer to Fig. 1.(a)).

We re-phrase the problem introduced by collective outliers as learnability and aim to address it in our active learning design. Due to the lack of access to human annotations in active learning, directly identifying collective outliers is implausible. Nevertheless, we turn to their main property, or inconsistency, as our breakthrough and propose to estimate the abstraction and granularity inconsistencies in unlabelled data. Concretely, existing image-based large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are used to approximate human annotations. Instead of directly using predictions from LVLMs as pseudo ground truths, which would deteriorate the overall performance because of domain gaps, we propose to measure the consistency not only internally among per-frame predictions but externally between predictions from a video captioning model and those per-frame predictions. The internal measurement captures the abstraction consistency and the external one counts on the granularity consistency. Combining both provides us an estimation of sample learnability, or how likely this sample belongs to collective outliers. Diversity and uncertainty are also leveraged in our active learning scheme where we rank samples based on their frequency in the entire dataset and reliability respectively. Our algorithm is able to select reliable, diverse yet learnable samples, and achieves SOTA trade-offs between accuracy and human efforts. Motivated by the causes of collective outliers, we propose a caption-wise active learning protocol such that only a limited number of human-annotated captions are acquired if one video is selected by our active learning algorithm.

(2023) is a task that automatically generates textual grammatical and semantically appropriate descriptions for a given visual content. While this task is easy for humans, it is extremely difficult for deep learning models. To perform visual captioning, models are required to have multiple capabilities: including but not limited to detection and recognition capabilities to extract objects in visual content, visual semantic understanding capabilities to determine the attributes and relationships of objects, and enriching language knowledge to describe information with grammatically correct sentences. Visual captioning can be classified into image captioning Ming et al. (2022) and video captioning Abdar et al. (2023). Deep-learning-based image captioning starts with the encoder-decoder framework combining convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks Kiros et al. (2014); Vinyals et al. (2015). It is further developed by extracting fine object region features Anderson et al. (2018); Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015), attribute features Yao et al. (2017), semantic relation features Yao et al. (2018); Yang et al. (2022) and introducing attention mechanisms Xu et al. (2015); Pan et al. (2020); Yu et al. (2020). With breakthroughs in vision-and-language pre-training approaches Radford et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2021a); Alayrac et al. (2022); Li et al. (2023a), applications in image captioning Li et al. (2020); Mokady et al. (2021); Li et al. (2023c) have emerged in recent years, benefit from the power of LVLMs (e.g.rich knowledge and strong recognition ability). The recently proposed BLIP2 Li et al. (2023a) has achieved superior performance on major image-text tasks with a simple pre-training method. Unfortunately, LVLMs focusing on video-text-related tasks have not yet come out. Video captioning still faces many challenges. Video captioning is more difficult than image captioning due to the many frames the video contains, which carry massive amounts of information. This raises the necessity of abstracting semantic information from the temporal dimension and describing content from the spatial dimension with different granularity. Video captioning started with the encoder-decoder framework Venugopalan et al. (2015). Subsequent researchers continued to design new encoders Wang et al. (2019); Pan et al. (2016) and decoders Jin et al. (2020); Guo et al. (2016). Some work is also actively trying to introduce scene graphs Hou et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2020b), text corpus Shi et al.

(2021), which are much harder to detect as they are more generic yet harder to identify as individuals. Not surprisingly, one important property of collective outliers is learnability, e.g., they are more likely to be hard-tolearn samples compared to normal data Karamcheti et al. (2021). Concretely, we exploit Dataset Maps to diagnose datasets with training dynamics Swayamdipta et al. (2020); Dagan et al. (2013); Sakaguchi et al. (2020). Compared to conventional Dataset Map that exploits two model-specific metrics (i.e.average confidence assigned to the correct answer and the variance of these values) to measure the learnability of training examples, we propose to utilize SPICE Anderson et al. (2016) to approximate the confidence score on the correct answer. On the one hand, the confidence score is not a reliable criterion as it can be largely affected by random-length text sequences generated by autoregressive models Zhang et al. (2020a). On the other hand, SPICE measures the F1 score between scene graphs generated by predictions and ground truths. It has the useful property of being defined over tuples that are easy to subdivide into meaningful categories, providing a more semantic-centric evaluation in a human-interpretable manner by abstracting away most of the lexical and syntactic idiosyncrasies of natural language compared to CIDEr Vedantam et al.

Clearly, samples that fall into the upper left area of this figure are easy-to-learn ones whose SPICE scores are consistently high. While the lower left area is occupied with hard-to-learn samples where no observable improvements can be found with longer training time.

As shown in Fig. 1.(a), these inconsistencies can be divided into two categories, abstraction and granularity. The inconsistency in abstraction summarizes cases where humans tend to provide not only the description of video contents, but also high-level reasoning behind it. For instance, a boy is walking to the beach to surf versus a movie about a man who likes to surf. On the other hand, inconsistency in granularity consists of samples with human annotations at different graininess,e.g.people might coarsely describe the video as a cartoon character talking on the phone while a fine-grained description summarizes the same video with Krabs talks on the phone while SpongeBob freaks out. We argue that collective outliers are not impossible to learn. Instead, they can be exploited with more consistent descriptions or learned at a later stage of the training process when general principles from easier examples are already learned by models.

In particular, we exploit LVLMs since they provide powerful tools to generate human-like captions at the same granularity. On the one hand, one can approximate the abstraction inconsistency among predictions from LVLMs. On the other hand, by comparing the predictions from $f$ and LVLMs, granularity inconsistency can be further approached. Rather than leveraging foundation models for videos, we utilize the predicted per-frame captions from image-based LVLMs for the following three reasons. Firstly, the image-based LVLMs are more mature and well-exploited compared to the former. Moreover, inconsistency in abstraction occurs more frequently when video samples are complex, e.g., contents vary a lot temporally. Such variety can be better captured by measuring the consistency between frame-wise predictions. Lastly, our design provides a lower bound when measuring the inconsistency in granularity as frame-wise predictions from LVLMs and video captions predicted by $f$ look at videos from different perspectives to the maximum extent, leading to more reliable approximations.

In particular, $y$ and $x$ axis are the averaged SPICE score over all training epochs and their variance. Intuitively, the average SPICE score reflects sample difficulty, while the variance represents its ambiguity. Combining both would provide us with a way to capture data learnability. Dataset Maps, to this end, provide an interpretable way to identify collective outliers w.r.t. data learnability. ", "page_idx": 19}, {"type": "text", "text": "To verify our assumption that Dataset Maps helps in terms of figuring out collective outliers, we propose to divide samples according to their learnability.

Each region exclusively contains $\\mathrm{{25\\%}}$ of the samples from the full training set to avoid the interference of data size on the results. We then train $f$ with data from each region and show the overall performance on the test set in Tab. 3. In short, We can draw the following two conclusions: (1) There exist obvious gaps between regions of various averaged SPICE scores (e.g. Easy v.s. Collective Outliers, Moderate v.s. Hard), indicating that simple samples bring in more performance boosts. (2) When the difficulty of samples is close, samples of higher variances lead to better performance (e.g.. Moderate v.s. Easy, Hard v.s. Collective Outliers). In our active learning scenario, this observation can be interpreted as simple and learnable samples with certain uncertainty (e.g.samples in the Moderate region) are of greater informativeness.

We then update our $f$ with these pseudo ground truths and report its performance on the MSR-VTT test set in Fig. 10. Apparently, there exist clear differences in language style between captions generated by BLIP2 and human-annotated ground truths. Specifically, this simple semi-supervised learning method achieves 0.31 and 0.07 for CIDEr and SPICE, which are worse than the starting points.

Specifically, we believe that the impact of temporal information can be minimized if videos are highly coherent among frames. Such coherency can be further approximated by frame-wise consistency.
