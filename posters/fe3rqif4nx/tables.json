The data was processed using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality to the top 5 principal components.  The left-out marginal approach was used for evaluation, where each model is trained on all but one time point and then tested on the excluded time point. The results are averaged over five independent runs, providing an estimate of the methods' performance and stability.
