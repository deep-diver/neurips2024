Diff-eRank assesses LLMs by analyzing their hidden representations, providing a quantitative measure of how efficiently they eliminate redundant information during training. We demonstrate the applicability of Diff-eRank in both single-modal (e.g., language) and multimodal settings. For language models, our results show that Diff-eRank increases with model size and correlates well with conventional metrics such as loss and accuracy. In the multi-modal context, we propose an alignment evaluation method based on the eRank, and verify that contemporary multi-modal LLMs exhibit strong alignment performance based on our method.

", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "LLMs understand the world knowledge through training on huge amounts of data. One famous belief [34] of how LLMs work is that larger models can find more shared hidden structures in data samples by eliminating redundant information through training. In particular, in the early phase of training, following random initialization, the representations derived from the training data tend to be somewhat chaotic. As training progresses, these representations become increasingly structured, and the model discards extraneous information from the training data, which resembles a process similar to \u201cnoise reduction\u201d. This perspective motivates us that LLM could be evaluated by characterizing the \u201cnoise reduction\u201d process.

Through the removal of redundant information, eRank decreases, indicating the representations become more structured and compact. Thus, the reduction of representations\u2019 eRank can signify the degree of \u201cnoise reduction\u201d. Therefore, we can evaluate a well-trained LLM via the eRank reduction of the model representations from its untrained status. We remark that different from conventional metrics like loss, which are derived from the predictions of LLMs, the proposed Diff-eRank focuses on the model representations.

Moreover, Diff-eRank has a consistent trend when compared with (reduced) cross-entropy loss and benchmark accuracy, highlighting its potential as an effective and easy-to-use evaluation metric. For multi-modal (vision-language) LLMs, visual and language information is usually encoded separately by two independent encoders and aligned through a connecting layer. Therefore, evaluating the quality of modality alignment in multi-modal LLMs is crucial. Building on insights from uni-modal LLMs, we can assess modality alignment by examining the matching degree of eRanks between representations from different modalities.

Conventional metrics such as accuracy, F1 [29], BLEU [24] and ROUGE [18] estimate between the annotated label and the prediction generated by the language model in different downstream tasks.

In particular, we study the characteristics of these representations by examining their ranks through both the geometric and information-theoretic perspective. On the one hand, studying the rank of these representations allows us to measure the extent of linear independence among them, which corresponds to the effective dimensions in the representation space (i.e., the geometric structure).

Note that normalization is necessary here for a fair comparison because the vision encoder and connector are entirely different networks. This metric evaluates the connector network\u2019s efficiency in condensing and refining visual information during image-text alignment training. On the other hand, the \u201cImage-Text Alignment\u201d metric is designed to evaluate the closeness among the effective rank of representations post LLM processing, considering individual images $\\mathrm{(eRank_{3})}$ ), text $\\mathrm{(eRank_{4})}$ , and image-text pairs $\\mathrm{(eRank_{5})}$ ) as inputs. In particular, the absolute eRank can be seen as the amount of absolute uncertainty or randomness. The mentioned three eRanks show how much the model integrates and represents each modality. If these three eRanks from different modalities are close to each other, it means that they align well from the perspective of information theory. Thus, this metric reflects the degree of closeness (i.e., alignment) among different modalities.

This finding is also consistent with their performance, as LLaVA-1.5 surpasses MiniGPT-v2 in most of benchmarks [9].

", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "To further investigate the role of each component in MLLM, we conduct additional experiments to calculate the eRank after rotating the images clockwise. We summarize the results in Table 3. As the rotation of images introduces new semantic information into the model, by noticing all the image-related quantities $\\mathrm{(eRank}_{i}$ $(i\\neq4)$ ) all increase from the base model when performing rotation, this semantic influence can propagate through the model. Therefore, we suggest that the multimodal model (including the connector and the language model) can indeed perceive subtle semantic variations in images, especially the position information. In addition, the \u201cImage Reduction Ratio\u201d score and \u201cImage-Text Alignment\u201d score both decrease after conducting image rotation, suggesting that the connector performs less effectively in condensing visual information, and the rotated images are less well-aligned with the corresponding text. This is primarily because the rotation alters the spatial relationships within the image, possibly making it more challenging for the model to maintain the coherence between visual and textual information. Overall, this experiment indicates that subtle changes in the vision encoder\u2019s understanding of images can be effectively conveyed to the LLM part and affect the MLLM\u2019s modality alignment.

The last layer, on the other hand, integrates this information, providing a more complete representation of the input data.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
