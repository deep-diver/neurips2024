These reasoning capabilities of LLMs are typically elicited by prompting techniques (Brown et al., 2020), which can be few-shot prompting with intermediate steps augmented demonstration exemplars (Chen et al., 2023b; Gao et al., 2022; Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a), or zero-shot prompting with specific instructions which ask for showing certain intermediate steps (Kojima et al., 2022; Yasunaga et al., 2023). The other prevalent strategy for eliciting LLM reasoning is through model training or instruction tuning using a substantial amount of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data (Chung et al., 2022; Cobbe et al., 2021; Ling et al., 2017; Nye et al., 2021).

Modeltuning can be expensive and requires a substantial amount of supervised data. In this work, we explore a different perspective and ask: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? And to what extent can they reason? We find that, perhaps surprisingly, there exists a task-agnostic way to elicit CoT reasoning from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the decoding procedure.

Despite achieving high performance, few-shot prompting techniques are often task-specific, requiring prompt designs tailored to each task. This limits their generalizability across tasks. Advanced prompting techniques often require manually intensive prompt engineering, and their effectiveness varies depending on the choice of prompts, resulting in inconsistent performance outcomes (Wang et al., 2022; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Zhou et al., 2023b). Efforts to discover improved prompts (Yang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023b) further entail model-specific and task-specific tuning.

Dissecting the distinct influence of each aspect, however, presents a significant challenge.

However, these approaches typically involve resource-intensive fine-tuning over large language models and require a large set of examples annotated with CoTs, which may not be readily available. Liu et al. (2024) show that a language model can be tuned by a proxy. Their method requires a few additional models, and implicitly assumes that the tuned model is well-optimized, e.g., on reasoning benchmarks the model needs to be tuned with CoT paths to enable contrasting logits with respect to the base untuned model.

The predominant focus in existing literature on decoding for language models revolves around aspects such as fluency, coherence, reduction of repetitiveness, and diversity in responses.

Furthermore, our empirical observations highlight that the presence of a CoT reasoning path correlates with increased model confidence in decoding its final answer. Based on this observation, we introduce CoT-decoding to extract more reliable decoding paths from language models, thereby enhancing their overall reasoning performance.

Future work could leverage the CoT-decoding paths to fine-tune the model to further enhance its reasoning capabilities.

While existing work (Burns et al., 2023) leverages the model\u2019s activation space to uncover latent knowledge, its applicability is restricted to answering yes-no questions. We hope that future research can address this limitation by delving deeper into the model\u2019s internal representation across a broader, more open-ended answer space.

In addition, we leverage the model\u2019s intrinsic probability of ranking the top- ${\\cdot k}$ tokens during the initial decoding step. For more complex or nuanced tasks, however, if the model is inadequately trained, it is possible that none of the top- $k$ tokens will yield relevant paths. This limitation can, in turn, help identify specific areas of model weakness, indicating the need for additional data coverage during training or for explicit guidance via expert knowledge during inference to successfully address these tasks.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
