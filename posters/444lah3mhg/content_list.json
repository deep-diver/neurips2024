Existing active learning methods struggle in this scenario due to their inherent bias in batch selection.

We found that performance significantly suffers when fewer centers are selected.

This limitation poses significant challenges for subsequent boundary sample selection. However, performance stabilizes once a sufficient number of centers to encompass all categories is established.

In pool-based scenarios, existing algorithms generally adopt criteria such as uncertainty or diversity for sample selection. Uncertainty-based methods make selections based on the difficulty of each sample, assessed through various heuristics including posterior probability [24, 39], entropy [18, 29], loss function [16, 45], or their impact on model performance [10, 28]. Conversely, diversity-based algorithms aim to select representative samples that closely approximate the distribution of the entire data pool. This concept of diversity can be measured by the distance between global [33] and local [1, 40] representations, or through other metrics such as gradient directions [2] or adversarial loss [20, 36].

It operates by aligning the distribution of selected samples with that of the original unlabeled pool within the feature space.

Optimizing these boundaries can substantially improve model generalizability and accuracy, especially in complex, high-dimensional data environments [42, 5]. In the case of support vector machines (SVMs), decision boundaries are integral to defining separating hyperplanes, and maximizing the geometric margin around these boundaries is crucial for robust classification [4]. This principle is equally pertinent to neural networks, where enhancing the margin can similarly boost generalization capabilities. When dealing with imbalanced datasets, adjusting the decision boundary becomes essential for accurately classifying minority classes. To address this, techniques such as Label-Distribution-Aware Margin (LDAM) loss [5] and Enlarged Large Margin (ELM) loss [19] have been developed to refine the decision boundary, thereby improving the balance of generalization errors across different classes. Studies have shown that neural networks tend to utilize the most discriminative or simplest features in constructing decision boundaries [30, 34]. Additionally, a theoretical framework has been proposed for evaluating the complexity of decision boundaries using the novel metric of decision boundary variability, which is inversely related to generalizability [23].

It is evident that the FDS method has significant drawbacks, leading to an insufficient selection of sample samples from central classes in feature space, which greatly impedes the model\u2019s learning capability. Both the K-Means and ActiveFT methods focus on selecting central samples, differing in their optimization goals and processes. As seen in Fig. 6, both methods achieve their intended purpose, resulting in a relatively uniform selection of samples. Our method further refines this approach. Firstly, we identify the central samples, represented by pentagrams, and then expand to boundary samples, denoted by circles, from each center. Our strategy emphasizes the boundaries between categories, rather than conforming to the entire distribution. For example, considering the \u2019brown\u2019 sample class, our method selects fewer samples in its internal area, far from other categories, and focuses more on locating boundary samples.
