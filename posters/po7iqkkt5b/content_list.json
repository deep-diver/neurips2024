Our study suggests a substantial entanglement of motion estimation with appearance in DNNs, which might also be linked to the lack of robustness observed in state-of-the-art motion estimators [33, 34]. Computational principles that better match human vision should be considered as promising candidates for addressing these issues. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Finally, we argue that deep learning based models as presented in our work have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of motion perception in humans. Low-level mechanisms for motion estimation and higher level processes for motion interpretation have been mostly studied in isolation [27]. In our work we follow a more holistic approach by studying the effects motion detection mechanisms on the perception of moving objects, which offers several unique opportunities. First, it is not necessary for most downstream tasks to perfectly estimate the physically correct motion. For example, segmenting moving objects does require precise information about object boundaries while other mistakes are less critical. Studying motion estimation and interpretation jointly allows to better understand viable compromises in estimation accuracy as the basis for more efficient processing. Second, studying end-to-end models of motion estimation and interpretation advances our understanding of how neural mechanisms give rise to behavior. DNNs are a particularly promising modeling approach positioned in a \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d regarding the trade-off between biological plausibility and scalability to natural stimuli and tasks [10]. In this vein, our work establishes a compelling link between cortical mechanisms for motion estimation and the Gestalt psychology of human object perception. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the future, this work can be extended in several directions. While scaling remarkably well, the original motion energy model is not able to match the performance of state-of-the-art optical flow methods on natural scenes. We see integrating principles from computational neuroscience with techniques from deep learning as a promising path towards closing this gap [41]. Moreover, training the parameters of the CNN implementation of the motion energy model jointly with the segmentation model did not lead to a generalizable solution. How humans learn generalizable motion perception from data, or to which degree this capability is innate, are important questions for future research. Finally, in the spirit of the neuroconnectionist research programme [10] we see our model as an executable hypothesis for motion perception in the human brain. While matching human performance in terms of generalization to moving random dots, this model might well fail to capture other aspects of human motion perception. Further evaluating and extending models of motion perception to capture a diverse range of phenomena is an exciting path towards a holistic understanding of human perception.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
