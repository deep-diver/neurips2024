FMR = 0.1%.", "description": "This table presents the effectiveness of various face morphing attacks against three different face recognition (FR) systems.  It compares the performance of several morphing techniques, including traditional methods (Webmorph, MIPGAN-I, MIPGAN-II), previous diffusion-model-based attacks (DiM-A, Fast-DiM, Morph-PIPE), and the proposed AdjointDEIS method. The results are presented in terms of MMPMR (Mated Morph Presentation Match Rate) at a 0.1% False Match Rate (FMR).  The NFE (number of forward evaluations) provides a measure of the computational cost of each attack.  Lower NFE values indicate a more efficient attack, while higher MMPMR values suggest greater vulnerability of the FR systems.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "fAlcxvrOEX/tables/tables_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Impact of number of discretization steps, M, on face morphing with AdjointDEIS. FMR = 0.1%.", "description": "This table shows the impact of the number of discretization steps (M) used in the AdjointDEIS algorithm on the performance of face morphing attacks. The results are measured by the MMPMR metric (Mated Morph Presentation Match Rate) at a False Match Rate (FMR) of 0.1% across three different Face Recognition (FR) systems: AdaFace, ArcFace, and ElasticFace.  As the number of discretization steps decreases, the performance of the morphing attack also decreases. This indicates that using a sufficient number of steps in the AdjointDEIS solver is crucial for achieving high performance in generating effective morphed faces.", "section": "Additional Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "fAlcxvrOEX/tables/tables_24_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Impact of learning rate, \u03b7, on face morphing with AdjointDEIS.

It shows the MMPMR (Mated Morph Presentation Match Rate) achieved using different learning rates with varying numbers of discretization steps (M) for both ODE and SDE variants of the AdjointDEIS algorithm.
