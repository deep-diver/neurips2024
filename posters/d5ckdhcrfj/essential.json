This opens new avenues for leveraging LLMs in handling real-world data challenges and offers valuable prompt engineering guidelines for the research community.", "summary": "EPIC: Effective prompting makes LLMs generate high-quality synthetic tabular data, significantly boosting imbalanced-class classification.", "takeaways": ["A novel prompting method (EPIC) uses LLMs to generate realistic synthetic tabular data, especially for imbalanced datasets.", "EPIC significantly improves ML classification performance by addressing class imbalance and preserving feature correlations.", "EPIC offers valuable prompt engineering guidelines for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data, showcasing the effectiveness of in-context learning with LLMs."], "tldr": "Many real-world applications rely on tabular data, but data scarcity and class imbalance hinder machine learning model performance.  Traditional methods like SMOTE struggle with complex relationships within data.  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, but require extensive fine-tuning, risking overfitting.  This increases the risk of poor performance.\n\nThe paper introduces EPIC, a novel prompting method.  EPIC leverages LLMs' in-context learning abilities, using balanced data samples and unique variable mapping in the prompts. This guides the LLMs to accurately generate synthetic data for all classes, handling imbalance effectively.  Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrated state-of-the-art classification performance and significantly improved generation efficiency.  The method is model-agnostic, easy to implement, and practical for various applications.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Few-Shot Learning"}, "podcast_path": "d5cKDHCrFJ/podcast.wav"}
