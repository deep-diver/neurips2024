Existing self-supervised BID methods have limitations in terms of performance, particularly on modestly blurred images and real-world images. They typically involve heuristic loss functions and lack efficient training strategies.  This limits their applicability in various domains. \nThis paper proposes a novel self-supervised BID method that overcomes these limitations.  It leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) for images and kernels to achieve resolution-free properties, leading to an effective cross-scale consistency loss.  This loss function, combined with a progressive coarse-to-fine training strategy, allows for more accurate and efficient training without ground truth data. The method outperforms existing self-supervised methods across diverse datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling various blur types and real-world images.  The INR-based approach offers a more robust and adaptable framework for future self-supervised BID research. **This innovative method significantly enhances the performance of self-supervised BID, offering significant advancements for real-world applications.**", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "CFez7MFUFd/podcast.wav"}
