These algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional data, multimodal distributions (distributions with multiple peaks), and scenarios with high energy barriers between modes. This leads to slow convergence and inaccurate results.\nThis paper introduces Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC), a novel sampling method designed to address these limitations. **ZOD-MC cleverly leverages the denoising diffusion process**, a technique used in generative modeling, and approximates the score function using Monte Carlo methods, requiring only zeroth-order queries (function evaluations without gradients).  The researchers demonstrate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and experiments, showing **superior performance compared to existing methods** particularly for lower-dimensional distributions.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Sampling"}, "podcast_path": "X3Aljulsw5/podcast.wav"}
