"], "tldr": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the third generation of artificial neural networks, are energy-efficient but lag behind traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in performance.  This paper tackles this issue by focusing on the multi-threshold model which enables richer information transmission.  However, existing works on this model did not fully explore its mathematical relationship with ANNs and SNNs.\nThe paper proposes a novel learnable multi-hierarchical threshold model (LM-HT) which dynamically regulates the global input current and membrane potential.  **LM-HT can be converted to a single-threshold model, enhancing hardware deployment flexibility and enabling mathematical equivalence with quantized ANNs under uniform input**.  The paper also introduces a hybrid learning framework to improve the performance of converted SNNs, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments that show the LM-HT model achieving state-of-the-art results and comparable performance to quantized ANNs.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "IlIDNMvwmX/podcast.wav"}
