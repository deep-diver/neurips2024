Measuring calibration is computationally expensive, particularly for large datasets. Existing approaches based on expected calibration error (ECE) suffer from discontinuity and parameter sensitivity issues. This necessitates a more efficient and reliable method for testing calibration.\nThis research introduces a new calibration testing problem and proposes efficient, nearly-linear time algorithms to address the challenges associated with existing approaches.  The algorithms leverage the connection between the smooth calibration error (a measure of calibration) and the minimum-cost flow problem, resulting in significant runtime improvements over the quadratic runtime of black-box linear program solvers. The paper also establishes theoretical lower bounds on sample complexity for some common calibration measures, further highlighting the advantage of the proposed algorithms.
