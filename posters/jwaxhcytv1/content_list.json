Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely change the entire causal graph over the latent factors. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The code can be found at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS.

In contrast to our setting, which focuses on identifying shifted nodes in the latent representation, existing methods in CRL aim to recover both the latent causal graph and the mixing function. Previous works have studied identifiability in various settings, such as latent linear SEMs with linear mixing [40], and with nonlinear mixing [4]; latent nonlinear SEMs with finite degree polynomial mixing [1], and with linear mixing [48]; and nonlinear SEMs with nonlinear mixing [50, 49, 23, 22]. Although these studies ensure the identifiability of causal graphs (up to permutation and scaling ambiguities), they generally rely on the assumption that each latent variable is intervened upon in at least one environment, necessitating access to at least $d$ interventional distributions. Moreover, the aforementioned works assume specific types of interventions, such as hard/soft interventions and single-node interventions, and restrict changes in interventional distributions, disallowing edge reversals or the addition of new edges. The most recent work [23] enables causal representation learning under general interventions in latent linear SEMs with linear mixing. However, this approach still requires the assumption that the number of environments $K$ is at least equal to the number of latent nodes $d$ and that there are at least $\\Theta(d^{2})$ interventions. If the objective is to detect variables with general mechanism changes across multiple environments\u2014environments that may lack a consistent topological order and sufficient interventions or environments\u2014using existing CRL methods to recover each latent graph becomes overly restrictive or even infeasible.

More recently, Chen et al.

Finally, the concept of detecting/localizing feature shifts between two distributions has also been discussed in [27], although from a non-causal perspective.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
