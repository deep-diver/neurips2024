Existing prompt-tuning methods for CL often struggle with this issue. This paper introduces a novel approach, focusing on tuning prompts orthogonally to previously learned information. This ensures that learning new tasks does not interfere with previous knowledge. \nThe core idea involves projecting prompt gradients into the null space of previously learned tasks' features. This orthogonal projection, however, presents unique challenges in Vision Transformers (ViT) due to high-order and non-linear self-attention mechanisms and the impact of LayerNorm. The researchers overcome this by deducing two consistency conditions, which ensures this orthogonalization actually prevents forgetting.  They propose an effective solution using null-space projection to satisfy these conditions.  Their experimental results showcase significant improvements in accuracy and reduced forgetting compared to existing methods across four benchmark datasets, highlighting the efficacy of their approach.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Visual Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "8pRemr5kEi/podcast.wav"}
