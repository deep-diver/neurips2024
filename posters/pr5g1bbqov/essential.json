Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising technique, but its effectiveness diminishes as model size increases.  This study reveals that standard SAM primarily affects the final layer in wide networks.  This leads to a critical limitation: hyperparameters optimized for smaller models may not transfer effectively to larger models. This limits efficiency.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the researchers propose \u00b5P\u00b2 (Maximal Update and Perturbation Parameterization). This novel parameterization incorporates layerwise perturbation scaling, ensuring that all layers contribute to the feature learning process.  Through rigorous theoretical analysis and experiments, \u00b5P\u00b2 is shown to successfully transfer optimal hyperparameters (learning rate and perturbation radius) across varying model sizes, resulting in significantly improved generalization performance.  The paper also provides a versatile condition for \u00b5P\u00b2 application across diverse architectures and SAM variants, enhancing its applicability and impact.", "affiliation": "University of T\u00fcbingen", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "pR5g1bBqoV/podcast.wav"}
