Three metrics are used for evaluation: CLIP_cond (measuring the consistency of generated videos with the condition image), CLIP_temp (measuring the temporal consistency within the generated videos), and FVD (measuring the overall quality and realism of the generated videos). Lower FVD scores indicate better visual quality. The results show ActAnywhere outperforms the baselines across all three metrics, demonstrating its superiority in generating coherent and realistic videos.", "section": "4.3 Quantitative Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "ntlFREw59A/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation study on key design choices.", "description": "This table presents the results of an ablation study conducted to evaluate the impact of key design choices on the performance of the ActAnywhere model.  The study varied the way in which the condition signal (background image) and foreground mask were incorporated into the model.  The results are evaluated using three metrics: CLIP_cond (consistency to condition image), CLIP_temp (temporal consistency), and FVD (Frechet Video Distance). The table shows that using CLIP features for cross-attention and including a mask yields the best performance.", "section": "4.4 Ablation Study"}]
