Current methods are limited to small, simple systems, hindering progress in diverse fields.  The lack of efficient ways to generate training data for AI models further complicates the task.\nThis work introduces a novel approach using sequence-to-sequence transformers.  By generating synthetic training data from random Lyapunov functions, the model achieves near-perfect accuracy on known systems.  Remarkably, it also discovers new Lyapunov functions for more complex, previously intractable systems. This demonstrates the potential of AI in solving long-standing mathematical challenges and opens new avenues for research in various fields requiring stability analysis.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "kOMrm4ZJ3m/podcast.wav"}
