It starts with a natural language (NL)-based protocol, which is then translated into a structured protocol using syntax-level transformations. The structured protocol is further refined into a completed protocol by addressing semantic ambiguities and filling in missing information. Finally, the completed protocol is converted into a linked protocol, ready for execution in a self-driving laboratory.  Each stage is represented by a corresponding Protocol Dependence Graph (PDG). The three stages of translation (syntax, semantics, and execution) are color-coded for clarity.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "qXidsICaja/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The design principles and the resulting pipeline of our translator. (Syntax level) Operation dependence synthesis on the syntax level, through the joint optimization of DSL program syntax space and the parsing tree of the NL-based protocols. This process is static and context-free. (Semantics level) Reagent flow analysis on the semantics level, through an automaton scheme maintaining the lifecycles of reagents and intermediate products. This process is static and context-free. (Execution level) Spatial-temporal dynamics analysis on the execution level, through the partial execution trace model based on the spatial-temporal dual constraint representation. This process is dynamic and context-aware.", "description": "This figure illustrates the design principles and pipeline of a protocol translator inspired by human experimenters. It decomposes the translation into three hierarchical stages: syntax, semantics, and execution. Each stage uses different methods (static/dynamic, context-free/context-aware) to construct Protocol Dependence Graphs (PDGs) that represent protocol operations and reagent dependencies.

Panels C, D, and E present comparative results demonstrating that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of overall performance (C) and performance at the syntax (D) and semantic (E) levels.
