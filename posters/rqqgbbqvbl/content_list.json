The cornerstone of its success rests on the availability of high-quality datasets. However, in industrial environments, obtaining accurate labels can often be costly and time-consuming. For example, in financial scenarios, it is challenging for human annotators to accurately assign labels to predict whether a user will default. Currently, many banks and companies utilize rules as low-cost autonomous annotators, especially in the early stages of some financial products. In healthcare scenarios, many rule-based algorithms are also employed to identify patients at risk of developing certain conditions, allowing for early intervention and potentially preventing more severe complications. Although these annotators can provide labels in a time- and cost-efficient manner [7, 44, 45], a single low-cost annotator usually produces biased or inaccurate labels in practice [8, 13, 18, 24, 29, 40]. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "On the other hand, multiple annotators can provide diverse perspectives with different insights and knowledge to mitigate errors and biases of individual annotators [30, 45]. Learning from multiple sets of inaccurate labels provided by multiple annotators has garnered widespread attention and relative works can be divided into two main categories. One stream of research focuses on advanced aggregation algorithms that infer the true labels before or during the training stage. The simplest aggregation algorithm is Majority Voting [38], which treats the labels equally by voting, while the approach known as Weighted Majority Voting [20] uses a weight vector to model annotators\u2019 expertise. Enhanced Bayesian Classifier Combination (EBCC) [22] tends to infer truth by modeling the correlation between annotators.

By viewing the ground-truth labels as latent variables, some methods that consider the relationships among multiple sets of labels have been proposed to infer true labels based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [1, 2, 34, 43]. Despite the effectiveness of these EM algorithms, they suffer from computational complexity during the training phase. In recent studies, an increasing number of studies focus on end-to-end learning. These end-to-end algorithms [3, 7, 10, 21, 27, 45, 30] can directly learn from multiple sets of noisy labels and map these noisy labels to part of the model (e.g., transition matrix) , encouraging the model to learn knowledge from all noisy labels collectively [45].

Most related works often neglect the significance of data refinement. Although some methods have recognized the need for data refinement [21, 31, 42], they merely adopt the small-loss criterion [11] to filter noisy samples, and refinement is not their core contribution or their key point. On the contrary, we contend that refining a relatively clean dataset during training is the central point, which can alleviate the demands placed on model design and enhance the model\u2019s performance. To refine the dataset, an essential step is to assess the reliability of labels from multiple sets. We consider annotator agreement as an instrument, which refers to whether multiple annotators agree or disagree on the labels for a given sample. In this paper, we leverage the annotator agreement information and propose a novel framework named Collaborative Refining for Learning from inaccurate labels (CRL).

For samples where some annotators disagree, Label Refining for samples with Disagreements (LRD) is proposed to select relatively reliable labels. Based on a theoretical analysis of the relationships among multiple label sets, ground-truth labels, and model predictions, LRD identifies the most reliable label by comparing the loss values. For samples where all annotators agree, Robust Union Selection (RUS) is proposed to select trustworthy samples to form a higherquality dataset. Guided by theoretical bounds on loss values, RUS introduces a loss-based selection criterion and improves it to be more robust against potentially problematic values. Meanwhile, the refined datasets are used to train a lightweight model that can be deployed and utilized for final prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. The framework is designed to be independent of any specific model architecture, making it compatible with most existing methods, which is confirmed by further experiments.

This work also lays the foundation for subsequent research of multi-class classification tasks with inaccurate labels. However, in the multi-class scenario, the proposed method needs to be further adapted. For instance, an issue arises with samples where annotators disagree, particularly when all the given labels for a particular sample are incorrect in the multi-class setting. LRD tends to select one of these incorrect labels as the inferred label, negatively impacting the model\u2019s performance. In binary classification problems, this situation is naturally avoided because when annotators disagree, one of the labels must be correct. A possible solution could be to develop a more refined measure based on annotator agreement, which could be utilized to decide whether to discard these samples, using LRD or RUS.

We believe that the sample segmentation strategy can be further improved. To achieve this, we can introduce a new metric: the consistency rate, defined as the proportion of agreement among annotators for the same sample. By establishing a threshold for this consistency rate, we can effectively partition the dataset. Specifically, for samples with a consistency rate exceeding the threshold, RUS is applied, whereas for samples with a consistency rate below the threshold, LRD is utilized. The determination of this threshold is related to the label qualities of the dataset and the number of label sets available, which is suitable for practical applications. Since these ideas are not yet mature enough, we did not include these parts in the current manuscript. We leave these issues for future research.

Some works aim to estimate the noise transition matrix [12, 17, 24, 28], which contains the probabilities of clean labels filpping into inaccurate labels. However, the noise transition matrix is hard to estimate accurately. The second approach is sample selection, employing sample selection methods to select possibly clean examples from a mini-batch and train the model with these examples [11, 13, 19, 23, 25, 35].

Enhanced Bayesian Classifier Combination (EBCC) [22] utilizes the Bayesian classifier to infer truth by modeling the correlation between annotators. By viewing the true labels as a latent variable, some methods considering relations among annotators are proposed to infer true labels based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The seminal works [4] (known as the DS model) assume that every annotator has class-dependent confusion when providing annotations, which is modeled by an annotator-specific noise confusion matrix.

CoNAL[3] assumes that the annotation noise is attributed to two sources (common noise and individual noise), and combines these two noises by a Bernoulli random variable. SLF[7] proposes to make the weight vectors and the confusion matrices data-dependent and comes up with two regularization methods for the confusion matrix to guide the training process.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
