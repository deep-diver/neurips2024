In-context learning performance typically increases with the number of provided examples. Xiong et al. (2023) show that language modeling loss decreases as function of the number of preceding tokens, following a power law. Fort (2023) describe a scaling law describing vulnerability of language models to adversarial perturbations of residual stream activations: the maximum number of output tokens that an attacker can control is directly proportional to the number of dimensions of activation space they can perturb. In our work, we observe that in-context learning follows power laws on most tasks, reminiscent of scaling laws for pretraining (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022) or finetuning (Hernandez et al., 2021) performance. Del\u00e9tang et al. (2024) studies a similar quantity (in-context compression rate) as a function of context length, but doesn\u2019t comment on the functional form of their empirical results. Wei et al. (2023b); Ratner et al. (2023) and, concurrently with our work, Agarwal et al. (2024); Jiang et al.

We study the long-context scalability of this form of jailbreak by identifying the scaling laws and using these to measure progress towards fixing this vulnerability. The distinction between the fixed vs. arbitrarily long context versions of this attack makes a material difference on mitigation attempts. Our analyses suggest that the current alignment pipeline involving supervised and reinforcement learning is sufficient at mitigating the short-context version of MSJ, and fails with long context windows. Kandpal et al. (2023) explore how to conduct backdoor attacks such that the planted backdoor still gets activated through in-context learning. The theoretical results of Wolf et al.

We are at a peculiar moment in time where we as a society are learning together how to both use and mis-use novel large language models. Model deployment in high-stakes domains (e.g., defense, healthcare, civil infrastructure, etc.) is currently minimal, but is likely to grow rapidly. At the same time, we also expect models to continue to become increasingly capable of both good and bad outcomes (Ganguli et al., 2022).

The simple yet effective attack described in this paper is an example; and scaling laws on adversarial attacks on LLM suggest that the number of bits accessible to adversaries is directly proportional to the number of bits in the output that can be controlled Fort (2023). Similarly, the diversity and amount of distribution shifts that might be induced under large context windows make it difficult to both train and evaluate models to act safely on out-of-distribution data Anil et al. (2022); Dziri et al. (2023). The behavioral drifts of instruction-tuned models during long conversations (e.g. that of Sydney, the model powering Bing Chat before it was context-constrained Roose (2023)) is an example for this difficulty. More worryingly, such behavioral drifts might also occur naturally in situations where the model is situated in an environment and is given a goal (e.g. it\u2019s an agent). An LLM agent\u2019s in-context interactions with the rewards provided by the environment might lead to in-context reward hacks that override safety training. In-context reinforcement learning Laskin et al.

This is occasionally referred to as \u201cindirect prompt injection\" Greshake et al. (2023).
