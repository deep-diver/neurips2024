It shows that Medformer uniquely addresses all three aspects, unlike other methods which only partially utilize these characteristics.  This is crucial for effective MedTS classification because the methods need to capture the relationships between multiple channels, the importance of temporal dynamics at various scales, and the inherent correlations between data points at different time resolutions.", "section": "2 Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "jfkid2HwNr/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: The information of processed datasets.
