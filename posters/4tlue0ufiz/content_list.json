Through a process known as (zero-shot) chain-of-thought (CoT), LLMs can be prompted to generate multiple reasoning steps by instructing them to \u201cthink step by step\u201d at inference time [18]. This method\u2019s accuracy can be improved by including manually designed examples (few-shot CoT) [41]. The tree-of-thoughts approach [44] generalizes CoT by considering multiple reasoning paths. Our work is inspired by the retrieval augmentation mechanism in Auto-CoT [49] and Retrieval-Q-CoT [49], which first use zero-shot CoT to generate a diverse set of reasoning chains and then sample them at runtime as few-shot CoT examples. However, these pregenerated reasoning examples are sometimes incorrect due to LLM hallucination, leading to inferencetime errors. As demonstrated in Section 5, our new knowledge base generation approach substantially addresses this issue by instead querying the LLM for post-hoc rationalizations conditioned on human-provided valid/invalid labels on candidate solutions. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Retrieval-augmented generation. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) augments the input space of LMs with retrieved text passages, significantly improving performance on knowledge-intensive tasks [10, 20, 29]. Traditional RAG methods typically use open-source, off-the-shelf knowledge bases for text generation [16, 33, 25, 47, 43, 51]. Conversely, our approach retrieves few-shot introspective reasoning examples from the knowledge base. This guides LLMs to explicitly reason about uncertainties and safety, formulating plan in a structured format, as shown in Tab. 13. In practice, we observe this strategy results in a more grounded reasoning process compared to conventional RAG, which relies on open-source knowledge bases. While existing RAG literature primarily addresses content hallucination, our approach aims to equip language agents with the capability to introspect and refine their own uncertainties. This emphasis allows for uncertainty-aware planning in robotics and achieves tighter statistical guarantees with conformal prediction. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "LLMs as planners. Emergent reasoning allows LLMs to break down a task into intermediate subgoals and generate actions as a sequence of plans [11]. Through prompting and in-context learning, LLMs can ground human instructions in natural language into executable robot actions conditioned on scene descriptions [21, 35, 1, 12]. Recent works further enhance the reasoning and planning ability by iteratively refining actions through self-reflection during planning [45, 24, 28, 6, 34, 39, 23]. ReAct [45] and Reflexion [34] focus on multi-step planning scenarios, in which robots can execute certain actions, observe the state feedback, and replan for correction. However, in safety-critical robotic applications, certain invalid actions can immediately lead to catastrophic safety failures that cannot be recovered from. Therefore, instead of relying on self-correction by trial and error, our method uses retrieval augmentation to guide the language agent to proactively reason about task compliance and safety at the planning stage. Additionally, recent work [17] has shown that LLMs cannot plan effectively through self-reflection alone but can do so when integrated with external verifiers, aligning with our method that employs LLMs to support planning by constructing an external knowledge base.

Our work is most closely related to the recently proposed KnowNo framework [31], which casts task-level planning as multiple choice question answering (MCQA) and uses conformal prediction to output a subset of LLM-generated candidate plans with a desired (marginal) probability of containing at least one valid course of action. Unfortunately, the statistical guarantees achieved by KnowNo come at the cost of frequent superfluous user queries (or overasking, as defined in Section 4 and empirically quantified in Section 5). In contrast, our method introduces a new introspection-based approach to automatically align the robot\u2019s uncertainty with the inherent task specification ambiguity before predicting a high-confidence subset of plans. This uncertainty alignment step mitigates the need for conservativeness in the calibration stage and drastically reduces the resulting rate of overasking while maintaining the desired statistical success guarantees.

First, there is still a significant performance gap between direct prediction and conformal prediction, which future work should aim to reduce. Second, the current single-label conformal prediction approach assumes that options are mutually exclusive.

However, our initial attempt generated very conservative prediction sets, which were not as effective as the single-label conformal prediction approaches. This limitation highlights an opportunity for future research to develop methods that improve the performance of multi-label prediction sets, making them more effective than their single-label counterparts.

In contrast, our approach considers all valid labels simultaneously and reasons over non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. Limitation. While this is a more reasonable way to perform calibration on truly ambiguous task, we noticed the prediction sets are usually conservative and not as good as the single-label conformal prediction approaches.
