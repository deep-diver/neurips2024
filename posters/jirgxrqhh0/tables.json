It shows the model used (ResNet18), batch size, learning rate, training cost, number of epochs, number of local FedAvg steps, and h (the number of local steps before the model is sent to the server). These parameters are important for understanding and reproducing the results of the CIFAR-10 experiments reported in the paper.", "section": "B Additional Experimental Results"}]
