Subfigures (a) and (b) show the number of passes required by each algorithm as a function of epsilon (\u03b5), while subfigure (c) shows the memory usage as a function of epsilon for both algorithms on both datasets.  The parameter k is fixed at 4.  The results indicate that APPROX-DD-HEURISTIC offers advantages in terms of the number of passes, especially on sparse graphs, while maintaining memory efficiency.", "section": "5 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "EC9Hfi9V3k/figures/figures_9_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The number of passes versus \u03b5 on NY Times (1a), on Dense (1b), and the memory versus \u03b5 on two datasets (1c), fixing k = 4.
