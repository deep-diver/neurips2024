Graphlet sampling enhances machine learning applications by transforming graph structures into feature vectors for tasks such as graph classification and subgraph identification, boosting neural network performance, and supporting clustered federated learning by capturing local structures and relationships. A recent work has shown that the problem admits an algorithm that preprocesses $G$ in time $O(n k^{2}\\log k+m)$ , and draws one sample in expected time $k^{O(k)}\\log{n}$ , where $n=|V(G)|$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{m=|E(G)|}\\end{array}$ .

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph (where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|)$ and $k\\,>\\,2$ an integer. A $k$ -graphlet of $G$ is a connected, induced subgraph of $G$ on $k$ vertices. It is well known that the $k$ -graphlet distribution (the relative frequency of $k$ -cliques, $k$ -paths, and so on) reveals key information about the structure of a graph $[\\bar{\\mathbf{M}}\\bar{\\mathbf{S}}\\mathbf{O}\\mathbf{I}^{+}02]$ and can be transformed into the feature vector for graph classification and subgraph identification $[\\mathrm{TLT^{+}}19]$ . Graphlet information also contributes to neural network in several ways. $[\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{G}^{+}20]$ converted the graph to a matrix by sampling $k$ -graphlets for a sequence of vertices so that convolutional neural networks can be applied. $[\\mathrm{TLT}^{+}19]$ showed that using graphlet frequency as a node attribute improves the performance of diffusion-convolutional neural networks for node classification and graph classification. It is also at the heart of graph mining applications such as graph kernels $[\\mathrm{SVP^{+}09}]$ . Furthermore, in clustered federated learning [GCYR22], graphlet sampling can be applied to improve model performance by capturing the local structures and characteristics of the data distributed across various clients or devices. Specifically, graphlet distributions can be used to model relationships between clients or their data in a way that reflects the underlying graph structure, allowing for more informed clustering decisions. As a consequence, sampling $k$ -graphlets uniformly at random from $G$ has become a key primitive in graph mining and machine learning. This problem is called Graphlet Sampling, and many algorithms have been proposed for it [ABH19, BRRAH12, $\\mathbf{BCK}^{+}17$ , $\\bar{\\mathbf{B}}\\bar{\\mathbf{C}}\\bar{\\mathbf{K}}^{+}18$ , BLP19, BLP21, CLWL16, HS16, MG20, PSS19, SH15, $\\mathtt{W L R}^{+}14]$ .

The computational model, called streaming model, is as follows. First, the graph $G$ can only be read by scanning its edges sequentially, in an arbitrary order that is unknown to the algorithm. Each scan of the list is called a pass. Second, the algorithm is only granted $M=o(|G|)$ words of memory of $\\Theta(\\log n)$ bits each, where $n=|V|$ . For the case $M=o(n)$ , the algorithm cannot even store the vertex set and is too restrictive. In this work, we consider the semi-streaming model, in which the algorithm has memory $M=\\Omega(n)$ and the input graph is dense such that $M=o(m)$ . Hence, the algorithm can store the degrees of $G$ but not the entire graph. The goal is to find an algorithm that makes a small number of passes, usually ${\\cal O}(\\log n)$ . This kind of algorithms is widely studied in graph mining, as they are useful when the input data are stored remotely or are too large to fit in main memory. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Let us discuss the problem in more detail under the standard RAM model of computation. Sampling a $k$ -vertex subgraph of $G$ that is not necessarily connected is straightforward: just sample a $k$ -vertex set $S\\subseteq V$ and return $G[S]$ . The problem becomes nontrivial, though, when the subgraph must be connected (i.e., a $k$ -graphlet). In this case, one very general approach is rejection sampling: one samples some connected subgraph $G[S]$ from some distribution, and then accepts $G[S]$ with some appropriate probability, so that the resulting distribution is as close to uniform as possible. For almost a decade, all known rejection sampling techniques had a worst-case running time of $\\Theta(n^{k})$ , or sampled from a nonuniform distribution [BRRAH12, $\\mathtt{W L R}^{+}14$ , SH15, BLP19, BLP21]. It was then shown that both issues can be avoided by using a simple two-phase algorithm, UGS (Uniform Graphlet Sampler) [Bre21a, Bre23]. The key idea behind UGS is to sort $G$ topologically by repeatedly deleting a vertex of maximum degree; this takes time $O(n k^{2}\\log k+m)$ where $m=|E|$ . Afterwards, one chooses a starting vertex $v$ according to a certain distribution computed from the topological order, creates a $k$ -graphlet $g$ by exploring the graph surrounding $v$ with vertices topologically no smaller than $v$ in a randomized way, and accepts $g$ with a certain probability (otherwise, the process is repeated). It can be shown that the distribution of the accepted graphlets is uniform, and that the expected time before accepting a graphlet is $k^{O(k)}\\log{n}$ . ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is therefore natural to apply UGS to the streaming setting. This is not so immediate, though. One key obstacle is that the computation of the topological order of $G$ seems inherently sequential: after deleting a maximum-degree vertex from $G$ , one needs to update the degrees of its neighbors, and in the streaming model this would require one pass. We would thus make $n$ passes in total, which is unacceptable. In this work we show how to overcome these kind of obstacles. We obtain an algorithm that in ${\\widetilde{O}}(\\log n)$ passes computes an approximate topological order of $G$ , and afterwards can sample $\\Theta(M/k^{O(k)})$ independent uniform random graphlets every $O(k)$ passes, as long as the algorithm has $M=\\Omega(k n)$ words of memory. We make several other nontrivial improvements that has practical impacts. For instance, while deciding if each vertex is contained in a sized- $k$ graphlet takes $k$ passes in a straightforward implementation, we show how to do that in only 1 pass. In the sampling phase, we show how to share computation between parallel trials such that the running time can be reduced by a factor of $M$ (and thus a factor of $n$ ), even though the distributions of the parallel instances are still independent. Specifically, if there are $Q$ parallel instances, instead of taking $O(m Q)$ time per pass on the edge list, we reduce the running time to $O(m\\log Q)$ . This requires a careful orchestration of random number generation, sorting, and prefix sum computations. We also prove that any $p$ -pass streaming algorithm for Graphlet Sampling requires memory $\\Omega\\left({\\frac{n}{p}}\\right)$ ; therefore, our algorithm is nearly space-optimal. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments which verify the relation between several metrics and the parameters of the algorithm.
