This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pretraining loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the Transformer models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks, with a fixed data corpus, tokenization, and model architecture. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks\u2014regardless of the continuity of metrics\u2014when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses.

Emergent abilities [58] are defined as abilities that present in larger LMs but not present in smaller one. The existence of such abilities is recently challenged for two reasons. First, small LMs trained on a sufficient amount of high-quality data can outperform large models on tasks with claimed emergent abilities [55, 56, 26]. For example, LLaMA-13B with less compute [55] can outperform GPT-3 (175B) on MMLU [21], due to more training tokens and improved data-filtering methods. Second, Schaeffer et al.

Existing literature has either focused on the transfer learning paradigm [33, 54] or constrained its study to single models, tasks, or prompting methods [49, 61].

Their downstream performance is evaluated on 12 diverse datasets covering different tasks, languages, prompting types, and answer forms. We demonstrate that the pre-training loss of an LM is predictive of its performance on downstream tasks, regardless of its model size or data size.

In the transfer learning setting, i.e. the language model is pre-trained on the general corpus and fine-tuned on supervised data of specific tasks, Tay et al. [54] find that models with the same pre-training loss can have different downstream performance after finetuning, due to inductive bias in model architectures such as Transformers and Switch Transformers. Tay et al. [53] further study the effect of model shapes on downstream fine-tuning. Liu et al. [33] also study the effect of inductive bias of model sizes and model algorithms on the relationship of pre-training loss and downstream performance after fine-tuning, but their theory only applies in the saturation regime, where the models are close to minimal possible pre-training loss. Instead, large language models today are generally under-trained [23, 55], far from the saturation regime. Overall, these studies focus on the pretrain-finetune paradigm, in which inducitive bias helps improve transferability, while we study prompted performance of large language models without finetuning [29, 6]. For the prompted performance of large language models, Xia et al. [61] claim that perplexity is a strong predictor of in-context learning performance, but the evidence is limited to the OPT model [66] and a subset of BIG-Bench [51]. Instead, Shin et al. [49] find that low perplexity does not always imply high in-context learning performance when the pre-training corpus changes. Gadre et al. [18] ftis the relation of perplexity and the top-1 error averaged over many natural language tasks with a power law. Instead, we focus on the different relations of tasks and a small part of tasks that show emergency trends. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Emergent abilities. Wei et al. [58] propose the idea of emergent abilities, abilities that only present in large language models. This is similar to the claim of Ganguli et al. [19] that it is more difficult to predict the capacities of language models than to predict the pre-training loss. The existence of emergent abilities has been challenged. Hoffmann et al. [23] show that smaller language models trained with sufficient data can outperform undertrained larger language models, supported by followup models [55, 26, 56]. On the other hand, Schaeffer et al. [46] claim that emergent abilities are due to the discontinuous metrics used for evaluation, also found in Xia et al. [61]. Similarly, Hu et al. [24] propose to predict the performance of emergent abilities with the infinite resolution evaluation metric. In this paper we prove the existence of emergent abilities from the perspective of pre-training loss, even with continuous metrics.

But there are fundamentally different model architectures, such as routed Transformers [16], and non-Transformer architectures [17, 39] beyond our consideration.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
