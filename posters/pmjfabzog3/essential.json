Existing methods often involve relaxations onto the Birkhoff polytope, but these can have limitations in terms of dimensionality and the preservation of geometric structures.  The Birkhoff polytope-based methods also often require penalty terms to encourage solutions that are near permutation matrices. \nThis paper introduces OT4P, a novel approach that relaxes permutations onto the orthogonal group.  **OT4P uses a temperature-controlled differentiable transformation to map an unconstrained vector space to the orthogonal group, concentrating the orthogonal matrices near the permutation matrices.** This provides a more efficient parameterization than the Birkhoff polytope and avoids the need for penalty terms. The paper shows how to use this parameterization for both gradient-based and stochastic optimization and demonstrates its efficacy on several benchmark problems.  The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "pMJFaBzoG3/podcast.wav"}
