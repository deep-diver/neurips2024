The HST is a tree structure that hierarchically measures the local consistency of each coarse correspondence across multiple feature scales. The process begins by extracting local patches at multiple scales from a feature pyramid. Then, the similarity between these patches is calculated layer by layer using a novel overlap-aware Sinkhorn distance. This distance measure focuses on the most likely overlapping points, improving robustness to noise.  By aggregating consistency measures across all scales, the HST filters out locally dissimilar correspondences, leading to more accurate and robust registration.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "sfPxUqzdPI/figures/figures_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the proposed method. The overall architecture (Top) is designed in a coarse-to-fine manner, which extracts coarse correspondences and then refines them to point level. Our proposed method contains the following parts: 1. Local exploration (Left) extracts local patch pairs for each putative match in multiple scales from the feature pyramid (Sec. 3.2.1). 2. Patch Overlap Prediction module (Bottom Middle) is then adopted to predict the overlap points between patch pairs (Sec. 3.2.2). 3. Overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance (Bottom Right) measures the patch similarity by focusing on potential overlap points (Sec. 3.2.3). Finally, we repeat the above operations across the layers to construct the Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (Left) in a BFS way. The process of modeling MSC essentially involves traversing a pair of HSTs and then aggregating the consistency measures of the corresponding tree nodes (Sec. 3.2.4).", "description": "This figure provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (HST) method for robust 3D point cloud registration. It illustrates the method's coarse-to-fine approach, starting with coarse matching at multiple scales, and then refining it to the point level using local patch exploration, overlap prediction, overlap-aware Sinkhorn distance computation, and hierarchical tree traversal.

Two patches from different point clouds are compared. One patch pair (green) represents inlier correspondences and has a lower Sinkhorn distance (SD) of 0.231. The other patch pair (red) represents outlier correspondences and has a higher SD of 0.678.
