Route planning is classically formulated in the language of graph theory as searching for paths between a source and a destination that optimize a single static objective (Dijkstra, 1959), usually travel time. In practice, route planning systems are not as simple. For example, navigation services like Google Maps do not only optimize for travel time\u2014they allow drivers to specify multiple modes of transportation, add intermediate stops, and convey preferences about avoiding roads with bike lanes (Ratliff et al., 2009). Modern routing systems are better described as performing semantic routing: a contextual and multi-objective generalization of route planning that involves processing a rich user query that specifies not only a source and destination but also various criteria\u2014such as bike lanes preferences\u2014and responding with a satisfactory route (Delling et al., 2017). ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Current routing systems implement semantic routing capabilities in an ad hoc way, customizing classical route optimization algorithms to support specific and limited types of route criteria. For example, the technique of \u201ccost modifiers\u201d rescales edge weights according to whether the edge type is preferred/dispreferred, such as doubling travel time along small roads when it is indicated that small roads should be avoided (Ratliff et al., 2009), and then runs a standard shortest-paths algorithm. As industry routing services transition to offering increasingly rich experiences, it has become clear that the current paradigm is unscalable. First, this ad hoc approach can only support the limited types of route criteria that can be efficiently achieved through classical graph algorithms; for example, cost modifiers only support \u201clinear\u201d criteria (Ratliff et al., 2009). Second, modern routing systems are complex ensembles of combinatorial algorithms and expensive to maintain; supporting new features requires adding new customized algorithms into an already messy ensemble and even then different route criteria can often not be efficiently combined. Third, current systems cannot take full advantage of rich graph metadata as they require explicit instructions on what and how to use each data field (Cormen et al., 2022); this is a major opportunity cost as, for example, modern road network metadata include live road conditions, the businesses along each road (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017), and even the locations and types of fruit trees (Welty and Phillips, 2013). One can directly observe how these limitations manifest in industry services. For example, Google Maps allows for specifying an intermediate stop if an explicit address is given but cannot automatically plan a short stop to purchase dental floss; it can provide routes that use public transportation but not when an intermediate stop is specified. In this paper, we study the open question of building a semantic routing system that is truly scalable and offers general open-ended capabilities.

Moreover, as we will demonstrate, learned models can approximately fulfill route criteria that may not admit efficient classical solutions and take advantage of available rich graph metadata that may be impractical to manually engineer support for. Semantic routing also exhibits the usual hallmarks of a practical machine learning application: though undesirable, having latency and errors in a semantic routing system is not typically catastrophic or dangerous, unlike higher-stakes applications such as autonomous driving.

Traditional routing tasks are approached as finding shortest paths within road networks and can be solved with dynamic programming algorithms such as Dijkstra\u2019s method (Dijkstra, 2022) and its generalizations (Shimbel, 1954; Bellman, 1958; Ford, 1956). Their efficiency has been improved via priority-queue-based implementations (Goldberg, 2001; Meyer, 2001), bidirectional search (Sint and de Champeaux, 1977), $\\mathbf{A}^{*}$ search (Hart et al., 1968), and contraction hierarchies (Bast et al., 2016; Delling et al., 2009; Bauer et al., 2010) that specifically make use of the near planar structure of the road networks. However, incorporating custom contextual information into these algorithms is challenging, requiring solving a (often NP-complete) combinatorial problem per context. For a very narrow set of contextual routing tasks where the \u201ccost\u201d of a route can be decomposed into sum of its component edges, it is possible to define context-dependent cost modifiers on edges such that the running shortest-paths on the new costs results in satisfactory solutions (Ratliff et al., 2009). However, this approach is not possible for most routing tasks of interest and\u2014even when available\u2014still requires one to solve the challenging problem of learning how to design good cost modifiers from complex natural language queries. A more generally available alternative is to run unguided search algorithms such as $\\mathbf{A}^{*}$ search or spectral methods based on electrical flows (Sinop et al., 2021) to compute a large set of candidate routes from source to destination, and then extract the best candidate. However, this approach needs one to have a good way of scoring candidate routes and may require iterating through intractably many candidates to find a solution.

As expected, scale leads to gains in prediction power but these gains quickly saturate. If we rescale our model simultaneously in both directions, we again observe quickly diminishing gains from scale; this result is depicted at the left of Figure 10 and is stated in terms of semantic routing success rate rather than next-edge prediction accuracy. This saturation in gains from scaling up model capacity is one reason to believe that our choice of a simple transformer architecture may not be optimal.

Most timesteps in real-world routing tasks are uninteresting and, for example, correspond to driving straight on a highway for hundreds of road segments. Typically, this is addressed with hierarchical methods that add \u201cshortcut\u201d edges to summarize common sequences of road segments (Delling et al., 2009). To maintain the simplicity of our proof-of-concept, we only implemented a simple alternative of contracting vertices with edges of the same road type, which only reduced effective road segment length by a factor of 2-3. This posed an issue as, in longer routes, next-vertex pairs contain sparser signals as more of the route is trivial, making training more expensive. We accordingly configured our benchmark to restrict navigation tasks to those can be solved in 600 road segments. The benchmark can be made more challenging by increasing this cap, which will require integrating techniques like strategically adjusting the coarseness of road segments in contraction hierarchies (Delling et al., 2009).

We expect that performance improvements can be gained by both enlarging the size of the receptive field and including richer graph metadata (e.g., allowing the model to retrieve the reviews of relevant local businesses during route finding), for which graph representation learning methods such as GNNs and graph transformers (Yun et al., 2019; Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020) are potentially useful thanks to their ability to combine the information from graph connectivity and metadata through learning.
