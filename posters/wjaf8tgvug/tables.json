The evaluation is performed in a zero-shot setting, meaning the models are not fine-tuned on the DUD-E dataset.  Performance is measured using AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), BEDROC (Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination of Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), and EF (Enrichment Factor) at different thresholds (0.5%, 1%, and 5%).  S-MolSearch, with two variations (trained with a 0.4 similarity threshold and a 0.9 similarity threshold), demonstrates superior performance across all metrics compared to the other methods.", "section": "4.4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "wJAF8TGVUG/tables/tables_6_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Performance on LIT-PCBA in zero-shot setting.", "description": "This table presents the performance of various virtual screening methods on the LIT-PCBA benchmark dataset in a zero-shot setting (i.e., without any fine-tuning on the benchmark dataset).  The metrics used for evaluation are AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), BEDROC (Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination of Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), and Enrichment Factor at 0.5%, 1%, and 5% (EF0.5%, EF1%, EF5%).  Higher values for these metrics indicate better performance. The table compares S-MolSearch's performance (with two different similarity thresholds: 0.4 and 0.9) to several established ligand-based (LBVS) and structure-based (SBVS) virtual screening methods. This allows for a direct comparison and assessment of S-MolSearch's effectiveness relative to existing state-of-the-art techniques.  The zero-shot setting is crucial as it reflects the practical scenario of using a pre-trained model without dataset-specific adaptation.", "section": "4.4 Results"}, {"figure_path": "wJAF8TGVUG/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation studies performance on DUD-E and LIT-PCBA.", "description": "This table presents the results of ablation studies conducted on the S-MolSearch model using the DUD-E and LIT-PCBA benchmark datasets.
