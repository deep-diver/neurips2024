Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation.

Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process.

Recently, deep learning methods have also been explored. Methods trained on affinity labels [9, 10, 11] conduct virtual screening by modeling binding affinities and ranking based on prediction. Additionally, a method [12] uses similarities between embedding of pockets and molecules to search for active molecules. However, these SBVS methods cannot escape the dependency on the structure of protein targets, which is unavailable for challenging or novel targets, such as disordered proteins like c-Myc, limiting the applicability of SBVS.

Searching for bioactive molecules needs to consider both structure and electronic similarity. Some methods [14] also require charge comparison, which is expensive and time-consuming. These methods struggle with inefficiency when handling large databases.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
