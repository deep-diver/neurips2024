However, the reasons behind LLMs' ability to learn from just a few examples (in-context learning) are not fully understood.  Existing work simplified this by studying linear self-attention without the softmax unit, revealing limitations. This research addresses this by exploring in-context learning using a softmax regression approach to encompass the behavior of the softmax unit, thus creating a more complete and realistic representation of LLMs' functionality.\nThis paper investigates in-context learning in a simplified model using softmax regression, revealing a surprising theoretical closeness to gradient descent. The authors prove that the data transformations induced by a single self-attention layer and gradient descent on a loss function are both bounded, meaning their differences remain small and controlled.  Numerical experiments also demonstrate a strong similarity between the model's behaviors and predictions when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental regression tasks, confirming the theoretical findings. **This contributes significantly to our understanding of in-context learning and the internal mechanisms of LLMs.**", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "SFaEENfEyw/podcast.wav"}
