We introduce the Parsimonious Latent Space Model (PLSM), a world model that regularizes the latent dynamics to make the effect of the agent\u2019s actions more predictable.

These typical effects have exceptions that are predictable as well, e.g. stepping on the gas will not lead to acceleration if the car engine is turned off, and the video game character will not move if it is facing a wall. How can we learn world models that capture these systematic properties of actions? World models predict the agent\u2019s future states, given the current state and action [1, 2, 3]. Most approaches to world modelling represent high-dimensional observations (such as images) in compact, low-dimensional latent states $\\mathbf{z}_{t}$ , simplifying model-based prediction and control [4].

Several methods focus on state compression for dynamics modeling [1, 22, 5, 6, 23, 24]: The Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM) [22, 2, 25], uses a variational Auto-Encoder in combination with a recurrent model (e.g. a GRU [26]) to infer compact latent states in partially observable environments. Latent consistency is enforced by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between latent states predicted by the model and latent states inferred from pixels. The KL term regularizes the latent state not to contain more information than can be predicted by the dynamics model [2, 27]. Unlike our approach, this information bottleneck is not applied to the dynamics $\\tilde{\\Delta}_{t}$ themselves, but to the representations $\\mathbf{z}_{t}$ . Expanding on this line of work, RePo [12] discards image reconstruction from the RSSM, and simply enforces that the model can reconstruct the environment\u2019s reward function, leading to stronger compression and improved performance in tasks with unpredictable elements. Similar approaches like Denoised MDP [28] only model controllable and reward-relevant aspects of the environment. While simplified latents can make transition dynamics more tractable to model, they do not necessarily give rise to the systematic action representations that we are interested in. Lastly, Self Predictive Representation (SPR) models [7, 6, 5] learn dynamics by predicting the future representations of a target encoder.

Mutual information minimization also has links to generalization ability [31, 32, 33, 34, 35], robustness in RL [36, 37], and exploration [38, 39].

Furthermore, when $\\tilde{\\Delta}_{t}$ is fully disentangled from $\\mathbf{z}_{t}$ , each action can be seen as a transformation that acts on the latent state space in the same way, invariantly of $\\mathbf{z}_{t}$ [44, 45].

In partially observable, non-Markovian environments, next-state prediction is often done with a recurrent model that uses the agent\u2019s history as input. Using our bottleneck here would correspond to the assumption that the effect of the agent\u2019s actions are softly history-invariant. Another promising avenue of research is to combine PLSM with discrete dynamics. Many successful world modelling approaches assume that the latent state space is categorical [25, 46]. Instead of modelling transitions using affine transformations $\\Delta$ , transitions could be modelled by predicting transition matrices. Finally, recent recent advances in controllable video-generation like Genie [47] and UniSim [48] both incorporate actions into their video models. Genie infers latent actions that explain transitions in videos, and UniSim conditions on actions and language instructions to generate controllable videos. Modelling the effect of actions in a parsimonious way could improve the accuracy and generation capabilities of such systems.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
