This work introduces REDUCR, a robust and efficient data downsampling method that uses class priority reweighting. REDUCR reduces the training data while preserving worst-class generalization performance. REDUCR assigns priority weights to datapoints in a class-aware manner using an online learning algorithm. We demonstrate the data efficiency and robust performance of REDUCR on vision and text classification tasks.

On the other hand, training models on such large datasets can demand significant computational resources [Kaddour et al., 2023], making it unsustainable in some situations [Bender et al., 2021, Patterson et al., 2021]. Additionally, the high speed at which streaming data is collected can make it infeasible to train on all of the data before deployment. To tackle these issues, various methods have emerged to selectively choose training data, either through pre-training data pruning [Sorscher et al., 2022, Bachem et al., 2017] or online batch selection techniques [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016, Mindermann et al., 2022], ultimately reducing data requirements and enabling ML models to handle otherwise unmanageable large and complex datasets.

[2022] have developed an online batch selection method called RHO-LOSS, which uses a reference model trained on a holdout dataset to guide the selection of points during training. Certain extensions of this work have focused on using a reference model in different settings such as reinforcement learning [Sujit et al., 2022]. However, to our knowledge, none have focused on improving the worst-class generalisation performance. Other batch selection methods [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016, Jiang et al., 2019, Kawaguchi and Lu, 2020] use the training loss of points under the model or an approximate gradient norm [Katharopoulos and Fleuret, 2017] to select challenging points. We observe that these methods (e.g., see Loshchilov and Hutter [2016] in Figure 2) exhibit greater consistency in terms of worst-class generalization error in imbalanced datasets. Nevertheless, Loshchilov and Hutter [2016] do not surpass the average generalization error achieved by point selection with a reference model, namely, RHO-LOSS. Recently, several works have also used reference models or a holdout dataset to train robust models. Oren et al. [2019], Liu et al. [2021], Clark et al. [2019] use a reference model to identify difficult-to-learn groups (or points, or biases) during training. Han et al. [2018] use two models which act as a reference model for the other to remove noisy points from the training data. Cao et al. [2021], Ren et al.
