{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on efficient model initialization and variable-sized models.  It **introduces a novel approach to initialize variable-sized Vision Transformers efficiently**, addressing the limitations of existing methods.  This is relevant to current trends in efficient deep learning and opens avenues for research on adaptive model architectures and transfer learning.", "summary": "LeTs: Learnable Transformation efficiently initializes variable-sized Vision Transformers by learning adaptable transformations from a compact learngene module, outperforming from-scratch training.", "takeaways": ["LeTs uses learnable transformations to initialize variable-sized Vision Transformers (ViTs), offering flexibility over existing methods.", "Experiments show LeTs outperforms from-scratch training, achieving better results with significantly less training time.", "LeTs addresses the challenges of efficient model initialization for various downstream tasks and resource constraints."], "tldr": "Existing methods for initializing variable-sized Vision Transformers (ViTs) often involve manually designed transformations or transferring entire pre-trained models, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility.  This limits adaptation to various resource constraints and downstream tasks.  Furthermore, these methods often neglect the width dimension of the learngene, limiting its flexibility. \nThe proposed method, LeTs, tackles these issues by introducing learnable transformations. LeTs simultaneously trains a compact learngene module and a set of transformation matrices which learn to add layers and neurons.  This allows flexible transformation along both the depth and width dimensions. The authors demonstrate LeTs' superiority through extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms existing initialization methods and from-scratch training, while being more efficient.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "7j6xgGj5lF/podcast.wav"}
