The left panel shows the initial pruning problem setup, where the goal is to find a sparse weight matrix W that minimizes reconstruction error while satisfying a sparsity constraint.  The middle panel depicts the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) step, which uses an iterative process to find the optimal support (non-zero elements) for W,  enhanced by a novel p-update scheme. The right panel displays the PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) post-processing step, focusing on optimizing the weights within the support found in the previous step for higher efficiency.", "section": "3 ALPS: Effective LLM pruning in One-shot"}, {"figure_path": "0lBx844upd/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of the proposed ALPS algorithm.
