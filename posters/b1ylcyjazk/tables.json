The densities of the estimated probabilities capture the uncertainty associated with the responses by each model.", "description": "This figure shows the true probabilities of necessity (PN) and sufficiency (PS) for three different reasoning problems compared against the probabilities estimated using three different GPT models. The results show that the more advanced GPT-4 model produces estimates closer to the true values than earlier models, indicating some improvement in reasoning abilities with more advanced models.  Note that the densities are calculated via bootstrap resampling, reflecting uncertainty in the LLM generated outputs.", "section": "4.1 Factual vs. counterfactual predictions"}]
