The left panel shows box plots of the log mean squared error (MSE) for each method across different response functions (step, abs, linear, and sin), providing a summary of their performance.  The right panel shows the estimated functions for one representative run of the experiment for each method, allowing for a visual comparison against the true structural function.", "section": "5 Numerical experiments"}]
