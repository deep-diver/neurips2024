Existing methods for quantifying predictive uncertainty often have limitations in terms of scalability or applicability to diverse model types. This necessitates more robust methods capable of generating accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts.\n\nThe authors introduce Wasserstein Gradient Boosting (WGBoost), a novel algorithm that addresses these challenges. WGBoost leverages Wasserstein gradients to train weak learners on probability distributions. It is shown to achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets across tasks such as classification and regression. **WGBoost's ability to produce non-parametric distributional predictions** makes it particularly valuable for scenarios with high uncertainty and complex data patterns. The method is also applied to evidential learning to enhance its predictive uncertainty quantification.", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cuO0DenqMl/podcast.wav"}
