This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network\u2019s hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

A key role is played by place cells \u2013 so named because they fire in specific spatial locations within an environment [13]. Place cells have spatially constrained firing fields, and \u201cremap\u201d firing patterns in response to significant contextual changes (especially in hippocampal subregion CA3) [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], including motion to a new environment [20] and modified behavioral context or sensory cues [21, 22]. After remapping, they form almost orthogonal representations [21, 23]. These findings suggest that CA3 place cell network may play a key role in maintaining both positional and contextual information [19, 24]. Meanwhile, others have suggested that hippocampal CA3 is a pattern completion and separation device [25, 26, 27, 28] that supports the storage and retrieval of episodic memories from partial cues [29, 7, 28]. This claim is supported by the extensive recurrent collaterals in CA3 [30, 31, 7], which could allow it to act as an autoassociative network retrieving a complete memory fron partial cues [32, 33, 7, 28].

Likewise [39] suggests that spatial awareness results from processing sequences of sensory inputs, and in a learning framework based on Hidden Markov Models, observed the emergence of place-like patterns. Furthermore, [40] trained an RNN on visual observations conditioned on the agent\u2019s direction to predict near-future observations and also found localized spatial representations.

We find that place-like firing patterns closely resembling rodent hippocampal place cells emerge in the encoding layer of this RAE. This emergence does not require explicit sparsity constraints (unlike [38]) and is robust across a wide range of environmental geometries, numbers of encoding units, and dimensions of sensory cues. We demonstrate that the pattern-completion objective encourages encoding units to prioritize temporally stable components of perceived experiences, naturally forming place-like representations. We also find that learned recurrent connections reflect expected variations of sensory experience, and thus enable single cells to form distinct representations of sensory experiences at similar locations in different environments. This mechanism allows our emergent place cells to remap and revert spatial representations when agents move between multiple unfamiliar and familiar environments, resembling place cells in the brain [41, 42, 22].

To explore, we measured the amount of reversion (Pearson correlation with previous firing patterns) during the first few moments of reintroduction to a familiar room. During early cycles, such as the third cycle, reintroduction to a familiar room results in a delayed reversion of the place fields (Pearson correlation $r=0.35$ when the agent enters a familiar room).

Sec. 4). We also found that emergence of place fields is robust to the dimension of the experience vectors and the number of hidden units (Suppl. Sec. 4). There is experimental evidence that place cells can develop multiple place field centers in larger enclosures [53, 54]. We tested whether this phenomenon occurred within our RAE. To do so, we had our agent explore an environment that contained two rooms connected by a tunnel and trained our RAE on the resulting experiences (Fig. 6a).

First, we predict that rapid changes to sensory and contextual experiences within an environment will disrupt and destabilize place fields. This prediction emerges from the results of Sec. 3.2, where we showed that neurons would orient their firing patterns to encode the most varying direction of experience vectors (EVs) at adjacent physical locations. If EVs at neighboring locations exhibit substantial variations over short durations of time, there is no consistent, most varying direction of the EVs. Accordingly, it is impossible for place cells to effectively learn temporal variance at adjacent locations, leading to an interruption in the formation of place cells. This prediction can be readily tested in VR setups as well as in specially constructed physical environments. Spatial information or other metrics of place cell stability should be measured as a function of sensory/contextual experience change. We anticipate a negative correlation that place cell stability decreases as more aspects of the experience are changed. Secondly, expanding on our hypothesis from Sec. 3.1, which suggests that recurrent connections facilitate reversion of place fields, we propose that the absence of recurrent connections will not disrupt formation of place fields, but will prevent them from reverting to previous representations upon re-entry into ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "image", "img_path": "ioe66JeCMF/tmp/641af3ce006bf0fcd1b404512a4208e1b8d8c558d0139bd48ea8af10e8cdbd59.jpg", "img_caption": [], "img_footnote": [], "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Figure 6: a.

Third, it is known that deforming a room by stretching or shrinking it changes the firing fields of grid cells [55, 56, 57, 58] and correspondingly affects human behavior [59], possibly because grid fields depend on path integration [60, 61], and there are trajectory dependent shifts in their locations driven by interaction with border cells [62, 63]. Grid cells provide one important class of inputs to the hippocampus, and so we expect that the changed grid cell input will correspondingly deform the experience manifold. Our model predicts the corresponding statistics of partial remapping of place fields when the familiar but deformed room is revisited. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "We also predict that the dimensionality of place fields is determined by the dimension in which temporally stable experiences change smoothly. As outlined in Sec. 3.2, place cells in our network prioritize encoding the most variable component within a localized region. The dimensionality of emergent place cells is therefore set by the projection of this encoded component onto the experience manifold (EM), and will be defined by the number of independent components of experience that change smoothly as an animal moves through a space\u2014whether physical or abstract. To substantiate, we simulated an agent in 3D rooms and trained our RAE, similar to Sec. 3.1. We observed the emergence of 3D place fields (Fig. 6b). This prediction is indirectly confirmed by Grieves et al. [64], who observed 3D place cells in rodents navigating a lattice maze, a 3D environment that where rodents explore volumetrically. To test in physical spaces, VR setups with parametrically controlled sensory inputs could be employed. For abstract space, the prediction could be tested following procedures similar to the bird-deformation space used in Constantinescu et al. [65], or by placing rodents in 1D or 2D tracks while gradually changing auditory/olfactory signals within the enclosure or varying visual cues displayed on walls.

To do so, we constructed a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) model of CA3 that received partial and noisy sensory inputs while an agent traversing an environment attempted to reconstruct the complete sensory experience at each location based on previous encounters. We demonstrated that networks concurrently minimizing average firing rate and reconstruction error naturally develop place-like responses. These responses create a continuous landscape of attractor basins (Suppl. Sec. 4.3), enabling robust recall of spatial experience at any location. We found that the emergent place-like units display remapping resembling experiments [21, 17, 18, 28], including cells that only fire in some environments while turning off in others, and other that change their firing location in novel environments while reverting in familiar arenas.

While both types of information can be encoded in the CA3 place cell network, our theory suggests a unified \u201csensory as spatial\u201d framework, which leverages the fact that particular combinations of sensory experiences tend to happen at particular locations and that sensory experiences tend to change smoothly over time. Neurally, these facts are embodied in the numerous weakly spatially modulated cells seen as inputs to the hippocampus [66] and which we use as the input to our network. We accordingly propose that these inputs are the primary drivers of place cell generation. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "In our model, neurons that capture more input variance contribute more to pattern completion, and reorganization of recurrent connections serves to maximize their role. This suggests that individual cells will remap to form unique representations for similar sensory experiences encountered in different environments since the trajectory of those experiences and the expected variation of these experiences will differ across rooms. At a network level, this difference is reflected in reorganization of recurrent connections across environments, along with minimal input projection adaptation. These input projections also allow experience trajectories to remain stable in familiar environments, allowing cells to revert to prior firing locations upon return to a familiar arena. Finally, our findings indicate that if a network repeatedly navigates between multiple rooms, it could gradually learn to encode them more efficiently, enabling immediate remapping without learning/rewiring recurrent connections.

Despite this, the majority of active cells continue to exhibit place-like characteristics. (see Fig. 5a). (2) The number of place cells decreases slowly as trial duration increases. This decrease is due to the optimizer forcing the network to encode WSMs more efficiently after the MSE loss stops decreasing. This optimized encoding is thus overfitted to one single room and requires individual cells to fire at unrealistic rates, which are unlikely to occur in biological systems (see Fig. 5b) (3) As $\\lambda_{f r}$ increases, all active cells become place cells.

We observed in our experiments that the number of hidden units required for PF emergence increases as the dimension of the experience vector (EV), i.e., the number of WSM signals, increases. This is likely because increasing the dimensionality of experience will increase the amount of information that must to be stored, and thereby require more hidden units.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \nWhile NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis  \nsions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the   \nnature of the contribution. For example   \n(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.   \n(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.   \n(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).   \n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
