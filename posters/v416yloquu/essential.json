Existing analyses often produced results inconsistent with practical observations, lacking a full explanation for the techniques' success.  This paper tackled this challenge. \nThis research leverages the online-to-nonconvex conversion framework to analyze Adam with EMA. By focusing on the core elements of Adam (momentum and discounting factors) combined with EMA, the authors demonstrate that a clipped version of Adam with EMA achieves optimal convergence rates in various nonconvex settings, both smooth and nonsmooth. This new theoretical framework showcases the advantages of coordinate-wise adaptivity in situations with varying scales, thus offering a deeper understanding of Adam and EMA's power.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "v416YLOQuU/podcast.wav"}
