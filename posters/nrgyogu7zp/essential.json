Existing methods to address this either compromise accuracy or lack hardware efficiency. This paper introduces Sketch Structured Transform (SS1), an operator that enhances both expressivity and GPU efficiency. \nSS1 achieves this by implementing random yet structured parameter sharing. This method, coupled with quantization, allows for significant speed-ups while maintaining or even improving model accuracy. Experiments show that the approach works well when training models from scratch and also when fine-tuning existing models, resulting in faster inference without significant performance loss. **SS1 showcases better quality-efficiency tradeoffs than existing methods**, providing a practical solution to the challenges of efficient inference in deep learning.", "affiliation": "Rice University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "nrgyOGU7ZP/podcast.wav"}
