Existing methods often process many frames simultaneously, leading to high computational costs and memory consumption, or sequentially, leading to error accumulation and limiting parallelization. This paper introduces TURTLE, a novel video restoration framework that addresses these limitations. \nTURTLE uses a truncated causal history model. It efficiently summarizes a video frame's history to improve restoration quality while maintaining computational efficiency.  By storing and summarizing a truncated history, TURTLE avoids the need to process numerous frames in parallel or sequentially. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on several video restoration benchmarks, including video desnowing, deraining, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational costs compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Alberta", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "cUGf2HaNcs/podcast.wav"}
