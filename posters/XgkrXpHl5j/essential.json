Existing methods often make assumptions about feature dimension consistency and data reliability, limiting their generalizability.  These limitations hinder the development of effective multimodal systems for various applications.\nThis paper proposes a generalized multimodal fusion method (GMF) using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation.  GMF addresses these issues by treating features as charged particles and controlling their movement via dissociation and concentration.  This approach significantly reduces downstream task entropy and enhances performance across various tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art results in some instances, while requiring fewer parameters and computational resources.  The flexibility of GMF also allows for seamless integration with other advanced fusion methods.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "XgkrXpHl5j/podcast.wav"}
