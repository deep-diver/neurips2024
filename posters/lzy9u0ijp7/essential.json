Speculative decoding attempts to speed things up by using a smaller, faster model to create a draft, which is then reviewed by the larger model. However, this approach is inefficient due to slow autoregressive generation in the drafting process and uneven time allocation. \nThis paper introduces Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting) to solve these problems. CS Drafting uses two types of cascades: the Vertical Cascade replaces slow neural model generation with faster statistical methods, and the Horizontal Cascade optimizes time allocation by prioritizing more important tokens. Experiments show CS Drafting achieves substantial speedups compared to existing methods, making LLMs more efficient and practical for real-world use.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "lZY9u0ijP7/podcast.wav"}
