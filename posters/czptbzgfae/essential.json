This paper introduces novel algorithms that cleverly combine gradient compression with random reshuffling, significantly reducing communication complexity and improving convergence rates compared to existing methods.", "takeaways": ["Combining gradient compression with random reshuffling (a superior sampling method) significantly improves training efficiency in distributed and federated learning.", "The proposed DIANA-RR and DIANA-NASTYA algorithms effectively reduce variance introduced by gradient compression, leading to faster convergence.", "The paper offers convergence guarantees for these novel methods, demonstrating their theoretical soundness and practical applicability."], "tldr": "Training large machine learning models often involves distributing the task across multiple devices.  This poses a challenge, as communicating the gradients during training can become computationally expensive.  Prior work has mainly focused on techniques that improve communication efficiency, but often these methods use a simpler, less effective gradient sampling technique (sampling *with* replacement).  This research paper aims to improve these methods.\nThe paper focuses on the random reshuffling (RR) technique, a more advanced gradient sampling method (sampling *without* replacement).   It develops new algorithms that combine RR with gradient compression to reduce the communication overhead.  **They introduce algorithms like Q-RR, DIANA-RR, Q-NASTYA, and DIANA-NASTYA**, which incorporate different variance reduction techniques and local computation steps.  **The researchers provide comprehensive convergence analysis and demonstrate improved performance** in various experiments.", "affiliation": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "CzPtBzgfae/podcast.wav"}
