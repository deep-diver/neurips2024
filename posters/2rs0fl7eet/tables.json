[{"figure_path": "2RS0fL7Eet/tables/tables_15_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Memory cost and the number of arithmetic operations at iteration t.", "description": "This table compares the per-iteration memory costs and number of arithmetic operations for four different instrumental variable regression (IVaR) algorithms: the original O2SLS algorithm from Della Vecchia and Basu (2023), the updated O2SLS algorithm (with matrix form updates), the Two-sample One-stage Stochastic Gradient IVaR (TOSG-IVaR), and the One-sample Two-stage Stochastic Gradient IVaR (OTSG-IVaR).  The table highlights the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms (TOSG-IVaR and OTSG-IVaR) compared to the O2SLS algorithms. The memory cost and arithmetic operations are expressed in Big O notation as a function of the dimensions of the variables (dx, dz).", "section": "Per-iteration Complexities"}]
