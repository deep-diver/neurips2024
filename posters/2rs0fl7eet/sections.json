[{"heading_title": "IVaR's Evolution", "details": {"summary": "Instrumental Variable Regression (IVaR) has seen significant evolution. Early methods relied on two-stage least squares (2SLS), a simple but potentially biased approach.  **Minimax optimization** emerged as a more sophisticated alternative, framing IVaR as a conditional stochastic optimization problem. However, this approach proved computationally expensive and involved approximations. Recent advancements focus on **direct solutions** to the conditional stochastic optimization problem using streaming algorithms. This enables fully online IVaR with streaming data, avoiding the need for matrix inversions or minibatching. These new algorithms leverage two-sample or one-sample oracles to create unbiased gradient estimators, significantly improving efficiency and addressing the 'forbidden regression' problem inherent in 2SLS.  **The shift from minimax to direct optimization methods** represents a major advancement, offering both theoretical improvements and practical benefits for handling high-dimensional or streaming data."}}, {"heading_title": "Streaming IVaR", "details": {"summary": "Streaming IVaR addresses the challenge of performing instrumental variable regression (IVaR) on data that arrives sequentially, a common scenario in real-time applications.  Traditional IVaR methods often require processing the entire dataset at once, making them unsuitable for streaming settings.  **Streaming IVaR algorithms aim to update the IVaR estimates incrementally as new data arrives, without needing to store or reprocess past data.** This approach is crucial for efficiency and scalability when dealing with massive or continuously generated datasets.  **Key challenges in streaming IVaR include handling data dependencies, managing computational costs for online updates, and maintaining statistical consistency.**  Different techniques, such as stochastic gradient methods and online two-stage least squares, have been proposed to tackle these challenges.  **A critical aspect is ensuring convergence guarantees and theoretical bounds on estimation error in the streaming setting.** Furthermore,  **the trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy needs careful consideration.**  Finally, **practical applications of streaming IVaR are wide-ranging, including online A/B testing, real-time causal inference, and adaptive control systems.**"}}, {"heading_title": "Two-Sample Oracle", "details": {"summary": "The concept of a 'Two-Sample Oracle' in the context of instrumental variable regression with streaming data is a crucial innovation.  It elegantly addresses the challenge of estimating causal effects when dealing with endogenous variables and unobservable confounders. **The oracle's ability to provide two independent samples of the independent variable (X), conditioned on the instrument (Z), is key.** This cleverly sidesteps the need for explicitly modeling the relationship between Z and X, which is often problematic due to the 'forbidden regression' issue, thus avoiding potential biases. By constructing an unbiased stochastic gradient estimator using these independent samples, the proposed method significantly improves efficiency and accuracy.  **This unbiased estimator is particularly powerful in the streaming data setting because it doesn't require nested sampling or mini-batches**, both of which can be computationally expensive. The method's effectiveness hinges on the availability of this oracle, making its accessibility a significant practical consideration. Overall, the two-sample oracle approach offers a more direct and efficient way to address complex causal inference problems in the streaming data paradigm, showcasing the power of clever algorithmic design to overcome long-standing challenges."}}, {"heading_title": "One-Sample Oracle", "details": {"summary": "The 'One-Sample Oracle' scenario presents a more realistic, yet challenging, situation for instrumental variable regression. Unlike the 'Two-Sample Oracle', which provides independent samples, the one-sample approach only offers a single observation (Xt, Yt, Zt) per iteration. This limitation necessitates modifications to gradient estimation, shifting from unbiased to biased estimators.  **The core challenge is the absence of a readily available independent sample for X**, forcing methods to work with a single, potentially noisy estimate. Consequently, **algorithms designed for the one-sample oracle often employ two-stage procedures**.  The first stage focuses on estimating the relationship between Z and X (often involving online updating of model parameters), while the second leverages this estimate, along with Y, to update the model parameters for the causal effect of X on Y.  This introduces additional complexity in the analysis and necessitates assumptions on model structure, often favoring linear models to ease mathematical tractability. While it may appear less efficient, this two-stage approach remains important because it mirrors the conditions found in many real-world applications of instrumental variable regression where only single observations per sample are readily available.  **The analysis for one-sample oracles typically demonstrates slower convergence rates** than two-sample counterparts, underscoring the price of limited data availability."}}, {"heading_title": "Future Works", "details": {"summary": "The paper's conclusion mentions several promising avenues for future research.  **Extending the theoretical analysis to nonlinear models** is a significant challenge, requiring a deeper dive into non-convex stochastic optimization and potentially the development of novel analysis techniques.  **Developing streaming inferential methods for IVaR** would greatly enhance the practical applicability of the proposed algorithms. This involves constructing appropriate confidence intervals or hypothesis tests within the streaming setting, which necessitates novel approaches to handle dependent data.  **Investigating Markovian-type dependency assumptions** instead of i.i.d. data would make the algorithms more robust and applicable to a wider range of real-world problems.  Finally, exploring **alternative loss functions** beyond the squared loss and considering **more sophisticated gradient estimation** techniques, like Multilevel Monte Carlo, will significantly improve the efficiency and efficacy of the algorithms in handling various scenarios.  This will lead to the development of more accurate, efficient and broadly applicable algorithms for causal inference in a streaming data environment."}}]
