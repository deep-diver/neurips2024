There are two common classification settings based on how the data is available to the learner: batch and online. In the batch setting, the learner is provided with a fixed set of training samples that are used to train a classifier, which is then deployed to make predictions on new, real-world examples [Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1971, Natarajan, 1989]. On the other hand, data arrives sequentially in the online setting and predictions need to be made in each round [Littlestone, 1987, Daniely et al., 2011].

This hardness result arises mainly because the adversary can deterministically choose hard examples, even possibly adapting to the learner\u2019s strategy. One way to circumvent this hardness result is to consider a smoothed online model, where the adversary has to choose and draw examples from sufficiently anti-concentrated distributions [Rakhlin et al., 2011, Haghtalab, 2018, Haghtalab et al., 2020, Block et al., 2022].

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
