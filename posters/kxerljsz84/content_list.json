We overcome these challenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with sufficiently diverse data enables learning reasonable character localization for any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a large number of instances, and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy, leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained detection model with approximate character localization is available, it is possible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a different alphabet. Our approach, dubbed DTLR, builds on a completely different paradigm than state-of-the-art HTR methods, which rely on autoregressive decoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a complete line in parallel. Remarkably, we demonstrate good performance on a large range of scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches.

Similarly, on the READ dataset, our performance is reasonable but still lower than the state-of-the art. This could be due to the challenges posed by the dataset: it has a small number of samples, a difficult handwriting style, and an old German language. In [13], the authors initially trained their model on synthetic lines generated from the READ dataset, which helps the model to learn the language prior. On the RIMES dataset, our performance is more competitive, and only outperformed by Diaz et al. [15] which relies on a large internal dataset for training.

On the RIMES sample, the input image is an example of a badly cropped line, a recurring problem in this dataset. The model misses some of the letters in couvert and relies on a misleading visual cue for \u00e9 instead of \u00ea.
