Existing methods like classifier guidance require additional training, limiting their flexibility and applicability. Training-free guidance offers a promising alternative by using pretrained networks, achieving zero-shot conditional generation. However, this approach has limitations such as misaligned gradients and slower convergence. \nThis paper delves into the theoretical underpinnings of training-free guidance, revealing its susceptibility to misaligned gradients and slower convergence compared to classifier-based methods. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce random augmentation to enhance gradient alignment and a Polyak step size schedule to improve convergence rates.  Extensive experiments across different diffusion models and various control conditions (image and motion generation) validate the effectiveness of these proposed techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in both quality and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "Eu80DGuOcs/podcast.wav"}
