Each scenario depicts a convex polygon in a two-dimensional space where the coordinates represent the ratios of functions R(x), p(x), and q(x).  The points within the polygon represent elements from the sets X0, X1, and X2 (defined in the paper).  The dashed lines highlight a separation based on the optimality of the decision strategy (c*) being analyzed. Scenario (a) shows an example where all vertices of the polygon are in X0 and the point x is in X1. Scenario (b) demonstrates a mirrored situation where the polygon's vertices are in X1 and x is in X0.  In both cases, these configurations violate the conditions of optimality for the strategy c*, as described in the paper's Claim 1.3. The figure visually demonstrates a crucial part of the proof of the main theorem.", "section": "Appendix (proof of the main theorem)"}, {"figure_path": "ntV5xZfzEk/figures/figures_15_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: The infeasible configuration described by Claim 1.3.
