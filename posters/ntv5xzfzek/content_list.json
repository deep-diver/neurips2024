Beyond classical statistics, BDM problems are used in many machine learning applications, such as detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples [11, 14, 6, 5, 15, 10, 2, 21, 20, 22, 23], designing selective classifiers [13, 12, 4, 8, 9], and developing selective classification in the presence of OOD data (SCOD) [24, 16, 7] to name a few.

Another recent example is the work of [24], who developed a method for learning a selective classifier handling inputs contaminated by out-of-distribution data, so called SCOD problem.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
