This paper introduces a novel solution using differentiable neural surrogates which efficiently represent the geometric aspects of the problem, addressing these limitations.  \nThe proposed method, Wireless Geometric Algebra Transformer (Wi-GATr), uses geometric algebra for versatile representations and is equivariant with respect to the symmetry group of the underlying physics. It showcases two approaches based on differentiable predictive modelling and diffusion models to tackle signal prediction and inverse problems.  The results demonstrate higher-fidelity predictions with significantly less training data compared to traditional methods.  Two new datasets are also introduced to support further research in this area.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "TWfNFCOPaK/podcast.wav"}
