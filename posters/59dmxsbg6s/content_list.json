An influential model of episodic memory is the Hopfield Network (1), a recurrent associative memory that can learn a pattern in one shot and recall it, given some partial or noisy cue. Some important limitations have been addressed with the development of differentiable continuous Hopfield Networks (2) and their connection to deep learning (3; 4), thus providing a renewed interest to the field of associative memory. Episodic memory has also been studied as an efficient way to control reinforcement learning in so-called episodic control, particularly in the initial steps of learning (5), but no explicit link has been made between Hopfield Networks and control algorithms. Such a link could lead to the development of more efficient controllers and memory models. It could also shed light on how the hippocampus, the seat of episodic memory in the brain, contributes to behavior.

It is shown in Section 2 that the differentiable neural dictionary (DND) introduced in the context of episodic control (6) as a rapid way to store and retrieve experiences, is mathematically close to the Hopfield Network. Retrieval from a DND can indeed be decomposed into similarity, separation and projection operations, just as any instance of the general Universal Hopfield Network framework (UHN) (7) recently proposed to encompass both classical and recent models of associative memory. In a DND, similarity scores are computed using the Euclidean distance and separated with a $k$ -nearest neighbor algorithm. The projection operation of DND is the same as for all existing UHN instances, including the traditional Hopfield Network. DND can thus be thought of as a single-shot associative memory model, just like Hopfield Networks and their modern continuous variants. These models can often be defined by an energy function which decreases as memories are retrieved. We show that energy functions can also be derived for the recall operation of the DND.

One thing to note is that the time complexity of $k$ -nearest neighbor search is ${\\mathcal{O}}(\\log\\!n)$ when implemented with k-d trees (11). In contrast, the Softmax function has a time complexity of ${\\mathrm{O}}({\\mathfrak{n}})$ . Thus, one of the present objectives was to assess the performance of the more efficient $k$ -Max separation function. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Interestingly, $k$ controls the degree of separation, and setting $k=1$ is equivalent to using the Max function studied by (7). While having theoretically unbounded capacity, the Max function can transition sharply from one memory attractor to another when noise of increasing amplitude is added to the query. With Figure 2, it was hypothesized that higher $k$ values could be better at modelling datasets and improve the performance assessed in absolute terms. Simulations indeed revealed higher capacity and better retrieval from noisy queries with $k>1$ , especially with simple datasets like MNIST. However, these results depend on the way performance is evaluated. Traditionally, the evaluation of retrieval is based on some distance evaluation of the memory output and the actual image, which must not exceed some threshold fixed by the experimenter. This is a widespread method for evaluating associative memory models, but one must choose the threshold wisely, as setting it too high can result in false positives with the model grossly reproducing statistics of the dataset (generalization). This for example seems to be the case when retrieval is assessed using the MNIST dataset. The performance of 50-Max (and even the identity function) remains high despite very strong noise. Therefore, another way of evaluating retrieval was introduced, which does not consider the output in absolute terms, but rather compares it to the whole memory set. Retrieval is deemed correct if and only if the output resembles the actual image more than any other stored memory. Memory models thus cannot benefti from modeling statistics of the dataset, and must rather focus on recalling the distinguishing characteristics of the query (memorization). Using this method, the Max function outperforms the others. Ideally, performance should be evaluated in both absolute and relative terms to ensure that recall is accurate and stands out from other memories. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "This raises the question of what is the function of associative memory. Modeling statistics of a dataset is related to generalization, which is typically the main goal of machine learning. The objective of associative memory is somewhat different. Instead of generalizing, an associative memory aims to recall the exact information corresponding to the individual memory. This is reminiscent of the division of labor between episodic and semantic memory (12). When it comes to episodic control however, that is the use of episodic memories for action control, some generalization is desirable. This is especially the case in Neural Episodic Control in which the selection of actions only relies on episodes, the DND thus constituting a bottleneck. Initially, episodic control (not to be confused with its implementation in Neural Episodic Control) has been introduced as a way of speeding up the learning of reinforcement agent and, after the initial episodic control phase, it is desirable that more robust controllers can take over (5). A biologically inspired alternative to Neural Episodic Control would be to supplement episodic memory with other controllers whose function is to generalize. The episodic memory would then no longer be a bottleneck, and could instead be devoted to memorizing the specifics of situations. That being said, there is also an ongoing debate about the fact that episodic memory could also integrate a part of generalization and not only store the specificities of episodes (13; 14; 15).

Conversely to the application of DND to associative memory, the novel theoretical link also implies that any instance of UHN can be used for episodic control. It is possible that the Manhattan function could consistently improve sample efficiency, outperforming the Euclidean kernel of DND, as it does on the associative memory tasks. The Softmax function, which has been proven powerful in transformers (16), and more performant than $k$ -Max in the present study, could also improve episodic control agents. RL experiments are being conducted in this regard. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Finally, the fact that DND is theoretically related to Hopfield Networks provides a biological basis to Neural Episodic Control, as the most influential model of the hippocampus relies heavily on similar associative memory mechanisms (17).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
