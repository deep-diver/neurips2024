A popular approach involves fitting the data to a sequence model and then using that model to generate actions that lead to a high expected return. However, these methods often suffer from \"inference-time suboptimality,\" meaning that while the model accurately represents the data, it struggles to effectively utilize this knowledge to choose good actions during evaluation. This is partly due to the inherent stochasticity in the data and the environment.\nThis paper introduces Trifle, a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses this issue by using \"Tractable Probabilistic Models\" (TPMs). TPMs are a class of generative models that allow for efficient and exact computation of various probabilistic queries. By leveraging TPMs, Trifle bridges the gap between accurate sequence models and high expected returns during evaluation.  The empirical results on various benchmark tasks show that Trifle outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with stochastic environments or constraints on actions (safe RL). This demonstrates the significant impact of tractability on offline RL.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "UZIHW8eFRp/podcast.wav"}
