The variations differ in the methods used for selecting hyperparameters and merging subgroups.  The y-axis represents the correct selection probability, indicating the success rate of correctly identifying the best subgroups. The x-axis shows the experimental stage. The lines represent the four variations: double and na\u00efve bootstrap, single and na\u00efve bootstrap, double and separate bootstrap, and single and separate bootstrap.

The methods compared include the proposed dynamic subgroup identification strategy using both Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) estimators, three conventional methods (complete randomization, epsilon-greedy, and upper confidence bound algorithms), and a causal tree model. The comparison is based on two metrics: correct selection probability and normalized mutual information. The results demonstrate that the proposed design strategy using AIPW and IPW consistently outperforms the conventional methods in terms of both metrics, especially at later stages.", "section": "K.2 Extension: AIPW estimator"}, {"figure_path": "4WIBvL6ZF4/figures/figures_23_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of the correct selection probability among three conventional methods and our proposed design strategy. \"Single and separate bootstrap\" refers to our proposed design.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed dynamic subgroup identification strategy with three other methods: complete randomization, epsilon-greedy algorithm, and upper confidence bound 1 algorithm.
