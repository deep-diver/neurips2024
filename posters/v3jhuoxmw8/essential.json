Current approaches rely on supervised learning, often accumulating errors and struggling to generalize well. This limitation stems from solely focusing on conditional action distributions and neglecting the inherent complexities of the Markov decision process. \nThis paper introduces Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP), a novel method that models the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model.  By maximizing the likelihood of expert actions and modeling navigation dynamics, ENP globally aligns with expert policies.  Results show significant performance improvements on standard VLN benchmarks, surpassing existing methods across different architectures.  The ENP approach provides a robust and generalizable solution to VLN, overcoming the challenges of error accumulation and distribution mismatch in traditional methods.
