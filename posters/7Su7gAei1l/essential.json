Existing models like Plackett-Luce have limitations in expressiveness and efficiency. This makes handling complex tasks involving permutations, such as image sorting or solving puzzles, difficult.\nThis paper introduces SymmetricDiffusers, a novel discrete diffusion model that tackles this challenge. It breaks down the complex learning problem into simpler, manageable steps by learning transitions in the reverse diffusion process using neural networks. The model employs riffle shuffle for forward diffusion and a more expressive generalized Plackett-Luce distribution for reverse transition.  A theoretically grounded denoising schedule improves sampling and learning efficiency. Experiments show that SymmetricDiffusers achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks involving permutations.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "7Su7gAei1l/podcast.wav"}
