Traditional approaches often require enormous datasets, which are often unavailable in practical applications. This leads to poor performance when the model is presented with new, unseen parameter configurations. \nThe paper introduces GEPS, a novel method that addresses these challenges by incorporating adaptive conditioning mechanisms. GEPS utilizes a first-order optimization technique with low-rank rapid adaptation, improving generalization without requiring extensive data.  The method's effectiveness is validated across various PDE problems and demonstrates strong performance compared to traditional techniques.  **GEPS is versatile and compatible with diverse neural network architectures**, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.", "affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Meta Learning"}, "podcast_path": "GuY0zB2xVU/podcast.wav"}
