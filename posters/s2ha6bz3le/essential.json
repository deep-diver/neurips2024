Standard methods, like using multiple random initializations, suffer from issues like permutation invariance and diminishing gradients when networks are too similar. This makes it difficult to obtain a good estimate of how confident the model is in its predictions.  The naive similarity metrics lack permutation invariance and are inappropriate for comparing networks.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach using **Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)** and **Hyperspherical Energy (HE)** to address these issues.  The method projects the feature kernels onto a unit hypersphere, then minimizes the hyperspherical energy between kernels. This helps ensure that the network ensemble/posterior is diverse and well-distributed, leading to better uncertainty quantification. Experimental results show the method significantly outperforms existing baselines, particularly in uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection tasks across various datasets and neural network architectures.", "affiliation": "Oregon State University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "s2hA6Bz3LE/podcast.wav"}
