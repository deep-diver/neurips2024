The problem is worsened when these dangling entities are unlabeled, a common scenario in real-world datasets.  This significantly impacts EA accuracy, especially when knowledge graphs are of different scales.  Existing approaches frequently require a portion of labeled dangling entities for training, adding significant cost and complexity.\nThe proposed framework, Lambda, addresses this challenge head-on.  It combines a GNN-based encoder (KEESA) that incorporates a spectral contrastive learning loss for EA with a novel iterative PU learning algorithm (iPULE) for detecting dangling entities.  **Lambda offers theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and improved accuracy,** surpassing baseline methods, even those leveraging labeled dangling data for training. This novel framework provides a more efficient and robust solution for handling incomplete and imbalanced data in entity alignment.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Named Entity Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "AWFryOJaGi/podcast.wav"}
