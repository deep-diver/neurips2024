However, electricity usage typically declines during the day because residents are generally absent, being engaged in work or education activities outside the home.

Moreover, the declined performance of PowerPM-C, particularly in anomaly detection and classification tasks, suggests that dual-view contrastive learning is effective in capturing subtle discrepancies between instances.

Large-scale model based on self-supervised pre-training has become more significant in both industrial and academic domains due to the versatility and impressive performance. It initially developed in the fields of computer vision [14] and natural language processing [8, 11]. Self-supervised pre-training in time series is typically classified into two paradigms: contrastive learning and mask modeling. The objective of contrastive learning is to learn representation by pushing positive pairs closer and pull negative pairs away in the embedding space [16]. TS2Vec [42] proposes contextual consistency for positive pair selection. Then, CoST [37] extracts the trend and seasonal feature representations, and takes advantage of both time and frequency domain contrastive loss to encourage discriminative seasonal representation. And TF-C [47] applies time-frequency consistency for embedding time-based and frequency-based neighbors. In mask modeling, to extract the contextual semantic information, PatchTST [21] masks at the series-level. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Supervised Learning Model. Since the self-attention mechanism in Transformer [33] showed the great ability to seize global dependencies between input and output, recently many variants have been proposed to tackle power system tasks.

Autoformer [39] leverages auto-correlation mechanism to achieve series-wise representation aggregation. FEDformer [50] incorporates frequency-domain information to enhances prediction performance while reducing complexity to linear levels. Besides, DLinear [43] questions the effectiveness of transformers as it outperforms most Transformer-based SOTAs, with a simple linear model.

Therefore, many reserachers begin to apply LLMs to assist time series modeling. Time-LLM [17] and TEXT [28] employ reprogrammed input time series with text prototype embedding and incorporate textual prompts for time series. GPT4TS [51] and UniTime [20] apply fine-tuning to selected components of LLMs to improve performance in time series analysis tasks.

Moreover, when transferred to the public dataset, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of a foundation model in the field of power system. Also, PowerPM is an off-the-shelf model with its code and weights.
