Panel (a) depicts the hierarchical structure of ETS data, starting from the city level and going down to individual users. This hierarchy is important because it allows for different levels of aggregation and analysis. Panel (b) shows the temporal dependencies within an ETS window, which means that data points closer together in time are more likely to be correlated, but exogenous variables (like weather) can also play a role. Panel (c) shows that different instances (e.g., households) may have diverse electricity consumption patterns. Panel (d) shows various tasks related to ETS data analysis, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "JInTfcxH3Q/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance comparison of our model and other baseline models on all downstream tasks in our scenario.

It shows the process of constructing a hierarchical graph from the ETS data, using a temporal encoder to capture temporal dependencies and incorporate exogenous variables, and employing a hierarchical encoder to model correlations between different levels of the hierarchy.  The self-supervised pre-training strategy, which combines masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, is also depicted.  The figure breaks down the process into stages, showing the input data, the temporal and hierarchical encoding processes, the masked ETS modeling, and the dual-view contrastive learning, ultimately producing a latent representation for each ETS window.", "section": "2 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "JInTfcxH3Q/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: The pre-training framework of PowerPM. For simplicity, we take the windows of each instance in the same time range for illustration, and the window process at other times is the same.", "description": "This figure illustrates the pre-training framework of the PowerPM model. It shows the hierarchical graph construction, the temporal encoder with exogenous variables, and the self-supervised pre-training task, which includes masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning.  The temporal encoder uses a Transformer to capture temporal dependencies, incorporating exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder uses R-GCN to model correlations between different hierarchical levels. The self-supervised learning framework aims to improve the model's understanding of both temporal dependencies within ETS windows and the discrepancies across different windows. This comprehensive framework enables PowerPM to learn a robust and generalizable representation for various downstream tasks.", "section": "2 Methodology"}]
