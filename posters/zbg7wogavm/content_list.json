This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making.

Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) (Lindley, 1956; Chaloner and Verdinelli, 1995; Ryan et al., 2016; Rainforth et al., 2024) is a powerful framework in this context, guiding and optimizing experimental design by maximizing the expected amount of information about parameters gained from experiments, see Fig. 1(a). However, the ultimate goal in many tasks extends beyond parameter inference to inform a downstream decisionmaking task by leveraging our understanding of these parameters. For example, in personalized medical diagnostics, a model is built based on historical data to facilitate an optimal treatment for a new patient (Bica et al., 2021). This data typically comprises patient covariates, administered treatments, and observed outcomes. Since the query of such data tends to be expensive due to, e.g., privacy issues, we need to actively design queries to optimize resource utilization. Here, when the goal is to improve decisions, the strategy of experimental designs should not focus solely on inferring the parameters of the model, but rather on guiding the final decision-making for the new patient, to ensure that each query contributes maximally to the diagnostic decision.

Losscalibrated inference, which was originally introduced by Lacoste-Julien et al. (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2011) for variational approximations in Bayesian inference, provides a concept that adjusts the inference process to capture posterior regions critical for decision-making tasks. Rather than focusing on parameter estimation, the idea is to directly maximize the expected downstream utility, recognizing that accurate decision-making can proceed without exact knowledge of the posterior as not all regions of the posterior contribute equally to the downstream task. Inspired by this concept, we could consider integrating decision-making directly into the experimental design process to align the proposed designs more closely with the ultimate decision-making task.

Unlike traditional methods, which never reuse the information from past data, amortized methods can integrate this knowledge to refine and improve design strategies for new experiments.

Currently, we employ a basic REINFORCE algorithm, which can result in unstable training, particularly for tasks with sparse reward signals. For more complex problems in the future, we could deploy advanced RL methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017); the trade-offs include the introduction of additional hyperparameters and increased computational cost. Like all amortized approaches, our method requires a large amount of data and upfront training time to develop a reliable model. Besides, our architecture is based on the Transformer, which suffers from quadratic complexity with respect to the input sequence length. This can become a bottleneck when the query set is very large. Future work could focus on designing more sample-efficient methods to reduce the data and training requirements. Our TNDP follows the common practice in the neural processes literature (Garnelo et al., 2018) of using independent Gaussian likelihoods. If modeling correlations between points is crucial for the downstream task, we can replace the output with a joint multivariate normal distribution (Markou et al., 2022) or predict the output autoregressively (Bruinsma et al., 2023). Following most BED approaches, our work assumes that the model is well-specified. However, model misspecification or shifts in the utility function during deployment could impact the performance of the amortized model (Rainforth et al., 2024). Future work could address the challenge of robust experimental design under model misspecification (Huang et al., 2023a). Another limitation is that our system is currently constrained to accepting designs of the same dimensionality. Future work could focus on developing dimension-agnostic methods to expand the scope of amortization. Lastly, our model is trained on a fixed-step length, assuming a finite horizon for the experimental design process. Future research could explore the design of systems that can handle infinite horizon cases, potentially improving the applicability of TNDP to a broader range of real-world problems.

Towards amortization, we developed a novel Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP) architecture with dual output heads: one for proposing new experimental designs and another for approximating the predictive distribution to facilitate optimal decision-making. Our experimental results demonstrated that TNDP significantly outperforms traditional BED methods across a variety of tasks. By integrating decision-making considerations directly into the experimental design process, TNDP not only accelerates the design of experiments but also improves the quality of the decisions derived from these experiments.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
