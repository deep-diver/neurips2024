Humans excel at recognizing actions from minimal motion cues like point-light displays, a skill AI has yet to match. This research gap highlights a critical need for models capable of robust and generalized motion perception. \nThe paper introduces Motion Perceiver (MP), a novel model that utilizes patch-level optical flows from videos as input, bypassing limitations of previous pixel-level approaches. **MP employs flow snapshot neurons to learn prototypical motion patterns and motion-invariant neurons to enhance robustness against variations in temporal dynamics.**  Evaluated on a new large-scale benchmark dataset encompassing diverse BMP conditions, **MP substantially outperforms all existing AI models and even exhibits human-like behavioral alignment.** This work significantly advances the field by addressing the generalization problem in BMP and providing valuable insights into the design of more human-like AI systems.", "affiliation": "College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Action Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "btuHzsAVsK/podcast.wav"}
