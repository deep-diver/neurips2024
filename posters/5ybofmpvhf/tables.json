Each row represents a layer type (Convolutional layer, Maxpooling layer, or Fully Connected layer), and each column represents a specific CNN model (CNN-1 through CNN-5).  The specifications provided include kernel size (for convolutional layers), pooling size (for max-pooling layers), number of neurons (for fully connected layers), and the total model size in MB. The model sizes decrease from CNN-1 to CNN-5, indicating a reduction in model complexity.", "section": "5.1 Experiment Setup"}, {"figure_path": "5yboFMpvHf/tables/tables_16_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Average test accuracy (%) in model-heterogeneous FL.", "description": "This table presents the average test accuracy achieved by FedMRL and seven other state-of-the-art MHeteroFL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under three different settings of the number of clients and client participation rates.  The results demonstrate the superior performance of FedMRL across various scenarios in terms of model accuracy, communication costs, and computation overhead.", "section": "5.2 Results and Discussion"}]
