Existing unsupervised representation learning methods often struggle with these complexities, leading to suboptimal feature extraction and reduced interpretability.  Shape analysis offers a potential solution, but generalizing it to time series with varied structures is difficult. \nThis paper proposes TS-LDDMM, a novel unsupervised method that addresses these issues.  TS-LDDMM represents time series as deformations of a reference series, using diffeomorphisms to learn shape-based features. The algorithm excels at handling irregularities and provides interpretable results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-world and synthetic datasets. It is backed by a representation theorem providing a solid theoretical foundation.", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "JM0IQSliol/podcast.wav"}
