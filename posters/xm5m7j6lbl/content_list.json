Drawing from utility and social choice theory, we provide a novel quantitative definition of alignment in the context of social decision-making. Building on this definition, we introduce probably approximately aligned (i.e., near-optimal) policies, and we derive a sufficient condition for their existence. Lastly, recognizing the practical difficulty of satisfying this condition, we introduce the relaxed concept of safe (i.e., nondestructive) policies, and we propose a simple yet robust method to safeguard the black-box policy of any autonomous agent, ensuring all its actions are verifiably safe for the society.

For example, tax rates and public spending are typically set periodically by a parliament.

Due to this information bottleneck, governments can only make educated guesses about what is best for the society (assuming they can come to an agreement in the first place).

Firstly, it requires a definition of alignment that is both quantitative and measurable. Given our focus on social decision processes, where the perception of each action may differ among individuals, we define and quantify alignment by drawing from long-established theories of utility and social choice. For completeness, we also discuss all the assumptions that allow such a metric to exist. Secondly, one can only ensure that an agent is $a$ priori aligned if one independently understands (at least reasonably well) how its available actions may affect society, regardless of how those effects are perceived. Indeed, asserting the safety of an autonomous agent would be impossible if it could take actions with unknown consequences. Although we make no assumption of the exact nature of this knowledge (domain specific expertise, heuristics, physical/data-driven modeling, or a mix thereof), we assume it is encapsulated in a world model that estimates, given an action and a current state, the probability of moving to any other state.

Or, at the very least, can we use it to ensure the safety of a more complex (black-box) policy? We address these questions by introducing probably approximately aligned (PAA) and safe policies, and by studying their existence based on the quality of this knowledge. Akin to the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework in the theory of learnability [38], we are also interested in the sample complexity of finding PAA policies. In our setting, this complexity is two-faceted: First, the number of calls to the world model (similar to the number of calls to a perfect generative model in [18]), and second, the amount of feedback (think ballots) required to confidently rank which state is socially preferred. While we are not yet concerned with efficient PAA policies, whose sample complexity is at most polynomial with respect to the desired tolerances, we argue that these complexities should, at least, be independent of the number of possible states (similarly to sparse sampling algorithms [19]), as most natural state spaces are infinite.

We are interested in quantitatively measuring these welfare levels. Debreu\u2019s representation theorem [10] states that if this preference relationship is complete, continuous, and transitive on the topological space $\\boldsymbol{S}$ , then there exists infinitely many continuous, real-valued functions $u:S\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ (called utility functions) such that $u(s)\\leq u(\\bar{s}^{\\prime})\\iff s\\preceq s^{\\prime},\\,\\forall s,s^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{S}$ (note that any strictly monotonically increasing function can transform a valid utility function into another). While these findings establish the existence of these utility functions, which are proxies for the intrinsic welfare levels of individuals, they do not provide insights into their measurability and interpersonal comparability. It is these two properties, however, that eventually determine what measure of social welfare can be derived. In a nutshell, measurability and comparability impose how much information can be extracted from the values $|u_{i}(s)-u_{i}(s^{\\prime})|$ and $u_{i}(s)-u_{j}(s)$ , respectively, for any $i\\neq j$ and $s\\neq s^{\\prime}$ .

That is, we assume that individuals cannot be infinitely satisfied or dissatisfied, and that they must scale their utilities when reporting (which does not imply measurability or comparability!).

In other words, the non-welfare characteristics (i.e., any information influencing $f(\\mathbf{u})$ beside $\\mathbf{u}$ , such as the judgement of an AI agent) are of secondary importance, as they can only break ties between $s$ and $s^{\\prime}$ such that $W(\\mathbf{u}(s))=W(\\mathbf{u}(s^{\\prime}))$ and cannot be detrimental to the society. Although we do not require it in this work, maximization of $W$ can be made sufficient if one imposes Welfarism (W), e.g., by replacing (WP) with Weak Pareto Indifference (WPI) or more drastically by imposing Continuity (C) (see Appendix A.1.2 for more details). We are left with the following question: Given a SWFL satisfying (XI), (U), (IIA), (WP) and (A), what is the form of the corresponding SWF?

While some work has attempted to tackle LLM alignment from a social choice perspective [22], the issue of aligning the meaning of generated text is, by nature, both qualitative and subjective, and therefore separate from ours. A setting closer to our work is the value alignment problem [34, 23], based on the theory of basic human values [31], where the preferences of individuals (over social states) are assumed to be guided by a predefined set of common values, and where the goal is to find \u201cnorms\u201d (i.e., hard-coded logical constraints on actions) that guide society towards states that maximize these values. The alignment of these norm can be quantified by measuring the level of these values in the subsequent states, and the alignment of an autonomous system is simply given by the alignment of the norms it follows.

Another limitation arises from the dependence on the informational basis of utilities, a philosophical question that falls outside the scope of this paper but that is common to all systems involving human feedback. A third practical limitation is the assumptions that individuals can observe and evaluate the entire social states when reporting their utilities. Future work could extend our analysis to the setting of partially observable MDP (POMDP) [42], for instance. Finally, the assumption that individuals have static preferences can also be challenged, but it is not clear how evolving preferences can be modeled, let alone factored in our analysis.

Additional dichotomization becomes possible when comparability is taken into account [29, 9, 32]. In a nutshell, utilities are either ordinal non-comparable (ONC), where individuals transform their intrinsic utilities differently when reporting; cardinal non-comparable (CNC), which is similar to ONC but with cardinal measurability), ordinal level comparable (OLC), where individuals transform their intrinsic utilities similarly when reporting; cardinal unit comparable (CUC), in which the affine transforms of the individuals have identical scaling factor but different bias; cardinal fully comparable (CFC), where individuals have the same affine transform; or cardinal ratio-scale comparable (CRS), in which all transforms are unbiased with the same scaling factor. Note that CRS is stronger than CFC in the sense that one can have statements such has \u201cBob is $x$ times more satisfied than Alice\u201d under the CRS assumption.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
