We introduce a metric that can accomplish both objectives, without requiring access to\u2014or knowledge of\u2014an underlying, unobservable state space. Our metric, the $\\lambda$ -discrepancy, is the difference between two distinct temporal difference (TD) value estimates, each computed using $\\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda)$ with a different value of $\\lambda$ .

Indeed, we prove that the $\\lambda$ -discrepancy is exactly zero for all Markov decision processes and almost always non-zero for a broad class of partially observable environments. We also demonstrate empirically that, once detected, minimizing the $\\lambda$ -discrepancy can help with learning a memory function to mitigate the corresponding partial observability. We then train a reinforcement learning agent that simultaneously constructs two recurrent value networks with different $\\lambda$ parameters and minimizes the difference between them as an auxiliary loss.

In principle, an environment can be modeled as either a Markov decision process (MDP) [Puterman, 1994], or its partially observable counterpart, a POMDP [Kaelbling et al., 1998], as long as the underlying state representation contains enough information to satisfy the Markov assumption.

When faced with a potentially partially observable environment, if we provide the agent with a large enough recurrent neural network (RNN), it can perhaps discover an internal state representation \u201cendto-end\u201d that maximizes reward via gradient descent [Bakker, 2001, Hausknecht and Stone, 2015, Ni et al., 2022, Dong et al., 2022].

However, such examples are rare; in typical POMDPs, a single observation $\\omega$ does not contain enough information to fully resolve the state $s$ .

The $\\lambda$ -discrepancy is capable of detecting non-Markovian observations in a \u201clarge\u201d class of POMDPs, which we have described using an analytic almost-all characterization. However, there do exist POMDPs in which the fact that observations are non-Markovian cannot be detected by the $\\lambda$ -discrepancy, and we provide one such example in Section 3.2. The examples of such POMDPs we have found seem to exist on a \u201cknife\u2019s edge\u201d, meaning that slightly perturbing the parameters of the POMDP results in a non-zero $\\lambda$ -discrepancy.
