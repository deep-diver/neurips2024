This is particularly problematic in high-stakes applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial. Existing calibration techniques often struggle to balance accuracy and calibration, leading to inconsistent optimization of these two objectives.  The problem is further compounded by the variability in gradient magnitudes during training, potentially hindering the learning process.\nThis research introduces a novel approach that leverages a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust a probability-dependent gradient decay rate. The PID controller uses feedback from a relative calibration error metric to regulate the decay rate, maintaining a balance between accuracy and calibration.  To address the issue of variable gradient magnitudes, an adaptive learning rate mechanism is implemented.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in consistently improving both accuracy and calibration, offering a significant advancement in model calibration techniques.", "affiliation": "Jiangnan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "fAnubdSFpn/podcast.wav"}
