The comparison is based on three key metrics: ID Score (measuring identity preservation), LPIPS (measuring disentanglement), and CLIP Score (measuring semantic alignment). Higher ID Score and CLIP Score values are better while a lower LPIPS value is better.  The table shows that the w2w method outperforms the other two methods across all three metrics for all the attributes tested (Gender, Chubby, Eyes). This demonstrates the superiority of the w2w approach in maintaining the identity while editing the attribute in a semantically meaningful and disentangled way.", "section": "4.3 Editing Subjects"}, {"figure_path": "DAO2BFzMfy/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: w2w Inversion closes the gap with Dreambooth.", "description": "This table compares the identity preservation performance of three different methods: Dreambooth with LoRA trained on multiple images, Dreambooth with LoRA trained on a single image, and the proposed w2w inversion method.  The ID Score metric is used to evaluate identity preservation, with higher scores indicating better performance. The results show that w2w inversion achieves comparable performance to Dreambooth trained on multiple images, while significantly outperforming Dreambooth trained on a single image. This demonstrates the effectiveness of w2w inversion in encoding identities from limited data.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "DAO2BFzMfy/tables/tables_19_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Edits in w2w space preserve identity, are disentangled, and semantically aligned.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of three different methods for editing subject attributes in images: w2w, Concept Sliders, and prompting. The comparison is based on three criteria: identity preservation (how well the edited image maintains the original identity), disentanglement (how well the edit is separated from other visual elements), and semantic alignment (how well the edit matches the intended semantic meaning). The results show that w2w outperforms the other methods on all three criteria, indicating that it is a more effective method for editing subject attributes in a disentangled and semantically aligned manner.", "section": "4.3 Editing Subjects"}, {"figure_path": "DAO2BFzMfy/tables/tables_20_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Inversion into w2w space balances identity preservation and efficiency.", "description": "This table compares the efficiency and identity preservation of three different methods for inverting a single image into a model: Dreambooth with LoRA (trained on a single image and multiple images), and the proposed w2w inversion method.
