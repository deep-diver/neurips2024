Existing methods, relying on global feature alignment or model distillation, often produce coarse results. This is due to the difficulty in establishing precise correspondence between 3D and 2D-text embedding spaces.\nXMask3D tackles this problem by introducing a cross-modal mask reasoning framework that meticulously aligns 3D features with 2D-text embeddings at the mask level. It utilizes a denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model as a 2D mask generator, enabling precise textual control and enhancing open-world adaptability.  The model incorporates 3D global features as implicit conditions in the UNet to generate geometry-aware masks, further enhancing 3D-2D-text alignment. Finally, it fuses complementary 2D and 3D mask features for improved accuracy. The results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate XMask3D's superior performance in open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "z1GwaNoGnr/podcast.wav"}
