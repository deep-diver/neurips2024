The brute-force proof (Section 4.1) computes the exact performance uses orders of magnitude more compute than other approaches. The cubic proof (Section 4.3) uses a small amount of mechanistic understanding and less compute, while still retaining good accuracy lower bounds. Finally, subcubic proofs (Section 4.3) require the entirety of the mechanistic interpretation of the model to attain non-vacuous bounds; this understanding allows us to further reduces compute costs, but we still achieve worse bounds. See Appendix H.2.1 for a detailed description of the various proof strategies.", "description": "This figure shows the trade-off between proof length (measured in FLOPs) and the tightness of the accuracy lower bound obtained by different proof strategies.  The brute-force approach provides the tightest bound but is computationally expensive.  Cubic proofs utilize some mechanistic interpretability, resulting in shorter proofs and reasonably good bounds. Subcubic proofs leverage a more complete mechanistic understanding, leading to the most compact proofs, but at the cost of looser bounds.  The plot visually demonstrates the relationship between the degree of mechanistic understanding incorporated into the proof strategy and its computational cost and bound accuracy.", "section": "Results"}]
