Discriminative models struggle to solve the one-to-many mapping problem between structures and sequences.  This necessitates the exploration of alternative approaches such as generative models.\n\nThe paper introduces Bridge-IF, a generative diffusion bridge model that addresses these issues.  **Bridge-IF uses an expressive structure encoder to create an informative prior from structures and constructs a Markov bridge to connect it with native sequences, progressively refining the initial sequence.** A novel reparameterization simplifies the loss function and improves training. By integrating structure conditions into protein language models, Bridge-IF significantly enhances generation performance and efficiency. The model outperforms existing methods in sequence recovery and design of plausible proteins, demonstrating its effectiveness in inverse protein folding.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "Q8yfhrBBD8/podcast.wav"}
