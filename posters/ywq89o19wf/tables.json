The metrics include creator diversity (CD), recommendation diversity (RD), recommendation relevance (RR), and tendency to polarization (TP).  The results are shown for different values of \u03b2 (the sensitivity of recommendations).  The table shows how top-k truncation affects the balance between recommendation diversity and other important aspects of the system. In essence, this table compares system performance metrics with varying levels of k to understand the tradeoffs between diversity and relevance optimization strategies, in the presence of dual influence in recommender systems.", "section": "Top-k Truncation"}, {"figure_path": "yWq89o19wf/tables/tables_14_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Comparison between our work and some previous works on performative effects of recommender systems", "description": "This table compares the current work with other related works in terms of several key aspects: whether users and creators are adaptive, whether a creator reward is involved, whether a dynamic model or equilibrium model is employed, and what content adjustment model is used.
