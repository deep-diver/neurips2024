This paper addresses these issues by introducing Language Feedback Models (LFMs).  **LFMs improve sample efficiency by learning from LLM feedback on a small number of trajectories, avoiding costly online LLM queries.**\n\nThe proposed LFMs method trains a feedback model to identify productive actions based on LLM-provided feedback for each step.   **This model then guides imitation learning, enabling efficient policy improvement by directly imitating the productive actions.**  Experiments on multiple instruction-following benchmarks showcase that LFMs significantly outperform baselines in task completion rates while generalizing well to unseen environments.  **The human-interpretable nature of the LFM feedback further enhances the system's transparency and usability.**", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "FVgCwcwpJw/podcast.wav"}
