Then various improvements have been made to the basic GNNs for different purposes [36, 35, 69, 65]. For instance, to alleviate the over-smoothing problem, decoupling mechanisms [64] and identity mapping [4] were introduced respectively.

Specifically, on graph structured data, OpenWGL [54] employs an uncertainty loss in the form of a graph reconstruction loss [27] on unlabeled data. PGL [37] extends a previous unsupervised domain adaption framework for the open-set scenario with graph neural networks. However, it focuses on the unsupervised domain adaption and conditional shift problem. With the development of deep learning, several novel approaches have been proposed. SRNC [72] further presents a domain adaption framework for the two most common kinds of data shifts in graph structured data, i.e., open-set and closed-set data shift, by combining a graph adversarial clustering technique to shift-robust node classification. MHGL [71] extends traditional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks to open-set scenarios, employing Pattern Distribution Estimator (PDE) and Multi-Hypersphere Graph Learning algorithm to model fine-grained patterns and identify previously unseen anomalous patterns. GOOD [22] proposes a weakly supervised relevance feedback approach, named Open-WRF, to mitigate sensitivity to thresholds. $\\mathcal{G}^{2}P x y$ [67] use the unknown proxies generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the distribution of novel classes and achieve excellent prediction performance under the constraint of both cross entropy loss and complement entropy loss.
