This paper proposes a novel perspective inspired by neural collapse to solve the spurious correlation problem through the alternate execution of environment partitioning and learning semantic masks. Specifically, we propose to assign an environment to each sample by learning a local model for each environment and using maximum likelihood probability. At the same time, we require that the learned semantic mask neurally collapses to the same simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) in each environment after being applied to the original input.

Here, to measure the extent of neural collapse, we propose to compute the Frobenius norm (F-norm) of the difference between the feature prototypes and the standard simplex ETF. A smaller F-norm indicates a closer proximity to the standard simplex ETF.

Although IRM-based methods [Arjovsky et al., 2019] theoretically learn a feature representation such that the last layer of the feature extractor is similar across environments, we empirically found that IRM-based methods are not aligned very well, which motivates using neural collapse to align feature for OOD generation.

In the absence of environment labels, we can automatically partition the environments and assign local models to different environments.

The phenomenon known as neural collapse, first identified by [Papyan et al., 2020], refers to the observation that when the number of training samples across different classes is balanced, both the feature vectors in the final layer and the classifier vectors tend to converge to the simplex ETF upon the completion of training. Recently, several studies [Ji et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2021, Tirer and Bruna, 2022, Zhu et al., 2023b, Li et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2023, Beaglehole et al., 2024, Fisher et al., 2024, Guo et al., 2024, Kothapalli et al., 2024, S\u00b4uken\u00b4\u0131k et al., 2024] have utilized this phenomenon to guide the training process in imbalanced data sets. Among them, Yang et al. [2023] involves pre-allocating a fixed number of classes in a simplex ETF for continual learning, guiding the learning of minority classes in subsequent incremental steps, thereby ensuring convergence of intra-class features to specified positions and maximizing and uniformly separating inter-class features. Xie et al. [2023] addresses class imbalance by designing a novel loss function, namely the attraction-rejection balanced loss. Li et al. [2023] apples neural collapse into federated learning scenarios. Under distributed conditions, neural collapse is used to guide the alignment direction of each client, and the personality of each client model is maintained through fine-tuning. The aforementioned methods only consider collapsing the same class onto a single point in a fixed simplex ETF without accounting for the impact of intra-class spurious correlations.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
