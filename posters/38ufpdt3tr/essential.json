A common strategy to mitigate this involves converting parts of the network into Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, leveraging activation sparsity. However, current approaches do not fully exploit this sparsity and their efficiency is limited. This paper tackles these issues. \nThe paper introduces D2DMoE, a novel method that enhances activation sparsity before conversion, employs a more effective router training scheme, and introduces a dynamic-k expert selection rule. **D2DMoE outperforms existing approaches, reducing inference costs by up to 60% without significant performance loss**. It is also generalized beyond feed-forward networks to multi-head attention projections, improving its overall applicability and efficacy.", "affiliation": "Warsaw University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "38UFpdt3Tr/podcast.wav"}
