Existing local methods, while efficient, have runtime limitations.  This paper addresses these limitations.  The paper explores the potential of localizing standard iterative solvers, which are usually applied globally.  These standard solvers are efficient for solving the type of linear systems used in PPR but are not applicable in a large-scale setting because they need to access the whole graph. \nThis research proposes a novel framework called \"locally evolving set process\" to effectively localize standard solvers.  It demonstrates the effective localization of various solvers, including gradient descent and Chebyshev methods. The framework offers new runtime bounds, which closely mirror the actual performance, and achieves up to a hundredfold speedup on real-world graphs, demonstrating its superior efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.  **This significantly advances the field of local graph algorithms and opens up new avenues for optimizing computations on massive graphs.**", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "wT2KhEb97a/podcast.wav"}
