Due to their properties of permutation equivariance and natural adaptation to varying input dimensions, GNNs are well-suited for graph-related optimization problems such as minimum vertex covering [30] and traveling salesman [13]. Recent research has demonstrated that GNNs can effectively accelerate the solving process for both linear programming (LP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, which are among the most important and widely applied types of optimization problems.

Understanding the principles behind the success of small-sized GNNs can potentially lead to more parameter-efficient models, thus reducing the computational resources required for LP solving. Moreover, these insights could potentially enhance MILP solvers. Specifically, the leading approach for MILP is the branch-and-bound framework, which involves selecting variables and dividing the search space. A prevalent variable selection approach is strong branching, where variables are scored by solving associated LPs to guide the branching decisions. Researchers have exploited GNNs to score these variables, with GNNs essentially solving the associated LPs [9\u201311, 23, 31].

Importantly, our variant of GD is guaranteed to output a $(1+\\epsilon)$ -approximate solution in polylog $(m n A_{\\mathrm{max}}/\\epsilon)$ iterations. Therefore, we affirm the feasibility of solving general packing and covering LPs with polylogarithmic-depth constant-width GNNs. Here, we remark that the polylogarithmic dependency on depth is also necessary. Specifically, Kuhn et al. [16] showed that: for the fractional maximum matching problem, a special kind of packing LP, every constant-factor approximation distributed algorithm requires at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log\\log n})$ rounds. Moreover, since one layer of GNNs can be naturally simulated by one round of distributed LP algorithms (see, e.g., the second paragraph on page 5 in [16]), we conclude that GNNs need at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log\\log n})$ layers.

The numerical success of GD-Net not only corroborates our theoretical framework but also suggests a potential direction for designing more parameter-efficient GNNs for L2O.
