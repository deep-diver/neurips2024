The \"control\" arrangement shows the default search results. The other arrangements involve swapping the positions of certain search results or hiding elements like Ads and Shopping boxes, allowing researchers to measure the causal effect of these changes on user clicks. The table is crucial for understanding the methodology used to isolate the effects of different algorithmic manipulations on user behavior.", "section": "4.2 Experimental groups"}]
