Traditional ITR estimation methods often rely on inverse probability weighting (IPW), which can be statistically biased, and L1-penalization, which makes the objective non-smooth and computationally costly.  This leads to inaccurate and unstable ITR estimations.\nThis research proposes a novel ITR estimation framework formulated as a smooth convex optimization problem, enabling robust computation using projected gradient descent.  The study leverages covariate balancing weights, providing better computational and statistical guarantees than IPW. The results showcase that the proposed method significantly improves both the robustness and effectiveness of ITR estimation, outperforming existing methods in simulations and real-world applications.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "G7L65B2P0y/podcast.wav"}
