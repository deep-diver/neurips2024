All subplots in the same row share the same simulation setting, focusing on randomized trials with linear ITR as the true optimal rule (top) and observational studies with nonlinear ITR as the true optimal rule (bottom). Each subplot presents (Left) accuracy comparisons based on weights, illustrating the difference between the standard IPW approach of AD-Learning with the proposed approach using EBW, (Middle) accuracy comparisons based on optimization algorithms, illustrating the difference between the standard L1-penalized approach against the proposed constrained optimization with PGD, (Right) evaluation of accuracies between existing standard approaches and the proposed method, which integrates EBWs, variance and dimension reduction techniques implemented through PGD. Error bars represent the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of accuracies across multiple simulations.", "description": "This figure compares the accuracy of different ITR estimation methods across various simulation settings.  It shows accuracy results for both randomized trials (with linear optimal ITR) and observational studies (with nonlinear optimal ITR). The figure highlights the impact of different weighting schemes (IPW vs. EBW), optimization methods (L1-penalized vs. constrained PGD), and the combined approach (EBW, PGD, variable screening, outcome augmentation, inverse variance weighting) on the accuracy of ITR estimation.", "section": "Simulation Studies"}, {"figure_path": "G7L65B2P0y/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of Optimization Methods by \u03bb\u2081. \u03bb\u2081 is L\u2081-ball size of the constraint set in the constrained optimization and the regularization parameter with additional L\u2081-regularization of the model parameter in the penalized regression, respectively.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of constrained and penalized optimization methods by varying the L1 regularization parameter (\u03bb\u2081).
