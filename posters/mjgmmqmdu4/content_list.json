However, the training of a sparse DNN encounters great challenges in achieving optimal generalization ability despite the efforts from the state-of-the-art sparse training methodologies. To unravel the mysterious reason behind the difficulty of sparse training, we connect network sparsity with the structure of neural loss functions and identify that the cause of such difficulty lies in a chaotic loss surface. In light of such revelation, we propose $\\mathrm{S^{2}}$ -SAM, characterized by a Single-step Sharpness-Aware Minimization that is tailored for Sparse training.

With the presence of a large portion of zeros in the network, both forward and backward computation for training can be saved by skipping those zeros, as well as reducing the memory consumption since the zeros are not necessary to be stored. However, training a sparse neural network is difficult since the optimization under sparse regime readily converges to stationary points with a sub-optimal generalization accuracy (i.e., saddle points) [7]. Due to the difficulty of directly (i.e., without the time-consuming linear interpolation) assessing if the sparse solution is in the saddle point, finding workaround approaches for training a better sparse neural network is critical, especially for the practical usage in efficient learning [8\u201317].

On the other hand, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) such as SET [2], RigL [23], and MEST [3] iteratively updates the sparse topology during training to find a better sparse model. However, those methods either suffer from suboptimal generalization ability due to heuristic nature of their methodology or metric settings, or experience difficulties in parameter setting and dynamic sparsity scheduling.

When incorporating sparsity into a neural network, the effective structure of the original network becomes narrower. According to the study of neural loss function structure [24], a wide network resulted in flat minima and wide regions of apparent convexity, which helps prevent the chaotic behavior that occurs during training. Evidently, higher sparsity indicates a narrower structure, which suggests more chaotic behavior is expected during training, thus degrading the accuracy. We perform different types of sparse training with different levels of sparsity and plot the loss surface in Figure 1 to demonstrate the convexity of the training behavior. According to the sharpness of the loss basin, we observe a transition from a smooth and close-to-convex surface to a steep one as sparsity is introduced and increased. Since higher sparsity levels lead to more chaotic behavior, in landscapes that are narrow and sharp with a large $R a$ value, we might expect to encounter more chaotic training behavior that degrades generalization ability.

Therefore, we raise the following question: is there a simple, effective method that can improve generalization ability of training a sparse neural network, without sacrificing efficiency (sparsity) and incurring zero extra cost? We believe the answer to the above question lies in the sharpness of the loss surface. Inspired by the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) [25] technique that finds flatter minima that have uniformly low loss in nearby regions, we argue that such technique is especially suitable for sparse training since the steep loss surface induced by sparsity can be directly mitigated. However, to leverage sharpness for better generalization, SAM uses an additional full training step (i.e., forward and backward propagation) to quantify and evaluate loss on the summation of current weights and a constrained perturbation, which roughly doubles the computation of training. Such extra costs contradict the goal of sparse training. Although some literature [26, 27] have been proposed to reduce the computation cost for SAM, the computation is still significant, posing a roadblock to the wide application of SAM to the realm of sparse training.

Deep R [48] uses a combination of stochastic parameter updates and dynamic sparse parameterization for training. Dynamic Sparse Reparameterization (DSR) [33] proposes to redistribute parameters between layers during training. Sparse Networks from Scratch (SNFS) [49] creates the sparse momentum algorithm, which finds the layers and weights that effectively reduce the error by using exponentially smoothed gradients (momentum).

To reconcile such, ESAM [26] introduces two novel and efficient training strategies: stochastic weight perturbation and sharpness-sensitive data selection, enhancing the efficiency of the SAM process without compromising its generalization performance. LookSAM [27] only periodically calculates the inner gradient ascent to significantly reduce the additional training cost of SAM. SAF [28] introduces a novel trajectory loss based on KL-divergence to measure the rate of change in training loss along the model update trajectory and replace the SAM sharpness measure.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
