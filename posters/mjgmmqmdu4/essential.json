Sparse training, which involves using networks with many zero-valued parameters, offers a solution to this problem by reducing computation and memory requirements. However, achieving both sparsity and high accuracy remains a challenge due to the difficulty of optimizing the loss function in sparse settings, often leading to suboptimal generalization performance. Existing methods for addressing this issue often suffer from high computational cost. \nThis paper introduces S2-SAM, a novel method for sparse training, that effectively tackles this challenge. **S2-SAM approximates the sharpness of the loss function using gradient information from the previous training step, leading to significant accuracy gains without increasing computation time**. Unlike previous methods, S2-SAM is designed to enhance generalization without sacrificing efficiency, improving the accuracy and efficiency of sparse training algorithms for a wide variety of network architectures.", "affiliation": "Clemson University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "MJgMMqMDu4/podcast.wav"}
