However, performing abductive reasoning tasks, like finding the most probable explanation for observed evidence (MAP inference), is computationally challenging, especially for large networks. This limits the applicability of LCNs in complex real-world scenarios. \nThis research addresses this challenge by developing novel algorithms for solving MAP and Marginal MAP inference queries in LCNs. The paper proposes both exact search-based algorithms and approximate methods to handle larger problem instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on various LCN instances, including randomly generated networks and realistic use cases.  The approximate methods especially prove successful in tackling larger problems, expanding the applicability of LCNs to more complex situations. The key contribution is the improvement in scalability and efficiency of abductive reasoning within the LCN framework, making it more suitable for real-world applications.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "GlXUxNI6TN/podcast.wav"}
