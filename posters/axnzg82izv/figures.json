It shows how a realistic neural rendering process combines the original vehicle image with an adversarial texture, generated by a diffusion model conditioned on both adversarial and text-based features. The adversarial features are obtained through backpropagation from a target object detector, ensuring the generated camouflage effectively deceives the detector.  A clipping strategy is used to balance the trade-off between naturalness and attack performance. The framework integrates various components including a realistic neural renderer (combining environmental features), an adversarial texture generation module (using a pre-trained diffusion model and feature combination/clipping), a backpropagation mechanism for adversarial optimization, and finally an object detector to assess the attack performance.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "aXNZG82IzV/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Reordered texture UV map to improve camouflage naturalness.", "description": "This figure shows the UV map of a vehicle texture before and after reordering.
