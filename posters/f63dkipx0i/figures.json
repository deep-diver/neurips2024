Initially, the model shows relatively stable performance.  At time *t*, an environment change causes a sudden drop in accuracy. Following the change, four different adaptation strategies (a1, a2, a3, a4) are applied. Each strategy leads to a different pattern of model recovery. Some strategies result in quick and sustained improvement, while others lead to more gradual or less effective recovery.

The deployed model, *f*, interacts with the healing mechanism, *H*, which consists of four components: monitoring (*H<sub>M</sub>*), diagnosis (*H<sub>D</sub>*), adaptation, and testing (*H<sub>T</sub>*).  The monitoring component detects performance degradation.  If degradation is detected, the diagnosis component identifies the cause.  Based on the diagnosis, the adaptation component selects an action (*a*) from a set of possible actions (*A*) according to an adaptation policy (\u03c0).  Finally, the testing component evaluates the action's effect on the model's performance. The chosen action is then applied to the model (*f*) at the next time step.

The average recovery time shows an exponential relationship with the drift detection threshold, increasing significantly as the threshold increases. The post-intervention accuracy decreases linearly as the drift detection threshold increases. This indicates that lower thresholds lead to faster recovery and higher accuracy, but with greater risks of false positives and unnecessary interventions.
