Four different sets of five classes were selected for erasure, and the performance of five methods (original Stable Diffusion model, ESD, UCE, CA, and the proposed method) was evaluated using two metrics: Erasing Success Rate (ESR) and Preserving Success Rate (PSR).  ESR measures the percentage of generated images where the object from the to-be-erased classes is not detected (in top-1 or top-5 predictions using ResNet-50), reflecting the effectiveness of erasure. PSR measures the percentage of generated images where the objects from the to-be-preserved classes are detected, reflecting the preservation performance.
