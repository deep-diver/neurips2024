Blockwise parallel decoding (BPD) offers a promising solution by predicting multiple tokens simultaneously, but the quality of these predictions needs improvement.  Existing methods often struggle to produce fluent and natural outputs, limiting the practical effectiveness of BPD.\nThis work delves into improving BPD. The researchers analyze token distributions across prediction heads in LLMs and propose novel algorithms to enhance the quality of block drafts. This is done by leveraging lightweight task-independent n-gram and neural language models as rescorers. Experiments show that these refined drafts lead to a substantial increase in accepted tokens (5-25%), resulting in a remarkable **over 3x speedup** in inference time compared to standard autoregressive decoding in open-source LLMs.  The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in accelerating inference, overcoming current limitations of BPD.", "affiliation": "KAIST AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "KT6F5Sw0eg/podcast.wav"}
