It demonstrates the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy and shows PPR consistently outperforms CSGM across different compression sizes. The plot shows that PPR achieves better MSE for various privacy parameters (\u03b5) and compression sizes. For example, for \u03b5 = 1 with 50 bits compression, CSGM has an MSE of 0.1231 while PPR has 0.08173, a significant reduction of 33.61%. Also, for a high compression rate at \u03b5=0.5 (25 bits compression), PPR achieves a 22.33% reduction in MSE.
