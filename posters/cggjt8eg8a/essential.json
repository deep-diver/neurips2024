However, transmitting this data directly poses significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms add noise to the data to protect individual privacy, but this can significantly increase communication costs. Existing methods for compressing DP mechanisms either approximate the original distribution or only work for specific types of noise, limiting their applicability.\nThis paper introduces Poisson Private Representation (PPR), a novel method that **exactly compresses any local DP mechanism** while ensuring local DP.  PPR uses shared randomness and a Poisson process for efficient compression and recovery, achieving a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound.  Crucially, it preserves the statistical properties of the original mechanism, such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity.  The authors demonstrate PPR's effectiveness on distributed mean estimation, showcasing its superior trade-off compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "CgGjT8EG8A/podcast.wav"}
