However, their complexity poses challenges for understanding their decision-making process, hindering their reliable application, especially in high-stakes areas.  Existing methods for explaining model predictions are often unreliable, failing to provide faithful interpretations.  This necessitates the development of reliable and trustworthy methods for explaining Mamba model predictions.\n\nThe paper introduces MambaLRP, a novel algorithm that integrates Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) into the Mamba architecture to produce more reliable explanations. By carefully examining relevance propagation and addressing specific components causing issues, MambaLRP ensures relevance conservation. The effectiveness is demonstrated across a wide range of models and datasets, exceeding the performance of baseline approaches. **MambaLRP enhances transparency and helps in identifying model biases, contributing significantly to the reliable and responsible use of Mamba models.**", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Interpretability"}, "podcast_path": "2n1Ysn1EDl/podcast.wav"}
