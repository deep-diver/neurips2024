This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel architecture called Asynchronous Perception Machine (APM).  Current TTT methods suffer from the information bottleneck problem, often relying on surrogate pre-text tasks, and using architectures like transformers that require parallel processing of all input patches. These limitations significantly increase computational costs and limit scalability.\nAPM overcomes these challenges by processing image patches one at a time in any order, significantly reducing computational costs.  It also learns directly from the test sample's representation without any pre-training tasks or data augmentation, making it highly efficient and adaptable.  The authors demonstrate APM's competitive performance against existing TTT approaches, its scalability, and provide the first empirical evidence supporting the GLOM theory.
