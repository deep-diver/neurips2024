In online linear optimization, it is known that if the average gradient of loss functions exceeds a certain threshold, the curvature of feasible sets can be exploited by the follow-the-leader (FTL) algorithm to achieve a logarithmic regret. This study reveals that algorithms adaptive to the curvature of loss functions can also leverage the curvature of feasible sets. In particular, we first prove that if an optimal decision is on the boundary of a feasible set and the gradient of an underlying loss function is non-zero, then the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\\rho\\ln T)$ in stochastic environments. Here, $\\rho>0$ is the radius of the smallest sphere that includes the optimal decision and encloses the feasible set. Our approach, unlike existing ones, can work directly with convex loss functions, exploiting the curvature of loss functions simultaneously, and can achieve the logarithmic regret only with a local property of feasible sets.

Our approach is based on the results of universal online learning, the motivation of which is to be adaptive to parameters of loss curvature without knowing them. This line of investigation was initiated by van Erven and Koolen [21], van Erven et al. [22], who establish an algorithm, MetaGrad, that achieves an $\\begin{array}{r}{O(\\frac{d}{\\beta}\\ln T)}\\end{array}$ regret bound if loss functions are $\\beta$ -exp-concave and an $O({\\sqrt{T\\ln\\ln T}})$ bound otherwise, without knowing the curvature of loss functions. The underlying idea is to run several experts in parallel with different curvature parameters, and then another expert algorithm integrates their results to choose decisions. This algorithm was later extended to achieve an $O(\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\ln T)$ regret bound when the loss functions are $\\alpha$ -strongly convex [24]. Roughly speaking, this was made possible by considering MetaGrad with additional experts of OGD with a learning rate of $\\Theta(1/t)$ . They provided a bound of $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\langle\\nabla f_{t}(x_{t}),x_{t}-x_{\\star}\\rangle=O(G\\sqrt{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\lVert x_{t}-x_{\\star}\\rVert_{2}^{2}\\ln T}+G D\\ln T)}\\end{array}$ for $D=\\operatorname*{max}_{x,y\\in K}\\|x-y\\|_{2}$ .
